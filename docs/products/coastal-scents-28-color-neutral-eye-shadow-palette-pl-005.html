            <li>Stila &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34; palette is a great matte palette option while this is still handy for neutral shades.</li>

            <li>this is a good neutral starter palette for those who are just getting into makeup.</li>
            <li>Great warm neutrals.</li>
            <li>They do the job and it was a good price</li>

            <li>When I got it, the palette was beautifully and safely wrapped.</li>
            <li>Go Palette was cheap but excellent quality, so I assumed all of their eye shadows would have nice pigmentation but</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>Cute colors, great price, kinda powdery but their blendable</li>
            <li>As an artist I have learned that many cosmetic lines offer great products.</li>
            <li>The color payoff isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.</li>
            <li>I have used all the eye shadow bases and none works better than this...which contributes to the great color I get from my Costal Scents 28 neutral color pallette.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of shadows and the pigment is great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on with nice color, doesn&#x27;t fade and is just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This is a nice selection of colors for a good price.</li>
            <li>If you know anything about make up.. you will notice right off the bat that this is not the best quality.</li>
            <li>If you love make You´ll love this pallette!!</li>
            <li>These colors are great neutrals, more mattes than shimmery which is nice</li>

            <li>Absolutely loved this product colors are beautiful and natural and I sure don&#x27;t regret buying it.!!</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I do like Coastal Scents palettes for what they are cheap and pigmented- great color variety, etc...  </li>
            <li>This palette is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I never thought how amazing the colors would come out.</li>
            <li>Amazing colors</li>
            <li>but besides that it is an amazing palette</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>(That is amazing for a palette.</li>
            <li>They are smooth and creamy and have great color payoff.  </li>
            <li>The colors are off a bit from the picture but the colors are nice and pigmented.</li>
            <li>This is good for the price but for a better neutral option- go for the 88 Warm-</li>
            <li>When taking the palette out of its own box that said Coastal Scents 28 Color Eyeshadow Palette, Neutral on it</li>
            <li>This is a nice neutral palette.</li>
            <li>Really nice palette with nutral colors</li>
            <li>I just received this palette and I am loving it.  </li>
            <li>im loving it</li>
            <li>Nice sized palette.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely</li>
            <li>most of the colors are really good</li>
            <li>Some colors are stronger than others, but the options are awesome &amp; they show up really well.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of colors and comes in a nice package as well</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>Pallet is nice.</li>
            <li>Colors show up nicely</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t think the pigmentation is anything to rave about.</li>
            <li>and I honestly can compare it to MAC makeup at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Its a good eye shadow pallete color should be more pigmented but there not...</li>
            <li>Quality is nice.</li>
            <li>really nice</li>
            <li>and they wear nicely all day.</li>
            <li>NICE NEUTRAL COLORS</li>
            <li>ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND WAS NICELY PACKAGED.</li>
            <li>The neutral colors are nice</li>
            <li>The shadows stay on nicely</li>
            <li>warm brown with flecks of rose.</li>
            <li>in all I got this pallette because of the warm browns and neutral tones.</li>
            <li>But the darker colors are nice and pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors are super pigmented and they are all just soooooooo beautiful.</li>
            <li>that is a great neutral pigmented palette which blends easily and has a better color variety.</li>
            <li>Being a cosmetologist, I look for exceptional quality and I am telling you this stuff is like the brands you pay for at the cosmetic counters, and really goes on like MAC!!!!  </li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous and vibrant, and blend beautifully.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s just getting into makeup and she loved it.shes very happy overall</li>
            <li>came quick i love the colors, they blend well and are easy to use i will def get this palette again even recomend it :D</li>
            <li>I would say these are better quality than most drugstore brands but not as good as mac.</li>

            <li>The colors on my lid turn out very light even with more than one application.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this palette.  </li>
            <li>I think I may need to get a better primer....</li>
            <li>I think most brands are.    </li>
            <li>But for the most part neutrals.</li>
            <li>I love this palette because it gives you options &amp; you can even smoke it up.</li>
            <li>The most I use this pallet for at this point is the brown for brows, and the lighter colors for highlighting the brow.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation could have been better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this pallet, I have a Carmel like complexion and these colors compliments my face.</li>
            <li>love these shadows...</li>
            <li>they are really pigmented and look great</li>
            <li>I just wish it had more darker shades.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li>Take the time to find them, and start with this one!! :-)</li>
            <li>in my opinion sleek palette are waaaaaay better than this one.</li>
            <li>I love all the choices in this palette.</li>
            <li>My drug store eye shadow purchases were of better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pallet is okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with dollar store pallets...</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>I love coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>my YouTube videos grate pigmentation I love it</li>
            <li>You are better off with a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>These eyeshadows are okay.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with name brands at retail stores like Loreal, Neutrogena, Cover Girl, or Mabelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>and I love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>And most of the shades just don&#x27;t have a lot of pigment in them, though some are better than others.  </li>
            <li>This palette could use some more pigmentation...</li>
            <li>This palette has great colors, but they don&#x27;t really show up well on skin.</li>
            <li>it is more better to add some money and buy more qualitative eyeshadows...</li>
            <li>My drugstore cheapo eye shadows have served me much better.</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>downfall for me is theirs to many colors with glitter or what ever that sparkle</li>
            <li>but I was looking more for matte shades.</li>
            <li>Maybe a bit of thought into a better design would help.</li>
            <li>Love love this palette.</li>
            <li>I love these shadows.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>However, I found that the Coastal Scents was more pigmented.</li>
            <li>I love the Coastal Scents 28 Color Eye shadow palette because the colors go well with my complexion.</li>
            <li>I recieved this palette and there are a couple of things I love about it...</li>
            <li>Love the colors and mix of matte/sparkle.</li>
            <li>I just love these colors!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>I love this pallette because I NEVER wear color eye shadow</li>
            <li>I love this pallet and will buy more.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, with the help of a primer, the colors will have better staying power.  </li>
            <li>The colors are interesting, but there are a number of them that are frost/ shiny, which I do not use; hoped there would not be too many frost/shiny,</li>
            <li>There are too many shades that are close in color</li>
            <li>I am a forever customer! :)</li>
            <li>Love..</li>
            <li>Its an okay purchase...maybe would buy something else</li>
            <li>and  you i&#x27;ve never bought palette before, than you can be sure you will like this one..</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>But mostly matte which I use the most.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more warmer shades..</li>
            <li>I have a coastal scents pallette and I love it</li>

            <li>I am so pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors but the pigmentation and color pay off is somewhat lacking.</li>
            <li>Better than anything else you&#x27;d find anywhere close to the price.</li>
            <li>i love the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li>:)) I bought it for a gift though :)</li>
            <li>I have more reviews.</li>
            <li>These are my Favorite neutral eyeshadow pallete better than any</li>
            <li>The case itself seemed a bit more</li>
            <li>but wish they had some more gold undertones.</li>
            <li>Love all of the neutral colors</li>
            <li>I love neutral eye shadow</li>
            <li>Because I already own this palette, I can say it is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another now, just in case the company stops making this particular palette.</li>
            <li>Colors look true to the picture and come out nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use this palette!</li>
            <li>Never disappointed with This product!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Great pigmentation a vsriety of colors to play with and b creative do a suttle smokey eye or a natural barley</li>
            <li>Came quickly which was nice.</li>
            <li>Love love this palette awesome colors last a long time beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>It would be really great if the Co.  would put the colors on the back of the packaging and label them with names, kind of like how you get a box of chocolate</li>
            <li>On my computer monitor, many of the colors appeared pinkish, but I&#x27;m happy to say that most of the colors are more neutral to yellow, which suits my coloring much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s part of the daily makeup routine especially good for a neutral summer make up look glowly and nice for an effortless pretty breezy face</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars to find the best for your buck-</li>
            <li>For better cheap makeup try nyx....</li>
            <li>they shadows are very pigmented good quality.</li>
            <li>I loved this palette so much I purchased one for my mom and sister at Christmas.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and the colors show up very well on me.  </li>
            <li>I was initially very excited to receive this palette as I really enjoy matte neutrals.</li>
            <li>And so far, I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>I actually used this palette for a wedding and the bride turned out gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I have been a true Fan!</li>
            <li>Eyeshadows are a bit powdery, other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>Obviously you cannot expect a great quality for that price, so I&#x27;m OK with it.</li>
            <li>You could easily end up with muddy eye shadows.</li>
            <li>For those who say this is good for beginners, it is in some respects as the colors aren&#x27;t too vibrant.</li>
            <li>The color isnt strong to show  </li>
            <li>Incredibly strong glue and flimsy pans.</li>
            <li>The colors are fairly pigmented but if you prefer high intensity colors</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those who are looking for matte neutral colors with good pigments.</li>
            <li>Not really useing it but great quality just dont really know how to do my make up great service</li>
            <li>the product has a strong smell &amp; it was not the brand offered, aside from that, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Very greats pallete loved the shades in it very neutral which is trendy and affordable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the older offerings by coastal scents but is actually my favorite of all of their palettes that I own.</li>
            <li>Revlon&#x27;s Color-Stay products are awesome in this regard and are half the price on Amazon as they are in the drug stores.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love coastal scents products, &amp; I love the fact that they are very affordable!</li>
            <li>But other then that, love every color, and I loved all of pigments!</li>
            <li>Coastal scents is my latest super discovery.</li>
            <li>The colors are not too strong not too light,</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite pallet !</li>
            <li>They blend easily, are nicely pigmented, and are quite smooth in their application, however, the colors don&#x27;t have as much staying power as I would like.  </li>
            <li>ok first of all i am in LOVEEEEE!  </li>
            <li>These colors are true and smooth, blend exceptionally well and are very pigmented</li>
            <li>Amazing colors and go on like a gem, very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost too light and neutral.</li>
            <li>But you should know how to blend because you will be doing a lot of it with this palette as some colors aren&#x27;t as smooth as I thought.</li>
            <li>I was not planning on buying it, but I figured I get the free shipping with the 88 Colors Palette I also ordered from Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>(even if you fall asleep with them on - still look great the next day)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect for an everyday use as well</li>
            <li>Perfect shades for everyday.</li>
            <li>I was very excited at how little fallout I experienced and I love the staying power.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the light highlight colors are not as pigmented as the darker shades.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous for crease/brow bone colors-</li>
            <li>the mattes are absolutely perfect for an everyday look.</li>
            <li>The pigment of the colors are great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It light shades...</li>
            <li>Confirmed as counterfeit by Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>Such a great selection of colors.</li>
            <li>They blend well and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>There are so many colors that I find useful.  </li>
            <li>i recommend it for all make up lovers who want a cheap make up.</li>
            <li>Awesome for everyday looks.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a fast turnaround time, received item in excellent time.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and right on the mark :)</li>
            <li>This has a very nice range of color and can be mixed and blended with all skin tones/eye colors.  </li>
            <li>While they aren&#x27;t top of the line either, their colors are more vibrant.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when the package got here was that it was not packed very secure.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal palette is super pigment and easy apply.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is okay, and the colors look so pretty on my skin</li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy this palette</li>
            <li>Love, colors are very well pigmented and blend great.. would totally recommend...</li>
            <li>Excited to try the colors out.</li>
            <li>This palette is more for who doesnt like makeup more into natural makeup look.</li>
            <li>I like a clean matte look.</li>
            <li>I love a neutral face for my everyday look, this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>every women that love using eyeshadow should own this palette or even something similar.</li>
            <li>Comes on smoothly and blends great with other colors.</li>
            <li>I use color on special events, etc.</li>
            <li>Specially for beginners.</li>
            <li>Very good everyday pallet.</li>
            <li>great colors for everyday use and enough colors for a great night look.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product, it has more fallout than MAC but nothing excessive.</li>
            <li>Its true</li>
            <li>I am a true customer now...</li>
            <li>it might be good for someone starting out in makeup.</li>
            <li>and I got a full refund.</li>
            <li>And for not quite the full purchase amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would make one that&#x27;s all cool colors, which is what I need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good neutral palette for daily use.</li>
            <li>Also, you do not get so much that you will never use it and love the color combinations they offer.  </li>
            <li>These are good for simple looks, weddings, and fall colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that most eyeshadows have way too much shimmer in them for me or they&#x27;re too chaulky.  </li>
            <li>Glides on , lovely nude pallet it was suggested  that as I get older I should use matte eyeshadows with out the glittery shiny as it doesn&#x27;t look as nice on my 58 yr old eyes.</li>
            <li>it is like M-A-C quality and super affordable.</li>
            <li>When you apply the shadow it goes on great, and packs very well when properly priming your lid.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Not only the colors are juicy and potent, but so many colors for this price...</li>
            <li>&amp; I got my package quickly to</li>
            <li>and it got here quick.</li>
            <li>I most likely won&#x27;t order this brand again and go with a brand that has more opaque colors.</li>
            <li>Either way, this is a super affordable way to play with eyeshadow looks.</li>
            <li>luckily none of the shadows were shattered.&lt;br /&gt;eyeshadows</li>
            <li>I got mine really quick</li>
            <li>Super pigmented.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my package; i got it right on the date estimated.</li>
            <li>You would be better off investing in two or three high quality shadows because in this case, you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Love them and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The black is great and the color stays true through out the night.</li>
            <li>I love this colours, The quality is normal, and colours not very bright, with other bright palette you can make perfect make up</li>
            <li>I live hundreds of miles and doubted my sister arrives in good condition but was very surprised by the care, timeliness and quality.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this 28 Neutral palette is worth the price, it came very quickly and even better it was packaged carefully so not one shadow was disturbed</li>
            <li>serves well as a great black and the browns can be used to bronze or contoure</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the colors!!</li>
            <li>Product as described and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>The only one that I think is better is the Chanel line, but then again, it is Chanel!  </li>
            <li>If you want more flexibility with how you organize your colors, you are better off getting one of the palette sets that comes in the magnetic palette and/or purchasing the Hot Pots individually.</li>
            <li>Honestly best eye shadows could easily replace expensive brands like Mac any day for the price</li>
            <li>this neutral palette was a little chalky and not so great.</li>
            <li>Its great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for everyday looks.</li>
            <li>It a bright pink</li>
            <li>The bright pink color will stain your lids.</li>
            <li>It is great for everyday wear and has allowed me to play around with colors</li>
            <li>They come out very chalky and cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid of color at all</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$$</li>
            <li>The quality of the eyeshadows seem a lot better directly ordered from coastal scents.</li>
            <li>I probably would have returned it, but it was worth checking out.</li>
            <li>Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li>Over all I use it often and feel it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>The palette is certainly useful</li>
            <li>These colors are nice, natural and good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I must say though, that these colors will only look nice &amp; noticible if you know how to blend and mix colors.</li>
            <li>Worth the Money</li>
            <li>Such good quality and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>These far exceed many drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll give a more complete review.</li>
            <li>I was nervous that the shadows might arrive all broken up, but it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and glamorous nice palette for natural to smoky look!</li>
            <li>These are more toward a burgundy-ish hues on one scheme and the other scheme is more of a orange-y tan rather than a neutral scheme as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully there is a very nice off-white with a hint of minty green to it that helps to neutralize those colors.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, it&#x27;s a good buy, however, I wouldn&#x27;t compare this product to the higher end makeup you get at a makeup counter, but it&#x27;s the same or better compared to what you get at a local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>im about to try them right now lolz.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>The pigment of the shadows is as other reviewers testify, very substantial, not like most drug store pallettes that are mostly filler rather than true pigment.</li>
            <li>There are also not any real good browns in any sense in the lot, so I have to use other shadows for ranging through the light, med, dark brownish tones I need as a staple for my colors.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to pay more and purchase naked or Lorac pallets than this cheap Chinese made product.</li>
            <li>Its still a great neutral palette... Usually comes with a logo in front but these for some reason don&#x27;t have it...</li>
            <li>I own other palettes from coastal scents and they are of a far better quality than the trash I was sent.</li>
            <li>They all go together so well that you can just sweep a pale color over your lid, a medium color in the crease, and use a mixing medium on a liner brush on the upper lash line with one of the darker colors for a perfect daytime smokey eye.</li>
            <li>I love this , smells nice and last long. ..</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this pallets if you want create that flawless everyday eye look ;)</li>
            <li>I unraveled the bubble wrap and noticed the palette&#x27;s outer box was very very dusted with eye shadow.</li>
            <li>The other great thing about this set is that it&#x27;s mostly soft matte colors.</li>
            <li>This palette is very good especially for beginners, but also for people who do not like applying a lot of color and tend to keep it natural on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second coastal scents purchase (the other was contour kit) and am super happy with both.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>would and the moment i open the palette i felt in love with it</li>
            <li>First time I used it today.</li>
            <li>I have several Coastal Scents products and I love all of them.    </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t look how they really are!.    </li>
            <li>This pallette is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Be AWARE .....</li>
            <li>, even it is better, the size of a circle of a paletka corresponds to a photo when you see such qualitative cosmetics</li>
            <li>I got this as a present for my mom for christmas since she always wears more neutral eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>and in the future..Would HIGHLY suggest!!</li>
            <li>I really like this palette!</li>
            <li>This is my first pallatte, so I like it for what I&#x27;m trying to get done.</li>
            <li>This is the first item ever from Amazon that I have been dissatisfied with after years of shopping.</li>
            <li>I had hoped they would be more pigmented than they actually are.  </li>
            <li>First off, please DO NOT buy the knockoffs.</li>
            <li>the ones I use most often are the colors in the last two rows.</li>
            <li>Also, I dampen my eyeshadow brush with some NYX setting spray first to help minimize fallout.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty pigmented, although some of them run together without distinction.</li>
            <li>use it every day and have no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first palette(second one, because first is in the trash now.. bad-quality) and if you try to find somethin</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite neutral palettes because it comes with a variety of matte and shimmer colors.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>All the colors are not so pigmented like the first row is not</li>
            <li>She fell in love instantly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it because it&#x27;s really good for everyday use and formal looks.</li>
            <li>The only thing I kind of dislike is the bit of shimmery that it has, But other than that I love this palette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had the original revealed pallets and it was getting old (lasted a year)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this product for highlighting, but because it is the MOST excellent product for eye shadow base...</li>
            <li>some more pigmented than others.&lt;br /&gt;easily capable of creating a variety of different neutral looks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The palette has AMAZING neutrals and only a few are sparkly, most are matte, which I ADORE.</li>
            <li>The colors are great, especially the dark sparkly purple color, but the two of the colors popped out when I opened it for the first time, so the glue didn&#x27;t hold so well.  </li>
            <li>My first real palette and I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely \\&quot;loved\\&quot; this palette when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>Colors are perfect for everyday use and for natural looks a must buy if you are just starting to use make up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad when I want to go for a natural look..</li>
            <li>It was an easy return and was actually a warehouse problem</li>
            <li>But while I truly love the colors in this palette they are dry</li>
            <li>Good pigmentation and long lasting finish.</li>
            <li>it creates great smoky eyes and toned down looks for work or even a simple run to the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I have bought everything from large furniture items to exercise equipment and everything in between from Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional make up, and for the price i&#x27;ve spend in this, let me say that i don&#x27;t think it deserves, first of all it has only 28 colors, and they&#x27;re NOT pigmented at all, and i tried this with many primers, and also foundation..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a medium brown skin black female and it looks great on me.</li>
            <li>This is hard to say when you get a palette with this many, but i enjoy this one.</li>
            <li>Received my palette today and really like it.</li>
            <li>I had been looking at all the different palettes available trying to decide which one to purchase.</li>
            <li>but I got this because I had heard so much about the \\&quot;Mac Dupes\\&quot; in it and also</li>
            <li>Really all the neutrals a girl can ever wish for.  </li>
            <li>I really like this pallete.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pigmented.</li>
            <li>but they are very blendable as well.</li>
            <li>You will get so much use out of it.</li>
            <li>I really love that, but the quality of the product is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented and has some MAC dupes.</li>
            <li>I really like all the colors.</li>
            <li>I feel like for the price, I can&#x27;t really complain though.</li>
            <li>A lot of the colors almost seem to have a reddish undertone on the skin which I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li>Colors look fabulous in the case, but it has no richness or depth to it at all and colors faded or rubbed off and wouldn&#x27;t last from morning to the afternoon.  </li>
            <li>Was better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the fact that the palette I received had no labels or anything.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>some of them are really chalky and don&#x27;t have any pigment.</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t recommend this product...</li>
            <li>The colors are very blendable and are matte.</li>
            <li>This palette isn&#x27;t very pigmented and the lighter colors are very chalky.</li>
            <li>I have never had MAC products because I refuse to spend that much on makeup.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented</li>
            <li>Packed very well, in bubble wrap, nothing broke.</li>
            <li>colors are very pigmented and have lots of staying power even with my greasy lids.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really understand how it happened</li>
            <li>If you want the real costal scents, go buy from their website.  </li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i didn&#x27;t try them already but they seem really good!!!&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this pallet!</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m very dissapointed..</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I read so much about this on you tube.</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>No broken pieces or anything</li>
            <li>I think I was expecting too much.</li>
            <li>They are also very chalky.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I opened up the palette to find it absolutely destroyed</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the colours in the picture do not match the eye shadows in real life.</li>
            <li>The quality of these shadows are okay, could be much better, but I&#x27;ve seen worse.</li>
            <li>Second the colors blend nice and third the colors can work on all skin tones.</li>
            <li>Dead honest words...</li>
            <li>The colors are great, some color are like a chalk, you need much produt to work, and during  transportation one of color was broken</li>
            <li>The colors are very light so primer or a base is the best way to go when using even if your skin tone is dark or light.</li>
            <li>first I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I will add this eyeshadow palette to my other eyeshadows and customize my finished look as my wardrobe and seasons change OK.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and this palette has more usable colors than any other palette I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I love this, and plan on getting a few more, as long as they are new, and untouched.  </li>
            <li>My makeup routine is not complete without some FABULOUS makeup on my eye-lids.</li>
            <li>They are true to color, and they last all day.</li>
            <li>, I wanted something more neutral for school functions with the kids and where I need a toned down look.</li>
            <li>considering that the cost for shipping to where I live is just way too much.</li>
            <li>Most of them are pigmented, but the black at the corner of the palette doesn&#x27;t come out how it looks in the pan.</li>
            <li>As with most palettes you won&#x27;t use all the colors - I&#x27;ve used about half, though at $20 I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>I broke more than half of the colors trying to get them out.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this particular makeup palette being that I am a beginner when it comes to makeup.</li>
            <li>The only con is that they are super pigmented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased one item from them and after that I&#x27;ve found their main site where they run specials quite often.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are also great for an eye shadow base as well.</li>
            <li>This is my main eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>I use it occasionally  but its good for everyday.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say they are particularly vibrant but</li>
            <li>decent, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>It gives you the color you are looking for right away without applying several times and not as much residue gets on to your cheeks</li>
            <li>I recommend this palette highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these shadows.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend it</li>
            <li>Do not irritate the eyes at all and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They can definitely be worked with to get started with makeup and get experimental and familiar with color placement for beginners.</li>
            <li>* :)...smell a little</li>
            <li>The pigment could be a little better</li>
            <li>These are a little creamier and blend better.</li>
            <li>After reading such wonderful reviews and lusting over this palette via Internet.... I can honestly say that I am very disappointed in this palette.</li>
            <li>so you do experience some fall out &amp; some colors are similar to each other &amp; I would of liked a few more highlighting colors that are a little lighter as most</li>
            <li>Has matte and shimmer shadows, I use the matte baby pink as a blush and matte light bronze as my contour.</li>
            <li>Great for teens/tweens to play with, but I am not impressed at all by these shadows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a very big fan of bright colours when it comes to make-up, so I usually stick with neutral shades.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth paying the extra 4 bucks from coastal scents.</li>
            <li>I normally buy Clinique or Loreal, MAC, Sephora, but wanted to compare this for myself.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the palette is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It has everything to give you a everyday look and more, this is the 6th pallet I have bought from them</li>
            <li>I am soo loving these shadow colors and they are seriously like my favorite eyeshadows I own now, totally been using them EVERYDAY!!!!  </li>
            <li>so I may order it in the future if needed but for now I will be ordering the other palette with the bright colors pictured above!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main complaint, but I do see a bright future with this palette</li>
            <li>I am pretty creative artistically and oftentimes I volunteer to do wedding/party makeovers for little extra cash tips.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow is really pretty and nicely sized but the thing is really hard to open.</li>
            <li>Lovely colors with pigmentation dont care if its a fake it still works perfectly fine for me</li>
            <li>I always held out from buying this because it&#x27;s so cheap compared to other brands, but now I regret not getting this sooner.</li>
            <li>picture does not really show the colors as they truly are but still a good little palette for the money.</li>
            <li>The formula for these are is different from the different 88 color ones that are available.</li>
            <li>I use the purple on my lid and the light brown next to it on my upper lid.</li>
            <li>Great palette for everyday natural looks, and Also for more dramatic evening looks!  </li>
            <li>Its nothing special and while it is a decent price, I would suggest saving your money and investing in the Naked palette from Urban Decay or even a Nyx palette.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that middle bottom circle got damaged pretty quickly from opening the palette (darn, it was one of my favorite colors too)</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow set hasn&#x27;t given my eyes any problem at all, and I&#x27;m very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Was very surprised with the pigment and staying power.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by a few colors: the peach one has flecks of gold, the white is very opalescent and reflects different colors, the black has very fine pinky-brown flecks in it, and the one in the upper right corner is my new favorite eyeshadow...</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and I&#x27;ll be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li>only REAL problem with this 28 Neutral Palette is that these \\&quot;colors are not labeled\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>at all; and some contain cheap glitter that falls down your face when applied.</li>
            <li>but if you just re-apply it a few times its an easy fix.</li>
            <li>colors are hard to come and blend there are many other great products worth spending money on than this silly pallet I ordered 4 of this pallet and</li>
            <li>I love these eyeshadows because they are so natural and can be used almost everyday to give a subtle but sexy look.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I was a little skeptical of this purchase, but WOW, I absolutely love this make-up!</li>
            <li>My God, coastal scents isn&#x27;t even a high end brand, I never expected to be conned.</li>
            <li>The colors are very flattering to every skin tone and the shadows are long wearing and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>This 28 neutral palette completely exceeds any hopes that I had for it...</li>
            <li>For the price of 1 Mac eyeshadow you get a whole 28 same size as Mac eyeshadows!!!</li>
            <li>As far as Mac Dupes-</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I use an eyeshadow primer and the colors,which are very pigmented in my opinion, last all day.</li>
            <li>Comparable to La colors, not too powdery so far.</li>
            <li>This is by no means a professional quality product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this palette, I would recommend going directly to the coastal scents website.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised the eyeshadows in the pallet didn&#x27;t break....</li>
            <li>At age 51 I didn&#x27;t think I would really like these colors so much, especially since they are not all 100% matte.</li>
            <li>My eyes are green and so the purple looks fabulous with them.</li>
            <li>I will be returning to Amazon, and reordering directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li>If you want something that actually blends very well.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Ben Nye eyeshadows are VERY pigmented, but that is a theatrical line designed for stage and film.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>Maybe before they actually sent the real one from here</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and last all day with a primer.</li>
            <li>The colours are matte and natural looking</li>
            <li>Works really well, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and skin</li>
            <li>Most colors are creamy, only a few are chalky.</li>
            <li>Go splurge on a good expensive eyeshadow palette elsewhere.</li>
            <li>, especially the deep purple and browns on the far right vertical row.</li>
            <li>use it everyday for nice toned down natural looks.</li>
            <li>And they do last a fairly decent time on the lids.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product, however a few colors were broken when I received it.</li>
            <li>so the eye shadow sticks better because it tends to fake somewhat fast.  </li>
            <li>the light colors in the left side were actually a heavy grry color..</li>
            <li>A lot of the reviews that I watched on Youtube were 4 years old and that is why  it looks different than some of the palettes on there.  </li>
            <li>I am a woman of color and a professional makeup artist, and not only are these eyeshadows well pigmented</li>
            <li>&#x27;n Wild drugstore shadows are about the same quality as these.</li>
            <li>The colors stay on all day and barely crease.</li>
            <li>You can barely see it...or have to keep building it up.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I even contacted Costal Scents because in some of the YouTube videos the palette had a different color in the palette, like out of nowhere mine had a hot pink color in it ,  </li>
            <li>I would tell anyone to get this palette before the 88 palette just because the colors on the 88 are very vibrant, and if you are not used to doing bright colors on a daily basis you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li>and they confirmed it was suppose to be in there, so in the second row third shadow its a hot pink one not a light pink like the picture has ..</li>
            <li>Most of the time I end up with odd shades of blue and green that will never be used.</li>
            <li>The pan sizes are a little bit small, but the quality is compared to huge high end makeup brands.</li>
            <li>the color barely shows up and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>, I lost mines in my room and missing it so much!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this palette to those who have a makeup collection with higher quality makeup because it will be a waste and wouldn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are much lighter on the skin and take a long time to build up their color, also they are very dry.</li>
            <li>I would say the new Wet</li>
            <li>That was a huge disappointment but the eyeshadows worked pretty well</li>
            <li>The smoky black wouldn&#x27;t even stay on my eyes no matter how much I put on.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not very pigmented but that was why I bought it, for very natural looking makeup.</li>
            <li>These shades have shimmer and are not flat like I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>,colors are vibrant and it stays on the brush instead of falling down your face</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Stila &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34; palette is a great matte palette option while this is still handy for neutral shades.</li>

            <li> When I got it, the palette was beautifully and safely wrapped.</li>
            <li> Go Palette was cheap but excellent quality, so I assumed all of their eye shadows would have nice pigmentation but</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> Cute colors, great price, kinda powdery but their blendable</li>
            <li> As an artist I have learned that many cosmetic lines offer great products.</li>
            <li> The color payoff isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.</li>
            <li> I have used all the eye shadow bases and none works better than this...which contributes to the great color I get from my Costal Scents 28 neutral color pallette.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of shadows and the pigment is great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on with nice color, doesn&#x27;t fade and is just gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This is a nice selection of colors for a good price.</li>
            <li> If you know anything about make up.. you will notice right off the bat that this is not the best quality.</li>
            <li> If you love make You´ll love this pallette!!</li>
            <li> These colors are great neutrals, more mattes than shimmery which is nice</li>

            <li> Absolutely loved this product colors are beautiful and natural and I sure don&#x27;t regret buying it.!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I do like Coastal Scents palettes for what they are cheap and pigmented- great color variety, etc...  </li>
            <li> This palette is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I never thought how amazing the colors would come out.</li>
            <li> Amazing colors</li>
            <li> but besides that it is an amazing palette</li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> (That is amazing for a palette.</li>
            <li> They are smooth and creamy and have great color payoff.  </li>
            <li> The colors are off a bit from the picture but the colors are nice and pigmented.</li>
            <li> This is good for the price but for a better neutral option- go for the 88 Warm-</li>
            <li> When taking the palette out of its own box that said Coastal Scents 28 Color Eyeshadow Palette, Neutral on it</li>
            <li> This is a nice neutral palette.</li>
            <li> Really nice palette with nutral colors</li>
            <li> I just received this palette and I am loving it.  </li>
            <li> im loving it</li>
            <li> Nice sized palette.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely</li>
            <li> most of the colors are really good</li>
            <li> Some colors are stronger than others, but the options are awesome &amp; they show up really well.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of colors and comes in a nice package as well</li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> Pallet is nice.</li>
            <li> Colors show up nicely</li>
            <li> and I honestly don&#x27;t think the pigmentation is anything to rave about.</li>
            <li> and I honestly can compare it to MAC makeup at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Its a good eye shadow pallete color should be more pigmented but there not...</li>
            <li> Quality is nice.</li>
            <li> really nice</li>
            <li> and they wear nicely all day.</li>
            <li> NICE NEUTRAL COLORS</li>
            <li> ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND WAS NICELY PACKAGED.</li>
            <li> The neutral colors are nice</li>
            <li> The shadows stay on nicely</li>
            <li> warm brown with flecks of rose.</li>
            <li> in all I got this pallette because of the warm browns and neutral tones.</li>
            <li> But the darker colors are nice and pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors are super pigmented and they are all just soooooooo beautiful.</li>
            <li> that is a great neutral pigmented palette which blends easily and has a better color variety.</li>
            <li> Being a cosmetologist, I look for exceptional quality and I am telling you this stuff is like the brands you pay for at the cosmetic counters, and really goes on like MAC!!!!  </li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous and vibrant, and blend beautifully.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s just getting into makeup and she loved it.shes very happy overall</li>

            <li> love.. love!</li>
            <li> And it came two days early, which was great!</li>
            <li> The colors that I&#x27;ve tried thus far have been excellent.  </li>

            <li> Love coastal scents their pigments are amazing eyeshadow</li>
            <li> This is the best matte, neutral, natural palette I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> i use it with eye primer , the color is pigment,and  awesome ,matt and natural</li>
            <li> To not ever safe your money on your own pallets</li>
            <li> love love love!</li>
            <li> Good pigment good price and fast shipping from Amazon can&#x27;t complain at all</li>
            <li> Recieved my palette and honestly I was looking for a palette with light warm colors.</li>
            <li> exactly as it looks, greatly packaged</li>
            <li> i really love all the colors and they are really pigmented and look really good on the eye!</li>
            <li> I have a very light skin tone and some blend in well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Comes off very light, or grayish.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in 2 days with prime shipping, and seemed to be packaged very securely, seemed being the keyword.</li>
            <li> Once it was available again, I went ahead and re-ordered and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> The colors on my lid turn out very light even with more than one application.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this palette.  </li>
            <li> I think I may need to get a better primer....</li>
            <li> I think most brands are.    </li>
            <li> But for the most part neutrals.</li>
            <li> I love this palette because it gives you options &amp; you can even smoke it up.</li>
            <li> The most I use this pallet for at this point is the brown for brows, and the lighter colors for highlighting the brow.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation could have been better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet, I have a Carmel like complexion and these colors compliments my face.</li>
            <li> love these shadows...</li>
            <li> they are really pigmented and look great</li>
            <li> I just wish it had more darker shades.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li> Take the time to find them, and start with this one!! :-)</li>
            <li> in my opinion sleek palette are waaaaaay better than this one.</li>
            <li> I love all the choices in this palette.</li>
            <li> My drug store eye shadow purchases were of better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This pallet is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with dollar store pallets...</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> I love coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> my YouTube videos grate pigmentation I love it</li>
            <li> You are better off with a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are okay.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off with name brands at retail stores like Loreal, Neutrogena, Cover Girl, or Mabelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> and I love the colors.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> And most of the shades just don&#x27;t have a lot of pigment in them, though some are better than others.  </li>
            <li> This palette could use some more pigmentation...</li>
            <li> This palette has great colors, but they don&#x27;t really show up well on skin.</li>
            <li> it is more better to add some money and buy more qualitative eyeshadows...</li>
            <li> My drugstore cheapo eye shadows have served me much better.</li>
            <li> love this</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> downfall for me is theirs to many colors with glitter or what ever that sparkle</li>
            <li> but I was looking more for matte shades.</li>
            <li> Maybe a bit of thought into a better design would help.</li>
            <li> Love love this palette.</li>
            <li> I love these shadows.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> However, I found that the Coastal Scents was more pigmented.</li>
            <li> I love the Coastal Scents 28 Color Eye shadow palette because the colors go well with my complexion.</li>
            <li> I recieved this palette and there are a couple of things I love about it...</li>
            <li> Love the colors and mix of matte/sparkle.</li>
            <li> I just love these colors!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> I love this pallette because I NEVER wear color eye shadow</li>
            <li> I love this pallet and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, with the help of a primer, the colors will have better staying power.  </li>
            <li> The colors are interesting, but there are a number of them that are frost/ shiny, which I do not use; hoped there would not be too many frost/shiny,</li>
            <li> There are too many shades that are close in color</li>
            <li> I am a forever customer! :)</li>
            <li> Love..</li>
            <li> Its an okay purchase...maybe would buy something else</li>

            <li> I am so pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors but the pigmentation and color pay off is somewhat lacking.</li>
            <li> Better than anything else you&#x27;d find anywhere close to the price.</li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li> :)) I bought it for a gift though :)</li>
            <li> I have more reviews.</li>
            <li> These are my Favorite neutral eyeshadow pallete better than any</li>
            <li> The case itself seemed a bit more</li>
            <li> but wish they had some more gold undertones.</li>
            <li> Love all of the neutral colors</li>
            <li> I love neutral eye shadow</li>
            <li> Because I already own this palette, I can say it is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another now, just in case the company stops making this particular palette.</li>
            <li> Colors look true to the picture and come out nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use this palette!</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with This product!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation a vsriety of colors to play with and b creative do a suttle smokey eye or a natural barley</li>
            <li> Came quickly which was nice.</li>
            <li> Love love this palette awesome colors last a long time beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> It would be really great if the Co.  would put the colors on the back of the packaging and label them with names, kind of like how you get a box of chocolate</li>
            <li> On my computer monitor, many of the colors appeared pinkish, but I&#x27;m happy to say that most of the colors are more neutral to yellow, which suits my coloring much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of the daily makeup routine especially good for a neutral summer make up look glowly and nice for an effortless pretty breezy face</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars to find the best for your buck-</li>
            <li> For better cheap makeup try nyx....</li>
            <li> they shadows are very pigmented good quality.</li>
            <li> I loved this palette so much I purchased one for my mom and sister at Christmas.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and the colors show up very well on me.  </li>
            <li> I was initially very excited to receive this palette as I really enjoy matte neutrals.</li>
            <li> And so far, I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I actually used this palette for a wedding and the bride turned out gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I have been a true Fan!</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows are a bit powdery, other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Obviously you cannot expect a great quality for that price, so I&#x27;m OK with it.</li>
            <li> You could easily end up with muddy eye shadows.</li>
            <li> For those who say this is good for beginners, it is in some respects as the colors aren&#x27;t too vibrant.</li>
            <li> The color isnt strong to show  </li>
            <li> Incredibly strong glue and flimsy pans.</li>
            <li> The colors are fairly pigmented but if you prefer high intensity colors</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those who are looking for matte neutral colors with good pigments.</li>
            <li> Not really useing it but great quality just dont really know how to do my make up great service</li>
            <li> the product has a strong smell &amp; it was not the brand offered, aside from that, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Very greats pallete loved the shades in it very neutral which is trendy and affordable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the older offerings by coastal scents but is actually my favorite of all of their palettes that I own.</li>
            <li> Revlon&#x27;s Color-Stay products are awesome in this regard and are half the price on Amazon as they are in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love coastal scents products, &amp; I love the fact that they are very affordable!</li>
            <li> But other then that, love every color, and I loved all of pigments!</li>
            <li> Coastal scents is my latest super discovery.</li>
            <li> The colors are not too strong not too light,</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite pallet !</li>
            <li> They blend easily, are nicely pigmented, and are quite smooth in their application, however, the colors don&#x27;t have as much staying power as I would like.  </li>
            <li> ok first of all i am in LOVEEEEE!  </li>
            <li> These colors are true and smooth, blend exceptionally well and are very pigmented</li>
            <li> Amazing colors and go on like a gem, very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost too light and neutral.</li>
            <li> But you should know how to blend because you will be doing a lot of it with this palette as some colors aren&#x27;t as smooth as I thought.</li>
            <li> I was not planning on buying it, but I figured I get the free shipping with the 88 Colors Palette I also ordered from Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> (even if you fall asleep with them on - still look great the next day)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect for an everyday use as well</li>
            <li> Perfect shades for everyday.</li>
            <li> I was very excited at how little fallout I experienced and I love the staying power.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the light highlight colors are not as pigmented as the darker shades.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous for crease/brow bone colors-</li>
            <li> the mattes are absolutely perfect for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> The pigment of the colors are great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It light shades...</li>
            <li> Confirmed as counterfeit by Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> Such a great selection of colors.</li>
            <li> They blend well and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> There are so many colors that I find useful.  </li>
            <li> i recommend it for all make up lovers who want a cheap make up.</li>
            <li> Awesome for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a fast turnaround time, received item in excellent time.  </li>
            <li> Affordable and right on the mark :)</li>
            <li> This has a very nice range of color and can be mixed and blended with all skin tones/eye colors.  </li>
            <li> While they aren&#x27;t top of the line either, their colors are more vibrant.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when the package got here was that it was not packed very secure.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal palette is super pigment and easy apply.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is okay, and the colors look so pretty on my skin</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this palette</li>
            <li> Love, colors are very well pigmented and blend great.. would totally recommend...</li>
            <li> Excited to try the colors out.</li>
            <li> This palette is more for who doesnt like makeup more into natural makeup look.</li>
            <li> I like a clean matte look.</li>
            <li> I love a neutral face for my everyday look, this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> every women that love using eyeshadow should own this palette or even something similar.</li>
            <li> Comes on smoothly and blends great with other colors.</li>
            <li> I use color on special events, etc.</li>
            <li> Specially for beginners.</li>
            <li> Very good everyday pallet.</li>
            <li> great colors for everyday use and enough colors for a great night look.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product, it has more fallout than MAC but nothing excessive.</li>
            <li> Its true</li>
            <li> I am a true customer now...</li>
            <li> it might be good for someone starting out in makeup.</li>
            <li> and I got a full refund.</li>
            <li> And for not quite the full purchase amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would make one that&#x27;s all cool colors, which is what I need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good neutral palette for daily use.</li>
            <li> Also, you do not get so much that you will never use it and love the color combinations they offer.  </li>
            <li> These are good for simple looks, weddings, and fall colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that most eyeshadows have way too much shimmer in them for me or they&#x27;re too chaulky.  </li>
            <li> Glides on , lovely nude pallet it was suggested  that as I get older I should use matte eyeshadows with out the glittery shiny as it doesn&#x27;t look as nice on my 58 yr old eyes.</li>
            <li> it is like M-A-C quality and super affordable.</li>
            <li> When you apply the shadow it goes on great, and packs very well when properly priming your lid.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Not only the colors are juicy and potent, but so many colors for this price...</li>
            <li> &amp; I got my package quickly to</li>
            <li> and it got here quick.</li>
            <li> I most likely won&#x27;t order this brand again and go with a brand that has more opaque colors.</li>
            <li> Either way, this is a super affordable way to play with eyeshadow looks.</li>
            <li> luckily none of the shadows were shattered.&lt;br /&gt;eyeshadows</li>
            <li> I got mine really quick</li>
            <li> Super pigmented.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my package; i got it right on the date estimated.</li>
            <li> You would be better off investing in two or three high quality shadows because in this case, you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love them and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The black is great and the color stays true through out the night.</li>
            <li> I love this colours, The quality is normal, and colours not very bright, with other bright palette you can make perfect make up</li>
            <li> I live hundreds of miles and doubted my sister arrives in good condition but was very surprised by the care, timeliness and quality.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this 28 Neutral palette is worth the price, it came very quickly and even better it was packaged carefully so not one shadow was disturbed</li>
            <li> serves well as a great black and the browns can be used to bronze or contoure</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore the colors!!</li>
            <li> Product as described and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> The only one that I think is better is the Chanel line, but then again, it is Chanel!  </li>
            <li> If you want more flexibility with how you organize your colors, you are better off getting one of the palette sets that comes in the magnetic palette and/or purchasing the Hot Pots individually.</li>
            <li> Honestly best eye shadows could easily replace expensive brands like Mac any day for the price</li>
            <li> this neutral palette was a little chalky and not so great.</li>
            <li> Its great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> It a bright pink</li>
            <li> The bright pink color will stain your lids.</li>
            <li> It is great for everyday wear and has allowed me to play around with colors</li>
            <li> They come out very chalky and cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid of color at all</li>
            <li> Worth the $$$$</li>
            <li> The quality of the eyeshadows seem a lot better directly ordered from coastal scents.</li>
            <li> I probably would have returned it, but it was worth checking out.</li>
            <li> Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> Over all I use it often and feel it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> The palette is certainly useful</li>
            <li> These colors are nice, natural and good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I must say though, that these colors will only look nice &amp; noticible if you know how to blend and mix colors.</li>
            <li> Worth the Money</li>
            <li> Such good quality and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> These far exceed many drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll give a more complete review.</li>
            <li> I was nervous that the shadows might arrive all broken up, but it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and glamorous nice palette for natural to smoky look!</li>
            <li> These are more toward a burgundy-ish hues on one scheme and the other scheme is more of a orange-y tan rather than a neutral scheme as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully there is a very nice off-white with a hint of minty green to it that helps to neutralize those colors.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, it&#x27;s a good buy, however, I wouldn&#x27;t compare this product to the higher end makeup you get at a makeup counter, but it&#x27;s the same or better compared to what you get at a local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im about to try them right now lolz.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> The pigment of the shadows is as other reviewers testify, very substantial, not like most drug store pallettes that are mostly filler rather than true pigment.</li>
            <li> There are also not any real good browns in any sense in the lot, so I have to use other shadows for ranging through the light, med, dark brownish tones I need as a staple for my colors.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to pay more and purchase naked or Lorac pallets than this cheap Chinese made product.</li>
            <li> Its still a great neutral palette... Usually comes with a logo in front but these for some reason don&#x27;t have it...</li>
            <li> I own other palettes from coastal scents and they are of a far better quality than the trash I was sent.</li>
            <li> They all go together so well that you can just sweep a pale color over your lid, a medium color in the crease, and use a mixing medium on a liner brush on the upper lash line with one of the darker colors for a perfect daytime smokey eye.</li>
            <li> I love this , smells nice and last long. ..</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this pallets if you want create that flawless everyday eye look ;)</li>
            <li> I unraveled the bubble wrap and noticed the palette&#x27;s outer box was very very dusted with eye shadow.</li>
            <li> The other great thing about this set is that it&#x27;s mostly soft matte colors.</li>
            <li> This palette is very good especially for beginners, but also for people who do not like applying a lot of color and tend to keep it natural on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second coastal scents purchase (the other was contour kit) and am super happy with both.</li>
            <li> It came exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> would and the moment i open the palette i felt in love with it</li>
            <li> First time I used it today.</li>
            <li> I have several Coastal Scents products and I love all of them.    </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look how they really are!.    </li>
            <li> This pallette is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Be AWARE .....</li>
            <li> , even it is better, the size of a circle of a paletka corresponds to a photo when you see such qualitative cosmetics</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for my mom for christmas since she always wears more neutral eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> and in the future..Would HIGHLY suggest!!</li>
            <li> I really like this palette!</li>
            <li> This is my first pallatte, so I like it for what I&#x27;m trying to get done.</li>
            <li> This is the first item ever from Amazon that I have been dissatisfied with after years of shopping.</li>
            <li> I had hoped they would be more pigmented than they actually are.  </li>
            <li> First off, please DO NOT buy the knockoffs.</li>
            <li> the ones I use most often are the colors in the last two rows.</li>
            <li> Also, I dampen my eyeshadow brush with some NYX setting spray first to help minimize fallout.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty pigmented, although some of them run together without distinction.</li>
            <li> use it every day and have no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first palette(second one, because first is in the trash now.. bad-quality) and if you try to find somethin</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite neutral palettes because it comes with a variety of matte and shimmer colors.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> All the colors are not so pigmented like the first row is not</li>
            <li> She fell in love instantly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it because it&#x27;s really good for everyday use and formal looks.</li>
            <li> The only thing I kind of dislike is the bit of shimmery that it has, But other than that I love this palette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the original revealed pallets and it was getting old (lasted a year)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product for highlighting, but because it is the MOST excellent product for eye shadow base...</li>
            <li> some more pigmented than others.&lt;br /&gt;easily capable of creating a variety of different neutral looks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The palette has AMAZING neutrals and only a few are sparkly, most are matte, which I ADORE.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, especially the dark sparkly purple color, but the two of the colors popped out when I opened it for the first time, so the glue didn&#x27;t hold so well.  </li>
            <li> My first real palette and I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely \\&quot;loved\\&quot; this palette when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> Colors are perfect for everyday use and for natural looks a must buy if you are just starting to use make up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad when I want to go for a natural look..</li>
            <li> It was an easy return and was actually a warehouse problem</li>
            <li> But while I truly love the colors in this palette they are dry</li>
            <li> Good pigmentation and long lasting finish.</li>
            <li> it creates great smoky eyes and toned down looks for work or even a simple run to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I have bought everything from large furniture items to exercise equipment and everything in between from Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional make up, and for the price i&#x27;ve spend in this, let me say that i don&#x27;t think it deserves, first of all it has only 28 colors, and they&#x27;re NOT pigmented at all, and i tried this with many primers, and also foundation..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium brown skin black female and it looks great on me.</li>
            <li> This is hard to say when you get a palette with this many, but i enjoy this one.</li>
            <li> Received my palette today and really like it.</li>
            <li> I had been looking at all the different palettes available trying to decide which one to purchase.</li>
            <li> but I got this because I had heard so much about the \\&quot;Mac Dupes\\&quot; in it and also</li>
            <li> Really all the neutrals a girl can ever wish for.  </li>
            <li> I really like this pallete.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pigmented.</li>
            <li> but they are very blendable as well.</li>
            <li> You will get so much use out of it.</li>
            <li> I really love that, but the quality of the product is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented and has some MAC dupes.</li>
            <li> I really like all the colors.</li>
            <li> I feel like for the price, I can&#x27;t really complain though.</li>
            <li> A lot of the colors almost seem to have a reddish undertone on the skin which I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li> Colors look fabulous in the case, but it has no richness or depth to it at all and colors faded or rubbed off and wouldn&#x27;t last from morning to the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> Was better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the fact that the palette I received had no labels or anything.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> some of them are really chalky and don&#x27;t have any pigment.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t recommend this product...</li>
            <li> The colors are very blendable and are matte.</li>
            <li> This palette isn&#x27;t very pigmented and the lighter colors are very chalky.</li>
            <li> I have never had MAC products because I refuse to spend that much on makeup.  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented</li>
            <li> Packed very well, in bubble wrap, nothing broke.</li>
            <li> colors are very pigmented and have lots of staying power even with my greasy lids.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really understand how it happened</li>
            <li> If you want the real costal scents, go buy from their website.  </li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i didn&#x27;t try them already but they seem really good!!!&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this pallet!</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m very dissapointed..</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I read so much about this on you tube.</li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> No broken pieces or anything</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting too much.</li>
            <li> They are also very chalky.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I opened up the palette to find it absolutely destroyed</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the colours in the picture do not match the eye shadows in real life.</li>
            <li> The quality of these shadows are okay, could be much better, but I&#x27;ve seen worse.</li>
            <li> Second the colors blend nice and third the colors can work on all skin tones.</li>
            <li> Dead honest words...</li>
            <li> The colors are great, some color are like a chalk, you need much produt to work, and during  transportation one of color was broken</li>
            <li> The colors are very light so primer or a base is the best way to go when using even if your skin tone is dark or light.</li>
            <li> first I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I will add this eyeshadow palette to my other eyeshadows and customize my finished look as my wardrobe and seasons change OK.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and this palette has more usable colors than any other palette I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I love this, and plan on getting a few more, as long as they are new, and untouched.  </li>
            <li> My makeup routine is not complete without some FABULOUS makeup on my eye-lids.</li>
            <li> They are true to color, and they last all day.</li>
            <li> , I wanted something more neutral for school functions with the kids and where I need a toned down look.</li>
            <li> considering that the cost for shipping to where I live is just way too much.</li>
            <li> Most of them are pigmented, but the black at the corner of the palette doesn&#x27;t come out how it looks in the pan.</li>
            <li> As with most palettes you won&#x27;t use all the colors - I&#x27;ve used about half, though at $20 I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> I broke more than half of the colors trying to get them out.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this particular makeup palette being that I am a beginner when it comes to makeup.</li>
            <li> The only con is that they are super pigmented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased one item from them and after that I&#x27;ve found their main site where they run specials quite often.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are also great for an eye shadow base as well.</li>
            <li> This is my main eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> I use it occasionally  but its good for everyday.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say they are particularly vibrant but</li>
            <li> decent, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> It gives you the color you are looking for right away without applying several times and not as much residue gets on to your cheeks</li>
            <li> I recommend this palette highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these shadows.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend it</li>
            <li> Do not irritate the eyes at all and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They can definitely be worked with to get started with makeup and get experimental and familiar with color placement for beginners.</li>
            <li> * :)...smell a little</li>
            <li> The pigment could be a little better</li>
            <li> These are a little creamier and blend better.</li>
            <li> After reading such wonderful reviews and lusting over this palette via Internet.... I can honestly say that I am very disappointed in this palette.</li>
            <li> so you do experience some fall out &amp; some colors are similar to each other &amp; I would of liked a few more highlighting colors that are a little lighter as most</li>
            <li> Has matte and shimmer shadows, I use the matte baby pink as a blush and matte light bronze as my contour.</li>
            <li> Great for teens/tweens to play with, but I am not impressed at all by these shadows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very big fan of bright colours when it comes to make-up, so I usually stick with neutral shades.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth paying the extra 4 bucks from coastal scents.</li>
            <li> I normally buy Clinique or Loreal, MAC, Sephora, but wanted to compare this for myself.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the palette is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It has everything to give you a everyday look and more, this is the 6th pallet I have bought from them</li>
            <li> I am soo loving these shadow colors and they are seriously like my favorite eyeshadows I own now, totally been using them EVERYDAY!!!!  </li>
            <li> so I may order it in the future if needed but for now I will be ordering the other palette with the bright colors pictured above!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main complaint, but I do see a bright future with this palette</li>
            <li> I am pretty creative artistically and oftentimes I volunteer to do wedding/party makeovers for little extra cash tips.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is really pretty and nicely sized but the thing is really hard to open.</li>
            <li> Lovely colors with pigmentation dont care if its a fake it still works perfectly fine for me</li>
            <li> I always held out from buying this because it&#x27;s so cheap compared to other brands, but now I regret not getting this sooner.</li>
            <li> picture does not really show the colors as they truly are but still a good little palette for the money.</li>
            <li> The formula for these are is different from the different 88 color ones that are available.</li>
            <li> I use the purple on my lid and the light brown next to it on my upper lid.</li>
            <li> Great palette for everyday natural looks, and Also for more dramatic evening looks!  </li>
            <li> Its nothing special and while it is a decent price, I would suggest saving your money and investing in the Naked palette from Urban Decay or even a Nyx palette.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that middle bottom circle got damaged pretty quickly from opening the palette (darn, it was one of my favorite colors too)</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow set hasn&#x27;t given my eyes any problem at all, and I&#x27;m very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Was very surprised with the pigment and staying power.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by a few colors: the peach one has flecks of gold, the white is very opalescent and reflects different colors, the black has very fine pinky-brown flecks in it, and the one in the upper right corner is my new favorite eyeshadow...</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and I&#x27;ll be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> only REAL problem with this 28 Neutral Palette is that these \\&quot;colors are not labeled\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> at all; and some contain cheap glitter that falls down your face when applied.</li>
            <li> but if you just re-apply it a few times its an easy fix.</li>
            <li> colors are hard to come and blend there are many other great products worth spending money on than this silly pallet I ordered 4 of this pallet and</li>
            <li> I love these eyeshadows because they are so natural and can be used almost everyday to give a subtle but sexy look.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was a little skeptical of this purchase, but WOW, I absolutely love this make-up!</li>
            <li> My God, coastal scents isn&#x27;t even a high end brand, I never expected to be conned.</li>
            <li> The colors are very flattering to every skin tone and the shadows are long wearing and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> This 28 neutral palette completely exceeds any hopes that I had for it...</li>
            <li> For the price of 1 Mac eyeshadow you get a whole 28 same size as Mac eyeshadows!!!</li>
            <li> As far as Mac Dupes-</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I use an eyeshadow primer and the colors,which are very pigmented in my opinion, last all day.</li>
            <li> Comparable to La colors, not too powdery so far.</li>
            <li> This is by no means a professional quality product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this palette, I would recommend going directly to the coastal scents website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised the eyeshadows in the pallet didn&#x27;t break....</li>
            <li> At age 51 I didn&#x27;t think I would really like these colors so much, especially since they are not all 100% matte.</li>
            <li> My eyes are green and so the purple looks fabulous with them.</li>
            <li> I will be returning to Amazon, and reordering directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li> If you want something that actually blends very well.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Ben Nye eyeshadows are VERY pigmented, but that is a theatrical line designed for stage and film.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> Maybe before they actually sent the real one from here</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and last all day with a primer.</li>
            <li> The colours are matte and natural looking</li>
            <li> Works really well, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and skin</li>
            <li> Most colors are creamy, only a few are chalky.</li>
            <li> Go splurge on a good expensive eyeshadow palette elsewhere.</li>
            <li> , especially the deep purple and browns on the far right vertical row.</li>
            <li> use it everyday for nice toned down natural looks.</li>
            <li> And they do last a fairly decent time on the lids.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product, however a few colors were broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> so the eye shadow sticks better because it tends to fake somewhat fast.  </li>
            <li> the light colors in the left side were actually a heavy grry color..</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews that I watched on Youtube were 4 years old and that is why  it looks different than some of the palettes on there.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman of color and a professional makeup artist, and not only are these eyeshadows well pigmented</li>
            <li> &#x27;n Wild drugstore shadows are about the same quality as these.</li>
            <li> The colors stay on all day and barely crease.</li>
            <li> You can barely see it...or have to keep building it up.</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I even contacted Costal Scents because in some of the YouTube videos the palette had a different color in the palette, like out of nowhere mine had a hot pink color in it ,  </li>
            <li> I would tell anyone to get this palette before the 88 palette just because the colors on the 88 are very vibrant, and if you are not used to doing bright colors on a daily basis you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and they confirmed it was suppose to be in there, so in the second row third shadow its a hot pink one not a light pink like the picture has ..</li>
            <li> Most of the time I end up with odd shades of blue and green that will never be used.</li>
            <li> The pan sizes are a little bit small, but the quality is compared to huge high end makeup brands.</li>
            <li> the color barely shows up and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> , I lost mines in my room and missing it so much!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this palette to those who have a makeup collection with higher quality makeup because it will be a waste and wouldn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are much lighter on the skin and take a long time to build up their color, also they are very dry.</li>
            <li> I would say the new Wet</li>
            <li> That was a huge disappointment but the eyeshadows worked pretty well</li>
            <li> The smoky black wouldn&#x27;t even stay on my eyes no matter how much I put on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very pigmented but that was why I bought it, for very natural looking makeup.</li>
            <li> These shades have shimmer and are not flat like I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> ,colors are vibrant and it stays on the brush instead of falling down your face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much of it because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but I came to find out that it is a lot cheaper to buy this palette and other coastal scents products directly threw their website.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this palette, but yes half of the colors seem very cheap and not as pigmented as the real one would, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I really try to like this palette, but every time I use i get more dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> They are not at all chalky and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this set looking for long lasting eye color but found that the color fades after about 4 hours and you have to reapply.</li>
            <li> Yes all the EYESHADOW IS SOFT but its powdery and not super pigment.</li>
            <li> Most eyeshadows will cause my eyes to tear up all day, which is not attractive, and then I give up wearing makeup at all after a few days.</li>
            <li> Also, when this arrived, one of the colors had broken, but luckily it was one I wouldn&#x27;t use anyway.</li>
            <li> The black eyeshadow its not a true black more off black.    </li>
            <li> This might sound weird</li>
            <li> To my surprise it was not the one I had wanted for so long.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t had it that long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of the colors so far</li>
            <li> but packaging was not clearly marked by name of company.will not order again</li>
            <li> stays on long..</li>
            <li> but once you try to apply they all come out like a grey undertone to your eyelid.</li>
            <li> smaller than I​ expected.</li>
            <li> Regular intake because their pigmentation is not very good, barely noticeable, like me enough, the result to apply was not completely satisfactory</li>
            <li> I have found that other brands such as Stila and MAC stay all day until you remove them - not the case here with Coastal.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to try other color palette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but I had to give it 3 stars due to the fact that almost all of these shades have an orang/red pigment to them they go on well but don&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li> I apply these dry over Revlon&#x27;s Color-Stay highlighter.</li>
            <li> As a brown girl, I can do my everyday makeup with these subtle, yet bold shades.</li>
            <li> I tried every single color on my skin</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as I would want it to be and not enough dark colours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blue eyed, redheaded, pale white girl, and I can use all of the shades in this palette without looking like a drag queen or a transplant from the 80s.</li>
            <li> OMG, NitraaB on youtube raves about this pallet all the time on her channel, I finally broke down and bought it</li>
            <li> These are not a high end makeup product so don&#x27;t expect it to be so.</li>
            <li> but the eye shadows got super chalky making them hard to keep on and hard to blend.</li>
            <li> but I used urban decay primer potion with this on my nw20 skin pretty pale and had the worst color pay off more like a blotchy wash of color.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money.</li>
            <li> It was like putting baby powder colored with crushed chalk onto your eyelids.  </li>
            <li> the pink in the picture looks shuttle but is not it</li>
            <li> Nobody could ever get dissapointed by the size, so it has a wide range of colors that if you were to purchase them separatelly, it would cost a lot.</li>
            <li> The white eye shadow has a green sparkle to it.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that I was using the same colors for my everyday look.</li>
            <li> I was worried that a few eyeshadows would be broken by the time they reached me, but the packaging was amazing and not even one was broken.</li>
            <li> Colors are not very pigmented at all, some u can&#x27;t even tell you swatched a color..</li>
            <li> id say save your money and buy something worth buying.maybe, this is a fake idk</li>
            <li> This palette was not at all what i had expected and I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> i also like the wide variety of colors this palette provides.</li>
            <li> , the pans were scattered everywhere, multiple eye shadows were smashed to bits, one was missing, one looked like some of my well used eye shadows that have hit the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li> The colors are pigmented for a few hours however I would suggest applying a primer prior to application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hardly ever use it because it does not last long.</li>
            <li> Half of the shadows actually have pigment, and the other half are trash.</li>
            <li> The colours gives a real natural look for everyday use and you can even use it as a smokey eye makeup for late night-outs.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t blend as easily as other palettes either.  </li>
            <li> The makeup palette was just in the box, not wrapped with any other type of security bobble wrap.</li>
            <li> Other than that i recommend, but there&#x27;s a chance of the product arriving damaged.</li>
            <li> I will purchase other colors from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Extremely pigmented, buttery and blendable eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Colors were not exact to the photo shown.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, subtle, blends well and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> :/ kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Other then that I like to use the link shadow as a blush and the dark brown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a make-up junkie, and it&#x27;s really hard to find non-shimmery, flattering colors that actually last and blend well.</li>
            <li> I use almost every single color in the palatte, which is not something I can usually say for other palettes I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> There should be dark browns through</li>
            <li> On dark skin it looks like you are wearing chalk on your eyes</li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> the price is not worth it.</li>
            <li> its very difficult to blend and the colors aren&#x27;t really true to the shade.</li>
            <li> There are lots of different colors in this palette, but be prepared to layer them on really thickly.</li>
            <li> I think a few of the brown colors are like dust not much pigment in it.</li>
            <li> I had narrowed it down to the 88 color palette, then I was looking for the ones that had no shipping fee.</li>
            <li> no more single eyeshadows filling up my makeup box.</li>
            <li> This is a fake, the colours are very very chalky with very little pigment payoff.</li>
            <li> The black one doesn&#x27;t even come off on my finger when I touch it.</li>
            <li> They did finally issue me a refund, but only after a lot of resistance and silly excuses.</li>
            <li> I got this pallette because of the price range as well as being a previous customer of coastal scents.</li>
            <li> Not true to color..</li>
            <li> I will never waste my money on expensive Mac or other name brand eyeshadows again.  </li>
            <li> One can be too heavy handed with any eyeshadow on top of eyeshadow base, must use a light hand applying eyeshadow on eyeshadow base.  </li>
            <li> The was a little bobble wrap in the box</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the shadow is a little powdery</li>
            <li> but I can also mix it up a little with the variety given.</li>
            <li> I received this product was a cheap case , did not say coastal on the pallette, was very very unhappy with this product .</li>
            <li> , some of these colors will appear a little orange-y, even a few that don&#x27;t seem like they should be orange-y.</li>
            <li> I regret not purchasing sooner and spending oodles of cash on other, brand-name, make-up!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My everyday look.</li>
            <li> but I feel like the eye shadows dried out.</li>
            <li> I also use a few colors as my contour and blush.</li>
            <li> i got this a few days ago</li>
            <li> I use it everyday since I&#x27;ve received it and loveeee.</li>
            <li> No point to waste your money at department store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> everyday looks though.</li>
            <li> I use this palette everyday for work.</li>
            <li> Plus i figured one broken eye shadow is not that big of a deal for the price I got it.</li>
            <li> The only downside was that the product was broken.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on what I thought I bought.</li>
            <li> There are 2 or 3 colors that I&#x27;d had trouble locating in stores.</li>
            <li> but the shadows practically jumped out of the black case!</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have pale pale porcelain skin</li>
            <li> Ladies with pale skin beware</li>
            <li> There are 6 or 7 total with a bit of shimmer, but it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li> once applied the colors are bland and dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to compare anything to mac eyeshadow, but these come close and cost so much less.</li>
            <li> it just came in a matte black case in a large manila envelope no logo on the front of the pallet that disappointed me,</li>
            <li> They have very poor pigmentation, the darkest one barely showed up on my finger when I TRIED to swatch it through the layers of dust and chunks.</li>
            <li> If I have to compare this palette; its not better than L&#x27;oreal La Palette.</li>
            <li> I use everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually have problems with eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d recommend it..</li>
            <li> it is very low quality... difficult to blend ...</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Give this to your little girl to play dress up in, because you can NOT take this product seriously.</li>
            <li> there are really none that are so insanely close that I would call them a dupe and that is doing a side by side to actual Mac product.    </li>
            <li> Shipped fast and noting was broken or dirty.</li>
            <li> The other colors were not chalky however, but they were so tightly pressed that it was even difficult to get the product out with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Shadows are not very good quality.</li>
            <li> I wear everything from MAC, Dior, and urban Decay and so on, but as you know their very expensive, so i wanted to try something less $$</li>
            <li> Very upsetting experience:(</li>
            <li> The colors are really dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a grown woman and these colors were worse than the dress up make up little girls use.  </li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are not too pigmented, as say compared to my urban decay or too faced shadows but with a little eye primer they are not too bad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try different lines.</li>
            <li> would give it negative stars if I was allowed to.</li>
            <li> I was nervous because I had read some of the reviews that the product was a fake, due to the font on the front of the palette....</li>
            <li> Basically, expect to pay for 14 random shadows, because the other 14 aren&#x27;t going to show up on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> Also they were very small.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like, mine has a eyeshadow that always falls out on me every time I open it, its very annoying.</li>
            <li> Not only did I get disappointed with that</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only color I was disappointed with.</li>
            <li> The colors are also very hard to blend.</li>
            <li> If you order this palette, I highly doubt you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I do use an eyeshadow base, and these eyeshadows are not much more pigmented than other eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li> It travels well because it is so thin.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> This palette is total crap.</li>
            <li> The shades came in broken.</li>
            <li> However,  I&#x27;m accustomed to using Victoria secret shadows.</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is poor.</li>
            <li> That was annoying to me because I didn&#x27;t know what was what except for the obvious.</li>
            <li> Came all broken up and couldn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> Also when i went to swatch it the shadows were chalky, the color payoff was poor, and the sparkles were chunky.</li>
            <li> but when I opened the package two of the shadows were broken and had gotten all over the palette.</li>
            <li> I think if I didn&#x27;t get mine broken</li>
            <li> Anyone who is not happy with this product is probably not using a shadow base or similar product.</li>
            <li> If you wanna create a neutral look with this palette, it would be a very subtle look.</li>
            <li> I was a little frustrated because the picture was deceiving.</li>
            <li> needless to say it isn&#x27;t a fake</li>
            <li> but when I ordered it I received the wrong colors.</li>
            <li> one of the reasons I&#x27;m rating this as 3 stars the second thing I cannot stand is the smell of this eyeshadow pallet it smells terrible</li>
            <li> This palette has weird colors in it.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks to be delivered and it was the wrong palette.</li>
            <li> It is useless as the colors have no pigmentation to speak of.</li>
            <li> I never go anywhere without my Coastal Scents eye-shadow palette because I can never go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Its just mediocre. 1 to 10.. I would rate it a 5.</li>
            <li> However for the price you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> IT IS A FAKE</li>
            <li> I then went to YouTube in hopes that I was wrong but everyone else that had the palette but sadly my accusation was correct.</li>
            <li> Looks fake version of coastel scents, colors a lil off but</li>
            <li> i swatched darkest color and it bearly shows ill be returning 2</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken!</li>
            <li> the item arrived and I was disappointed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> However, the palette was damaged; one of the eye shadows was broken :(.</li>
            <li> They have a little shimmer and that&#x27;s annoying!</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the shadows would break during shipping.</li>
            <li> This palette is VERY difficult to de-pot.</li>
            <li> Price not so bad.</li>
            <li> bad pigmented</li>
            <li> I did receive this product, I was HUGELY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am unimpressed and disappointed by this palette.</li>
            <li> COMING FROM CHINA AND RECEIVED WITH MOLD...:(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this purchase I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> are base &amp; crease colors.</li>
            <li> You should always use a base for your shadows.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t judge any eyeshadow pallette until you use it over a shadow base.</li>
            <li> I will say that using a primer or a concealer or eye base will help with pigmentation issues for this pallette, as well as building the color to the desired shade and consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed not pigmented at all you literally have to be reapplying color every two seconds to get that color you see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and have already packaged it to return.</li>
            <li> this is the one of the worst palettes I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service was very horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> the worst..  </li>
            <li> Smells horrible like it is expired.</li>
            <li> Product has an awful smell...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money. You get what you pay for though.</li>
            <li> The colors are off a bit from the picture but the colors are nice and pigmented.</li>
            <li> None of these shades are truly matte. Should have saved my money and gotten Urban Decay Naked Basics 2. Never use this.</li>
            <li> ok first of all i am in LOVEEEEE!  This 28 neutral palette completely exceeds any hopes that I had for it... I was nervous because I had read some of the reviews that the product was a fake, due to the font on the front of the palette....needless to say it isn&#x27;t a fake they changed fonts over the years.  A lot of the reviews that I watched on Youtube were 4 years old and that is why  it looks different than some of the palettes on there.  Ok so the shadows are so pigmented!!!!! Like so gooddddd... I will never waste my money on expensive Mac or other name brand eyeshadows again.  For the price of 1 Mac eyeshadow you get a whole 28 same size as Mac eyeshadows!!! Dude I am not kiddinggggg!  They blend so good and I have used the palette several times before writing this review just so i could fully evaluate the quality and performance...Im stoked and will totally continue to buy this again.  I even contacted Costal Scents because in some of the YouTube videos the palette had a different color in the palette, like out of nowhere mine had a hot pink color in it ,  and they confirmed it was suppose to be in there, so in the second row third shadow its a hot pink one not a light pink like the picture has .. but i don&#x27;t even care ....I am soo loving these shadow colors and they are seriously like my favorite eyeshadows I own now, totally been using them EVERYDAY!!!!  I COULD NOT BE MORE HAPPY !!!!! Also lasts all day looks same as when applied and I don&#x27;t even use eyeshadow primer 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Everyone I show this palette to loves the neutral colors. The black is great and the color stays true through out the night. Helpful hint I always dab my brush with water then blot it on a tissue before I dip into my eyeshadow. It gives you the color you are looking for right away without applying several times and not as much residue gets on to your cheeks</li>
            <li> this is the one of the worst palettes I have ever used.  the color barely shows up and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I like the make up a lot. I am happy with the product, however a few colors were broken when I received it. They were colors I know I would not use so I didnt deal with the hassle of sending it back to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and I&#x27;ll be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this palette.  I don&#x27;t have to use much of it because a little goes a long way.  Its great for everyday use.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to order this particular makeup palette being that I am a beginner when it comes to makeup. Im African American and the colors start to look  chalky after a while. I worry about that when I go out. I think I may need to get a better primer....</li>
            <li> The colors are great, especially the dark sparkly purple color, but the two of the colors popped out when I opened it for the first time, so the glue didn&#x27;t hold so well.  That&#x27;s the main complaint, but I do see a bright future with this palette and I would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> Received my palette today and really like it. There is a good selection of matte and shimmer colors. I had to have the neutral palette since I also have the 88 palette. This is a really good buy.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the color choices and the size of the shadows. The only con is that they are super pigmented. Otherwise, I am very satisfied with them. They last all night.</li>
            <li> I had been looking at all the different palettes available trying to decide which one to purchase. I had narrowed it down to the 88 color palette, then I was looking for the ones that had no shipping fee.I came along this one and purchased it. I was reviewing my purchase and realized that I had purchased the the 28 Neutral palette (one I already owned). I was a little frustrated because the picture was deceiving. Yes, I should have read the description but the picture should resemble the item being sold.     Because I already own this palette, I can say it is pretty nice. Most colors are creamy, only a few are chalky.</li>
            <li> I like the colors but when I ordered it I received the wrong colors. The picture showed bright colors and I got brown colors. Not to happy but I don&#x27;t want to deal with waiting two weeks for the correct one so I kept it. I use it for coverup cause I don&#x27;t wear brown for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Shadows are not very good quality. The black one doesn&#x27;t even come off on my finger when I touch it. It&#x27;s like solid, not even a powder. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Good pigment good price and fast shipping from Amazon can&#x27;t complain at all</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I do like Coastal Scents palettes for what they are cheap and pigmented- great color variety, etc...  I&#x27;m not afraid of color at all but I got this because I had heard so much about the \\&quot;Mac Dupes\\&quot; in it and also, I wanted something more neutral for school functions with the kids and where I need a toned down look. I even wear makeup to the grocery store. For that, this palette works well.    As far as Mac Dupes- there are really none that are so insanely close that I would call them a dupe and that is doing a side by side to actual Mac product.    This palette doesn&#x27;t seem as pigmented to me as others I have tried by Coastal Scents- it&#x27;s almost too light and neutral. The colors don&#x27;t blend as easily as other palettes either.  For those who say this is good for beginners, it is in some respects as the colors aren&#x27;t too vibrant. But you should know how to blend because you will be doing a lot of it with this palette as some colors aren&#x27;t as smooth as I thought. Mac is actually great beginner eyeshadow because of its ease of use and easy blending. But their shadows are hit and miss as well- I think most brands are.    I have sensitive eyes and they are not bothered by any Coastal Scents palette either. Always wear a good eye primer with any eyeshadow- Shadow Insurance does make these eyeshadows last all day and then some!    This is good for the price but for a better neutral option- go for the 88 Warm- that is a great neutral pigmented palette which blends easily and has a better color variety.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting the Coastal Scents 28 Color Eyeshadow Palette, Neutral for sometime now so I finally ordered it. The first thing I noticed when the package got here was that it was not packed very secure. At the time I purchased the palette I also purchased a curling iron. Both items were packed together. The makeup palette was just in the box, not wrapped with any other type of security bobble wrap. The was a little bobble wrap in the box so things wouldn&#x27;t move around but if the box had been dropped the makeup would have broke. When taking the palette out of its own box that said Coastal Scents 28 Color Eyeshadow Palette, Neutral on it there was a palette that said 26 palette eyeshadow and blush. To my surprise it was not the one I had wanted for so long. I was upset but thought I would call and have the correct one sent to me. No luck. I have to send the one I received back for a refund and reorder from someone else. Very upsetting experience:(</li>
            <li> It came exactly as described.  Gorgeous neutral shades in a good sized palette.  Really all the neutrals a girl can ever wish for.  Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I am a neutral eye girl. My everyday look. I use color on special events, etc. But for the most part neutrals. I love this palette because it gives you options &amp; you can even smoke it up. So deffinetly recommend this palette. Specially for beginners.</li>
            <li> I have the 88 matte and 26 color shadow blush palettes from coastal scents,but this one is definitely my favorite! The colors are so gorgeous. If you like neutral eyes, you will like this palette. I use an eyeshadow primer and the colors,which are very pigmented in my opinion, last all day. Great palette!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was a little skeptical of this purchase, but WOW, I absolutely love this make-up!</li>
            <li> Lovely colors with pigmentation dont care if its a fake it still works perfectly fine for me *double thumbs up* :)...smell a little but that i can handle</li>
            <li> My first real palette and I will buy it again when I run out. Has matte and shimmer shadows, I use the matte baby pink as a blush and matte light bronze as my contour. LOVE this! Will recommend to everyone I know! Especially for the price. Shipped fast and noting was broken or dirty.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! And it came two days early, which was great! The pigmentation is okay, and the colors look so pretty on my skin (I have tan skin). This is great for beginners! Worth the $$$$</li>
            <li> One of the best eyeshadow palettes, so many choices and all blend well together.  It goes on well, I haven&#x27;t had it that long but looks good each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the color pay off to be too great. The most I use this pallet for at this point is the brown for brows, and the lighter colors for highlighting the brow.</li>
            <li> Love love this palette awesome colors last a long time beautiful colors.I order the product and it got here the day they promise it would and the moment i open the palette i felt in love with it truely awesome :) very happy with it and amazon</li>
            <li> The play it and I don&#x27;t love it. Yes all the EYESHADOW IS SOFT but its powdery and not super pigment. You got to dig a lot in the eyeshadow and pat your eyelid. If I have to compare this palette; its not better than L&#x27;oreal La Palette. L&#x27;oreal palette is super pigment and easy apply. What coastalscents and L&#x27;oreal palette have similar it that both the palette is satin. Yeah coastalscents look like a shimmer palette but on the eyelid its satin.  The black eyeshadow its not a true black more off black.    This palette is more for who doesnt like makeup more into natural makeup look. The color isnt strong to show  P.S. I order from Amazon company not others.</li>
            <li> This palette is absolutely amazing. it is like M-A-C quality and super affordable. I am definitely going to buy it again when i run out</li>
            <li> Regular intake because their pigmentation is not very good, barely noticeable, like me enough, the result to apply was not completely satisfactory</li>
            <li> The pigmentation could have been better. Comparable to La colors, not too powdery so far. First time I used it today. You have to use a eye primer though. Price not so bad. Good starter palette for beginners.</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with this palette. I was not planning on buying it, but I figured I get the free shipping with the 88 Colors Palette I also ordered from Coastal Scents. When you apply the shadow it goes on great, and packs very well when properly priming your lid. I would tell anyone to get this palette before the 88 palette just because the colors on the 88 are very vibrant, and if you are not used to doing bright colors on a daily basis you will be disappointed. This palette is very good especially for beginners, but also for people who do not like applying a lot of color and tend to keep it natural on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used painterly paintpot by MAC as my primer. (works great also)</li>
            <li> This is a nice neutral palette. Great price for the amount of product you get. This product is great for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely \\&quot;loved\\&quot; this palette when I first purchased it. There was not one thing I didn&#x27;t like about it. But that ended about 4 months after purchasing it. This might sound weird but I feel like the eye shadows dried out. I don&#x27;t know if I make sense but the eye shadows got super chalky making them hard to keep on and hard to blend. I even bought different eye primers and bases thinking that was the problem but it wasn&#x27;t. Not only did I get disappointed with that but I came to find out that it is a lot cheaper to buy this palette and other coastal scents products directly threw their website.</li>
            <li> HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Really nice palette with nutral colors, I lost mines in my room and missing it so much! It&#x27;s part of the daily makeup routine especially good for a neutral summer make up look glowly and nice for an effortless pretty breezy face</li>
            <li> Recieved these eyeshadows about a week ago. Since i saw very good reviews i decided to try them out. I was very disappointed not pigmented at all you literally have to be reapplying color every two seconds to get that color you see. Its true you do get what you pay for i would not recommend this eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet, I have a Carmel like complexion and these colors compliments my face. I also use a few colors as my contour and blush.</li>
            <li> love these shadows... they are really pigmented and look great - i use the NYX HD eye shadow primer prior to and they stay on forever without creasing! (even if you fall asleep with them on - still look great the next day)</li>
            <li> Love this! Great colors and great pigmentation!!</li>
            <li> Great color payoff for the price!</li>
            <li> I really like this pallete. I use it almost all the time when I want to wear eyeshadow. I like the shades in the pallete the pigmentation is really good. It has some mate and shimmer colors. I just wish it had more darker shades. I would recommend it because it&#x27;s really good for everyday use and formal looks.</li>
            <li> So now that I read it, it does say that the palette is neutral but I figured that was just the name of the palette- the item arrived and I was disappointed to say the least.  I&#x27;d like it if Amazon would put up the proper picture so I may order it in the future if needed but for now I will be ordering the other palette with the bright colors pictured above!</li>
            <li> Cute colors, great price, kinda powdery but their blendable</li>
            <li> I never thought how amazing the colors would come out. They&#x27;re very pigmented. They&#x27;re perfect for an everyday use as well</li>
            <li> All great colors , good quality for the price. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this palette!!&lt;br /&gt;please purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Very pigmented!!</li>
            <li> I received this palette about 2 weeks ago - have used it each time I do a makeup application. I absolutely adore the colors!! I am a woman of color and a professional makeup artist, and not only are these eyeshadows well pigmented but they are very blendable as well. They show up on ALL SHADES OF SKIN COLOR. They are not at all chalky and last a long time. Please do yourself a favor and do not get caught up in the \\&quot;big name\\&quot; lines (i.e: MAC,NARS,etc.). Makeup is makeup is makeup. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try different lines. As an artist I have learned that many cosmetic lines offer great products. Take the time to find them, and start with this one!! :-) I actually used this palette for a wedding and the bride turned out gorgeous! If you are looking for a bang for your buck this is the palette for you. You will get so much use out of it. JUST BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> I just received this palette and I am loving it.  The colors that I&#x27;ve tried thus far have been excellent.  Good coverage and depth of color.</li>
            <li> colors are hard to come and blend there are many other great products worth spending money on than this silly pallet I ordered 4 of this pallet and one of them is a gift and when I saw the quality of the shadows eventually I didnt gift it. in my opinion sleek palette are waaaaaay better than this one. save your money</li>
            <li> It has very nice colors. I really love that, but the quality of the product is not what I expected. Obviously you cannot expect a great quality for that price, so I&#x27;m OK with it.</li>
            <li> Great palette for everyday natural looks, and Also for more dramatic evening looks!  Texture is good...maybe a tad bit powdery but all in all and good product. I would buy again...Will be purchasing another color palette soon.</li>
            <li> exactly as it looks, greatly packaged</li>
            <li> i got this a few days ago and i didn&#x27;t like it at all trust me do not bye it.&lt;br /&gt;i decided to bye this because i saw a lot of good review but truth is this doesn&#x27;t work you will regret this.</li>
            <li> awesome colors, good quality, very good for the price.  it does not irritates.  Im really happy</li>
            <li> I have several Coastal Scents products and I love all of them.    Excellent Product!    This eyeshadows are ideal for make-up artists, I love to use, beatifull colors which are amazing in real life, on the picture doesn&#x27;t look how they really are!.    100% Recommended!! If you love make You´ll love this pallette!!</li>
            <li> This product came in a timely fashion and intact. I was afraid that the shadows would break during shipping. I&#x27;ve used a few of the colors so far and it&#x27;s great. The shadow almost stays on for an entire workday depending on how oily my skin gets (and that&#x27;s even with an eye shadow primer).  For the price I paid, it&#x27;s a good buy, however, I wouldn&#x27;t compare this product to the higher end makeup you get at a makeup counter, but it&#x27;s the same or better compared to what you get at a local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again and I do recommend it to my friends who are on a budget, but want a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has shimmering and matte shades, which is great for me since I&#x27;m so indecisive. I&#x27;ll use a shimmering color one day and a matte the next or both if I&#x27;m going out at night.</li>
            <li> The colors are very nice with both matte and shimmer shades. The shimmer are not too \\&quot;glittery\\&quot; and actually stay put longer than the others. I bought this set looking for long lasting eye color but found that the color fades after about 4 hours and you have to reapply. I have found that other brands such as Stila and MAC stay all day until you remove them - not the case here with Coastal.</li>
            <li> I love all the choices in this palette. I like how I have an option of making a daytime look or a neutral smokey eye! The pigment could be a little better but if you just re-apply it a few times its an easy fix. I would order this again.</li>
            <li> The quality of the eyeshadows seem a lot better directly ordered from coastal scents. The two I have purchased off amazon don&#x27;t even compete with the quality you get from their. Probably just a knock off. Definitely worth paying the extra 4 bucks from coastal scents.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I use everyday! It is very pigmented and has some MAC dupes. I think this a great starter palette, the pigment and color variety is awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a great neural palette. It&#x27;s one of the older offerings by coastal scents but is actually my favorite of all of their palettes that I own. The formula for these are is different from the different 88 color ones that are available. These are a little creamier and blend better. Also there are fewer colors but the pot sizes are comparable to MAC. There are even some colors in this palette that are close if not identical to some M.A.C. eye shadows. The difference is that one M.A.C. shadow costs you fourteen bucks and you can get 28 of these for nineteen! This palette is great for bridal parties. I recommend this palette highly. Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is by no means a professional quality product. Great for teens/tweens to play with, but I am not impressed at all by these shadows. The colors look very nice, but the texture of the shadows is inconsistent. They are chalky and do not blend well...at all; and some contain cheap glitter that falls down your face when applied. You would be better off investing in two or three high quality shadows because in this case, you do get what you pay for. I would say the new Wet &#x27;n Wild drugstore shadows are about the same quality as these.</li>
            <li> Price was great they shadows are very pigmented good quality. I use it with with eyeshadow primer to make it last all day. Colors are perfect for everyday use and for natural looks a must buy if you are just starting to use make up.</li>
            <li> I had heard about coastal scents prior to my purchase and from the reviews you would think this product was the HOLY GRAIL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT.. It is a HOLY FAIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product a while back from Coastal Scents not Amazon. Their customer service was very horrible. I emailed them my shipping address several times and the customer service representative snottily claimed they never received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did receive this product, I was HUGELY disappointed. The colors ARE NOT pigmented. They do not appear on your skin ESPECIALLY if you are of color. Forget about blending and some of the colors actually crumbled and popped off the palette. BOOOOO!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am wondering if Coastal Scents gave out incentives for these reviews because this product is definitely INFERIOR. My drug store eye shadow purchases were of better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for colors that don&#x27;t show on your skin, don&#x27;t blend, and crumble, then this is the product for you. Give this to your little girl to play dress up in, because you can NOT take this product seriously.</li>
            <li> This pallette is exactly what I was looking for. I use it everyday since I&#x27;ve received it and loveeee. Neutrals for the win. Good pigmentation and long lasting finish.</li>
            <li> This pallet is okay. Half of the shadows actually have pigment, and the other half are trash. Basically, expect to pay for 14 random shadows, because the other 14 aren&#x27;t going to show up on any skin tone. I&#x27;ve had better luck with dollar store pallets...</li>
            <li> I am pretty creative artistically and oftentimes I volunteer to do wedding/party makeovers for little extra cash tips. Coastal scents is my latest super discovery. I&#x27;ve purchased one item from them and after that I&#x27;ve found their main site where they run specials quite often. Bottom line, what a deal. Not only the colors are juicy and potent, but so many colors for this price... you can&#x27;t beat that. The quality is very good too. No point to waste your money at department store.</li>
            <li> I bought this 28Neutral Palette along with the Fall Festival Palette after being really impressed with Coastal Scents&#x27; GO Palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Go Palette was cheap but excellent quality, so I assumed all of their eye shadows would have nice pigmentation but this neutral palette was a little chalky and not so great. The colors on my lid turn out very light even with more than one application. It&#x27;s not bad when I want to go for a natural look..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price and variety of colors is very good but the quality just was not as good as I was expecting it to be. I am unimpressed and disappointed by this palette.</li>
            <li> I just received my Coastal Scents 28 Color Eyeshadow Paletter (Neutral)&lt;br /&gt;and I must say, im extremely satisfied! Every eyesshadow is intact, it was carefully/cautiously wrapped, and the Palette colors are beautiful! im about to try them right now lolz. I have just started shopping at Amazon.com &amp; im loving it &amp; I got my package quickly to so I not only recommend this Palette but also Amazon.com! u all r the best. Thank you so very much &amp; ill be shopping with you all 4ever;0) blessings to you all&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Okay but packaging was not clearly marked by name of company.will not order again</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite pallet ! There should be dark browns through</li>
            <li> I really like all the colors. This is hard to say when you get a palette with this many, but i enjoy this one. The colors are not too strong not too light, just right. It travels well because it is so thin.</li>
            <li> I love this , smells nice and last long. ..</li>
            <li> I love coastal Scents. They&#x27;re products are great. Perfect shades for everyday. Nice sized palette. Great for travel. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I usually have problems with eye makeup. Most eyeshadows will cause my eyes to tear up all day, which is not attractive, and then I give up wearing makeup at all after a few days. This eyeshadow set hasn&#x27;t given my eyes any problem at all, and I&#x27;m very sensitive. The other great thing about this set is that it&#x27;s mostly soft matte colors. There are 6 or 7 total with a bit of shimmer, but it&#x27;s very subtle. The colors are in the cooler range of plum, brown, and pinks. Very good for creating nice daytime looks suitable for the office. I&#x27;m also at the age where I was concerned with eyeshadow that might cake up in creases, but have not had any problem at all with this set. It lasts all day until I use makeup remover at night to take it off.</li>
            <li> Junk!!!!! Be AWARE .....COMING FROM CHINA AND RECEIVED WITH MOLD...:(</li>
            <li> I use this every day and I mention it a lot I&#x27;m my YouTube videos grate pigmentation I love it</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Not pigmented at all. You are better off with a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> This is a fake, the colours are very very chalky with very little pigment payoff. I own other palettes from coastal scents and they are of a far better quality than the trash I was sent. My God, coastal scents isn&#x27;t even a high end brand, I never expected to be conned. Don&#x27;t buy this palette, I would recommend going directly to the coastal scents website. This palette is total crap.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Not true to color.. all of the shadows have a white undertone! On dark skin it looks like you are wearing chalk on your eyes</li>
            <li> excellent shadows as on a photo, even it is better, the size of a circle of a paletka corresponds to a photo when you see such qualitative cosmetics, at once there is a wish to create)</li>
            <li> one of my favorite palettes of all time! and thats saying alot because i am quite the makeup junkie! use it everyday for nice toned down natural looks. love love love!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good set of neutrals that I could blend and this is perfect! I bought the concealer as well- which I am amazed at. I have spent hundreds of dollars to find the best for your buck- and this is undoubtedly it. Trust me the concealer has every tone possible. Go ahead an order. I have already told all my friends.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for my mom for christmas since she always wears more neutral eyeshadow. The eyeshadow is really pretty and nicely sized but the thing is really hard to open. I couldn&#x27;t figure it out and it takes my mom a while to open it. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d recommend it..</li>
            <li> This is a perfect palette for both avid beauty lovers and beginning makeup users. The colors are very flattering to every skin tone and the shadows are long wearing and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are okay. I feel like for the price, I can&#x27;t really complain though. The color payoff isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not horrible either. A lot of the colors almost seem to have a reddish undertone on the skin which I don&#x27;t really like. The colors look different in the pan but tbh on the skin they all just kind of blend together! Had this been anymore money I probably would have returned it, but it was worth checking out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use this palette! Great colors!</li>
            <li> I am a make-up artist that loves to try need make-up that is out in the world.  I decided on this and I am happy that I chose it.  The browns are great.  They hold to the eye lid all day without using a primer.  They have both shimmery and matte colors within this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately, this is a find.  If you are on the fence about it, I say go ahead and get these eyeshadows!!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this purchase I threw it away. I&#x27;m a grown woman and these colors were worse than the dress up make up little girls use.  Colors look fabulous in the case, but it has no richness or depth to it at all and colors faded or rubbed off and wouldn&#x27;t last from morning to the afternoon.  It was like putting baby powder colored with crushed chalk onto your eyelids.  The smoky black wouldn&#x27;t even stay on my eyes no matter how much I put on. Don&#x27;t buy this.  I normally buy Clinique or Loreal, MAC, Sephora, but wanted to compare this for myself.  You&#x27;re better off with name brands at retail stores like Loreal, Neutrogena, Cover Girl, or Mabelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it negative stars if I was allowed to.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet it came very quickly, very surprisingly being as it was being shipped from Hong Kong, the colors are beautiful, I bought this palett thinking it was costal Scents (that&#x27;s what it said the brand was) it just came in a matte black case in a large manila envelope no logo on the front of the pallet that disappointed me, one of the reasons I&#x27;m rating this as 3 stars the second thing I cannot stand is the smell of this eyeshadow pallet it smells terrible thirdly the packaging sucked I&#x27;m surprised the eyeshadows in the pallet didn&#x27;t break....I would definitely buy this pallet again I can get over the smell and packaging.</li>
            <li> Good quality !! It&#x27;s a perfect neutral palette. Colors are just beautiful and i recommend this palette !! Just like pictures. Good product !!</li>
            <li> I went back and forth between the coastal scents and the cheaper brands but I am so glad I got this one. The pigment is great and I love the colors. Totally worth buying. I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday but when I wear it I use these eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Amazing colors the pink in the picture looks shuttle but is not it It a bright pink but besides that it is an amazing palette</li>
            <li> Was better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. great colors for everyday use and enough colors for a great night look. It goes every where with me. no more single eyeshadows filling up my makeup box.</li>
            <li> I am sohappy with this purchase....GREAT Colors....Great Palette..Great application...Great packaging also. I regret not purchasing sooner and spending oodles of cash on other, brand-name, make-up!! The Fall pallette is also incredible..I am a true customer now...and in the future..Would HIGHLY suggest!! Tracey Baker</li>
            <li> I received this product was a cheap case , did not say coastal on the pallette, was very very unhappy with this product .</li>
            <li> Lots of choices. Goes on nicely</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my aunt. She&#x27;s just getting into makeup and she loved it.shes very happy overall</li>
            <li> I really like this palette! Colors are great, pigment is great, the colors stay on well! I gave it four stars because the shadow is a little powdery so you do experience some fall out &amp; some colors are similar to each other &amp; I would of liked a few more highlighting colors that are a little lighter as most are base &amp; crease colors. And the colors are not named which will sometimes throw me off because of the similar colors, I have to remember what color I just used! But regardless, you will have no problem creating a multi-dimensional look for your eyes! Can&#x27;t beat the price for what you get!</li>
            <li> Love coastal scents their pigments are amazing eyeshadow stays on long.. Honestly best eye shadows could easily replace expensive brands like Mac any day for the price</li>
            <li> This palette has weird colors in it. And most of the shades just don&#x27;t have a lot of pigment in them, though some are better than others.  I guess you should expect that for the low price. I like a few of the shades and use them fairly regularly, but on the whole, they just don&#x27;t blend well. Also, when this arrived, one of the colors had broken, but luckily it was one I wouldn&#x27;t use anyway.</li>
            <li> This palette could use some more pigmentation... This palette has great colors, but they don&#x27;t really show up well on skin. I think that they need some pigmentation. I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the fact that the palette I received had no labels or anything. It doesn&#x27;t even say coastal scents on it lol. That was a huge disappointment but the eyeshadows worked pretty well so I&#x27;m won&#x27;t complain too much. The eyeshadows are not too pigmented, as say compared to my urban decay or too faced shadows but with a little eye primer they are not too bad. And they do last a fairly decent time on the lids.</li>
            <li> The shades came in broken. Also they were very small.</li>
            <li> I live hundreds of miles and doubted my sister arrives in good condition but was very surprised by the care, timeliness and quality.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> came quick i love the colors, they blend well and are easy to use i will def get this palette again even recomend it :D</li>
            <li> The pan sizes are a little bit small, but the quality is compared to huge high end makeup brands. Nobody could ever get dissapointed by the size, so it has a wide range of colors that if you were to purchase them separatelly, it would cost a lot.</li>
            <li> most of the colors are really good some of them are really chalky and don&#x27;t have any pigment. Over all I use it often and feel it was worth the price. The bright pink color will stain your lids.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t recommend this product... it is very low quality... difficult to blend ...scent s the worst..  but i have no complains... it is more better to add some money and buy more qualitative eyeshadows...</li>
            <li> The colors are really dull. I find that I have to use a lot just to get it to show up. My drugstore cheapo eye shadows have served me much better.</li>
            <li> love this but this is not coastsl scents.</li>
            <li> This is the best matte, neutral, natural palette I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m a make-up junkie, and it&#x27;s really hard to find non-shimmery, flattering colors that actually last and blend well. These are amazing. I&#x27;m a blue eyed, redheaded, pale white girl, and I can use all of the shades in this palette without looking like a drag queen or a transplant from the 80s. (That is amazing for a palette. Most of the time I end up with odd shades of blue and green that will never be used. Not in this case!)</li>
            <li> Wonderful palette that matches exactly what the product description described. No hassles purchasing and it got here quick. Definitely going to try other color palette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeshadow. Goes on with nice color, doesn&#x27;t fade and is just gorgeous. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better palette!</li>
            <li> perfect. 100 % recommended . all in perfect condition .</li>
            <li> This is my personal experience I love it the colors are amazing and apply just as they appear on the pallette beautiful colors I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downfall for me is theirs to many colors with glitter or what ever that sparkle stuff is me I like a clean matte look.</li>
            <li> The pigment in this neutral palette is great! I love a neutral face for my everyday look, this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> At age 51 I didn&#x27;t think I would really like these colors so much, especially since they are not all 100% matte. However, I find myself using 90% of the shades and therefore a very good value. The pigment of the shadows is as other reviewers testify, very substantial, not like most drug store pallettes that are mostly filler rather than true pigment. Looking at the pallette as pictured, my favorites are found on the last 3 verticle rows., especially the deep purple and browns on the far right vertical row. I use the purple on my lid and the light brown next to it on my upper lid. My eyes are green and so the purple looks fabulous with them. I apply these dry over Revlon&#x27;s Color-Stay highlighter. I don&#x27;t use this product for highlighting, but because it is the MOST excellent product for eye shadow base...I have used all the eye shadow bases and none works better than this...which contributes to the great color I get from my Costal Scents 28 neutral color pallette. You should always use a base for your shadows. Revlon&#x27;s Color-Stay products are awesome in this regard and are half the price on Amazon as they are in the drug stores. Don&#x27;t judge any eyeshadow pallette until you use it over a shadow base. Anyone who is not happy with this product is probably not using a shadow base or similar product.</li>
            <li> I like the hues. However,  I&#x27;m accustomed to using Victoria secret shadows. While they aren&#x27;t top of the line either, their colors are more vibrant. This set is great for work/everyday looks though.</li>
            <li> The palette is certainly useful but I was looking more for matte shades. These shades have shimmer and are not flat like I was hoping for. Stila &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34; palette is a great matte palette option while this is still handy for neutral shades.</li>
            <li> I love this, and plan on getting a few more, as long as they are new, and untouched.  This is my first pallatte, so I like it for what I&#x27;m trying to get done.</li>
            <li> I use this palette everyday for work. I use almost every single color in the palatte, which is not something I can usually say for other palettes I&#x27;ve bought. My only complaint is that middle bottom circle got damaged pretty quickly from opening the palette (darn, it was one of my favorite colors too) Maybe a bit of thought into a better design would help. Otherwise, love it!</li>
            <li> Product as described and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Love love this palette. Great dupe for pricy eyeshadows. Great variety of colors</li>
            <li> I love these shadows.  They are smooth and creamy and have great color payoff.  I was very excited at how little fallout I experienced and I love the staying power.  I would highly recommend these shadows.</li>
            <li> Bought this palette because I am almost fifty and have read that matte eyeshadow is best , also neutral colors. This is a nice selection of colors for a good price. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The quality of these shadows are okay, could be much better, but I&#x27;ve seen worse. They can definitely be worked with to get started with makeup and get experimental and familiar with color placement for beginners. I would not recommend this palette to those who have a makeup collection with higher quality makeup because it will be a waste and wouldn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this palette but I had to give it 3 stars due to the fact that almost all of these shades have an orang/red pigment to them they go on well but don&#x27;t last all day do you def need a good primer before applying.. Other then that I like to use the link shadow as a blush and the dark brown serves well as a great black and the browns can be used to bronze or contoure so I&#x27;m working with it!!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible like it is expired. I will be returning to Amazon, and reordering directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great products and price.</li>
            <li> Some colors are stronger than others, but the options are awesome &amp; they show up really well. Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks to be delivered and it was the wrong palette. Not coastal scents at all.It is useless as the colors have no pigmentation to speak of. I feel completely ripped off. This is the first item ever from Amazon that I have been dissatisfied with after years of shopping. I have bought everything from large furniture items to exercise equipment and everything in between from Amazon but I am definitely not coming back for makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. The colors are very blendable and are matte. Highly reccomend it</li>
            <li> I love the colors they are great! but once you try to apply they all come out like a grey undertone to your eyelid. its very difficult to blend and the colors aren&#x27;t really true to the shade. once applied the colors are bland and dull. it might be good for someone starting out in makeup. If you want something that actually blends very well. this is definitely not the product.</li>
            <li> I had purchased both the Coastal Scents and the BH Neutral Palette. However, I found that the Coastal Scents was more pigmented. I gave it 4 stars because the light highlight colors are not as pigmented as the darker shades. Overall, the palette is worth the price. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> These colors are nice, natural and good for everyday use.  I have a very light skin tone and some blend in well with my skin. I had hoped they would be more pigmented than they actually are.  I most likely won&#x27;t order this brand again and go with a brand that has more opaque colors.</li>
            <li> the product has a strong smell &amp; it was not the brand offered, aside from that, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Amazing colors and go on like a gem, very silky and smooth. Do not irritate the eyes at all and would highly recommend. Colors are vibrant and glamorous nice palette for natural to smoky look!</li>
            <li> Great selection and just what my daughter wanted.  Nice variety of colors and comes in a nice package as well</li>
            <li> WOW. Just an amazing product! First off, please DO NOT buy the knockoffs. I tried and they smell like acrylic paints and I could NOT even put on my eyes because I didn&#x27;t want to get an infection! The palette has AMAZING neutrals and only a few are sparkly, most are matte, which I ADORE. The colors stay on all day and barely crease. GET THIS PALETTE ladies and gents!</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette as a gift..my sister loves it..a great neutral palette for the eyes..the colors are blendable as well..great buy..</li>
            <li> I am a big eye shadow person. My makeup routine is not complete without some FABULOUS makeup on my eye-lids. I love the Coastal Scents 28 Color Eye shadow palette because the colors go well with my complexion. As a brown girl, I can do my everyday makeup with these subtle, yet bold shades. Most of the colors are also great for an eye shadow base as well. I never go anywhere without my Coastal Scents eye-shadow palette because I can never go wrong with it. It is also AFFORDABLE. User for life!</li>
            <li> This palette isn&#x27;t very pigmented and the lighter colors are very chalky. The white eye shadow has a green sparkle to it. The colors are also very hard to blend. You could easily end up with muddy eye shadows. If you do buy this palette, be prepared to pack on the color.</li>
            <li> I origionally bought the 88 color palette and I noticed that I was using the same colors for my everyday look. I recieved this palette and there are a couple of things I love about it...first I have very sensitive skin and it does not irratate it! Second the colors blend nice and third the colors can work on all skin tones. I would recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and mix of matte/sparkle.</li>
            <li> I just love these colors!&lt;br /&gt;They look really good on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use some of the colors to my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good makeup product.</li>
            <li> This is my main eyeshadow palette. It is fabulous for crease/brow bone colors- the ones I use most often are the colors in the last two rows. Also, I dampen my eyeshadow brush with some NYX setting spray first to help minimize fallout. Whenever I want a pop of color on the lid, I use either the Coastal Scents Metal Mania palette (teal used in the picture shown) or one of my ColourPop eyeshadows. Either way, this is a super affordable way to play with eyeshadow looks.</li>
            <li> The pallet is very nice for the price. The colors are fairly pigmented but if you prefer high intensity colors I&#x27;m not so sure. I&#x27;m a medium brown skin black female and it looks great on me.</li>
            <li> A lot of great colors. Wears well</li>
            <li> I have never had MAC products because I refuse to spend that much on makeup.  I love this pallette because I NEVER wear color eye shadow..im always blending neutral colors with white highlight.  I would recommend some type of eye primer so the eye shadow sticks better because it tends to fake somewhat fast.  Nice product though, cant beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Pallet is nice. The colors are pretty pigmented, although some of them run together without distinction.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of shadows and the pigment is great. NO theyre NOT Mac eyeshadows, but you&#x27;re paying the price of one and getting a bunch! I love this pallet and will buy more.</li>
            <li> excelente producto!!!</li>
            <li> Colors show up nicely</li>
            <li> Colors are not as pigmented.</li>
            <li> Product has an awful smell...</li>
            <li> The colors were what I was looking for.  They blend easily, are nicely pigmented, and are quite smooth in their application, however, the colors don&#x27;t have as much staying power as I would like.  Hopefully, with the help of a primer, the colors will have better staying power.  Nonetheless, I would purchase this product again.  Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to order this palette twice before, and was sent the blush palette both times. It was an easy return and was actually a warehouse problem and I got a full refund. Once it was available again, I went ahead and re-ordered and boy am I glad I did! I&#x27;ve had the palette for about three days and I am absolutely in love with it! the mattes are absolutely perfect for an everyday look. If you order this palette, I highly doubt you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The only eyeshadow palette you&#x27;ll ever need. Awesome. Long lasting, subtle, blends well and stays on all day. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a fast turnaround time, received item in excellent time.  The colors are interesting, but there are a number of them that are frost/ shiny, which I do not use; hoped there would not be too many frost/shiny, oh well.  There are also not any real good browns in any sense in the lot, so I have to use other shadows for ranging through the light, med, dark brownish tones I need as a staple for my colors.  These are more toward a burgundy-ish hues on one scheme and the other scheme is more of a orange-y tan rather than a neutral scheme as I had hoped for.  I do use an eyeshadow base, and these eyeshadows are not much more pigmented than other eyeshadows.  One can be too heavy handed with any eyeshadow on top of eyeshadow base, must use a light hand applying eyeshadow on eyeshadow base.  Ben Nye eyeshadows are VERY pigmented, but that is a theatrical line designed for stage and film.  Nevertheless, I will add this eyeshadow palette to my other eyeshadows and customize my finished look as my wardrobe and seasons change OK.</li>
            <li> I was worried that a few eyeshadows would be broken by the time they reached me, but the packaging was amazing and not even one was broken. The pigment of the colors are great, especially for the price. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> After reading such wonderful reviews and lusting over this palette via Internet.... I can honestly say that I am very disappointed in this palette. Its just mediocre. 1 to 10.. I would rate it a 5. If you know anything about make up.. you will notice right off the bat that this is not the best quality. Its nothing special and while it is a decent price, I would suggest saving your money and investing in the Naked palette from Urban Decay or even a Nyx palette. I prefer Nyx over Coastal Scents. There are too many shades that are close in color and I honestly don&#x27;t think the pigmentation is anything to rave about. Yeah you get 28 colors but only a handful actually show up on your skin... I will probably give this palette away... or toss it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love coastal scents products, &amp; I love the fact that they are very affordable! I am a forever customer! :)</li>
            <li> I am in love with this set! Very pigmented and I honestly can compare it to MAC makeup at a fraction of the price. Shipped on time and arrived on time. Packed very well, in bubble wrap, nothing broke. Love.. love.. love!</li>
            <li> The colors of this set are beautiful, however the quality of the make up is sub par.   Not worth buying. Pigmentation is poor.</li>
            <li> This palette is absolutely awesome!  If you love the neutrals, this one is for you!  I have purchased several as gifts for the holidays and, of course, one for myself, too!  It is really beautiful!</li>
            <li> Its a good eye shadow pallete color should be more pigmented but there not...Its an okay purchase...maybe would buy something else</li>
            <li> i like this palette..&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and have no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first palette(second one, because first is in the trash now.. bad-quality) and if you try to find somethin and  you i&#x27;ve never bought palette before, than you can be sure you will like this one..</li>
            <li> I love this palette. Definitely one of my favorite neutral palettes because it comes with a variety of matte and shimmer colors. But mostly matte which I use the most. Highly recommend for those who are looking for matte neutral colors with good pigments.</li>
            <li> OMG, NitraaB on youtube raves about this pallet all the time on her channel, I finally broke down and bought it and I love it! colors are very pigmented and have lots of staying power even with my greasy lids. I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my package; i got it right on the date estimated. However, the palette was damaged; one of the eye shadows was broken :(. I kept my palette because i had an event the next day and it arrived a day before. Therefore, no time for returns or refunds, so i kept it. Plus i figured one broken eye shadow is not that big of a deal for the price I got it. Now material wise, let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s GREAT! I wear everything from MAC, Dior, and urban Decay and so on, but as you know their very expensive, so i wanted to try something less $$ but that would deliver the same. And so far, I LOVE IT!! Comes on smoothly and blends great with other colors. The pigments are great!! It&#x27;s a perfect day/night wear. I have been using the palette ever since it arrived. The only downside was that the product was broken. Other than that i recommend, but there&#x27;s a chance of the product arriving damaged. Don&#x27;t really understand how it happened the product was perfectly wrapped all around. However, looking forward to buy more! ;)</li>
            <li> Makeup was intact. Colors are not very pigmented at all, some u can&#x27;t even tell you swatched a color..</li>
            <li> creamy pigmented beautiful! i am a freelance MUA and this palette is wonderful! it is almost identical to BH cosmetics actually and i love them too!</li>
            <li> did not like the quality of the makeup at all. Do not waste your money&lt;br /&gt;not a great buy at all.</li>
            <li> This is a knock-off. The cover doesn&#x27;t even say that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;costal scents&amp;#34;. If you watch tutorials on youtube you would know that on the cover it says costal scents.  I had high expectations for this palette, but yes half of the colors seem very cheap and not as pigmented as the real one would, very disappointing. Never buying make-up off of amazon again, had this same problem with another product. If you want the real costal scents, go buy from their website.  Maybe before they actually sent the real one from here that;s why the reviews are so good? who know.</li>
            <li> The pic is kinda deceiving because majority of the palate It light shades... I wish there were more warmer shades.. I find my self only uses about 4-5 shades from the palate.. Quality is nice.</li>
            <li> I have a coastal scents pallette and I love it so I ordered this one thinking it would be the same. It&#x27;s definitely a ripe off and NOT coastal scents. The colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented at all. Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not really useing it but great quality just dont really know how to do my make up great service look forward to using this product</li>
            <li> Colors look true to the picture and come out nicely. Most of them are pigmented, but the black at the corner of the palette doesn&#x27;t come out how it looks in the pan. Comes off very light, or grayish. You can barely see it...or have to keep building it up. That&#x27;s the only color I was disappointed with. Otherwise, great! I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as I would want it to be and not enough dark colours. However for the price you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> it a really good product!!! really nice colors!!!&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t try them already but they seem really good!!!&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this is a beautiful palette! every women that love using eyeshadow should own this palette or even something similar. I love these eyeshadows because they are so natural and can be used almost everyday to give a subtle but sexy look. it creates great smoky eyes and toned down looks for work or even a simple run to the grocery store. I must say though, that these colors will only look nice &amp; noticible if you know how to blend and mix colors.The colors are very light so primer or a base is the best way to go when using even if your skin tone is dark or light. Some of the colors need to be packed on but I recommend for the best look; give time, patience and technique when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only REAL problem with this 28 Neutral Palette is that these \\&quot;colors are not labeled\\&quot;! That was annoying to me because I didn&#x27;t know what was what except for the obvious. It would be really great if the Co.  would put the colors on the back of the packaging and label them with names, kind of like how you get a box of chocolate and it tells you what filing is inside each. Otherwise, this 28 Neutral palette is worth the price, it came very quickly and even better it was packaged carefully so not one shadow was disturbed ;). Go for it!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. IT IS A FAKE</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with This product! The colors are awesome and they last all day!</li>
            <li> The colors are well enough but the product is chalky. I hardly ever use it because it does not last long.</li>
            <li> i really love all the colors and they are really pigmented and look really good on the eye! Worth the Money</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this palette as it had so many wearable colors. The colors looked good in the palette but they are not pigmented at all. The formula for the lighter colours are chalky. They&#x27;re like flour when applied to the skin, and does not stay put. The other colors were not chalky however, but they were so tightly pressed that it was even difficult to get the product out with my fingers. If you wanna create a neutral look with this palette, it would be a very subtle look. Don&#x27;t expect a lot of pigmentation from this. I have pale pale porcelain skin and this does not work for me. I have to literally stab my brush vertically into the pots 10 times to get the amount of color i need! I do not recommend this product...considering that the cost for shipping to where I live is just way too much. Don&#x27;t bother shipping across the globe just to try these out..the price is not worth it. Dead honest words...</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation a vsriety of colors to play with and b creative do a suttle smokey eye or a natural barley there look to a more dramstic night out look i love this pallete colors r very easy to blend ,apply and hold time is amazeing deffinetly outlasts ur day no fadeing or creaseing wonderful product at a eonderful price :):):)</li>
            <li> Its still a great neutral palette... Usually comes with a logo in front but these for some reason don&#x27;t have it...</li>
            <li> These colors are great neutrals, more mattes than shimmery which is nice and they wear nicely all day.</li>
            <li> i use it with eye primer , the color is pigment,and  awesome ,matt and natural</li>
            <li> this is a good neutral starter palette for those who are just getting into makeup. I use it occasionally  but its good for everyday. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, mine has a eyeshadow that always falls out on me every time I open it, its very annoying.</li>
            <li> Perfect for anytime, traveling, great price, nice container, nice color palette. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This palette is awesome any color I need it is in this kit. I will purchase other colors from this vendor.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice range of color and can be mixed and blended with all skin tones/eye colors.  This is my second coastal scents purchase (the other was contour kit) and am super happy with both. Will order more products.</li>
            <li> NICE NEUTRAL COLORS, I USE IT SOMETIMES IN THE CORNERS OF MY EYES. ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND WAS NICELY PACKAGED. YEA.</li>
            <li> Its amazing  the colors are beautiful</li>
            <li> Buyer beware!  Confirmed as counterfeit by Coastal Scents. They did finally issue me a refund, but only after a lot of resistance and silly excuses. And for not quite the full purchase amount. What a crew...</li>
            <li> This is not a coastal scents product I was quite dissapointed I wasted money on what I thought I bought. There is no pigmentation as this is a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> I loved this palette so much I purchased one for my mom and sister at Christmas. You can&#x27;t beat the price and this palette has more usable colors than any other palette I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I love this but the shadows practically jumped out of the black case! I lost more of them to the floor then I used! But other then that, love every color, and I loved all of pigments!</li>
            <li> Love this pallet! I had the original revealed pallets and it was getting old (lasted a year) and i was running out. So I wanted this. Such good quality and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> There are 2 or 3 colors that I&#x27;d had trouble locating in stores. Most of the colors are not usable for one person. The richness/density of color is not all that, in my opinion, but it&#x27;s alright with a primer of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would make one that&#x27;s all cool colors, which is what I need.</li>
            <li> The Coastal Scents 28 Color Eyeshadow bought for my niece and she likes the color Pallete. The neutral colors are nice</li>
            <li> The colors are great, some color are like a chalk, you need much produt to work, and during  transportation one of color was broken</li>
            <li> Such a great selection of colors. The shadows stay on nicely</li>
            <li> Love, colors are very well pigmented and blend great.. would totally recommend...</li>
            <li> I cant put into words how much I love Coastal scents, ever since I heard about this makeup on YouTube I have been a true Fan! I love the neutral pallet. It has everything to give you a everyday look and more, this is the 6th pallet I have bought from them and it just keeps getting better. The makeup blends well,colors are vibrant and it stays on the brush instead of falling down your face lol. I highly recommend this pallet!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product, it has more fallout than MAC but nothing excessive. As with most palettes you won&#x27;t use all the colors - I&#x27;ve used about half, though at $20 I&#x27;m not complaining. I am fair skinned and the colors show up very well on me.  They blend well and go on smoothly. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are particularly vibrant but as a neutral palette I wasn&#x27;t looking for that. It is great for everyday wear and has allowed me to play around with colors I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased separately. I&#x27;d buy it again and have recommended it to a friend.</li>
            <li> There are lots of different colors in this palette, but be prepared to layer them on really thickly. The quality of pigment is low, and takes a lot of application to get a true-to-color result.</li>
            <li> Ok, i love coastal scents products, so, i&#x27;ve order this.. And i&#x27;m very dissapointed.. I&#x27;m a professional make up, and for the price i&#x27;ve spend in this, let me say that i don&#x27;t think it deserves, first of all it has only 28 colors, and they&#x27;re NOT pigmented at all, and i tried this with many primers, and also foundation.. So.. But i like the colors.. I really try to like this palette, but every time I use i get more dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> Very greats pallete loved the shades in it very neutral which is trendy and affordable</li>
            <li> All the colors are not so pigmented like the first row is not but the rest colors are so pigmented</li>
            <li> These are not a high end makeup product so don&#x27;t expect it to be so. That being said, if you are on a makeup budget these are the way to go! Very pigmented and last all day with a primer. These far exceed many drugstore brands. The colors are also magnificent. I am very pleased with this product. I have since bought more pallets and even brushes by coastal scents and am beyond please with those products.</li>
            <li> Ladies with pale skin beware, some of these colors will appear a little orange-y, even a few that don&#x27;t seem like they should be orange-y. Thankfully there is a very nice off-white with a hint of minty green to it that helps to neutralize those colors. I would say these are better quality than most drugstore brands but not as good as mac. It&#x27;s a good neutral palette for daily use. So many color options! They all go together so well that you can just sweep a pale color over your lid, a medium color in the crease, and use a mixing medium on a liner brush on the upper lash line with one of the darker colors for a perfect daytime smokey eye. I was surprised by a few colors: the peach one has flecks of gold, the white is very opalescent and reflects different colors, the black has very fine pinky-brown flecks in it, and the one in the upper right corner is my new favorite eyeshadow...warm brown with flecks of rose.</li>
            <li> picture does not really show the colors as they truly are but still a good little palette for the money.</li>
            <li> Came all broken up and couldn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago, and only one of the colors is gone.  Great colors, goes on nicely, and LASTS!  Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Iv tried ceap brands and iv had better color pay off.but id say save your money and buy something worth buying.maybe, this is a fake idk but I used urban decay primer potion with this on my nw20 skin pretty pale and had the worst color pay off more like a blotchy wash of color.</li>
            <li> The packaging is the first sign that I knew it was a fake because it doesn&#x27;t have that Comic Sans font. Also when i went to swatch it the shadows were chalky, the color payoff was poor, and the sparkles were chunky. I then went to YouTube in hopes that I was wrong but everyone else that had the palette but sadly my accusation was correct. This palette was not at all what i had expected and I will be returning this. Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really great assortment of browns and nudes. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a similar product within this prize range.</li>
            <li> Being a cosmetologist, I look for exceptional quality and I am telling you this stuff is like the brands you pay for at the cosmetic counters, and really goes on like MAC!!!!  I think MAC uses this manufacturer.  Also, you do not get so much that you will never use it and love the color combinations they offer.  Try just one, believ me you will never buy name brand again, like Estee Lauder, Mac etc...  The only one that I think is better is the Chanel line, but then again, it is Chanel!  LOL</li>
            <li> Great beginner pallet. Great warm neutrals. Very pigmented. Very good everyday pallet.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors on this palette, ever since I got them I use them for my everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> saw many reviews &amp; decided to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comes in a sleek palette. luckily none of the shadows were shattered.&lt;br /&gt;eyeshadows come in several different finishes. some more pigmented than others.&lt;br /&gt;easily capable of creating a variety of different neutral looks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Looks fake version of coastel scents, colors a lil off but bad pigmented i swatched darkest color and it bearly shows ill be returning 2 👎👎</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t discount coastal scents eyeshadows!!! A lot of MAC dupes are in this palette! Extremely pigmented, buttery and blendable eye shadows. Use this every day!</li>
            <li> This colors are great! I would buy this pallet again. They are true to color, and they last all day.</li>
            <li> Came quickly which was nice. However, there is no proof on the packaging or pallet that this is from Coastal Scents. The pallet is a cheaper plastic and reminds me of something I could buy in Icing. The eyeshadows are much lighter on the skin and take a long time to build up their color, also they are very dry. They do the job and it was a good price but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying again. Go splurge on a good expensive eyeshadow palette elsewhere.</li>
            <li> For the most part its fairly okay. I think a few of the brown colors are like dust not much pigment in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I got a dud. I have a coastal scents blush palette and its awesome! I have received samples of cs eyeshadows that were awesome! But while I truly love the colors in this palette they are dry and I have to apply several layers for any color to show, and that is when using urban decay eden primer potion!</li>
            <li> I read so much about this on you tube. Purchased it for my sister for Christmas. She fell in love instantly.</li>
            <li> I got mine really quick but when I opened the package two of the shadows were broken and had gotten all over the palette. I guess they could have written &amp;#34;fragile&amp;#34; on the package but whatever. I like the product since I am on a budget. Some colors are great and some aren&#x27;t so pigmented. I think if I didn&#x27;t get mine broken I would like it more.</li>
            <li> I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it.  It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> These are the best eyeshadows I&#x27;ve ever used, this beats my lorac and urban decay shadows any day. The colors are gorgeous and vibrant, and blend beautifully. I always held out from buying this because it&#x27;s so cheap compared to other brands, but now I regret not getting this sooner. I love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this.....I really did. The colors looked great but that&#x27;s about it. I tried every single color on my skin so I did give them a try. They come out very chalky and cheap. For better cheap makeup try nyx....even elf is better quality.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought, but this palette gives all it says it will. I use it everyday! The colours are matte and natural looking and I often mix them to see what I can come up with. Affordable and right on the mark :)</li>
            <li> I got this pallette because of the price range as well as being a previous customer of coastal scents. The pigmentation on the shimmery shadows  is very good  but the matte ones come off as chalky or too powdery&lt;br /&gt;. I will say that using a primer or a concealer or eye base will help with pigmentation issues for this pallette, as well as building the color to the desired shade and consistency.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I got this pallette because of the warm browns and neutral tones. These are good for simple looks, weddings, and fall colors. That&#x27;s just how I would use them. Price is good and it delivered quickly which amazon has always been awesome with.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and it&#x27;s totally beautiful! I&#x27;ve seen a lot of feedbacks from Youtubers about this palette so I gave it a try and I have no regrets. When I got it, the palette was beautifully and safely wrapped. No broken pieces or anything so that&#x27;s really good. The colours gives a real natural look for everyday use and you can even use it as a smokey eye makeup for late night-outs. I&#x27;m not a very big fan of bright colours when it comes to make-up, so I usually stick with neutral shades. If you are the similar, YOU CAN&#x27;T MISS THIS! It&#x27;s a total MUST to have.</li>
            <li> The colors and texture of the eye shadow is top-notch.  I am so pleased with this purchase.  There are so many colors that I find useful.  Great price, too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very pigmented but that was why I bought it, for very natural looking makeup. if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then go ahead and buy it, otherwise no.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors but the pigmentation and color pay off is somewhat lacking. I think I was expecting too much. :/ kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Super pigmented.  I used this almost every day</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition and love the colors. Plus they last all day!! Will be buying another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Recieved my palette and honestly I was looking for a palette with light warm colors. And when i opened it to see the eyeshadows the light colors in the left side were actually a heavy grry color.. I will use it but the colors in the picture are misleading.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows aren&#x27;t matte. They have a little shimmer and that&#x27;s annoying! I thought they were going to be matte. They are also very chalky.</li>
            <li> Glides on , lovely nude pallet it was suggested  that as I get older I should use matte eyeshadows with out the glittery shiny as it doesn&#x27;t look as nice on my 58 yr old eyes. Well these are all matte and beautiful. I just got it so give me some time to play with it and I&#x27;ll give a more complete review.</li>
            <li> I do not write reviews at all, but I have to say I AM IN LOVE!!!!!!!!!! This is the perfect eyeshadow palette ever!! I cannot wait to start using it! The colors are super pigmented and they are all just soooooooo beautiful. The packaging was great. Nothing was broken! I definitely recommend this pallets if you want create that flawless everyday eye look ;)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful eyeshadow palette. The majority of the shadows are matte, some are shimmery, none are too glittery. On my computer monitor, many of the colors appeared pinkish, but I&#x27;m happy to say that most of the colors are more neutral to yellow, which suits my coloring much better. I was nervous that the shadows might arrive all broken up, but it arrived in perfect condition. I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another now, just in case the company stops making this particular palette.</li>
            <li> Works really well, especially for the price. Stays on well. I like the neutral colors but I can also mix it up a little with the variety given. Better than anything else you&#x27;d find anywhere close to the price. It&#x27;s hard to compare anything to mac eyeshadow, but these come close and cost so much less.</li>
            <li> Colors were not exact to the photo shown.</li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item. it was well organized and well wrapped. the colors were as displayed in the picture on the website. i also like the wide variety of colors this palette provides. i recommend it for all make up lovers who want a cheap make up.</li>
            <li> The lighter colors are very similar and powdery. But the darker colors are nice and pigmented. Awesome for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this product colors are beautiful and natural and I sure don&#x27;t regret buying it.!! I will def look into more sales from this user THANKYOUU.!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t don&#x27;t buy this it&#x27;s better to pay more and purchase naked or Lorac pallets than this cheap Chinese made product. To not ever safe your money on your own pallets :)) I bought it for a gift though :)</li>
            <li> I like these shades. I received this palette today. To me the colors were like what I saw on the computer screen. I put on some of shadows as soon as I got it. Was very surprised with the pigment and staying power. I did have on a primer on .I would recommend these to those whom are just starting out. I might purchase something else later. Iam going to give these to my niece. talk with you later. I have more reviews.</li>
            <li> What can I say! These are my Favorite neutral eyeshadow pallete better than any Ive bought at target. I use this On my clients and myself each time. Love them and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It arrived well-packaged. All shades were intact. The eyeshadows themselves&lt;br /&gt;are decent, nothing to write home about. The case itself seemed a bit more&lt;br /&gt;flimsy than the concealer palette I have purchased from this brand - the concealer&lt;br /&gt;is of a good consistency but wish they had some more gold undertones.</li>
            <li> smaller than I​ expected.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of beautiful colors here and this is a very good value. However, if you plan to de-pot these shadows and put them into smaller compacts for portability, don&#x27;t bother. This palette is VERY difficult to de-pot. Incredibly strong glue and flimsy pans. I broke more than half of the colors trying to get them out. If you want more flexibility with how you organize your colors, you are better off getting one of the palette sets that comes in the magnetic palette and/or purchasing the Hot Pots individually.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Exactly what I wanted. Excited to try the colors out. Mahalo!</li>
            <li> I love this colours, The quality is normal, and colours not very bright, with other bright palette you can make perfect make up</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows are a bit powdery, other than that, it&#x27;s a great product! Love all of the neutral colors</li>
            <li> Awesome colors and coverage.  I&#x27;ve found that most eyeshadows have way too much shimmer in them for me or they&#x27;re too chaulky.  These colors are true and smooth, blend exceptionally well and are very pigmented so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  I have sensitive eyes and skin and these eyeshadows do not bother my allergies at all.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I love neutral eye shadow so I&#x27;m in love! The only thing I kind of dislike is the bit of shimmery that it has, But other than that I love this palette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Eli</li>
            <li> I was initially very excited to receive this palette as I really enjoy matte neutrals. The product arrived in 2 days with prime shipping, and seemed to be packaged very securely, seemed being the keyword. I unraveled the bubble wrap and noticed the palette&#x27;s outer box was very very dusted with eye shadow. I opened up the palette to find it absolutely destroyed, the pans were scattered everywhere, multiple eye shadows were smashed to bits, one was missing, one looked like some of my well used eye shadows that have hit the bottom of the pan. I also noticed that the colours in the picture do not match the eye shadows in real life. They have very poor pigmentation, the darkest one barely showed up on my finger when I TRIED to swatch it through the layers of dust and chunks. I&#x27;m very disappointed and have already packaged it to return. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with a coastal scents palette before, but I will not be attempting to order them through amazon again. I do hope I&#x27;m the only one to have this problem but I&#x27;d like to warn others of this potential situation.</li>
            <li> I wanted a neutral pallet and this was just the perfect option. The product arrived on time, the packaging was flawless. The colors are pigmented for a few hours however I would suggest applying a primer prior to application.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product !</li>
