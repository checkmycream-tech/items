            <li> not for everyone. Just for me.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> order received successfully</li>
            <li> We have received the item on time and the user is satisfied with the product.Thanks.</li>
            <li> in love with this, smell so good</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go, either on my job, grocery store, etc., I get a lot of compliments about the aroma of my cologne. I am a single man so it is important to look and smell good for all the beautiful women. This is my second time using 212 Men and I love it. I will definitely continue to order this great cologne.</li>
            <li> The product is simply wonderful. We liked it and we can recommend it to the people we know have similar taste.</li>
            <li> Excellent product just as exexcellent product just as expected, order just what I wanted product quality and originality ..pected, just what we wanted to order product quality and originality ..</li>
            <li> This cologne is probably the best smelling Cologne available....still.  It smells similar to jean Paul Gautier&#x27;s cologne in the blue bottle shaped that&#x27;s in the shape of a torso. However THIS one smells even sweeter...more addicting!!! Also, the scent lasts all day long!!!</li>
            <li> Its about simplicity and class. The scent is neither too strong nor mild,its just perfect for all times,sunny days or nights.Pure quality with welcoming aroma making everyone feels good around you.I have tried lots of perfumes,but I can confidently say Nothing comes without a doubt like the 212. I Love it and I wish most men and women will try it,and also be ready for lots and lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s was very nice and feels nice, it was fast and I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> came as described. totally happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> 212 most be the number of angels tears took to weep for the beauty of the scent. It should be called magnet. A delicous aroma that baths the senses of the &amp;#34;fairer&amp;#34; sex. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> One spray just to see how it goes.. Smells real nice.. I like it. Its refreshing.. I wonder what two sprays would be ...</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> Great product but a little small.</li>
            <li> good product, responsible company</li>
            <li> I dont usually wear cologne but my wife made me get this and it smells wicked. Came at a good price.</li>
            <li> The ladies love it ,,thanks</li>
            <li> It seems to be genuine fragrance but not lost long enough. The one I tried in Sephora at JCPenny....was very very last long. I could smell it from my watch strap even after 2 weeks. but this one goes away in 4-5 hrs.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant aroma. I use it constantly. Very good buy for a fair price.</li>
            <li> I have no negatives about this fragrance. It smells absolutely wonderful, sophisticated but fresh enough to wear everyday. The longevity gets a good six hours on my skin and stays fresh. It&#x27;s also light so you can bathe in it but I wouldn&#x27;t do that unless you&#x27;re ready to keep buying it. The sprayer is very generous and it&#x27;s easy to get carried away.</li>
