            <li>, I am in love with it!</li>
            <li>Nice smell - love Pureology products!</li>
            <li>Whoever is selling it needs to tidy up the listing as in one area</li>
            <li>This product is the BEST on the market and really does work.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best smoothing creme/serum I have ever used.</li>
            <li>i am not one to delude myself into thinking something works if it doesn&#x27;t have a very marked affect, and this product has given my hair the thing i was looking for, which is protection, mostly, from heat, and makes my hair look and feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>Super smooth cream is excellent to use whe  blow drying your hair, it leave the hair smooth, shinny and bouncy</li>

            <li>I love Pureology for its eco-friendly ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would make it easier to dry/straighten my hair, and leave it looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I read the questions and answers to make sure it was a tube as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li>Just another product to put in the closet along with the others I&#x27;ve tried since TIGI discontinued my favorite product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I figured, why not; one more to try!!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Can be used on dry hair or after shampoo - best results with use of blower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other hair products, but this is the best one I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
            <li>This product works well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is colored.</li>
            <li>I did not get the smooth hair I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product when it was used at a salon and my hair was blown out by a professional</li>
            <li>This is not at all like the Super Smooth oil.  </li>
            <li>I have very very fine hair that just keeps getting frizzier and crazier as I get older.</li>
            <li>Maybe this works better for people with curly hair, but my straight hair that gets frizzy</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair and this controls the frizz even in the summer.  </li>
            <li>When I use the Super Smooth Cream is looks thick, shiny, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Working well, pleasant, very light smell, however Oribe light moisturizing cream and gold lust oil are the best for my mid length, naturally curly, dry, freeze prune hair, also dyed with natural hair colors in low humidity Colorado.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I know it seems pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my hair dresser</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything great!  </li>
            <li>i have very thick, wavey, colored hair, and use super smooth shampoo and conditioner, and recently purchased the super smooth cream, and i love it!</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair that turns into a huge mess in the humidity.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have very frizzy hair and was expecting to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference, but I just like to put some sort of moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant yet subtle.</li>
            <li>There is no more frizz, and my hair looks amazingly healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li>The product seemed fine, but I paid a lot and felt it did exactly what other products from Target or Sally beauty supply would do.  </li>
            <li>This came highly recommended by a friend, so my expectations were set quite high..</li>
            <li>This hair cream helps to keep my hair smooth, shiny and straight after using a flat iron; and I only have to use it once (on damp hair).  </li>
            <li>A tiny bit of the product goes a looooong way, which makes very economical in the long run.</li>
            <li>My hair looks soft and SMOOTH, without any of those little ends sticking out all over.</li>
            <li>This product controls my hair and leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft</li>
            <li>It really helps keep my hair under control in especially humid conditions.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I found this at my old salon and now that I&#x27;ve moved I buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This thick cream is applied to clean, damp hair and it leaves the hair soft and silky, yet controllable.</li>
            <li>My son like it and using it, his hair are thin and not curly, he thinks his hair looks better with this cream.</li>
            <li>I was using way too much at first, which was a waste.</li>
            <li>A little heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t like to fuss too much; i just want things to work, and i will pay a little extra if they do, and this does what it is supposed to.</li>

            <li> my hair soft and not oily which a lot of products tend to do usually</li>

            <li> Other products just make my hair stick to my head or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> use very little, it goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> I have dry, unruly, wavy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a go to item for me after an evening shower to add a little manageability.</li>
            <li> No residue, just a little cream works.</li>
            <li> The product came within of few days of placing the order.  </li>
            <li> It does not smooth frizzy hair at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick with some body, but becomes out of control with humidity.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for those with incredibly thick hair that is prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> If you are sick of the frizz, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> and I hate how frizzy it gets.  </li>

            <li> Smells really good! Works well. A little heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. My hair is thick with some body, but becomes out of control with humidity. I needed a product that would not flatten my hair, nor leave it \\&quot;tacky\\&quot;. This thick cream is applied to clean, damp hair and it leaves the hair soft and silky, yet controllable. A tiny bit of the product goes a looooong way, which makes very economical in the long run. Very happy with this product.</li>

            <li> I have dry, unruly, wavy, thick hair.  This product tames it and makes it a bit sleeker.  I combine it with a curling gel and get great results.  It&#x27;s a go to item for me after an evening shower to add a little manageability.</li>

            <li> This product works well on my fine hair. It is not heavy or sticky. The scent is pleasant yet subtle. I also appreciate the fact that Pureology does not test on animals or use animal byproducts.</li>

            <li> Controls the frizz and big hair</li>

            <li> My hairdresser said this is now discontinued so I purchased this online. Whoever is selling it needs to tidy up the listing as in one area it says it is in a pump container. I read the questions and answers to make sure it was a tube as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the good reviews but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything great!

            <li> Good for reducing frizz. I use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different products for years to take away the frizz after I wash my hair. I&#x27;ve used every product on the market made for frizz!! I finally heard about Pureology from a friend. I figured, why not; one more to try!!&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you! This product is the BEST on the market and really does work. My hair looks soft and SMOOTH, without any of those little ends sticking out all over. There is no more frizz, and my hair looks amazingly healthy and shiny! I know it seems pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. I was using way too much at first, which was a waste. I now realize that a small amount goes a long way. If you are sick of the frizz, this product is for you. I have fine hair that is colored. When I use the Super Smooth Cream is looks thick, shiny, and beautiful. I can&#x27;t believe this is my hair!! Go for it; you&#x27;ll be thrilled!</li>
            <li> I did not get the smooth hair I was expecting.  Maybe this works better for people with curly hair, but my straight hair that gets frizzy it didn&#x27;t do anything for.</li>
            <li> i have very thick, wavey, colored hair, and use super smooth shampoo and conditioner, and recently purchased the super smooth cream, and i love it! i am not one to delude myself into thinking something works if it doesn&#x27;t have a very marked affect, and this product has given my hair the thing i was looking for, which is protection, mostly, from heat, and makes my hair look and feel wonderful. i don&#x27;t like to fuss too much; i just want things to work, and i will pay a little extra if they do, and this does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Super smooth cream is excellent to use whe  blow drying your hair, it leave the hair smooth, shinny and bouncy, I am in love with it!</li>
