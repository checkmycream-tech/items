            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a lipstick case for months in the stores.  I was so glad to hear from a friend that I could find one on Amazon.  It was a pleasant surprise to find not only one but three for less than the price I expected to pay for just one and they&#x27;re pretty and very usable.</li>
            <li> I kept one, gave one to my granddaughter, and gave one to my daughter,  The price was unbelievable !!!</li>
            <li> They are in good shape, but they have a strange smell. I sprayed them with Febreeze and laid them out in the sun, still smell a little.</li>
            <li> They arrived fine and are what I expected</li>
            <li> I purchased these as small gifts, and they were a hit.  I definitely plan on purchasing more to give out for little surprise gifts whenever I feel the need.</li>
            <li> I have a case like this purchased elsewhere many years ago.  My 5 year old granddaughter is so smitten with it that she asked me if I would give it to her.  Of course the answer was no, but instead I found these on Amazon.  They are a cute little set of three.  I filled two of them with lip balms for my granddaughter for Christmas and kept one.  My experience with Amazon / the seller could not have been better.  I might even order another set because my mother liked them too.  They are very handy with the mirror and quite pretty.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gify for my spouse.  She likes to &amp;#34;travel light&amp;#34; for evenings out.  These fit the bill terrifically.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with the fabric and the colors!!!!</li>
            <li> The original picture had 3 Cases in 3 different shapes and that&#x27;s the reason I ordered in 1st place.But when I received the package, picture was changed on Website as well to reflect 3 cases of same pattern/shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not planning to return as it won&#x27;t be worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love these cute little sturdy, compact cases.</li>
            <li> These are so beautiful.  Very easy transaction, no problems. I&#x27;d buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The cases smell of mold-I responded to an email from them telling them the same - the response was to air them a out. I have aired them, sprayed with febreeze and the smell still exists. I am  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item.  The colors of the case are beautiful and it the right size for my lipstick or perfume decant.  I received my order on time and the packaging was perfect. I also was pleasantly surprised to receive a complimentary, which I love.  I will definitely order from Easystore again.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a lipstick case with no luck.  Finally found these.  Got 3 for a great price.  They are well made and just what I was looking for!!! Great purchase....You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted.  Simple lipstick  holder with mirror inside.</li>
            <li> alll have clasps to open which is not what I paid for in the picture</li>
            <li> These were for my Mother-in-Law - at 93 (and counting) she needs a little more care than she used to - but she&#x27;s WORTH EVERY EXPENSE!!</li>
            <li> These lipstick cases are adorable, love the colors and designs, and they are very well made for the price!  Rather than lipstick, I keep my ear buds in these lipstick cases, the cases are sturdy and just the right size for this purpose.  These will make great stocking stuffers!  I would have preferred the magnetic closure, rather than the snap, but it&#x27;s all good.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I have been looking in local stores for a lipstick case with a mirror, and then I found these on Amazon. Three different colors to take my pick from.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these a long time.  They are hard to find.  Had some very old ones (maybe 20+ years) and was glad to find these.</li>
