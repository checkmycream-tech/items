            <li> I like it ,, very fast shipping üöÄ</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have acne and scarring. I have been using it on my upper back, shoulders, chest and lightly on my face for a few weeks now and my scars on my back are definitely starting to lighten. It leaves my skin so soft and the oil in it really moisturizes my skin. It smells good too, a mixture of coffee and orange.  Make sure to use this scrub only in the shower since it makes a mess but rinses easily. I use it 2-3x per week and make sure to keep your hair up in a bun since it gets everywhere. ALSO it&#x27;s 14$ on frankbody.com idk why it&#x27;s so expensive here.</li>
            <li> I have been using the original body scrub as well as the pepper mint scrub for 6 months and I absolutely love it. My skin feels and looks amazing.

            <li> This scrub definitely works makes my skin feel smoother, but it is a harsh scrub and hard to clean from your tub.  My skin does not like jojoba and I itched after.  My sister bought for me to try!</li>
