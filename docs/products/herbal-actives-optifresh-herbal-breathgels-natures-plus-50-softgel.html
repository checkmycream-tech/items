            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to use it for now until I find a better option.  </li>
            <li>so I googled it until I found it online and ordered more of it.  </li>

            <li>Buy more soon asap.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the Chlorophyl and works much better, but on its own, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, but this product is the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>These are great, wish they sold them local</li>

            <li>This product never fails me!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a gel cap that we take right after eating.  </li>
            <li>When I know that my breath does not smell fresh for whatever reason, I would pop a couple of pills and in a few minutes, I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>Taken after eating, it keeps you feeling fresh and positive about yourself.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than others.  </li>
            <li>It does a super job of keeping our breaths fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>Love the little package.</li>
            <li>Love the little package for everywhere you can hide it.</li>
            <li>I would normally take it when I have a meeting at work and would be sitting close to someone.  </li>
            <li>So, I would normally hoard</li>
            <li>I had purchased them from a drugstore in the past but haven&#x27;t been able to find them for some time.</li>
            <li>My favor authentic Chinese dishes are the veggies/meat mixed with raw garlic and spices.</li>

            <li> I have been searching for a long time something that will help me with my breathe.</li>
            <li> I found this product, and expected this is going to help, but it didn&#x27;t do anything with the garlic breath.</li>
            <li> The only downside I could think of is that it is not available in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain it works 100%</li>
            <li> It leaves a very faint herbal taste that goes away very fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these after eating heavy garlic dishes and onion rings.</li>
            <li> I hardly eat it now due to the garlic breath afterwards.</li>
            <li> Maybe it only helps the bad breath which caused by internal.</li>
            <li> I use it after a spicy meal and or garlicy meal and it has never left me feeling insecure in any way.</li>
            <li> These little gel caps work internally instead of just masking bad breath.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I had to for this product!</li>
            <li> Works very well purchased for my daughter who has bad sinus problems that causes her breath to have a bad odor.  </li>
            <li> works well, but a bit expensive for the product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in the stores</li>
            <li> To expensive.</li>
            <li> Sometimes bad breath comes from the stomach and sometimes your body odor takes on the smells from the foods you ingest.</li>
            <li> Someone I know has chronic bad breath</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> Not as good as MintAssure but it works great.  Much cheaper than others.  It leaves a very faint herbal taste that goes away very fast.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like garlic, cos it&#x27;s very good for your health. My favor authentic Chinese dishes are the veggies/meat mixed with raw garlic and spices. I hardly eat it now due to the garlic breath afterwards. I found this product, and expected this is going to help, but it didn&#x27;t do anything with the garlic breath. Maybe it only helps the bad breath which caused by internal.</li>
            <li> This really works  pop a few and you literally burp minty luv it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain it works 100% but it&#x27;s ok.  I use it in combination with the Chlorophyl and works much better, but on its own, not so much.  Will continue to use it for now until I find a better option.  I did obtain my order as promised, no delays, I was happy about that.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  It is difficult to find in the stores so I googled it until I found it online and ordered more of it.  I tell all my friends about this product and once I share it with them they purchase it.  Now you can eat what you want without the offensive breath.  It is a product that goes with me everywhere!</li>
            <li> Great! It sure works.</li>
            <li> Works very well purchased for my daughter who has bad sinus problems that causes her breath to have a bad odor.  Since she&#x27;s be using this she hasn&#x27;t had this issue any more.</li>
            <li> This product works great. We&#x27;ve tried others but this works well. Taken after eating, it keeps you feeling fresh and positive about yourself. Try It!!!!</li>
            <li> These little gel caps work internally instead of just masking bad breath. Sometimes bad breath comes from the stomach and sometimes your body odor takes on the smells from the foods you ingest. These gels not only work on your breath but they work on your body odor as well. I&#x27;ve used these after eating heavy garlic dishes and onion rings. Have you ever stood next to someone and they smelled like garlic or onions? Someone I know has chronic bad breath and I share these with everyone at the table when we go out to dinner, not just this person, so he doesn&#x27;t feel singled out. It makes the rest of the evening much more enjoyable for everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product . My husband was on a low carb diet and this product did a great job with not making his breath smell!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the difference</li>
            <li> They get the job done!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that good,product has no effect</li>
            <li> This product never fails me!  When I know that my breath does not smell fresh for whatever reason, I would pop a couple of pills and in a few minutes, I am good to go.  I would normally take it when I have a meeting at work and would be sitting close to someone.  You prevent those embarassing moments.  This is a must when you go on a date.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The only downside I could think of is that it is not available in the stores.  So, I would normally hoard so I would always have 1 in all my purses.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a long time something that will help me with my breathe. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, but this product is the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I had to for this product! It actually works!</li>
            <li> Does not work for me..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t worked as expected. To expensive.</li>
            <li> This product works. Pricing could be cheaper, but for what it does it is a good product. It stores easily in my purse and the container is easy to open and securely close. Good job.</li>
            <li> Excellent, works as it claims.</li>
            <li> These are great, wish they sold them local so you didn&#x27;t have to wait to receive them. Also would be nice if they coated them with a minty taste so when you would pop them in your mouth the mint would stay before you swallowed the caps.</li>
            <li> I recommend to everyone who breath isnt so good after onions......Overall company is great Company! Buy more soon asap. 100</li>
            <li> Have been using these faithfully since I received them for about 3 weeks now and I have not noticed the tiniest difference anywhere. Disappointed. Trying something else.</li>
            <li> Love the little package. They work and good to carry so tiny. Love the little package for everywhere you can hide it.</li>
            <li> I use it after a spicy meal and or garlicy meal and it has never left me feeling insecure in any way.</li>
