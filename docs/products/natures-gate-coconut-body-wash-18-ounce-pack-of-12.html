            <li>Good price, thanks</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really sweet!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product as a more mild soap for my husband.  </li>
            <li>This body wash is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>my skin is velvety smooth after washing.</li>
            <li>Like I said, this is nice gentle soap but unless you are looking for a bubblegum sent, maybe go with the hemp scent instead.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin SO smooth.</li>
            <li>He switched to this and his dry skin was greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>but I do like that its sweet.  </li>
            <li>This product has a sweet, almost candy like scent that I dislike.</li>
            <li>The body wash also smells a bit like bubble gum, least that is the best thing I can find to describe it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cloyingly sweet for me.</li>
            <li>With its fresh smell, it will leave you feeling clean</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t femanine nor is it particularly manly, I am able to use the soap without feeling like I smell like a man.</li>
            <li>I do not think it moisturizes more than any other kind of body wash, either.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is no longer available in my area, and I tried to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter really likes it too and its great for her sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells so soft and nice, smooth to skin, without no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>BUT IT SMELLS LIKE AIRPLANE BATHROOMS, which honestly, is why I choose seats in the middle of the plane, away from the bathrooms.</li>
            <li>But it is easy to wash off and is not a negative.</li>
            <li>It is the right consistency, lathers just right, and rinses off well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting a relatively neutral scent with an Aloe body wash, but this was more sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>hope you can pay more attention for future order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my husband asked me why I bought bubblegum scented body wash.</li>
            <li>but I was still surprised how sweet it smelled.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this body wash.  </li>
            <li>I use papaya body wash and this aloe body wash, and both are highly recommended !</li>
            <li>I have eczema and am very picky about what I use to wash myself with as far as soap is concerned.</li>
            <li>I definitely enjoy Nature&#x27;s Gate products, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase this specific one again only because of the scent.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and knew it would smell sweet</li>
            <li>do wish the manufacturer tightened the pumps completely onto the bottle</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin - this does not cause any inflammation.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that doesn&#x27;t have unnecessary chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I ordered four bottles, and two of them were broken in transit with most of the liquid in the plastic bag and the carton.</li>
            <li>I know now that this will be my last supply of this product, and I will have to seek a new body wash that I can buy in a local store.</li>
            <li>Within a week of so I noticed all my dry patches I have almost gone completely away.</li>

I know now that this will be my last supply of this product, and I will have to seek a new body wash that I can buy in a local store.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels and cleans BUT IT SMELLS LIKE AIRPLANE BATHROOMS, which honestly, is why I choose seats in the middle of the plane, away from the bathrooms.</li>
            <li> The body wash also smells a bit like bubble gum, least that is the best thing I can find to describe it.  I&#x27;m personally not a fan of the smell, but that is just me.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying this scent again.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the manufacturer tightened the pumps completely onto the bottle so it didn&#x27;t leak out everywhere during shipping.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product as a more mild soap for my husband.  He gets dry skin and was using a harsh men&#x27;s body wash.  He switched to this and his dry skin was greatly reduced.  The smell isn&#x27;t femanine nor is it particularly manly, I am able to use the soap without feeling like I smell like a man.</li>
            <li> I like the way it lathers and the way it moisturizes my skin. my skin is velvety smooth after washing. i have a problem with the scent though...it&#x27;s really sweet! it&#x27;s cloyingly sweet for me. it actually reminds me of children&#x27;s cough syrup. the smell is very artificial. i also do not like that it comes in a pump bottle. i&#x27;m holding a loofah in one hand and it&#x27;ll be nice if i can just grab the bottle and squeeze.</li>
            <li> I love Natures Gate products, but the scent on this was so unlike Aloe that I had to go back and verify that I didn&#x27;t buy it from a random seller who refilled the bottle! It&#x27;s like bubble gum. I&#x27;ll buy a different version of Natures Gate next time</li>
            <li> It is bad for package. when I received it , all the packing are broken. hope you can pay more attention for future order.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is very light. think it is suitable for me!</li>
            <li> I ordered this from amazon after target stopped carrying it. It is my favorite body wash! It is a mild wonderful scent. I have sensitive skin - this does not cause any inflammation. It leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap base. It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either. It is very gentle and leaves you feeling clean. However, the Aloe Vera scent smells just like bubblegum. When I showered, the entire bathroom smelled like bubblegum, and it&#x27;s not just me. The first time I used it my husband asked me why I bought bubblegum scented body wash. Like I said, this is nice gentle soap but unless you are looking for a bubblegum sent, maybe go with the hemp scent instead.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this from another website &amp; I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. But it turned out to be a great buy. It leaves my skin SO smooth. I don&#x27;t know how but it improved the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great body wash.. Good price, thanks</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it.  I love the smell - like smarties.  I read other reviews and knew it would smell sweet but I was still surprised how sweet it smelled.  My husband wouldn&#x27;t use it because it is too feminine, but that&#x27;s ok with me!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products from Nature&#x27;s Gate!</li>
            <li> works well and feels great on your skin, only need a litte and it lathers up great.  I will order more for sure.</li>
