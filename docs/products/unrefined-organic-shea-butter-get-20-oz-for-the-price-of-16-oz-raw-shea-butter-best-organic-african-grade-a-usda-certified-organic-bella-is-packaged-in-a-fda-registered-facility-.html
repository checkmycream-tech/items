            <li>I used this to make body butters, sugar scrub, lip balm, and more with great success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with the overall transaction, price and warranty and my wife is really happy with the product itself.</li>

            <li>Overall my experience with Imperial Shea Butter company was great!</li>
            <li>I love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After applied to the skin leaves a feeling silky smooth, I also liked the smell like trees or even wood.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>people may not like the smell of shea butter, but I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I will find some many uses for it.  </li>
            <li>sure how soon will it take for me to finish it</li>
            <li>And I LOVE TO USE IT AFTER MY MORNING SHOWER JUST BEFORE STAR MY</li>
            <li>I absolutely love shea butter...</li>
            <li>I have used it for a body butter, a sugar scrub and just tried it for a sunscreen all of which I love.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>:) Seems my skin needed it, loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so I brought 2 more : )</li>
            <li>It is very rich and I brought one to see if I would like it</li>
            <li>Loved it and it worked great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Awesome product is helping me with dry skin</li>
            <li>The best thing I had ever order it help me with my dry skin and my acne</li>
            <li>A fantastic deal with 25% more of this creamy product for the price of 16oz size.</li>
            <li>Bella Shea Butter is a great, natural product.</li>
            <li>I had my husband to try it because it works great as Natural Anti inflammatory</li>
            <li>more... FREE.</li>
            <li>the bag, easy to reseal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It melts so easily on the palm of your hand as you are rubbing them.</li>
            <li>I was so put off by the strong odour and uber grainy texture of this product that I didn&#x27;t end up using it at all.</li>
            <li>For this time of year, that&#x27;s fine; as the cooler temps prevent melting, but I wouldn&#x27;t want this for the summer.</li>
            <li>I was told that Shea Butter is a great shaving cream, as I would get irritation after shaving, but now I do not have red, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic in body butters.</li>
            <li>I actually heard about this product from a friend and have to say it is great.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, shiny, and I don&#x27;t use conditioner anymore at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I stopped using store-bought deodorants (I&#x27;ll pass on the Alzheimer&#x27;s and breast cancer, thanks), and started making my own using shea butter and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it, it is very recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and it feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use when mixing with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any one to try it, you will not regret it!!!!</li>
            <li>we received the product, it came with a very nice natural bag that would just be right for the description that I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wonderful product that has really addressed my dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely excited to utilize this product to keep my body glowing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great is no longer dry.</li>
            <li>also loved the fact that the company provided an amazing guarantee that  if I was not satisfied with the product, i could return it,  even if I used it all.</li>
            <li>Today I am grateful to have found this amazing all natural product.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing, a treasure from Mother Nature, and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it.  </li>
            <li>Not bad to get 4 oz.</li>
            <li>It is very rich in texture but absorbs fast and keeps my skin moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li>When it (quickly) arrived</li>
            <li>I suffer from acne and damaged hair, but luckily this product has been a life saver.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.......will be buying again and again</li>
            <li>I love how it has many different uses.</li>
            <li>I have ordered other Shea Butters before to make my homemade lotions and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li>Smell strong and very olily , not work for my son&#x27;s eczema .but</li>
            <li>My favorite for the skin leaves skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I love the soft scent, how smooth and soft it leaves skin and how easy it is to work with.  </li>
            <li>my wife used it in my little ones at night great product.</li>
            <li>You truly get your money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Completely met my expectations and more.</li>
            <li>So far I have  made lotion bars and  face lotion, both of these products have  turned out much better.</li>
            <li>tell its absorbed.</li>
            <li>smart, right)!</li>
            <li>I have only used this product once so far, but I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li>This soap makes me feel like I&#x27;m ready for prom and my date&#x27;s actually movie cute!</li>
            <li>The butter came in a plastic bag that was packaged in a nice little brown paper bag to block light from ruining the butter(how</li>
            <li>I have some mild eczema on my face and this Shea Butter really takes the redness and dryness away.  </li>
            <li>Super high quality shea butter!</li>
            <li>Was skeptical about the results at first, but after just one week, wife and daughter are very happy with this product!!!</li>
            <li>Plus the paper bag was resealable(again, smart right).</li>
            <li>I started noticing a difference on the first couple of days.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Overall, my skin (and my family&#x27;s) feel much better.</li>
            <li>There are so many ways to use this product and it is definitely doing its job.</li>
            <li>I am OK with giving away some wrinkles in return for a younger, healthier look.</li>
            <li>This is definitely pure and unrefined.  </li>
            <li>they swear that it made a BIG difference on their skin - would definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>very high quality.</li>
            <li>After re-ordering per their instructions I received the IVORY and was refunded the higher original price very quickly—and was told to keep the YELLOW!  </li>
            <li>I apply this straight up onto my face and hair; just melt a little in your hands and apply to face, body, and hair for an incredibly effective treatment.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>got to say I&#x27;m very impress.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It works that fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfy with this product.</li>
            <li>I was very with this product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t thank the woman who introduced me to this, Mrs. Jordan, thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.</li>
            <li>The consistency is different than what I&#x27;m used to, but once it warms up the product goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>This raw organic shea butter is smooth and free of any impurities.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to other crunchy moms. :)</li>
            <li>This could be my new tanning lotion and will certainly be the number one product to give to my pregnant friends to prevent possible stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, would recommend this Shea Butter highly.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>Truly a 100% pure natural product.</li>
            <li>skin tone improved within 2 days, it got the pink glow of health back that I love so much</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and makes my skin feel so soft and smooths.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I do have a flare, the natural butter eases the itching and discomfort instantly, and the rash subsides quickly.  </li>
            <li>Through a hot summer, with temperatures consistently in the upper 80s or higher and loads of humidity, I have had zero body odor issues - and I am pretty active!  </li>
            <li>Now, I think I want to try the new cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>The butter was easy to handle not too hard but not too soft which made it just right for melting.</li>
            <li>I have placed an order with a total of 3 bags of 100% Organic Raw Shea Butter, my whole family love it.</li>
            <li>This is a NATURAL product, and it smells beautifully natural!  </li>
            <li>It has left my skin feeling so soft without having too much of a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I t left it the skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ve been massaging it to my hands at night and have noticed my skin really soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I received my Shea butter really fast in the mail and start looking for recipes for the different uses for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even say how soft it made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old lady.</li>
            <li>My friend told my about this natural  product.</li>
            <li>so far I like the results and the smell.  </li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is soft &amp; pliable.  </li>
            <li>I make a moisturizer using this, coconut oil &amp; almond oil and my skin has never been as soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>but in reality was clearly marked &amp;#34;Yellow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the yellow stuff called Sheabutter that I was slathering on my body before but this Bella Shea butter is the real deal.</li>
            <li>other factors why I ordered this product was the fact that this was 4 oz more than other brands on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No other cream, ointment, prescription, scrub...nothing!  </li>
            <li>Using Bella Shea Butter on the dry patches for just a few days, I saw a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and still had acne occasionally, and that, too, has completely ended!  </li>
            <li>her hair is so soft and her curls last for 2-3 days without frizzing.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough for people who have sensitive skin, autoimmune problems, or just want to eliminate the chemicals and carcinogens in store-bought products.  </li>
            <li>and it arrived fast sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>After using raw, unrefined ivory shea butter as a skin and hair treatment for about two months, I am absolutely amazed at the difference!!  </li>
            <li>love it so much, I hardly use any other face cream or hand creme anymore.</li>
            <li>It has the right smell and raw Shea butter consistency.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time,  I read about the benefits and also what to expect from a real raw shea butter and seems to fit it all.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this product and didn&#x27;t expect much of a difference from any other Shea butter, BUT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many expensive products to help with my dry and sensitive skin but nothing has worked.</li>

            <li> A fantastic deal with 25% more of this creamy product for the price of 16oz size.</li>
            <li> Bella Shea Butter is a great, natural product.</li>
            <li> I had my husband to try it because it works great as Natural Anti inflammatory</li>
            <li> more... FREE.</li>
            <li> the bag, easy to reseal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It melts so easily on the palm of your hand as you are rubbing them.</li>
            <li> I was so put off by the strong odour and uber grainy texture of this product that I didn&#x27;t end up using it at all.</li>
            <li> For this time of year, that&#x27;s fine; as the cooler temps prevent melting, but I wouldn&#x27;t want this for the summer.</li>
            <li> I was told that Shea Butter is a great shaving cream, as I would get irritation after shaving, but now I do not have red, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic in body butters.</li>
            <li> I actually heard about this product from a friend and have to say it is great.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, shiny, and I don&#x27;t use conditioner anymore at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I stopped using store-bought deodorants (I&#x27;ll pass on the Alzheimer&#x27;s and breast cancer, thanks), and started making my own using shea butter and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> I really liked it, it is very recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and it feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use when mixing with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend any one to try it, you will not regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> we received the product, it came with a very nice natural bag that would just be right for the description that I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that has really addressed my dry skin issues.</li>

            <li> When it (quickly) arrived</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne and damaged hair, but luckily this product has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.......will be buying again and again</li>
            <li> I love how it has many different uses.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other Shea Butters before to make my homemade lotions and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li> Smell strong and very olily , not work for my son&#x27;s eczema .but</li>
            <li> My favorite for the skin leaves skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I love the soft scent, how smooth and soft it leaves skin and how easy it is to work with.  </li>
            <li> my wife used it in my little ones at night great product.</li>
            <li> You truly get your money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Completely met my expectations and more.</li>
            <li> So far I have  made lotion bars and  face lotion, both of these products have  turned out much better.</li>
            <li> tell its absorbed.</li>
            <li> smart, right)!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far, but I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li> This soap makes me feel like I&#x27;m ready for prom and my date&#x27;s actually movie cute!</li>
            <li> The butter came in a plastic bag that was packaged in a nice little brown paper bag to block light from ruining the butter(how</li>
            <li> I have some mild eczema on my face and this Shea Butter really takes the redness and dryness away.  </li>
            <li> Super high quality shea butter!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about the results at first, but after just one week, wife and daughter are very happy with this product!!!</li>
            <li> Plus the paper bag was resealable(again, smart right).</li>
            <li> I started noticing a difference on the first couple of days.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Overall, my skin (and my family&#x27;s) feel much better.</li>
            <li> There are so many ways to use this product and it is definitely doing its job.</li>
            <li> I am OK with giving away some wrinkles in return for a younger, healthier look.</li>
            <li> This is definitely pure and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> they swear that it made a BIG difference on their skin - would definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> very high quality.</li>
            <li> After re-ordering per their instructions I received the IVORY and was refunded the higher original price very quickly—and was told to keep the YELLOW!  </li>
            <li> I apply this straight up onto my face and hair; just melt a little in your hands and apply to face, body, and hair for an incredibly effective treatment.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> got to say I&#x27;m very impress.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It works that fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very with this product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t thank the woman who introduced me to this, Mrs. Jordan, thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.</li>
            <li> The consistency is different than what I&#x27;m used to, but once it warms up the product goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> This raw organic shea butter is smooth and free of any impurities.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to other crunchy moms. :)</li>
            <li> This could be my new tanning lotion and will certainly be the number one product to give to my pregnant friends to prevent possible stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, would recommend this Shea Butter highly.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> Truly a 100% pure natural product.</li>
            <li> skin tone improved within 2 days, it got the pink glow of health back that I love so much</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and makes my skin feel so soft and smooths.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I do have a flare, the natural butter eases the itching and discomfort instantly, and the rash subsides quickly.  </li>
            <li> Through a hot summer, with temperatures consistently in the upper 80s or higher and loads of humidity, I have had zero body odor issues - and I am pretty active!  </li>
            <li> Now, I think I want to try the new cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> The butter was easy to handle not too hard but not too soft which made it just right for melting.</li>
            <li> I have placed an order with a total of 3 bags of 100% Organic Raw Shea Butter, my whole family love it.</li>
            <li> This is a NATURAL product, and it smells beautifully natural!  </li>
            <li> It has left my skin feeling so soft without having too much of a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I t left it the skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve been massaging it to my hands at night and have noticed my skin really soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I received my Shea butter really fast in the mail and start looking for recipes for the different uses for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even say how soft it made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old lady.</li>
            <li> My friend told my about this natural  product.</li>
            <li> so far I like the results and the smell.  </li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is soft &amp; pliable.  </li>
            <li> I make a moisturizer using this, coconut oil &amp; almond oil and my skin has never been as soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> but in reality was clearly marked &amp;#34;Yellow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the yellow stuff called Sheabutter that I was slathering on my body before but this Bella Shea butter is the real deal.</li>
            <li> other factors why I ordered this product was the fact that this was 4 oz more than other brands on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No other cream, ointment, prescription, scrub...nothing!  </li>
            <li> Using Bella Shea Butter on the dry patches for just a few days, I saw a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and still had acne occasionally, and that, too, has completely ended!  </li>
            <li> her hair is so soft and her curls last for 2-3 days without frizzing.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough for people who have sensitive skin, autoimmune problems, or just want to eliminate the chemicals and carcinogens in store-bought products.  </li>
            <li> and it arrived fast sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> After using raw, unrefined ivory shea butter as a skin and hair treatment for about two months, I am absolutely amazed at the difference!!  </li>
            <li> love it so much, I hardly use any other face cream or hand creme anymore.</li>
            <li> It has the right smell and raw Shea butter consistency.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time,  I read about the benefits and also what to expect from a real raw shea butter and seems to fit it all.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product and didn&#x27;t expect much of a difference from any other Shea butter, BUT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many expensive products to help with my dry and sensitive skin but nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> no cracking!&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin and have been able to use Bella Shea Butter without any bad reactions or breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also used it on my extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will totally recommended for any dry skin and face.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin especially around the heel area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She always uses Natural products that organic and look for Raw and unrefined ingredients whenever possible.</li>
            <li> My niece suffers from very dry skin and is very prone to rashes and we used it for a couple of weeks and her skin is so much better and no more rashes.</li>
            <li> I have long, long hair</li>
            <li> This made a big difference in my choice between all other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I&#x27;ve been getting my Shea butter from my local hair supply store, needless to say I won&#x27;t be getting the yellow, greasy &amp;#34;Shea butter&amp;#34; from there anymore!</li>
            <li> This was unscented (which I wanted), so I can add blended essential oils to small amounts and have different scents for different uses.</li>
            <li> work for my husband dry hands , just too olily</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> just what you need for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My acne has been improving and my hair isn&#x27;t as dry.</li>
            <li> I. I work in construction and at the end of the day my hands and feet are dry.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> Recipes are all over the Internet, but I use roughly equal parts shea and coconut oil with a few drops of cedar and peppermint essential oils.</li>
            <li> No need for special expensive shampoos.</li>
            <li> Instantly we noticed his skin looked healthier, less dry, and</li>
            <li> Melts from the warmth of my hand, on extremely cold days, it takes one hot shot from my hair dryer to completely melt this butter in my hands.</li>
            <li> I guess for unrefined organic shea butter, that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the scent, you can add a few drops of essential oil of your choosing.  </li>
            <li> I do not really know how to use  this shea butter</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and several times a day on my hands after washing them and also I use it on a scar on my leg.</li>
            <li> It works due to the antimicrobial properties of the shea and coconut oils, as well as the cedar and peppermint oils.  </li>
            <li> and I use it now every other week.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first sight, but after applying the product i cant stop using.</li>
            <li> I do not have any skin aliments other than some dryness, so</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to the other uses of it.</li>
            <li> It even keeps my hands moisturized for a very long time even after I have washed them a few times.</li>
            <li> Other people complain about shea butter being messy.  </li>
            <li> also my nails are less brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s supposed to have the consistency of something along the lines of play dough but a little bit softer and those two things is what I found when I ordered my butter from Bella Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from eczema and Bella Shea butter has really helped.</li>
            <li> so this helps to keep it tame and the split ends at bay.</li>
            <li> My approach was to purchase some small 4-oz jelly jars and spoon the shea butter into one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference was</li>
            <li> Organic Raw Unrefined Grade A Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> I started using it on them and now  you can&#x27;t even tell that i work hard all day.</li>
            <li> wash my hands at least 20 times a day and my skin is often feeling chapped and  </li>
            <li> It loses one star for being crumbly.  </li>
            <li> For all over moisturizing I combine with extra virgin cold pressed coconut oil.</li>
            <li> son suffers from dry skin all over his body.</li>
            <li> Out of curiosity, I ordered this Organic Shea Butter, and let me tell you something: this thing is seriously miraculous:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The horrible dry skin bumps on my forearms have disappeared and when mixed with sugar this bodacious butter sloths away even the driest hands and heels.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;One of my son&#x27;s had bad dry skin</li>
            <li> and I mean nothing has worked like Bella Shea Butter!  </li>
            <li> ill continue buyingit, Miriam Pariente.</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from eczema and her skin hasnt felt so moisturized since she was born.</li>
            <li> husband suffers from psoriasis on his hands, knees, and feet.  </li>
            <li> My aunts experience and consecuences were so bad about this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell at all</li>
            <li> And suffering from autoimmune disease, I had flare ups of eczema that were terrible on my chest and trunk; since using the shea butter, the eczema is practically gone!  </li>

            <li> Awesome product.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son suffers from dry skin all over his body. My wife and I have tried all types of creams and treatments to help him out and nothing seems to work. We tried Bella Shea Butter and what a difference.  We are very happy with the results and my son&#x27;s skin now looks moist and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to try it for acne and stretch marks.....I will let you know.</li>

            <li> Shipping was on point,  and was shipped the very next day. Received the Shea Butter and has been working great. I was told that Shea Butter is a great shaving cream, as I would get irritation after shaving, but now I do not have red, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very rich, I used itfor my eczema, and worked great!!, It helped with the itching.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my extra dry skin.

            <li> Truly a 100% pure natural product. My daughter suffers from eczema and her skin hasnt felt so moisturized since she was born. Shes a happy girl. I highly recommend this product to other crunchy moms. :)</li>
            <li> Out of curiosity, I ordered this Organic Shea Butter, and let me tell you something: this thing is seriously miraculous:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hands at least 20 times a day and my skin is often feeling chapped and  dry; I&#x27;ve been massaging it to my hands at night and have noticed my skin really soft and hydrated also my nails are less brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would recommend this Shea Butter highly. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal.  100% Organic Raw Unrefined Grade A Shea Butter! A fantastic deal with 25% more of this creamy product for the price of 16oz size. My hair has never been healthier or shinier.  The horrible dry skin bumps on my forearms have disappeared and when mixed with sugar this bodacious butter sloths away even the driest hands and heels.  The vitamins are an added bonus and when my husbands shoulders got sunburned while doing yard work, the Bella Shea Butter soothed the burn and prevented the itchy peeling phase.  I can&#x27;t wait to experiment more with this beautiful product on all my skin issues. This could be my new tanning lotion and will certainly be the number one product to give to my pregnant friends to prevent possible stretch marks.  The fact that this company donates a dollar for each purchase to the Breast Cancer Association is just the \\&quot;Butter\\&quot;cream icing on the cake!  You MUST try this product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  Why you ask?  Well let me tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband suffers from psoriasis on his hands, knees, and feet.  Nothing and I mean nothing has worked like Bella Shea Butter!  No other cream, ointment, prescription, scrub...nothing!  Instantly we noticed his skin looked healthier, less dry, and no cracking!&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin and have been able to use Bella Shea Butter without any bad reactions or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  Using anything else after using this will make you say &amp;#34;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Bella Shea Butter!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about the results at first, but after just one week, wife and daughter are very happy with this product!!! they swear that it made a BIG difference on their skin - would definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have sensitive skin. I used this after shaving and helped prevent irritation. Kept my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great product! Loved it and it worked great for my dry skin. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel!  The best moisturizer ever for skin.  Not greasy, skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. I like it because it keeps my hair from going too frizzy and I helps preventing split ends. (I also use it for my acne and I would say it is alright...) You have to get used to the smell but when you put it on your hair just add hairspray to drown out the smell.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Feels wonderful applied straight onto your skin. I used this to make body butters, sugar scrub, lip balm, and more with great success. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Super high quality shea butter! I love it!</li>
            <li> Bella Shea Butter is a great, natural product. It has left my skin feeling so soft without having too much of a greasy feeling. I also love all of the things you can do with it: body scrub, body butter, lip chap, and even a hair mask! I have long, long hair so this helps to keep it tame and the split ends at bay. I&#x27;m definitely excited to utilize this product to keep my body glowing.</li>
            <li> Awesome product is helping me with dry skin and it also can be used as a scrub awesome product</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She always uses Natural products that organic and look for Raw and unrefined ingredients whenever possible. When I saw that this product had it all I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other factors why I ordered this product was the fact that this was 4 oz more than other brands on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also loved the fact that the company provided an amazing guarantee that  if I was not satisfied with the product, i could return it,  even if I used it all. This made a big difference in my choice between all other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we received the product, it came with a very nice natural bag that would just be right for the description that I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using it since I bought it and she has been really happy with her results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with the overall transaction, price and warranty and my wife is really happy with the product itself. So it is a win win purchase for the family.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it out of desperation.&lt;br /&gt;One of my son&#x27;s had bad dry skin and it work so good, it took one day to make my son skin better.&lt;br /&gt;I got to say I&#x27;m very impress.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product this is why I&#x27;m an amazon fan.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I&#x27;ve been getting my Shea butter from my local hair supply store, needless to say I won&#x27;t be getting the yellow, greasy &amp;#34;Shea butter&amp;#34; from there anymore! I love making my own hair and skin products and Bella Shea Butter its the only place I&#x27;ll get my Shea butter from now on. I did some research and found out that Shea butter is supposed to have an ivory or beige color to it and it&#x27;s supposed to have the consistency of something along the lines of play dough but a little bit softer and those two things is what I found when I ordered my butter from Bella Shea Butter.The butter came in a plastic bag that was packaged in a nice little brown paper bag to block light from ruining the butter(how smart, right)! Plus the paper bag was resealable(again, smart right). The butter was easy to handle not too hard but not too soft which made it just right for melting. Overall my experience with Imperial Shea Butter company was great! Plus this works great in my baby girl&#x27;s hair her hair is so soft and her curls last for 2-3 days without frizzing. I use it on my face as well. I love this Shea butter. I highly recommend any one to try it, you will not regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, fresh  !!</li>
            <li> I received my Shea butter really fast in the mail and start looking for recipes for the different uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;After applied to the skin leaves a feeling silky smooth, I also liked the smell like trees or even wood. It is very rich in texture but absorbs fast and keeps my skin moisturized for hours. I had my husband to try it because it works great as Natural Anti inflammatory and  he had some insects bites around his legs that could not stop scratching them, after applying to his skin it took the string out and relieve de pain.&lt;br /&gt;I wish some one told me about this Shea Butter before, I will recommend it to everyone ...  I was impress with the immediate results of this product, Thank you and I will order it again!</li>
            <li> I love this product.I started noticing a difference on the first couple of days. It works that fast. It melts so easily on the palm of your hand as you are rubbing them. It just takes the warmth of your body for it to start working. I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with different scent oils to personalize its smell. I was amaze of how well everything was packaged. And the customer service is just great:-) It&#x27;s as if they were outside my door, waiting for the delivery truck to knock at my door, for them to give me a call and asked if I had receive my product. I&#x27;m very satisfy with this product. Now, I think I want to try the new cocoa butter. They both come in 20 oz.for the price of 16 oz.Not bad to get 4 oz. more... FREE.</li>
            <li> Works just like they say. Fantastic in body butters.</li>
            <li> I actually heard about this product from a friend and have to say it is great. My niece suffers from very dry skin and is very prone to rashes and we used it for a couple of weeks and her skin is so much better and no more rashes. Excellent product. Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> After using raw, unrefined ivory shea butter as a skin and hair treatment for about two months, I am absolutely amazed at the difference!!  The vitamins in the shea butter accelerate skin turnover, which means the wrinkles I was getting around my eyes and on my forehead are GONE.  I am 40 years old and still had acne occasionally, and that, too, has completely ended!  And suffering from autoimmune disease, I had flare ups of eczema that were terrible on my chest and trunk; since using the shea butter, the eczema is practically gone!  When I do have a flare, the natural butter eases the itching and discomfort instantly, and the rash subsides quickly.  I apply this straight up onto my face and hair; just melt a little in your hands and apply to face, body, and hair for an incredibly effective treatment.  My hair is smooth, shiny, and I don&#x27;t use conditioner anymore at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may not like the smell of shea butter, but I absolutely love it.  This is a NATURAL product, and it smells beautifully natural!  Sort of earthy and elemental.  If you don&#x27;t like the scent, you can add a few drops of essential oil of your choosing.  Other people complain about shea butter being messy.  My approach was to purchase some small 4-oz jelly jars and spoon the shea butter into one.  I keep it in the bathroom cabinet, and when I need to use the butter, I just open the jar and get some out.  I refill the jar when it runs low.  Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I stopped using store-bought deodorants (I&#x27;ll pass on the Alzheimer&#x27;s and breast cancer, thanks), and started making my own using shea butter and coconut oil.  Recipes are all over the Internet, but I use roughly equal parts shea and coconut oil with a few drops of cedar and peppermint essential oils. The results are amazing!  Through a hot summer, with temperatures consistently in the upper 80s or higher and loads of humidity, I have had zero body odor issues - and I am pretty active!  Sometimes I would apply it a coupleof times a day to be safe, and also just because it smells so nice!  It works due to the antimicrobial properties of the shea and coconut oils, as well as the cedar and peppermint oils.  It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough for people who have sensitive skin, autoimmune problems, or just want to eliminate the chemicals and carcinogens in store-bought products.  This is the real thing, a treasure from Mother Nature, and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it.  I get compliments all the time about my skin and hair, and I love the way they feel and look now!  The 20-oz size is an awesome deal, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead, buy it!  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product to use on your skin and hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have placed an order with a total of 3 bags of 100% Organic Raw Shea Butter, my whole family love it.</li>
            <li> I really liked it, it is very recommended. 100 reliable for almost everything. ill continue buyingit, Miriam Pariente. thank you.</li>
            <li> I was very with this product.  Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  Highly recommend for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I never thought I will find some many uses for it.  It helps with any skin dryness.  I use it for my elbows knees and even for my dandruff. Yes it stopped my dandruff after couple of applications and I use it now every other week.  No need for special expensive shampoos. Wife is using for stretch marks and is working.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the amount of butter is GREAT! We get a lot of it compares to anything out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how soon will it take for me to finish it but I  may send to my family and friends,  it&#x27;s just so good I have no hesitation recommending it!</li>
            <li> Nice, but not the quality I was expecting. The texture is rather grainy compared to another organic, unrefined Shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased. Getting 20oz for the price of 16oz was a good value. I didn&#x27;t like that it came package in a Ziploc style bag and then placed in another similar styled bag designed for shipping. For this time of year, that&#x27;s fine; as the cooler temps prevent melting, but I wouldn&#x27;t want this for the summer.</li>
            <li> I used this to make my bath fizzies.  I can&#x27;t even say how soft it made my skin feel.  Thanks for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old lady. I&#x27;m in pre-menopause stage now. I&#x27;m so scare to use any product on my face. My aunts experience and consecuences were so bad about this. My friend told my about this natural  product.NOW  I&amp;#34;M SO BLESS TO HAVE IT AND USE IT EVERY NIGTH after my shower. And I LOVE TO USE IT AFTER MY MORNING SHOWER JUST BEFORE STAR MY DAY.THANK YOU ! THANK YOU ! THANK YOU !</li>
            <li> Amazing product! very high quality. I am so happy that I went with this brand Bella Shea Butter. This raw organic shea butter is smooth and free of any impurities. I will be ordering Bella shea butter again soon.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time,  I read about the benefits and also what to expect from a real raw shea butter and seems to fit it all. It leaves a very smooth and hydrated skin,  so far I like the results and the smell.  I will totally recommended for any dry skin and face.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that has really addressed my dry skin issues. I noticed a smoother skin texture! Give this product a chance...</li>
            <li> Good product.  Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> After reading a lot about shea butter I ordered this based on the great reviews and price.  When it (quickly) arrived I was dismayed that I received YELLOW and contacted the seller.  After re-ordering per their instructions I received the IVORY and was refunded the higher original price very quickly—and was told to keep the YELLOW!  Now I just have to figure out what to do with the yellow, since I&#x27;m using the IVORY to make &amp;#34;whipped body butter with magnesium oil.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this seller and this shea butter!</li>
            <li> Good quality, arrived on time. I mix it with various essential oils to create home-based moisturizer recipes. Melts from the warmth of my hand, on extremely cold days, it takes one hot shot from my hair dryer to completely melt this butter in my hands.</li>
            <li> This is definitely pure and unrefined.  Has that nutty smell we have come to like.  It loses one star for being crumbly.  I don&#x27;t know what that indicates but I don&#x27;t like crumbly.  I like shea butter that is like a stick of butter - cuts without crumbles.  The packaging was nice and when I melted the butter there were ZERO impurities.</li>
            <li> I do not really know how to use  this shea butter</li>
            <li> just what you need for dry skin.  helps stop cracks on fingers and helps mend them when you forget to use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love shea butter...use it for lips, skin (including face), even as a deep conditioner for my hair.  This package from Imperial was a good deal and shipped really quick.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s packaged in and FDA accredited facility, also. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it came packaged in a plastic bag.  Would rather see a sturdier container, but for the price, I&#x27;ll put it in my own container.  This was unscented (which I wanted), so I can add blended essential oils to small amounts and have different scents for different uses.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other Shea Butters before to make my homemade lotions and by far this is the best. I love the soft scent, how smooth and soft it leaves skin and how easy it is to work with.  So far I have  made lotion bars and  face lotion, both of these products have  turned out much better. Overall, my skin (and my family&#x27;s) feel much better. Love it! I will definitely buy Bella She Butter again! Did I mention how nice it smells!</li>
            <li> Great product!  This Shea Butter is soft &amp; pliable.  I make a moisturizer using this, coconut oil &amp; almond oil and my skin has never been as soft and supple.  Will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review, but this product deserves it. It came right on time, it was excellent quality, excellent packaging, I highly reccomend this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for four days and I&#x27;m already very impressed with it. I suffer from acne and damaged hair, but luckily this product has been a life saver. My acne has been improving and my hair isn&#x27;t as dry. There are so many ways to use this product and it is definitely doing its job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many expensive products to help with my dry and sensitive skin but nothing has worked. Today I am grateful to have found this amazing all natural product. I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product and didn&#x27;t expect much of a difference from any other Shea butter, BUT! This stuff is AMAZING! I have used it for a body butter, a sugar scrub and just tried it for a sunscreen all of which I love. My skin feels so much better and rejuvenated. I can&#x27;t thank the woman who introduced me to this, Mrs. Jordan, thank you so much. 5 star product! Must have!</li>
            <li> The best thing I had ever order it help me with my dry skin and my acne</li>
            <li> Great product!  Quick delivery.......will be buying again and again</li>
            <li> I love love this product!!! I have really dry skin especially around the heel area. Using Bella Shea Butter on the dry patches for just a few days, I saw a huge difference! It even works on ant bites! I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter! I use it everyday, and several times a day on my hands after washing them and also I use it on a scar on my leg. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter that I ordered was supposed to be Ivory in color but in reality was clearly marked &amp;#34;Yellow&amp;#34; when it arrived.  I&#x27;m not sure what the difference was but it was not what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the yellow stuff called Sheabutter that I was slathering on my body before but this Bella Shea butter is the real deal. I put it on my scalp, knees, hands, wrinkles, etc. Doesn&#x27;t really have a scent. You have to rub this on your hands for a while before it becomes usable if you don&#x27;t you will end up with a colored paste tell its absorbed. For all over moisturizing I combine with extra virgin cold pressed coconut oil. My skin looks great is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I have never tried pure Shea butter before and I am loving it!! It&#x27;s very creamy and it feels amazing on my skin. Can&#x27;t wait to use it in my DIY lotion bars.</li>
            <li> I ordered bella shea butter and it arrived fast sooner than I expected. I love how it has many different uses. My favorite for the skin leaves skin super soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use when mixing with essential oils.</li>
            <li> My Mother and law told my wife about this product. So we bought it. it work wonders on my wife and I. I work in construction and at the end of the day my hands and feet are dry. I started using it on them and now  you can&#x27;t even tell that i work hard all day. my wife used it in my little ones at night great product. my family and i are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in time and in excellent condition. It has the right smell and raw Shea butter consistency. I personally like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone improved within 2 days, it got the pink glow of health back that I love so much and I measure every good cream by. It is very moisturizing and makes my skin feel so soft and smooths.&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much, I hardly use any other face cream or hand creme anymore. It even keeps my hands moisturized for a very long time even after I have washed them a few times. After about 4 days of using it, some of the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared as well! Super happy about that! I am OK with giving away some wrinkles in return for a younger, healthier look. :) Seems my skin needed it, loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> This soap makes me feel like I&#x27;m ready for prom and my date&#x27;s actually movie cute! Thank you Imperial Shea Butter for making my weekend!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used to have dry elbows and knees. I have been applying the Bella Shea butter and I within two days I noticed a big improvement. I was skeptical at first sight, but after applying the product i cant stop using. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell at all and again it works wonders.</li>
            <li> The best shea butter I have tried so far. It is very rich and I brought one to see if I would like it I did so I brought 2 more : )</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far, but I&#x27;m loving it!  The consistency is different than what I&#x27;m used to, but once it warms up the product goes on smooth.  I do not have any skin aliments other than some dryness, so I cannot speak to the other uses of it.</li>
            <li> I tried it,but haven&#x27;t seen results.</li>
    </ol>
