            <li> Really great stuff. I purchased this for a celluite treatment. The smell is amazing but be warned.... if using this product neat, you can expect a bit of a side effect. It will clean you out. Next time I won&#x27;t be so eager to get ride of my hail damage. I need to do it less aggressively. Best of luck</li>
            <li> Used this with other oils to help swelling in my feet - this helped.</li>
            <li> Great oil but it leaked through the whole package...what is left has been helping me with my swollen feet.</li>
            <li> Still a work in progress</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, as promised, and in perfect condition with more than adequate packing material.&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil and have used it in my aromatherapy for years. It is pure with a true fragrance. Great Company.&lt;br /&gt;Aura Cacia, and as always Amazon never disappoints. Thank u from the Flowergirl.</li>
            <li> Cap was loose. Half of product leaked into the packaging. Oils are expensive the way it is without losing have in shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to my homemade liquid laundry soap. I make 3 gallons at a time, and need to use quite a bit of oil but it&#x27;s worth it. A nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Always happy with Aura Cacia brand, smells great</li>
            <li> I bought this product twice. Once was last year, one was one month ago. I have received nothing so far. I waste almost $50.00 . I emailed the company, but no response .</li>
            <li> I use this oil with an aromatherapy diffuser and the scent is very citrusy and refreshing. It smells just like fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Love it!</li>
            <li> not as fresh and lasting as the grapefriut oils i have purchased in stores.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Aura Cacia products. High quality at a great price. THANKS!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this scent!  Grapefruit is very uplifting, and I love putting it in a votive burner or in my diy cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> This smells just like you&#x27;ve sliced open a fresh grapefruit!  Just a couple of drops in a warmer or diffuser will fill the room with the smell of  yummy, citrusy grapefruits!  There are also quite a few health benefits that go along with grapefruit, unfortunately I can&#x27;t take grapefruit internally with a medication I take so I just enjoy it&#x27;s scent instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This grapefruit essential oil is nice and strong so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the same results.</li>
            <li> the bottle was packaged great, it did not break, and arrived in within the estimated arrival dates. Smells nice and refreshing. Using it with other oils for a linen spray</li>
            <li> Very resonably priced.  Great packaging.  Great oil.</li>

            <li> I love this brand of essential oil.  The grapefruit oil is perfect, its strong but not too strong you don&#x27;t recognize the smell.  I use it for salt scrubs and as a bath oil in combination with several other oils.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying many of the Aura Cacia essential oils for several years.  For the price, their quality is outstanding.
