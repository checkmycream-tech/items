            <li>This had a great price on compared to other lotions I researched.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried A LOT OF different lotion from different brands, and this is THE BEST!</li>
            <li>The scent is not unpleasant and dissipates rapidly.</li>

            <li>Because I have very dry skin, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the next best lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft and smells gentle and nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and inoffensive.  </li>
            <li>For $3 it&#x27;s well worth the money if you&#x27;re getting these as an add-on to your order.</li>
            <li>Easy on, soaks in quickly, last a couple of hours, very little smell, and it is from what I think the best company for the masses to buy.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is right, too.</li>
            <li>like very much.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and is super soft.</li>

            <li>Never had a lotion make my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended by Consumer Reports and they were right.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good because it does not leave your skin super sticky like some other lotions may, but it also does not keep its moisture for long.</li>
            <li>I actually got a little bottle of this lotion at a Best Western hotel.</li>
            <li>Slightly greasier than my genuine original Vaseline Intensive Care hand lotion.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast as well.</li>

            <li>I bought this lotion for my 10 year old son, and he loves it!</li>
            <li>It is really effective and helped me get rid of some chapped and dry skin problems during the winter in a few days (using it twice</li>

            <li>It makes his rough skin in winter much smoother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but moisturizing, the scent isn&#x27;t bad (not distracting to me or anyone around me), and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>

This product does what it says it will do, has a very pleasant fragrance and makes my skin feel smooth and silky all over.  I stopped buying Vaseline lotions because their smell was so strong I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it.  Because I have very dry skin, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the next best lotion.  Having the opportunity to try this was amazing.  I use this all over including my eyes and face.  I don&#x27;t have to put more lotion on each time I wash my hands, which is a lot during a day.  My hands still feel great.  I asked my husband what he thought after using this lotion for a few days and he couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt.  He even likes the fragrance. I use this all over my face and body and love the silkiness I feel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this lotion to anyone who would like to improve their skin through the use of lotions.

            <li> The best ever. Never had a lotion make my skin so soft and smooth. I&#x27;m telling everyone I know to try II, I&#x27;m that excited about it. I&#x27;ve tried every lotion out there and will never buy another again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only body lotion I use.  It was highly recommended by Consumer Reports and they were right.  Amazon&#x27;s price is right, too.</li>
            <li> I first used this lotion at a holiday inn express and was never able to find it in a store. This lotion smells good and works well. The shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> and non-greasy formula is great. The scent is not unpleasant and dissipates rapidly. I like the flip-top and the fact that the top also is flat so it can be stored upside down, making the product easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used many Vaseline intensive care products and I like them all because they work. This product is very basic, soothing and works for dry skin and other things too. For example: I gave a bottle to a friend and she told me it was the only moisturizer that worked to relieve a sunburn she recently got on a trip to California. I know you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this product, it works.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good because it does not leave your skin super sticky like some other lotions may, but it also does not keep its moisture for long. It has a mild scent.</li>
            <li> Favorite! I would recommend to anyone. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin slimy. Absorbs quickly and is super soft. Leaves you feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> This had a great price on compared to other lotions I researched. This lotions keeps my elbows nice and ashy free</li>
            <li> like very much. have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Easy on, soaks in quickly, last a couple of hours, very little smell, and it is from what I think the best company for the masses to buy. Vaseline. My wife buys this all the time at our food store, and uses it most of the time. A very good product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> awesome for a daily moisturizer for normal skin</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  It doesn&#x27;t leave hands greasy and you don&#x27;t have to use it constantly for it to work for long periods of time!  Plus is smells great!  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> A very effective moisturizer. It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin. It is really effective and helped me get rid of some chapped and dry skin problems during the winter in a few days (using it twice daily).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for more than a month and the bottle still has some left so it could last more than a month for you if you use it on a few spots.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have tried others but basic Vaseline is always the reliable best.</li>
            <li> It is a very excellent lotion. It treats chapped feet if used regularly. It is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It is not greasy and makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my 10 year old son, and he loves it! It makes his rough skin in winter much smoother.</li>
            <li> Slightly greasier than my genuine original Vaseline Intensive Care hand lotion. I don&#x27;t know why they keep messing with the formula. The others are horrible though... so this gets five stars.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever! I&#x27;ve had 2 really bad dry spots for years and nothing worked, even prescription strength lotions and creams. I actually got a little bottle of this lotion at a Best Western hotel. It seemed to do wonders on my hands so I tried it on my dry spots. After two weeks the spots are almost gone, no kidding. I wish I had found this before I got the expensive stuff. The Amazon price is really great too.</li>
            <li> Mi wife likes for the kids. We were looking for an alternative to the traditional baby lotion we had been using on our kids every since they were born. The Vaseline Total Moisture Conditioning Body Lotion was the answer.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I ever had. I have dry skin so I need to put on lotion all the time. I have tried A LOT OF different lotion from different brands, and this is THE BEST! It is so soft and smells gentle and nice. And the most amazing thing is that it is not greasy at all! Already had like 5 or 6 bottle of Vaseline lotion and still loving it</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion we use now.  The smell is fresh and inoffensive.  My husband has no problem using this and then feeling like he smells &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34;  It truly is clean-feeling, leaving you with just smooth skin and no greasiness.  Because of the lightness of this, I&#x27;ve occasionally used it on my face in a pinch (I normally only use lotions specifically for the face, as my skin is prone to breakouts), and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my face breaking out.</li>
            <li> I was going through my body butter faster than I would have preferred during the winter, so I decided to buy this lotion as spring approached. It&#x27;s light but moisturizing, the scent isn&#x27;t bad (not distracting to me or anyone around me), and it&#x27;s cheap. It doesn&#x27;t hold up to the moisturizing levels of my Body Shop body butter, but it&#x27;s not supposed to - it&#x27;s a regular lotion, perfect for normal seasons.</li>
            <li> Obviously this isn&#x27;t a miracle lotion but it smells great and does it&#x27;s job.For $3 it&#x27;s well worth the money if you&#x27;re getting these as an add-on to your order.</li>
            <li> This is amazing how it softens my skin and absorbs so well. Love this stuff ! Recommend it especially for seniors who are challenged with dry skin.</li>
