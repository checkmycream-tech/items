            <li> I have tried various colognes for different occasions and this is one of those that spans across work wear to evening wear. It is not too overpowering and it does last a good while even after washing my shirts it still lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not one of the musky scents that a man would be accustomed to but it is definitely a new age scent that one gets accustomed very quickly when you start receiving the kind compliments of a great scent.</li>
