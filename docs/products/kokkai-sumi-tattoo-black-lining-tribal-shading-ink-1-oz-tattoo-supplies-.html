            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>that good good stuff brah i got tatted up all on my own</li>
            <li>I ordered this tattoo ink and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It only took a matter of days to be delivered, the pricing was awesome and the size is incredible for that price.</li>
            <li>nice quality ink.</li>
            <li>and i do my own tattoos</li>
            <li>Great ink, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>He enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Love it and will order more when I need it.</li>
            <li>I have done tats for years, I bought this because I am researching inks to give a better understanding of safe and none safe inks bought online</li>
            <li>I was more then pleased with the outcome of the two tats I have used it on.</li>
            <li>Okay i guess.</li>
            <li>but I thought it would be better</li>
            <li>hey it got here before time and the quality is pretty good</li>
            <li>and when i run out i will be sure to order this again and it has a twist cap for easy accesaillbty</li>
            <li>love how bright and dark it is great for darker skinned person</li>
            <li>I also had several people that the ink worked great with...  </li>
            <li>overall im happy with it.</li>
            <li>no it was cheap</li>
            <li>Best black ink I have found yet!</li>
            <li>but if you plan on shading add a few drops of DISTILLED water to it to lighten up the ink its a very good product</li>
            <li>I have never seen a black ink take as good as this Kokkai Sumi Tattoo ink!</li>
            <li>Kokkai Sumi Black ink is some of the best outlining ink I have ever used, so much cleaner lines then the alternatives</li>
            <li>I was thinking that this ink would be a good all purpose ink because it says lining Tribal Shading ink its not a dark black but a very good shading ink and WorldWide Tattoo got it to me fast.</li>
            <li>But no matter what, it fades.. quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly in the mail after the order was placed</li>
            <li>it fades fast and it makes more work than it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Only pro it cleans up nice.</li>
            <li>I love how dark and bold it comes out!</li>
            <li>(Reason why it only got 4 stars) is because of the screw top lid.</li>
            <li>I havent worked with it too much yet but its pretty rich in pigment and so far i like it</li>
            <li>Great ink not to thin or thick looks great will order again</li>
            <li>He said he like the product and is ready to order more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my tattoo stuck out so much</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS INK</li>
            <li>, I  tested it, came back clean.</li>
            <li>The color pay off is decent for the price.</li>
            <li>decent when turned into a graywash.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and wanted thanks!</li>
            <li>It is a one pass kind of ink that remains dark and even long after having the tattoo.</li>
            <li>Very surprised.</li>
            <li>but it might leak a little when you squrit it into your cap but other than that its a good quallity ink</li>
            <li>THIS GREAAT INK WHICH SHOULD LAST ME FOR A LONG TIME AND FANTASTIC PRICE.</li>
            <li>It stays black and doesnt fade into the blue looking color like most blacks do.</li>
            <li>so it came 3 days early.</li>
            <li>this ink is well worth the money its really dark esp when you do fill work example</li>
            <li>It does fade a little but not too much.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This ink has worked great I also got this on time and i would purchase again just a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> nice quality ink. no complaints</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and wanted thanks!</li>
            <li> this ink is well worth the money its really dark esp when you do fill work example tribal but if you plan on shading add a few drops of DISTILLED water to it to lighten up the ink its a very good product and when i run out i will be sure to order this again and it has a twist cap for easy accesaillbty but it might leak a little when you squrit it into your cap but other than that its a good quallity ink......your fellow tattoo artist ( T SEIZ )</li>
            <li> I was told it would arrive between 5/10 and 5/15. I just got it this morning (5/7) so it came 3 days early. Good quality ink for this price. Only complaint i have (Reason why it only got 4 stars) is because of the screw top lid. its like the gatorade bottles that the lid has a hole in it and you twist to open. The lid is not made with a sealing o ring so be careful and dont shake or squeeze the bottle, i did this to mix the ink and it leaked out from under the lid.</li>
            <li> love how bright and dark it is great for darker skinned person</li>
            <li> It looks bigger in picture.but hey it got here before time and the quality is pretty good</li>
            <li> Really love this ink!!</li>
            <li> Bleeds out when tattooing are maybe it&#x27;s the one  operating. I don&#x27;t think so but you can follow the advise</li>
            <li> This ink fades really bad after just a couple weeks...  and the bottle leaks like crazy EVERYWHERE. I have had 3 different people that I simply couldn&#x27;t use this ink on. Their skin just wouldn&#x27;t accept the ink properly. I also had several people that the ink worked great with...  But no matter what, it fades.. quickly.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my brother who is a amateur tattoo artist. He said he like the product and is ready to order more.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly in the mail after the order was placed</li>
            <li> Works great and came on time!</li>
            <li> we bought this ink and i do my own tattoos and my tattoo stuck out so much and it looks so good even after it healed !</li>
            <li> I bought this for a person. He enjoyed it. He loved the price. But not an ink that will last forever you know...</li>
            <li> Got here when it was suppose to and works well.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a black ink take as good as this Kokkai Sumi Tattoo ink! It is a one pass kind of ink that remains dark and even long after having the tattoo. I have used many ink&#x27;s and &amp;#34;Kokkai Sumi&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;MOMS&amp;#34; are the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it won&#x27;t allow me to track where my ink is</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND &amp; I WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Great ink, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> the darkest black i have gotten offline so far</li>
            <li> This ink is great! It stays black and doesnt fade into the blue looking color like most blacks do. I ordered it for my husband and he said he will never purchase anything but this again for his black!</li>
            <li> Not a good verity of ink is watered down to much create alot of problems when tattooing. Only pro it cleans up nice.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this ink again.&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t stick at all it fades fast and it makes more work than it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I havent worked with it too much yet but its pretty rich in pigment and so far i like it</li>
            <li> Great ink not to thin or thick looks great will order again an I also will tell others about this ink I was nervous about buying ink I haven&#x27;t used before but it great</li>
            <li> THIS GREAAT INK WHICH SHOULD LAST ME FOR A LONG TIME AND FANTASTIC PRICE. I REALLY LIKE THIS INK THIS IS A GREAT SIZE FOR WHAT I WANT TO DO</li>
            <li> Very surprised. This ink is freaking black black...</li>
            <li> The color pay off is decent for the price. It does fade a little but not too much. overall im happy with it.</li>
            <li> that good good stuff brah i got tatted up all on my own&lt;br /&gt;got 2 sleeves done and a big &amp;#34;f the system we all antichrists&amp;#34; on my chest dog&lt;br /&gt;this good for the klan i be in im in that devil worship type proosess g</li>
            <li> This ink would be great bt when you try and pore it into the caps it leaks from the sides, Ink gets all over the bottle and your hands.</li>
            <li> this sucked, bottle leaks is vary runny  not worth it if you starter tattoo artist want advice STARBRIGHT or Moms</li>
            <li> I love how dark and bold it comes out! Best black ink I have found yet! Love it and will order more when I need it.</li>
            <li> I was thinking that this ink would be a good all purpose ink because it says lining Tribal Shading ink its not a dark black but a very good shading ink and WorldWide Tattoo got it to me fast. If you are looking for a shding ink this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> I have done tats for years, I bought this because I am researching inks to give a better understanding of safe and none safe inks bought online, I  tested it, came back clean. I was more then pleased with the outcome of the two tats I have used it on. It flows well stays and doesnt have the grey look after healing. Good buy</li>
            <li> Kokkai Sumi Black ink is some of the best outlining ink I have ever used, so much cleaner lines then the alternatives</li>
            <li> Well, what can i say....it&#x27;s black! lol good buy for some good ink. would buy from this brand again definitely!</li>
            <li> whoever wrote the reveiws for this is full up to their eyeballs thin ink looks like its almost a dark blue in my skin and im white so not cool i would image its a bunch of chinese waste lead making it turn blue yes lead im throwing it out waste of money</li>
            <li> I ordered this tattoo ink and I am very pleased. It only took a matter of days to be delivered, the pricing was awesome and the size is incredible for that price. Basically it was like a steal. I ordered this for my son and he&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;ll be ordering from this supplier for his ink needs for now on.</li>
            <li> Takes a couple go&#x27;s to get into skin very dark. decent when turned into a graywash. Okay i guess. Seller is A++</li>
            <li> this ink is water down didn&#x27;t even go in the skin it messed  up my clients tattoo I would not recommend this ink to anyone I no it was cheap but I thought it would be better so i wouldn&#x27;t buy anything from worldwide tattoo supply there ink is no good.</li>
            <li> I choose this product because it was not only the color I needed, but also because it was the type of ink as well.</li>
