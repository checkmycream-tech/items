            <li> You definitely notice it start to dry out within an hour and within a couple of hours</li>
            <li> When I bought this product it was listed at twelve dollars, and I saw a bottle of regular grapeseed oil at the grocery store that was some odd 12 ounces for the same price.</li>
            <li> This makes it harder to deal with, and it probably the single ounce won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I will also say that it works wonders on my dry skin on my knuckles.</li>
            <li> Not sure it will last long though.</li>
            <li> It makes it difficult to use and control how much product comes out.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I would definitely not recommend it for travel or at least store it in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> That knocked this down from 3 stars to 2 in my book.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much for this beard oil, but I was shocked to see that it is only grapeseed oil in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It feels a little itchy on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little liquidy...</li>
            <li> However, because the lid is like a sunscreen bottle, it is difficult to use the proper amount.</li>
            <li> I know refining, additives, bottling, and shipping all increase cost, but I&#x27;m not sure what drove the cost up 12x</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not suitable.</li>
            <li> The problem is it&#x27;s made from a hard plastic which made it hard to squeeze any oil out.</li>
            <li> You would have to hold it against the palm of your hand and squeeze hard with all of your fingers to get the oil to come out.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s frustrating because I already have grape seed oil in my cupboards for cooking.  </li>
            <li> addition, the cap is extremely poorly functioning.</li>
            <li> But hey, it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works well beard looks fuller and feels softer.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is &amp;#34;grape seed oil based&amp;#34; with no other ingredients listed.  That&#x27;s frustrating because I already have grape seed oil in my cupboards for cooking.  The lid could use improvement.  The directions state: use 4-6 drops several times a week.  However, because the lid is like a sunscreen bottle, it is difficult to use the proper amount.</li>
            <li> Cheap and works. But smells like Vaseline, and is very greasy. Overall, its a pretty decent for $3 to $5.</li>
            <li> This was the 2nd bottle of bear oil I&#x27;ve tried since deciding to grow out a full beard. Honestly, kind of disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nice, subtle smell. Between using aftershave on my lower neck and deodorant daily, I didn&#x27;t want to add another scent to the mix. This has a very slight, pleasant fragrance that&#x27;s really unnoticeable within a few minutes of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s lower viscosity, really closer to water than oil, which actually helps distribute it in your beard nice and easy.&lt;br /&gt;- Does make your beard hair nice and soft and less prone to itching...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- ...however that effect doesn&#x27;t last too long. You definitely notice it start to dry out within an hour and within a couple of hours it&#x27;s back to a coarse, dry-feeling beard. It lasted less time than another product that uses Golden Jojoba Oil and Argan Oil. That gives the product 3 stars in my book considering the cost.&lt;br /&gt;- The only ingredient listed is &amp;#34;Grapeseed Oil&amp;#34;. When I bought this product it was listed at twelve dollars, and I saw a bottle of regular grapeseed oil at the grocery store that was some odd 12 ounces for the same price. I know refining, additives, bottling, and shipping all increase cost, but I&#x27;m not sure what drove the cost up 12x the amount. As of this review the oil is on sale for 3 bucks, and admittedly that is a pretty solid price point for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle, Oh, the bottle. That knocked this down from 3 stars to 2 in my book. It is a squeeze-type bottle as opposed to the eye dropper many other oils use. The problem is it&#x27;s made from a hard plastic which made it hard to squeeze any oil out. You would have to hold it against the palm of your hand and squeeze hard with all of your fingers to get the oil to come out. It makes it difficult to use and control how much product comes out.&lt;br /&gt;- The bigger problem with the bottle was that I went out of town for a weekend for a wedding and had the oil in my toiletry bag, When I got home I saw that the bottle managed to open in the bag and all of the oil leaked out all over my toothbrush, razor, etc. It wasn&#x27;t hard to clean up since it&#x27;s very low viscosity, however that was a big waste considering what I paid and that I had probably 80% of the oil remaining when I left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it&#x27;s a good oil when it&#x27;s on sale however there are other oils in the 10-12 dollar range which perform better, and I would look to those.my toiletry bag, When I got home I saw that the bottle managed to open in the bag and all of the oil leaked out all over my toothbrush, razor, etc. It wasn&#x27;t hard to clean up since it&#x27;s very low viscosity, however that was a big waste considering what I paid and that I had probably 80% of the oil remaining when I left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it&#x27;s a good oil when it&#x27;s on sale however there are other oils in the 10-12 dollar range which perform better, and I would look to those.</li>
            <li> Just grape seed oil save your money</li>
            <li> It feels a little itchy on my skin. But I have sensitive skin. But hey, it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> I give 5 stars for the oil, but deduct 1 star for the bottle.  My bottle arrived with a pop-top (similar to some shampoos).  The only problem with that top is that the bottle should be squeezable.  This bottle has no give.  What I&#x27;ve found works is to open it, invert it, and then give it one shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to the ingredients, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of questions about why it is not listed.  Fortunately, my bottle arrived with the ingredients listed on the label.  They are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;100% Pure and Organic Ingredients: Premium Grapeseed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Moroccan Argan Oil, Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Castor Oil &amp; Vitamin E&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product does give you a nice shine, though my beard does not feel soft after various times using it. I guess the if you&#x27;re willing to pay more for a better product it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, the girlfriend likes it. Also really has no odor so that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good-Buy</li>
            <li> 5 bucks? You really can&#x27;t go wrong. Other oils cost over three times as much. I&#x27;d recommend this as a supplement to any beard regimen at this price point. Wash your beard with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap once a week, apply Honest Amish Leave In Conditioner in the morning, and apply this at your leisure (I do it in the evening before I go to bed). Experiment and see what&#x27;s best for you. Instructions say 5-10 drops, I go about 7 or until my hands start to shine.</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant and dose soften beard. Not sure it will last long though.</li>
            <li> I noticed NO difference between this product and plain old regular glycerin, they both make my skin feel better, but they do NOT make any difference on my beard.  I stopped using it and started using much much cheaper regular skin lotion and i get the same result.</li>
            <li> My first beard oil purchase. Performs as advertised with no foofy fragrances. Thouroughly impressed. I can definitely tell if I dont use it. Not greasy but just the right amout of lubrication...</li>
            <li> This Beard Oil worked like a charm. It kept my skin from drying out and kept my beard from going wild. A great value and a great price.</li>
            <li> Great oil, fragrance is strictly from the oils used and goes away very quickly.  Oils don&#x27;t provide as much control as balms, so for my large and bushy beard this is barely sufficient, however for a short beard it is perfect.  I will also say that it works wonders on my dry skin on my knuckles.</li>
            <li> It came fast and my dad loves this unique stuff he&#x27;s never seen before. It smells so natural and good too.</li>
            <li> It is a very low quality oil but it was only $5.00. It&#x27;s greasy and does not absorb in your beard like higher quality oils would. I honestly, would not even bother trying it, even for five bucks.</li>
            <li> Buy a big bottle of grape seed oil.same thing different name!grapeseed oil 16 ounces 13 dollars</li>
            <li> Not terribly impressed. It is a little liquidy... especially when the ambient temp is above 80 degrees. This makes it harder to deal with, and it probably the single ounce won&#x27;t last very long. More viscous oils I have used in the past are easier to apply, last longer on your beard, and don&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  This is all natural, but as one other reviewer said, save the money and buy any one of the oils listed among the ingredients for a fraction of the price. The container leaves a bit to be desired as well. It doesn&#x27;t flex, so you cannot squeeze the oil out, and you have to wait for it to get to the dispensing end. The other problem is the lid, it snaps shut and any oil left near it squirts onto your clothing. Natural or not, that leaves stains. Oils with a dropper seem to work better. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Beard oil is very thin. I haven&#x27;t notice any positive benefits. I have used Texas Beard Company and Honest Amish products and would recommend either of those over this. Don&#x27;t be enticed by the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the cap is extremely poorly functioning. Its hard to get a consistent amount out and it is prone to leaking. I would definitely not recommend it for travel or at least store it in a plastic bag. I have a duffle bag pocket coated in oil for my efforts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much for this beard oil, but I was shocked to see that it is only grapeseed oil in the bottle. I have a big bottle of that in my kitchen. It isn&#x27;t even a blend of anything. Seems a little more effort could have gone into this.</li>
            <li> Price cannot be beat. It is primarily grapeseed oil with a couple other oils like linseed added. No scent and organic. 1oz bottle not 1.6 like amazon states.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves the way it makes his beard manageable.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so so soft now.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. it has made his bread so soft that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like it use too.&lt;br /&gt;i really like that there really  isn&#x27;t any smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;*I have received no instructions and the opinions expressed are my own*</li>
            <li> Did not make my beard soft.  But it did make it Shiny.  It did work on my fly away hair though.  Just a drop or two will do.</li>
            <li> Did ok, but after testing other products on the market I gave it a three out of five. The smell is that of motor oil and maybe some guys want to smell like they just changed the oil. But in a professional environment. That&#x27;s not suitable.</li>
