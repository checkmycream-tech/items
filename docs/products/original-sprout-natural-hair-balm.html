            <li>The product came wrapped in packing tape, which pulled off most of the label print when I removed it.</li>
            <li>I love the cream and body wash from this line</li>
            <li>So much better than putting chemicals in you hair.</li>
            <li>When I found this balm, I was so happy because it says that fragrance free, natural and organic.</li>
            <li>My daughter has wavy/curly fine hair</li>
            <li>and I feel comfortable using this on my baby.  </li>

            <li>I go to the Original Sprout website to buy my products now.  </li>
            <li>A little of this around the edges of their hair when I put it up keeps the frizzies at bay fairly well, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My kids have very curly hair, and it frizzes easily at the edges.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a strong smell.  </li>

            <li>It only holds very lightly &amp; decreases after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I suspect &#x27;someone&#x27; is filling used jars with a completely different product than labelled and re-selling them as authentic.</li>
            <li>Perfect balm for short fluffy hair!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a sweet, baby smell like the lotion, but it is relatively scent free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this styling balm for years and always bought directly from Original Sprout.</li>
            <li>Scent-free and provides quite a bit of hold, but totally water-soluble, so it washes out easily with baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It is both pleasant and unpleasant, but very light &amp; can&#x27;t notice when in hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More</li>

            <li>I use it to tame my curly baby hairs around my hairline and he uses it for light hold.</li>
            <li>first thing I&#x27;ve found that didn&#x27;t leave white gunk in my sons dark hair.</li>
            <li>This is NOT Original Sprout Natural Styling Balm!!!  </li>
            <li>Nice firm hold, but my little boy was rubbing his head and messed up his hair after a few hours.</li>

            <li> Nice firm hold, but my little boy was rubbing his head and messed up his hair after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not good.</li>
            <li> My only caveat is that a little bit goes a long way (too much will leave the hair greasy and sticky, which is of course the case with ANY styling balm).</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has a strong unattractive sent to it, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>

            <li> Not like their other products.</li>
            <li> no harmful chemicals,  2) a little dab goes a long way so this lasts at least 2 months &amp; we use it daily.</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell to it almost rubber like.</li>
            <li> NOT &amp;#34;Original Little Sprout.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave his hair stiff.</li>
            <li> Yet, I was overall disappointed because it leaves my boys hair greasy feeling &amp; has a slightly unpleasant Odor ( even though it is supposed to be fragrance free).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I understand the complaint of the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m filing a complaint with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This styling balm should be thick and paste-like, like a pomade.</li>
            <li> What was inside this jar was a thick cream, grayish-white in color, that feels and smells like baby diaper balm.</li>
            <li> This one smells weird.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that if you give it the sniff test its horrible..</li>
            <li> Sadly it wasn&#x27;t up to par.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> It is not what I was looking for, I hated it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my son since he was 2, he&#x27;s now 6. Love this product because 1) it&#x27;s natural, no harmful chemicals,  2) a little dab goes a long way so this lasts at least 2 months &amp; we use it daily. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> When I found this balm, I was so happy because it says that fragrance free, natural and organic. However this is so greasy and doen&#x27;t hold my hair and my baby hair at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this styling balm for years and always bought directly from Original Sprout. Decided to order through Amazon to save on shipping. Big mistake. The product came wrapped in packing tape, which pulled off most of the label print when I removed it. This made me suspect of what was inside. This styling balm should be thick and paste-like, like a pomade. It&#x27;s color should be creamy-golden and it smells like lavender. What was inside this jar was a thick cream, grayish-white in color, that feels and smells like baby diaper balm. I suspect &#x27;someone&#x27; is filling used jars with a completely different product than labelled and re-selling them as authentic. I&#x27;m filing a complaint with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This pamlade is great! my husband and I both use it. I use it to tame my curly baby hairs around my hairline and he uses it for light hold. A great product</li>
            <li> Nice product, works really good and my boy&#x27;s hair is now on style :)</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real thing. I have bought other products and they normally smell great. This one smells weird. Not bad but not good.</li>
            <li> Loved this- first thing I&#x27;ve found that didn&#x27;t leave white gunk in my sons dark hair. Is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave his hair stiff.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels gross and goopy. Not like their other products. Would not use on my or my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Great hold and SAFE ingredients for my kid&#x27;s hair. My husband and I even like to use this product. The jar lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I like this balm a lot.  My kids have very curly hair, and it frizzes easily at the edges.  A little of this around the edges of their hair when I put it up keeps the frizzies at bay fairly well, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like this product bc it is non toxic &amp; safe! Yet, I was overall disappointed because it leaves my boys hair greasy feeling &amp; has a slightly unpleasant Odor ( even though it is supposed to be fragrance free). I do use it in emergencies but not for every day use!</li>
            <li> It leave my son&#x27;s hair the way he likes it.. The only problem I have is that if you give it the sniff test its horrible.. But once its on his hair it didn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Perfect balm for short fluffy hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years on my kids.  This is NOT Original Sprout Natural Styling Balm!!!  Notice that the label is different -- calling itself the &amp;#34;Original Little Sprout&amp;#34; styling balm -- this is a knock-off!!!  The real products are made by &amp;#34;Original Sprout&amp;#34;  NOT &amp;#34;Original Little Sprout.&amp;#34;  BUYER BEWARE.  I go to the Original Sprout website to buy my products now.  Very disappointed in Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> Holds so well! We love.it</li>
            <li> Actually it is to greasy and made my sons hair look like it wasn&#x27;t washed in days.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you like that look.</li>
            <li> I will use this, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  I like that it is natural and I feel comfortable using this on my baby.  Unfortunately it has a strong unattractive sent to it, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Scent-free and provides quite a bit of hold, but totally water-soluble, so it washes out easily with baby shampoo.  Has never irritated our son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Natural. Washes out with just water. No scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great! Nice firm hold, but my little boy was rubbing his head and messed up his hair after a few hours.</li>
            <li> My daughter has wavy/curly fine hair so I&#x27;ve been in the market looking for safe baby hair products to tame her hair. I love the cream and body wash from this line so I decided to try this product. Sadly it wasn&#x27;t up to par. It has an odd smell to it almost rubber like. I didn&#x27;t even try it on my daughters hair because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Works great. Nice amount of shine. A nice nutty smell. So much better than putting chemicals in you hair.</li>
            <li> It is not what I was looking for, I hated it!</li>
            <li> I can see what everyone&#x27;s saying about the scent. It is both pleasant and unpleasant, but very light &amp; can&#x27;t notice when in hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly though &amp; why I bought this product was that I was hoping for the &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34; that was advertised. I was disappointed.  It only holds very lightly &amp; decreases after an hour or so. The hold would be fine for a few pictures, but not for the whole day. My toddler has ear length light &amp; straight hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years on my middle daughter&#x27;s wavy / curly hair.  It&#x27;s great for controlling frizz and defining the curls in her hair.  Nothing else we&#x27;ve tried works as well  as this product.  I&#x27;m not sure I understand the complaint of the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t really have a strong smell.  It doesn&#x27;t have a sweet, baby smell like the lotion, but it is relatively scent free.  If anything it smells like vegetable oil.  Once the product is in the hair, there is no smell that I notice at all.  My only caveat is that a little bit goes a long way (too much will leave the hair greasy and sticky, which is of course the case with ANY styling balm).</li>
