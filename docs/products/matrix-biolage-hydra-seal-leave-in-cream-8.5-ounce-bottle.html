            <li>I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I was not thoroughly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Fabolous, smell very well and my hair looks great, love it, 100% recommended</li>
            <li>so I could buy this more often.</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 I am pleased</li>
            <li>I have fine/course hair which is challenging</li>
            <li>but I love my curls.</li>
            <li>This product makes me love them  more.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this at a salon within my Walmart, but they quit carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I have found mixing it with some filtered water and spraying it on is the better application.  </li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s bouncy and light!  </li>
            <li>:  I had read in one of the reviews that this product was discontinued and thus, I immediately ordered 5 more of them from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>But, I have seen this product in many of the Retail stores around</li>
            <li>But, I have seen this product in many of the Retail stores around</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better for curly hair than this ...</li>
            <li>I love the smell and conditioning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>very light and clean, does not leave your hair greasy at all, just soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li>Awesome product for my curly dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product not heavy or sticky but gives hydration moisture to your hair  easy to use supplements your conditioning regime</li>
            <li>Excellent for sealing conditioning in before blowing hair dry!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>than I do the strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is if I mix it with some type of gel it gives a nice smell and can be used to re-wet hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Biolage is a great hair product and it is better off to spend a little more money to purchase it from a legit salon.</li>
            <li>but it does great on short hair</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>feel this item completely filled my expectations.</li>
            <li>so I could get free shipping, but that&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair free of frizzies even on humid days but not oily</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and  manageable while allowing a good hold.  </li>
            <li>I love Biolage products and most certainly was not disappointed in this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job and pretty much fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>Amazon prices are so much more reasonable than the salon!</li>
            <li>It takes a while for my hair to dry, but when it does, this conditioner makes my curls look great.  </li>
            <li>The people with curly hair that keep complaining about it need to kindly give it a rest,  This product was not a replacement for Biolage curl defining cream, it is not intended for curly hair,  read the labels on the products, if they are for curly hair they clearly state that on the labels, this product does not!  </li>
            <li>I will recommend this product, specially for over treated hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so soft and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in quite some time, though, and am very worried that it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it leaves my hair feeling so much softer, I just wish the price was lower</li>
            <li>I love it for wash &amp; wear days when no time to really style the hair.</li>
            <li>I love the whole Matrix Biolage line.</li>
            <li>Amazon had it priced right and free shipping.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the local hair salons and stores that sell beauty products.  </li>
            <li>price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>was quick..</li>
            <li>I find this to work great in the Hot Humid weather ,my hair gets Frizzy in the heat and very dry</li>
            <li>this product is amazing and lasts thru the entire day!  </li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner not only conditions but leaves my hair feeling amazing, and keep its style.</li>
            <li>It is one of the few styling products that works great for me.</li>
            <li>Hair has never been so soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li>This is effective, but I don&#x27;t like to use this every day to possible damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>well worth it these days</li>
            <li>and my hair feel so soft and manageable love it</li>
            <li>So, I have used many products (including a flat iron) to try to get that shiny look which does not come naturally to fine and color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t moisturize at all and it evaporates right off my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it not only smells good, but it isn&#x27;t stiff and sticky, and, does a really nice job \\&quot;taming\\&quot; my wild hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for women/girls with thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and this has been a wonderful product for me since ive been on my hair journey, the first time i used it i used too much, you only need a little, i think thats why people are complaining about build up and flakes.</li>
            <li>At first it may feel a tad bit hard/crunchy for the hair but it truly softens hair.</li>
            <li>My rollerset hair consistently comes out shiny, smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper then buying it at the salon!</li>
            <li>Keeps curls soft and smooth without the frizz.  </li>
            <li>It does hydrate though and my hair will look better the next day after applying the cream.</li>
            <li>I really hope not because I have no idea what I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li>I want to have it look as healthy as possible while reinforcing the strength, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>used the Lanza product line (Color Care or Moisturizing) on a daily basis and love it.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time getting this product  </li>
            <li>Although I love the smell, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come close to providing the smoothness or thermal protection of the Ten leave-in.</li>
            <li>And it arrived fast!</li>
            <li>Good product for limp hair</li>
            <li>Makes hair SUPER soft!!</li>
            <li>I mean straight-out-of-those-&amp;#34;perfect hair&amp;#34;-advertisements GREAT.  </li>
            <li>For a higher end product it really did not stand up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>- I will continue to reorder this as long as it&#x27;s available.in one of the reviews that this product was discontinued and thus, I immediately ordered 5 more of them from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Good price though :/</li>
            <li>The Hydra-seal made my hair smell good, yes, but it did not leave that soft suppleness to my hair that I could feel with other hair styling products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good at roping in coarse, grey hair, too.</li>
            <li>I have fine long hair and after the first application my hair was healthier, softer than it has been since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use more than one little pump worth.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of all Biolage products, but this one absolutely rates 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>and I tried it once when I was visiting her to find that it worked really well with my hair, so I went and ordered some for myself.  </li>
            <li>Gives me control over my hair and let&#x27;s me do with it what I want to do with it, not what it wants to do.</li>
            <li>straight and in a bob.</li>
            <li>I received this so fast</li>
            <li>this really leaves my hair hydrated and</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>If you use too much your hair can get chunky.  </li>
            <li>This is a very lightweight lotion (I don&#x27;t even want to call it a lotion because that word implies that it&#x27;s thicker and heavier than it is).  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling as if conditioner is in it, and it didn&#x27;t really control the frizz.</li>
            <li>This product works very well to hydrate and detangle.</li>
            <li>I have never used a leave-in product, but really like this.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that actually works to keep my hair looking nice.</li>
            <li>I use and love many Biolage products, but this one is not great in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I have super curly hair that is super dry and never retains anything from the conditioner I use.</li>
            <li>Love this product and all the other matrix biolage products</li>
            <li>- I will continue to reorder this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair heavy and gives me nice soft curls.</li>
            <li>a result of using this product, in combination with the Strengthening shampoo and conditioner, my hair is super shiny but yet bouncy at the same time!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Bubble wrap and a cardboard box would have cost a wee bit more and maybe taken a little longer prep time , but</li>
            <li>and it holds pretty much the entire day.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of my normal</li>
            <li>My hair is less frizzy, soft, and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I am amazed and am a convert - this is my new hair preferred hair care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and live in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li>It makes my thin hair appear much fuller and leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li>It not only is VERY helpful in de-tangling my long, tending-to-dryness older hair, it helps smooth down frizzies and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find unless a professional so glad to find here at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I first bought this same product from a salon</li>
            <li>It tempers dry hair, and calms &#x27;frizz&#x27; down, and best of all, doesn&#x27;t make hair hard, or shelled as gels and hair sprays do.</li>
            <li>I have fine, color-treated hair that gets dry with daily washing.</li>
            <li>honestly, this is one of the very few products that actually WORKS -- and works well -- for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old female to has fine, wavy, brown hair which is colored blonde, and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my hair look young.</li>
            <li>leaving her hair soft with natural glow.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call myself product savvy, but as far as hair products, it feels like I&#x27;ve tried them all (within a modest budget range).  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft like silk now.</li>
            <li>So far this is just what the hairdresser ordered.</li>
            <li>Made my hair too soft and lank.</li>
            <li>Just made it so soft that it had no body at all.</li>
            <li>This makes it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I use it when I&#x27;m going to wear my hair wavy and natural.  </li>
            <li>As my late father always said,&amp;#34;Do it right the first time!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Then I scrunch it with my hands (not too much towel-drying or hair-dryers) and let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>you dont need a whole lot i start from Roots to Tip depending on how long your hair is.</li>
            <li>I have dry straight hair with split ends.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure if that is a true statement or not.  </li>
            <li>so I am not sure if that is a true statement or not.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair and truly cannot live without this.  </li>
            <li>I could accomplish this shine with the Lanza Moisturizing or Smoothing line, but my hair felt heavy and by the end of the day (if it was really hot), looks a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it would weigh hair down, however, it absolutely doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry on clear and it flakes.</li>
            <li>Not particularly happy with product, though it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;defective&amp;#34; - just doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any positive benefits for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Often feels a little &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and there isn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;hold &amp;#34; to it</li>

            <li> Helps smooth frizz which is great.</li>
            <li> And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I have struggled most of my life to find good products for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love to see people with shiny hair, as I think that it indicates health and good grooming.  </li>

            <li> - it&#x27;s now smooth, strong and shiny!!</li>
            <li> It is a very light styling cream that works well with curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a very light weight cream, not quite a lotion.</li>

            <li> As a side note, I have short hair, and it works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Love it ,can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I like the feel of this better.  </li>
            <li> It works in place of a mousse or gel which is so much better for your hair</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel healthy.  </li>
            <li> Okay for starters let&#x27;s establish my hair...</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I was not thoroughly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Fabolous, smell very well and my hair looks great, love it, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> so I could buy this more often.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 I am pleased</li>
            <li> I have fine/course hair which is challenging</li>
            <li> but I love my curls.</li>
            <li> This product makes me love them  more.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this at a salon within my Walmart, but they quit carrying it.  </li>
            <li> I have found mixing it with some filtered water and spraying it on is the better application.  </li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s bouncy and light!  </li>
            <li> :  I had read in one of the reviews that this product was discontinued and thus, I immediately ordered 5 more of them from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> But, I have seen this product in many of the Retail stores around</li>
            <li> But, I have seen this product in many of the Retail stores around</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Great product at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better for curly hair than this ...</li>
            <li> I love the smell and conditioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> very light and clean, does not leave your hair greasy at all, just soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> Awesome product for my curly dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product not heavy or sticky but gives hydration moisture to your hair  easy to use supplements your conditioning regime</li>
            <li> Excellent for sealing conditioning in before blowing hair dry!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> than I do the strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about it is if I mix it with some type of gel it gives a nice smell and can be used to re-wet hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Biolage is a great hair product and it is better off to spend a little more money to purchase it from a legit salon.</li>
            <li> but it does great on short hair</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> feel this item completely filled my expectations.</li>
            <li> so I could get free shipping, but that&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair free of frizzies even on humid days but not oily</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and  manageable while allowing a good hold.  </li>
            <li> I love Biolage products and most certainly was not disappointed in this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job and pretty much fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> Amazon prices are so much more reasonable than the salon!</li>
            <li> It takes a while for my hair to dry, but when it does, this conditioner makes my curls look great.  </li>
            <li> The people with curly hair that keep complaining about it need to kindly give it a rest,  This product was not a replacement for Biolage curl defining cream, it is not intended for curly hair,  read the labels on the products, if they are for curly hair they clearly state that on the labels, this product does not!  </li>
            <li> I will recommend this product, specially for over treated hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so soft and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in quite some time, though, and am very worried that it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it leaves my hair feeling so much softer, I just wish the price was lower</li>
            <li> I love it for wash &amp; wear days when no time to really style the hair.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Matrix Biolage line.</li>
            <li> Amazon had it priced right and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the local hair salons and stores that sell beauty products.  </li>
            <li> price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> was quick..</li>
            <li> I find this to work great in the Hot Humid weather ,my hair gets Frizzy in the heat and very dry</li>
            <li> this product is amazing and lasts thru the entire day!  </li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner not only conditions but leaves my hair feeling amazing, and keep its style.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few styling products that works great for me.</li>
            <li> Hair has never been so soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li> This is effective, but I don&#x27;t like to use this every day to possible damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> well worth it these days</li>
            <li> and my hair feel so soft and manageable love it</li>
            <li> So, I have used many products (including a flat iron) to try to get that shiny look which does not come naturally to fine and color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t moisturize at all and it evaporates right off my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it not only smells good, but it isn&#x27;t stiff and sticky, and, does a really nice job \\&quot;taming\\&quot; my wild hair.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for women/girls with thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and this has been a wonderful product for me since ive been on my hair journey, the first time i used it i used too much, you only need a little, i think thats why people are complaining about build up and flakes.</li>
            <li> At first it may feel a tad bit hard/crunchy for the hair but it truly softens hair.</li>
            <li> My rollerset hair consistently comes out shiny, smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper then buying it at the salon!</li>
            <li> Keeps curls soft and smooth without the frizz.  </li>
            <li> It does hydrate though and my hair will look better the next day after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> I really hope not because I have no idea what I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> I want to have it look as healthy as possible while reinforcing the strength, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used the Lanza product line (Color Care or Moisturizing) on a daily basis and love it.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time getting this product  </li>
            <li> Although I love the smell, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come close to providing the smoothness or thermal protection of the Ten leave-in.</li>
            <li> And it arrived fast!</li>
            <li> Good product for limp hair</li>
            <li> Makes hair SUPER soft!!</li>
            <li> I mean straight-out-of-those-&amp;#34;perfect hair&amp;#34;-advertisements GREAT.  </li>
            <li> For a higher end product it really did not stand up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> - I will continue to reorder this as long as it&#x27;s available.in one of the reviews that this product was discontinued and thus, I immediately ordered 5 more of them from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Good price though :/</li>
            <li> The Hydra-seal made my hair smell good, yes, but it did not leave that soft suppleness to my hair that I could feel with other hair styling products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good at roping in coarse, grey hair, too.</li>
            <li> I have fine long hair and after the first application my hair was healthier, softer than it has been since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use more than one little pump worth.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of all Biolage products, but this one absolutely rates 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> and I tried it once when I was visiting her to find that it worked really well with my hair, so I went and ordered some for myself.  </li>
            <li> Gives me control over my hair and let&#x27;s me do with it what I want to do with it, not what it wants to do.</li>
            <li> straight and in a bob.</li>
            <li> I received this so fast</li>
            <li> this really leaves my hair hydrated and</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you use too much your hair can get chunky.  </li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight lotion (I don&#x27;t even want to call it a lotion because that word implies that it&#x27;s thicker and heavier than it is).  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling as if conditioner is in it, and it didn&#x27;t really control the frizz.</li>
            <li> This product works very well to hydrate and detangle.</li>
            <li> I have never used a leave-in product, but really like this.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that actually works to keep my hair looking nice.</li>
            <li> I use and love many Biolage products, but this one is not great in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I have super curly hair that is super dry and never retains anything from the conditioner I use.</li>
            <li> Love this product and all the other matrix biolage products</li>
            <li> - I will continue to reorder this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair heavy and gives me nice soft curls.</li>
            <li> a result of using this product, in combination with the Strengthening shampoo and conditioner, my hair is super shiny but yet bouncy at the same time!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bubble wrap and a cardboard box would have cost a wee bit more and maybe taken a little longer prep time , but</li>
            <li> and it holds pretty much the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of my normal</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy, soft, and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I am amazed and am a convert - this is my new hair preferred hair care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and live in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li> It makes my thin hair appear much fuller and leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li> It not only is VERY helpful in de-tangling my long, tending-to-dryness older hair, it helps smooth down frizzies and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find unless a professional so glad to find here at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I first bought this same product from a salon</li>
            <li> It tempers dry hair, and calms &#x27;frizz&#x27; down, and best of all, doesn&#x27;t make hair hard, or shelled as gels and hair sprays do.</li>
            <li> I have fine, color-treated hair that gets dry with daily washing.</li>
            <li> honestly, this is one of the very few products that actually WORKS -- and works well -- for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old female to has fine, wavy, brown hair which is colored blonde, and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look young.</li>
            <li> leaving her hair soft with natural glow.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call myself product savvy, but as far as hair products, it feels like I&#x27;ve tried them all (within a modest budget range).  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft like silk now.</li>
            <li> So far this is just what the hairdresser ordered.</li>
            <li> Made my hair too soft and lank.</li>
            <li> Just made it so soft that it had no body at all.</li>
            <li> This makes it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m going to wear my hair wavy and natural.  </li>
            <li> As my late father always said,&amp;#34;Do it right the first time!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Then I scrunch it with my hands (not too much towel-drying or hair-dryers) and let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> you dont need a whole lot i start from Roots to Tip depending on how long your hair is.</li>
            <li> I have dry straight hair with split ends.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if that is a true statement or not.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure if that is a true statement or not.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and truly cannot live without this.  </li>
            <li> I could accomplish this shine with the Lanza Moisturizing or Smoothing line, but my hair felt heavy and by the end of the day (if it was really hot), looks a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it would weigh hair down, however, it absolutely doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry on clear and it flakes.</li>
            <li> Not particularly happy with product, though it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;defective&amp;#34; - just doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any positive benefits for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Often feels a little &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and there isn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;hold &amp;#34; to it</li>
            <li> I have thick rather frizzy hair and it is also color treated so it takes a combination of the right products to get it styled how I want,</li>
            <li> I really like Biolage Hair Products i usually use Alterna</li>
            <li> I was hoping that a leave-in conditioner would be lighter and provide thermal protection from hair dryers and flat irons.</li>
            <li> my hair was flat and oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because I am looking for something to tame my frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it makes my hair just as shiny as if I had used my flat iron!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years on my very long, color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I figured it may be because some are unhappy that matrix discontinued another product and recommends this one as a better replacment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have really, really long hair).</li>
            <li> My husband has short hair that he likes to Mohawk it up but with out the wet sticky look.  </li>
            <li> Due to health reasons, I lost some of my hair earlier this year and it has thinned in the front.  </li>
            <li> Can even use when your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I apply this product after towel-drying may hair; use about 3-4 squirts and concentrate on the ends; then comb through and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> so it is always dry.</li>
            <li> Then, I use a hair dryer to blow dry my hair (you can probably let it air dry</li>
            <li> and I need to blow dry it to accomplish this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Biolage did not detangle, condition the dry ends and</li>
            <li> I use it to care for my dry, medium curly hair, and it works.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, dry hair, and this has made it so soft!</li>
            <li> not frizzy.i use this on my wet hair and let air dry</li>
            <li> I apply it when my hair is wet, and air dry.</li>
            <li> Biolage Hydra-seal has left my hair softer and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair that gets super dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li> You put this on your wet hair after shampooing and leave it in.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair a much fuller look to it,since I have thin hair now.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very coarse, very curly/frizzy hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders, and</li>
            <li> When I used it in my wet hair then let it air dry, it left a very stiff texture.</li>
            <li> Does make my hair feel softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, i use a leave in conditioner before applying gel or any other hair product that holds it tight.</li>
            <li> She tried other products but none compared.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other leave in hair products, but, none can compare with this.</li>
            <li> I have had this forever, and have to keep buying other leave ins, as i rotate my leave ins</li>
            <li> I actually bought this two years ago (before I started using Lanza) but never tried it - not sure why.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was broken on arrival and I had to switch it to an entire different container.</li>
            <li> So I love Biolage products, but this one was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m using it sparinly and not every day, just when the hair gets a little dry and messy.</li>
            <li> I always use this on wet hair after a shower, as well as to tame hair when styling.</li>
            <li> I usually use a little bit after showering and again before I style it in the morning (once it&#x27;s dry).</li>
            <li> My styling technique is to flip my hair over (immediately after the shower), comb it down a little with my fingers and then apply the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my hair and helps my little fly-away baby hairs behave during the day.</li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive, product seems a little on the runny side but came sealed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use Biolage because I find the shampoos too harsh, conditioners ineffective and the conditioning balm too heavy.</li>
            <li> I work this into my hair after it has dried.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday instead of hair gel.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times... made my hair a little too stiff for my liking...</li>
            <li> Very little does the job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 10 years or so.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I find that the cream seems to be watered down and leaves a residue behind when my hair dries.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find this product at stores.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I notice less in the way of hair &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> before buying this, I was confused by some of the reviews out about it.  </li>
            <li> I think my hair is too thin for this product.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry, this item didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a sorry replacement.  </li>
            <li> I hate that it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keeper!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to hear Matrix discontinued this product..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Natural ang great for all kind of hair</li>
            <li> This item is lovely. At first it may feel a tad bit hard/crunchy for the hair but it truly softens hair. It also makes fly away hair more manageable. I usually use a little bit after showering and again before I style it in the morning (once it&#x27;s dry). My hair stays content with no re-application. Hopefully buying again!</li>
            <li> I work this into my hair after it has dried. Helps smooth frizz which is great. I have had this same bottle for 8 months and still have not run out. I love it because it works and there&#x27;s no residue. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Its great for my hair!</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!! I have dry straight hair with split ends. I use it after Matrix shampoo &amp; reg conditioner. The leave in cream had done wonders for my hair - it&#x27;s now smooth, strong and shiny!! Will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Makes my hair so shiny and bouncy. I have gray hair that I color every 4 weeks. This product makes my hair look young. I hate that it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> this product My wife loves. she loves it... leaving her hair soft with natural glow.</li>
            <li> This product is the best for moisture and some mild to medium control.  The people with curly hair that keep complaining about it need to kindly give it a rest,  This product was not a replacement for Biolage curl defining cream, it is not intended for curly hair,  read the labels on the products, if they are for curly hair they clearly state that on the labels, this product does not!  This product works great for the hair types that it is intended for.  One of the best products for hair that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My Daughter has curly hair &amp; doesnt like frizz this product is amazing and lasts thru the entire day!  She tried other products but none compared.  Hard to find this product at stores.  So we ordered on-line!!!</li>
            <li> Good product for limp hair</li>
            <li> Makes hair SUPER soft!!</li>
            <li> I have to vehemently disagree with some of my fellow curly-haired gals here ... I have very thick, very coarse, very curly/frizzy hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders, and honestly, this is one of the very few products that actually WORKS -- and works well -- for my hair.  I love the fact that it not only smells good, but it isn&#x27;t stiff and sticky, and, does a really nice job \\&quot;taming\\&quot; my wild hair.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in quite some time, though, and am very worried that it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> before buying this, I was confused by some of the reviews out about it.  I figured it may be because some are unhappy that matrix discontinued another product and recommends this one as a better replacment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me....this one is the best leave ins  I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Some complain of tackiness, buildup or residue.  I havent experienced any of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this after I wash my hair, using about 2 dime size pumps.  I added ( matrix) spray leave in on top and then a serum.  My rollerset hair consistently comes out shiny, smooth and soft.  I use the entire hydratherapie line and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keeper!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  Smells great, easy to use.  I am not a fan of all Biolage products, but this one absolutely rates 5 stars.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it!. My hair looks soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She loves it</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  I have very long hair and truly cannot live without this.  It seems like it would weigh hair down, however, it absolutely doesn&#x27;t.  I hope they never stop making this.  I&#x27;ve tried other leave in hair products, but, none can compare with this.</li>
            <li> My fiance won&#x27;t use anything else. He loves this stuff! I used it a few times... made my hair a little too stiff for my liking... but it does great on short hair (I have really, really long hair).</li>
            <li> If you have that middle-of-the-road curly/wavy hair like me, then you should try out this product.  I wouldn&#x27;t call myself product savvy, but as far as hair products, it feels like I&#x27;ve tried them all (within a modest budget range).  My sister had some of this and I tried it once when I was visiting her to find that it worked really well with my hair, so I went and ordered some for myself.  My styling technique is to flip my hair over (immediately after the shower), comb it down a little with my fingers and then apply the conditioner.  Then I scrunch it with my hands (not too much towel-drying or hair-dryers) and let it dry naturally.  It takes a while for my hair to dry, but when it does, this conditioner makes my curls look great.  I mean straight-out-of-those-&amp;#34;perfect hair&amp;#34;-advertisements GREAT.  Frizz-free and it holds pretty much the entire day.  Granted, I would argue that everyone&#x27;s hair is different and everyone&#x27;s styling technique is different, so I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I can definitely say this product works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle. Gives me control over my hair and let&#x27;s me do with it what I want to do with it, not what it wants to do. As a side note, I have short hair, and it works perfect for me. It&#x27;s good at roping in coarse, grey hair, too.</li>
            <li> Love it ,can&#x27;t do without it. It gives my hair such body. Can even use when your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and this has been a wonderful product for me since ive been on my hair journey, the first time i used it i used too much, you only need a little, i think thats why people are complaining about build up and flakes. I have had this forever, and have to keep buying other leave ins, as i rotate my leave ins</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair that gets super dry in the winter months. My hair gets very static. This is the only product that actually works to keep my hair looking nice.</li>
            <li> I use and love many Biolage products, but this one is not great in my opinion.  Unfortunately I notice less in the way of hair &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; than I do the strong fragrance. I would not but this again.</li>
            <li> This product works for me.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement that I liked....and now they don&#x27;t make it anymore</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I was using Redken anti-snap and I like the feel of this better.  It leaves my hair soft and  manageable while allowing a good hold.  It works in place of a mousse or gel which is so much better for your hair</li>
            <li> This Leave -In Cream is wonderful. My hair is so soft like silk now. I will recommend this product, specially for over treated hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have thick rather frizzy hair and it is also color treated so it takes a combination of the right products to get it styled how I want, straight and in a bob. And I use a hair dryer and a heating iron. This leave in conditioner not only conditions but leaves my hair feeling amazing, and keep its style.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!  Easy to use, tip never clogs up!!  Very satisfied!  So much cheaper then buying it at the salon!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to hear Matrix discontinued this product.. I was very happy to find it online. I am a hair dresser and have been using this for years...love it</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken on arrival and I had to switch it to an entire different container. Good price though :/</li>
            <li> Great product; smells good and does its job</li>
            <li> I received this so fast and it was just what I ordered.  The price was excellent.  A great leave in product for your hair!</li>
            <li> I really like Biolage Hair Products i usually use Alterna but like to change products now and than.I find this to work great in the Hot Humid weather ,my hair gets Frizzy in the heat and very dry this really leaves my hair hydrated and not frizzy.i use this on my wet hair and let air dry you dont need a whole lot i start from Roots to Tip depending on how long your hair is. This bottle is an 8.5 ounce and will last along time.</li>
            <li> So far this is just what the hairdresser ordered. Often feels a little &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and there isn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;hold &amp;#34; to it but I guess that&#x27;s the idea. A bit costly so I&#x27;m using it sparinly and not every day, just when the hair gets a little dry and messy.</li>
            <li> I love Biolage products and most certainly was not disappointed in this purchase.  This conditioner helped put body and texture in my hair.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not particularly happy with product, though it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;defective&amp;#34; - just doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any positive benefits for my hair.  Not really worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I apply this product after towel-drying may hair; use about 3-4 squirts and concentrate on the ends; then comb through and blow dry.  Makes my hair look and feel healthy.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle this year.</li>
            <li> Okay for starters let&#x27;s establish my hair...I have super curly hair that is super dry and never retains anything from the conditioner I use. So I love Biolage products, but this one was very disappointing. It doesn&#x27;t dry on clear and it flakes. For a higher end product it really did not stand up to my expectations. It didn&#x27;t moisturize at all and it evaporates right off my hair. The only good thing about it is if I mix it with some type of gel it gives a nice smell and can be used to re-wet hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love the product. My stylist got to use this product. I love the way it makes my hair feel and it actually does what my stylist said it would. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 years now. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for women/girls with thick naturally curly hair. I have struggled most of my life to find good products for my hair. I love this. Leaves my hair smooth and silky.  Plus I love the smell of this product! I use it everyday instead of hair gel. Will order more when I run out!</li>
            <li> The best thing that happened to my hair.  Keeps curls soft and smooth without the frizz.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products for curly hair.  None of them come close to topping this product.</li>
            <li> I was not thoroughly satisfied with this product. The Hydra-seal made my hair smell good, yes, but it did not leave that soft suppleness to my hair that I could feel with other hair styling products. Also, the product will leave my hair feeling sticky for a while. This then causes lint to stick to my hair and scalp. Not cool. It does hydrate though and my hair will look better the next day after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> Fabolous, smell very well and my hair looks great, love it, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling great.Will buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it leaves my hair feeling so much softer, I just wish the price was lower so I could buy this more often.</li>
            <li> i love my item! &amp;#60;3 I am pleased&lt;br /&gt;I feel this item completely filled my expectations. therefore deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, i use a leave in conditioner before applying gel or any other hair product that holds it tight. This one does the job, no the best though.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love it for wash &amp; wear days when no time to really style the hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, dry hair, and this has made it so soft! I apply it when my hair is wet, and air dry. My hair is less frizzy, soft, and more manageable.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding! I&#x27;ve never had a product perform so well in my hair. I&#x27;ve used everything from Oribe, Aveda, Miss Jessie&#x27;s and etc. didn&#x27;t provide the results I anticipated. I have fine/course hair which is challenging but I love my curls. This product makes me love them  more. Thank you seller for providing this product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li> Made my hair too soft and lank. I think my hair is too thin for this product. Just made it so soft that it had no body at all. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> KEEPS MY HAIR FROM LOOKING FRIZZY</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have found in a while. I bleach my hair so it is always dry. This makes it soft and silky. And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Use this in my hair every time in wash. Need to combat the humidity. Hard to find unless a professional so glad to find here at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner!! I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 10 years or so. It doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my hair and helps my little fly-away baby hairs behave during the day. I heard it&#x27;s been discontinued? I really hope not because I have no idea what I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> Hair has never been so soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this at a salon within my Walmart, but they quit carrying it.  I use it every time I wash my hair.  It&#x27;s a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> This cream smells delicious but it leaves my wavy hair quite crispy.  I have found mixing it with some filtered water and spraying it on is the better application.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Best leave-in cream on the market.</li>
            <li> Great product not heavy or sticky but gives hydration moisture to your hair  easy to use supplements your conditioning regime</li>
            <li> I have frizzy in between hair from swimming that I have been battling with for years. With this product I get the perfect ringlets I&#x27;ve been looking for.  If you use too much your hair can get chunky.  Being the wash and wear girl I am I feel like I couldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair heavy and gives me nice soft curls. No crunchy hair and no frizz. I recommend this for naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old female to has fine, wavy, brown hair which is colored blonde, and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  I love to see people with shiny hair, as I think that it indicates health and good grooming.  So, I have used many products (including a flat iron) to try to get that shiny look which does not come naturally to fine and color-treated hair.  This is effective, but I don&#x27;t like to use this every day to possible damage to my hair. Due to health reasons, I lost some of my hair earlier this year and it has thinned in the front.  I want to have it look as healthy as possible while reinforcing the strength, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Lanza product line (Color Care or Moisturizing) on a daily basis and love it.  I actually bought this two years ago (before I started using Lanza) but never tried it - not sure why.  When I found it in the closet last month, I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use this every day after using the Matrix Strengthening shampoo and conditioner.  This is a very lightweight lotion (I don&#x27;t even want to call it a lotion because that word implies that it&#x27;s thicker and heavier than it is).  You put this on your wet hair after shampooing and leave it in.  Then, I use a hair dryer to blow dry my hair (you can probably let it air dry if you like but I never do this as I want it straighter and shinier and I need to blow dry it to accomplish this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of using this product, in combination with the Strengthening shampoo and conditioner, my hair is super shiny but yet bouncy at the same time!  I could accomplish this shine with the Lanza Moisturizing or Smoothing line, but my hair felt heavy and by the end of the day (if it was really hot), looks a bit greasy.  I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it makes my hair just as shiny as if I had used my flat iron!  And, it lasts all day.  And, it&#x27;s bouncy and light!  I am amazed and am a convert - this is my new hair preferred hair care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I had read in one of the reviews that this product was discontinued and thus, I immediately ordered 5 more of them from Amazon.  But, I have seen this product in many of the Retail stores around so I am not sure if that is a true statement or not.  I hope not - as I plan to use this daily until further notice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, great product for fine hair - I will continue to reorder this as long as it&#x27;s available.in one of the reviews that this product was discontinued and thus, I immediately ordered 5 more of them from Amazon.

            <li> I love everything about this product! The smell, how it leaves my hair, doesn&#x27;t build up or anything. Absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> got for my daughter who thinks this product is the greatest</li>
            <li> This was my first time getting this product  and I think its great.It gives my hair a much fuller look to it,since I have thin hair now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years on my very long, color-treated hair.  It not only is VERY helpful in de-tangling my long, tending-to-dryness older hair, it helps smooth down frizzies and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  Very little does the job so don&#x27;t overuse it or it may leave your hair feeling a bit greasy.  I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> Nice Product for Hair!</li>
            <li> Does a good job and pretty much fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> The best way to get this product without running around to find it!</li>
            <li> I love the whole Matrix Biolage line. It leaves my hair feeling so soft and the smell is amazing. very light and clean, does not leave your hair greasy at all, just soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time.  It is a very light styling cream that works well with curly hair.  Amazon had it priced right and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the local hair salons and stores that sell beauty products.  Checked out Amazon and there they were.  Bought 3 so I could get free shipping, but that&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;Good price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Keeps my hair free of frizzies even on humid days but not oily</li>
            <li> Love this leave in conditioner!  It makes my thin hair appear much fuller and leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Can see the difference in my hair already. Love this product and all the other matrix biolage products</li>
            <li> Use it every day. Hold my hair well</li>
            <li> I first bought this same product from a salon and I loved it.  I found it cheaper on Amazon and figured it would be the same product.  I find that the cream seems to be watered down and leaves a residue behind when my hair dries.  It looks like I have dandruff in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest not to purchase ANY hair products from Amazon.  The seller may not be trustworthy and provide you with tampered products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biolage is a great hair product and it is better off to spend a little more money to purchase it from a legit salon.</li>
            <li> I have fine long hair and after the first application my hair was healthier, softer than it has been since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive, product seems a little on the runny side but came sealed.</li>
            <li> I have fine, color-treated hair that gets dry with daily washing. I don&#x27;t typically use Biolage because I find the shampoos too harsh, conditioners ineffective and the conditioning balm too heavy. I ran out of my normal Its a Ten leave in conditioner and the Biolage was on sale. I was hoping that a leave-in conditioner would be lighter and provide thermal protection from hair dryers and flat irons. I was wrong. Although I love the smell, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come close to providing the smoothness or thermal protection of the Ten leave-in. Biolage did not detangle, condition the dry ends and my hair was flat and oily by the end of the day. Lesson learned I will go back to Its a Ten, if it works don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because I am looking for something to tame my frizzy and dry hair. I find this product to be watery and does not help define my curls or keep frizz away. Pretty disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> My husband has short hair that he likes to Mohawk it up but with out the wet sticky look.  It&#x27;s perfect for that.  Great product at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now. It is one of the few styling products that works great for me. It tempers dry hair, and calms &#x27;frizz&#x27; down, and best of all, doesn&#x27;t make hair hard, or shelled as gels and hair sprays do. I always use this on wet hair after a shower, as well as to tame hair when styling. It is a very light weight cream, not quite a lotion. I use it to care for my dry, medium curly hair, and it works. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry, this item didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Lorinda</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeeeee the product !!! And it arrived fast! There is nothing better for curly hair than this ... No gel, mousse or spray! Just this and nothing else</li>
            <li> Ugh, I wanted this product to replace my Biolage Heat Styler creme that Biolage seems to want to discontinue (though I find it on ebay now and then) since that is the best product ever.  This is a sorry replacement.  It creates a flaky reside on my hair and I don&#x27;t use more than one little pump worth.  It leaves my hair feeling as if conditioner is in it, and it didn&#x27;t really control the frizz.</li>
            <li> The seller needs to learn to package things better! You do not wrap liquids in tissue paper  and use padded envelopes even if they are sealed in plastic! Bubble wrap and a cardboard box would have cost a wee bit more and maybe taken a little longer prep time , but well worth it these days, I think when most of us can&#x27;t afford to lose a good customer! As my late father always said,&amp;#34;Do it right the first time!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Biolage Hydra-seal has left my hair softer and less frizzy.  I have curly hair and live in a humid climate.  Curly hair is unmanageable under such conditions!  This product has helped &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; the frizz!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and conditioning. When I used it in my wet hair then let it air dry, it left a very stiff texture. I use it when I&#x27;m going to wear my hair wavy and natural.  Not so great when I plan to straighten.</li>
            <li> It works really good for my fine hair.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  I would definitely recommend it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  Makes my hair feel nourished, bouncy and shiney.</li>
            <li> I have bleach hair and I use two pumps of this and my hair feel so soft and manageable love it</li>
            <li> This product works very well to hydrate and detangle. Amazon prices are so much more reasonable than the salon!</li>
            <li> I have never used a leave-in product, but really like this. Does make my hair feel softer and less dry. I recommend this product and use it with Matrix shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sealing conditioning in before blowing hair dry!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product for my curly dry hair.  Been using this for a year and my hair loves it and delivery was quick.. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and it does work.</li>
            <li> Awesome, hydrates my hair and protects it from the heat of the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I add some coconut oil to that and mix together in my palm then apply it through my hair.  IT IS GREAT.</li>
