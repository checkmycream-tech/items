            <li>Really great value!</li>

            <li>And 5 oz for $25 is great.</li>
            <li>Great Buy</li>
            <li>Great pomade that can hold my hair in place all day</li>
            <li>This pomade smells great, it holds great &amp;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pliability is great.</li>
            <li>: why dont you have your own line of cologne for these?!</li>
            <li>A good tip is to is mix both imperial &amp; star wax together to get a great result.    </li>
            <li>The most amazing thing besides the holding ability of this pomade is that it smells superb!</li>
            <li>The scent of the product stays with you for a while, which in my opinion is a good touch.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: good product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>This product does an exceptional job holding and manipulating in place.</li>
            <li>Great hold, the right amount of shine, and smells good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Will buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li>However , the latest generation is a nightmare !</li>
            <li>I can begin to explain how much I love this product!</li>
            <li>My biggest issue became my pomades, I couldn&#x27;t find any that worked well and looked great, that also washed out easily.</li>
            <li>great hold and easy to wash out with shampoo and no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>i would say star wax was has a nice shine.</li>
            <li>this holds very well, washes very easily and, smells great without it being to overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using a blow dryer will give the product a hardened finished, and better hold at the cost of flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Possibly the best pomade I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s because this pomade hardens compared to many others that don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I got it from my barber though the price on Amazon is a bit better</li>
            <li>smells great, great hold, a little on the stronger side</li>
            <li>Easily a 2-month supply, even if you have a lot of hair like myself.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>But if I want a pleasantly strong, natural-feeling pomade, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that holds strong yet give you that water model status look</li>
            <li>The holding power is fantastic.</li>
            <li>being said, I do have and enjoy using the Star Wax branded Clay, and I&#x27;ll stick to that for durable matte stylings.</li>
            <li>Did notice that this product is good on a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>It is a huge downgrade from the original version .</li>
            <li>Very floral and VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>This is great for men who are looking for a good pomade, especially for short, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>From the hold and shine to the smell (really unique), there just isn&#x27;t anything not to like about this wax.</li>
            <li>The hold is very strong and it has a high shine.</li>
            <li>It seems mostly matte to me also, but used with Mink hair spray, I find that it holds very well throughout the day (wind while driving, or even brushing my head while putting on my laptop bag won&#x27;t budge it).</li>
            <li>The smell has been change to, which in my opinion is a less satisfying smell more akin to an AXE product, but certainly smells good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that its just fine for women also who want an extra hold throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>NOT a blind buy.</li>
            <li>First time using the Crystal after using the Original and I have to admit this is one of my favorite products and wouldn&#x27;t change for any other!</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m familiar and even fond of the Star Wax brand, this product is by far</li>
            <li>Another positive is that it washes out easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Background: I&#x27;ve used Suavecito, Enjoy, and American Crew (clay, fiber, grooming cream)products; none of them have the hold, malleability, and durability of this</li>
            <li>the flip side of this is that it does readily wash out.  </li>
            <li>It holds very well, and its non greasy.  </li>
            <li>Unforunately, I cannot comment on whether or not the product works as I did not try it - the smell was too much for me.  </li>
            <li>It holds really well</li>
            <li>I was a big supporter of the original starwax crystal .</li>
            <li>It is just a great over all value and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>okay but not worth the try in my opinion...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Oribe rough luxury soft instead for a deluxe scent and similar</li>
            <li>This wax doesn&#x27;t pull off the natural look very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more for a wet or slicked back style.</li>
            <li>The blue is noticeably overdyed and had the effect of tinting my light brown/blonde hair a lighter shade of blue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is not very &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; or special.</li>
            <li>I have VERY stubborn asian hair (straight and only flows forward).</li>
            <li>(how old am I,</li>
            <li>but you will still be able to change things up a few hours later if you want...</li>
            <li>This pomade works great, the blue tinge (if a proper amount is used) will make black hair jet black, and actually holds very well.</li>
            <li>but there are not many strong hold water based pomades on the market.</li>
            <li>Sticky and heavy compared to other products I own that will give you a comparable effect (American Crew Pomade and Oribe</li>
            <li>but I feel that its worth it due to the fact that you won&#x27;t need a lot of it for your hair so the product should last you a while.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, you&#x27;re not getting ripped off in terms of quantity of product with Star Wax like you are with other high-end brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer to have a natural look (i.e., it&#x27;s not obvious</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li>It was very unlike other pomades</li>
            <li>Overall, I do like this product, but I&#x27;m for sure going to try other pomades as well because I usually use clays</li>
            <li>I work at a bank, so I&#x27;ll generally style conservatively during the day, then change it up in the evening - and this definitely keeps up.</li>

            <li> , price point is a little high</li>
            <li> Although my hair is only around 2&amp;#34; long and wavy, this pomade could not shape my hair.</li>
            <li> The product is blue but wont be noticeable if you emulsify enough and or have dark</li>
            <li> oz. goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about 4 inches long all</li>
            <li> It is quite thick however with that being said you don&#x27;t need much of it.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey but it is bigger than any other product in a tub.</li>
            <li> This pomade will dry &amp; harden in your hair like a gel, so if you want flexibility all day &amp; you like to restyle your hair throughout the day, then this product isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> It is not a very deep blue unlike the aqua/teal thumbnail color, and for lighter color hair might actually leave a blue tint behind.</li>
            <li> blue color is odd, but not highly visible when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> again?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, it had a pretty bad texture, it felt very inconsistent and overly gooey while spreading through my hands.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair, which is a problem with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve never had any trouble simply rinsing out my hair.</li>
            <li> Other reviews got my hopes up.  </li>
            <li> not easily applied/cleaned from hands due to thickness &amp; consistency of pomade.&lt;br /&gt;2.  not highly reworkable--</li>
            <li> Gave it away to a  black haired friend to see if he could use it.</li>
            <li> I have black hair, and I spike my hair up.  </li>
            <li> Wish they would make a product that is slightly stronger.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick black and any other mall product does not work to get the desired 3 inch spikes i want.</li>
            <li> once I run out in a few months.</li>
            <li> It was nearly impossible styling a basic pomp, and don&#x27;t even bother if your hair is the slightest damp, this product has very little control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one has seriously raised the bar on me.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> It stains your hands and your head blue and has a terrible hold .</li>
            <li> so it works in a mediocre sense but retains some hold for what it delivers.</li>
            <li> but I keep that a secret as for everyone else try it out for yourself!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, from my experience, the color of the pomade is uncomfortably artificial.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is BLUE and when you put it in your hair or mustache it stays BLUE.  I have brown/gray hair and it was a disaster. Gave it away to a  black haired friend to see if he could use it.</li>
            <li> after using murray&#x27;s pomade I needed something that washed out easier but, still held the hold. this holds very well, washes very easily and, smells great without it being to overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6/11/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The producers have now since reworked this pomade. It is not a very deep blue unlike the aqua/teal thumbnail color, and for lighter color hair might actually leave a blue tint behind. The smell has been change to, which in my opinion is a less satisfying smell more akin to an AXE product, but certainly smells good. The scent of the product stays with you for a while, which in my opinion is a good touch.</li>
            <li> Great hold, the right amount of shine, and smells good! Will buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li> Background: I&#x27;ve used Suavecito, Enjoy, and American Crew (clay, fiber, grooming cream)products; none of them have the hold, malleability, and durability of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance/Smell: The smell is noticeable, but nothing foul imo. The product is blue but wont be noticeable if you emulsify enough and or have dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair/Styling: I use this product for a combover w/ a part. I have VERY stubborn asian hair (straight and only flows forward). This product does an exceptional job holding and manipulating in place. Using a blow dryer will give the product a hardened finished, and better hold at the cost of flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to note that they give you a lot of product per order. I&#x27;ve used this 5x/week for 5 months and still have about 1/5 of it left.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic about the strength of the hold this pomade was supposed to have. Not anymore though. The hold is very strong and it has a high shine. And 5 oz for $25 is great.</li>
            <li> I was a big supporter of the original starwax crystal . However , the latest generation is a nightmare ! It is a huge downgrade from the original version . It stains your hands and your head blue and has a terrible hold . I stopped buying starwax and am looking for a replacement !</li>
            <li> the best part of this pomade is its scent great hold and re workable with water good all day pomade!</li>
            <li> Does not hold.  Does not allow for recombing throughout the day.  Smells okay but not worth the try in my opinion... Try UpperCut Pomade best best best.</li>
            <li> Before I grew out my hair to it&#x27;s current length, I would only rinse out my hair. I found that it kept my hair healthier, which looked and felt nicer not having frizzy damaged hair every time I shampooed it. My biggest issue became my pomades, I couldn&#x27;t find any that worked well and looked great, that also washed out easily. This pomade works great, the blue tinge (if a proper amount is used) will make black hair jet black, and actually holds very well. And I&#x27;ve never had any trouble simply rinsing out my hair. It seems mostly matte to me also, but used with Mink hair spray, I find that it holds very well throughout the day (wind while driving, or even brushing my head while putting on my laptop bag won&#x27;t budge it). I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Possibly the best pomade I&#x27;ve ever had. The holding power is fantastic. Great Buy</li>
            <li> Other reviews got my hopes up.  I might have given it 4 stars if I didn&#x27;t have inflated expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not a wear a cologne with this scent as another reviewer suggested, but the smell is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;The blue color is odd, but not highly visible when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issues are that:&lt;br /&gt;1.  not easily applied/cleaned from hands due to thickness &amp; consistency of pomade.&lt;br /&gt;2.  not highly reworkable--the flip side of this is that it does readily wash out.  If you like to put your hands in your hair, or retouch in the bathroom, you&#x27;ll find that you lose hold &amp; shine if you disturb your initial application much.&lt;br /&gt;3.  On a positive note, you&#x27;re not getting ripped off in terms of quantity of product with Star Wax like you are with other high-end brands.  5 fl. oz. goes a long way.  Easily a 2-month supply, even if you have a lot of hair like myself.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Another positive is that it washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;5.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair, which is a problem with other products.&lt;br /&gt;6.  It does darken the color of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;7.  I&#x27;d prefer to have a natural look (i.e., it&#x27;s not obvious I have any hair product in).  This wax doesn&#x27;t pull off the natural look very well.  It&#x27;s more for a wet or slicked back style.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I was looking for.  It holds very well, and its non greasy.  It is quite thick however with that being said you don&#x27;t need much of it.  This is an excellent product...a bit pricey but I feel that its worth it due to the fact that you won&#x27;t need a lot of it for your hair so the product should last you a while.  This is great for men who are looking for a good pomade, especially for short, wavy hair.  I&#x27;m sure that its just fine for women also who want an extra hold throughout the day.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair so it works in a mediocre sense but retains some hold for what it delivers.The one thing I have to ask the company that sells this: why dont you have your own line of cologne for these?!</li>
            <li> Star wax for me was an alternative to using Imperial Barbers pomade..i would say star wax was has a nice shine.A good tip is to is mix both imperial &amp; star wax together to get a great result.    Did notice that this product is good on a sensitive scalp, price point is a little high but there are not many strong hold water based pomades on the market.My hair is thick black and any other mall product does not work to get the desired 3 inch spikes i want.</li>
            <li> Unforunately, I cannot comment on whether or not the product works as I did not try it - the smell was too much for me.  Very floral and VERY strong.  This is going back.</li>
            <li> Sticky and heavy compared to other products I own that will give you a comparable effect (American Crew Pomade and Oribe Rough Luxury Soft Molding Paste).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not very &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; or special. It&#x27;s a bit overpowering in reality. I highly recommend the Oribe rough luxury soft instead for a deluxe scent and similar hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have owned this for a year and it&#x27;s at the back of my cabinet. NOT a blind buy.</li>
            <li> Awful. While I&#x27;m familiar and even fond of the Star Wax brand, this product is by far their worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, from my experience, the color of the pomade is uncomfortably artificial. The blue is noticeably overdyed and had the effect of tinting my light brown/blonde hair a lighter shade of blue. (how old am I, again?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, it had a pretty bad texture, it felt very inconsistent and overly gooey while spreading through my hands. It was very unlike other pomades I&#x27;ve experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the product is marketed as the stronger version of their two-pomade lineup. Although my hair is only around 2&amp;#34; long and wavy, this pomade could not shape my hair. It was nearly impossible styling a basic pomp, and don&#x27;t even bother if your hair is the slightest damp, this product has very little control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do have and enjoy using the Star Wax branded Clay, and I&#x27;ll stick to that for durable matte stylings. But if I want a pleasantly strong, natural-feeling pomade, I&#x27;d look elsewhere. (and I&#x27;d regret suggesting the slightly-too-pricey Uppercut Delux pomade)</li>
            <li> the hold and shine on this product is great! I can begin to explain how much I love this product! It is just a great over all value and a little goes a long way! Get this product it you guys can!</li>
            <li> First time using the Crystal after using the Original and I have to admit this is one of my favorite products and wouldn&#x27;t change for any other! If you&#x27;re looking for something that holds strong yet give you that water model status look this is def the go to option! All my friends always ask me what Product I&#x27;m using but I keep that a secret as for everyone else try it out for yourself!</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have used.  On my fourth tub now.  It is pricey but it is bigger than any other product in a tub.</li>
            <li> Great pomade that can hold my hair in place all day; it&#x27;s because this pomade hardens compared to many others that don&#x27;t. The most amazing thing besides the holding ability of this pomade is that it smells superb! A++</li>
            <li> smells great, my boyfriend loves this stuff! great hold and easy to wash out with shampoo and no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> This pomade smells great, it holds great &amp; it&#x27;s pliability is great. This pomade will dry &amp; harden in your hair like a gel, so if you want flexibility all day &amp; you like to restyle your hair throughout the day, then this product isn&#x27;t for you. The &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; finish definitely lessens throughout the day, and the product hardens in your hair after you&#x27;re done styling in about 10-15 mins. Overall, I do like this product, but I&#x27;m for sure going to try other pomades as well because I usually use clays &amp; I would like to explore with some pomades.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  I have black hair, and I spike my hair up.  It does leave a blue color which is noticeable, hence the 4 star.  Kind of expensive.  Wish they would make a product that is slightly stronger.</li>
            <li> From the hold and shine to the smell (really unique), there just isn&#x27;t anything not to like about this wax. It holds really well but you will still be able to change things up a few hours later if you want... I work at a bank, so I&#x27;ll generally style conservatively during the day, then change it up in the evening - and this definitely keeps up. My hair is about 4 inches long all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a self-confessed picky consumer when it comes to hair products but this one has seriously raised the bar on me. I got it from my barber though the price on Amazon is a bit better so I&#x27;ll definitely get it on here once I run out in a few months. Bottom line: good product, works as advertised. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it! Really great value!</li>
            <li> smells great, great hold, a little on the stronger side</li>
