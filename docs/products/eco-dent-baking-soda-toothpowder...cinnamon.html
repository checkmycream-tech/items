            <li>Very good tooth powder.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great--doesn&#x27;t touch everyone&#x27;s toothbrush like the paste--easy to travel with because it&#x27;s not liquid and tastes great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great, and zero toxicity way to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>Quite happy that I made the switch.</li>
            <li>and I switched to their whiting version and am quite happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the price</li>
            <li>I like the cinnamon flavor best and was so happy to see it available at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>This is a superior product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It is good for traveling, as it can be carried in a bag or pocket and is not a liquid.  </li>
            <li>The power of cleaning and the mouth good feeling after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good flavor.</li>
            <li>This is some good toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>My hygienist always tells me how great my teeth look and so easy to clean...!!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll outlast any tube of paste!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to find the cinnamon here.</li>
            <li>But I really liked this one (cinnamon)</li>
            <li>However, for my field gear, I think it suits the job rather nicely.</li>
            <li>The effervescence of it is really nice</li>
            <li>So glad to have a natural,product to use that is so good.</li>
            <li>This baking soda, cinnamon-flavored toothpowder by Eco-Dent tastes great, but rinses away clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very refreshing taste in my mouth, and on top of that...</li>
            <li>So, I thought that there MUST be a product out there built upon this kind of thinking, that might even do more or taste better.</li>
            <li>It is still a great product I just had very high expectations.</li>
            <li>Better than the paste on many levels...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this item for about 2 years and it works better than toothpaste.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Leaves more room in my liquids bag through security and just lasts forever</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tooth powder.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>A+++ product...and fluoride free!</li>
            <li>This time when I checked to buy more I ordered some cinnamon flavored because I love cinnamon.</li>
            <li>But it just does not have the richness of that cinnamon punch that I love.</li>
            <li>Eco-dent baking soda tooth powder does a better job of keeping tartar and plaque away than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>By using Eco-dent with daily flossing, my dental health has improved to the point where even my dentist and hygienist are impressed.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpowder.</li>
            <li>Made your teeth feel very clean</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t full of kind of chemical</li>
            <li>If you plan to travel with this tooth powder, keep it in the original Eco-Dent bottle, unless you want everything in your bag to smell of Eco-Dent forever!</li>
            <li>I really like Eco-dent toothpowder, and especially love this intense cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing, makes my teeth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flavor is acceptable, although the aftertaste isn&#x27;t really that good.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste cleans very well, tastes great, and leaves breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never been so clean and healthy (and I had oral issues for years;</li>
            <li>Easy to use and to travel with.</li>
            <li>fine.  </li>
            <li>But I do enjoy brushing without that overpowering &amp;#34;minty-fresh&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>effin fabulous.</li>
            <li>Okay, but not as good as the regular Eco-Dent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I found the Lemon-Lime flavor to be absolutely repulsive, the Cinnamon flavor is a pretty pleasant -- if acquired -- taste.</li>
            <li>Most toothbrushes today have bristles spaced too far apart for the powder to sit on top of.  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of a lot of junk, but still leaves a clean</li>
            <li>Ladies and gentlemen,&lt;br /&gt;it get me squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>It foams up really nicely and doesn&#x27;t have any wacky ingredients (especially fluoride).</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth and mouth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Paired with a Radius toothbrush, my mouth has never felt so sparkling clean.</li>
            <li>Baking soda is great for cleaning, try household baking soda on stained sinks, pots, pans, your oven, anything.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more widely available, but most stores only carry the mint.</li>
            <li>The lemon-lime flavor in this toothpowder is different, but a good switch from mint.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been brushing with straight baking soda for a while now, and my teeth have never felt better or cleaner.</li>
            <li>The first taste is fine</li>
            <li>It also tastes great and doesn&#x27;t create as much foam as regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Great product and one of the few I can find that doesn&#x27;t use fluoride or glycerine.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I assume it cleaned my teeth properly</li>
            <li>I like the powder, but it will be nice to find out before ordering that it is only for 1 bottle instead of 2.</li>
            <li>breath was still fresh.</li>
            <li>Apr 20/17: Still using this for travelling everywhere after several years and still loving it.  </li>
            <li>Had to buy cream for cracked lips &amp; crustiness and it helped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I love how clean and white this product leaves my teeth.</li>
            <li>People who brush right after eating do themselves a disfavor.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>No more sloughing in my mouth and my dentist is happy with my hygiene.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product for travelling, especially with carryon only.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I floss at night and brush with my sonycare first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>but I would have to say the same about most toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 years and just emptied my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>If it does, the powder in the tip of the nozzle will start to harden and you won&#x27;t be able to get the powder out next time.  </li>
            <li>Used Sensodyne, which helped most of the time, but then read about how toothpastes prevent re-mineralization and actually exacerbate sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>At home, I find myself reaching more and more for this as I actually am coming to prefer it over regular toothpaste in a tube.</li>
            <li>When you first start brushing with it, it makes your mouth taste fizzy and cinnamon-y.</li>
            <li>I have used Eco-Dent Regular Care Cinnamon, Special Care Tarter and Special Care Whitening, consistently for one year now.</li>
            <li>stuff leaves your teeth and mouth super clean, and actually removes film and stain from your teeth and mouth.</li>
            <li>Certainly not the old Colgate Tooth Powder or Arm and Hammer Tooth Powder, but this is good.</li>
            <li>Product is good however the back is covered with a large product code sticker  that covers the entire label the instruction for use, cautions and ingredients.</li>
            <li>I do not like regular tooth paste because it is just too strong</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need much, especially with a good electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I began using Eco-Dent and found that the sensitivity totally disappeared the very first time I used the product!  </li>
            <li>Cinnamon flavor was sort of a surprise as I expected more of a baking soda taste.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I do enjoy using this &#x27;different&#x27; product.</li>
            <li>It cleans really well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you try it out!</li>
            <li>Not so much for my children</li>
            <li>as well (like them all, really).</li>
            <li>Really like this toothpowder.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I can really get 200 brushings out of one bottle, but I can tell it will be quite a</li>
            <li>so u can&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste a lot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially convenient when traveling or backpacking because you can take what you need more easily than with conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Also, as you spray the toothbrush with powder, make sure you rinse the powder that spills over down the drain.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like that these products have a more mild, less intensely sweet flavor than standard, commercial toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant on the cinnamon flavor, but found that I like it a lot better than their mint, which I previously had.  </li>
            <li>I thought this particular flavor was overpowering</li>
            <li>The taste is pretty strongly that of baking soda, with a little cinnamon, but it isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Eco-Dent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The powder lathers up well and seems to do a good job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the blue Eco-Dent bottle is tall, inflexible, and larger than you would need for most trips, I made the mistake of transferring some of it to another container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, if I eat a lot of blueberries, drink lots of tea etc., my teeth will be slightly less white, white, but still look great.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt very clean and smooth after use, I just shook a little bit onto a dry toothbrush and started brushing.</li>
            <li>This product cleans my teeth a lot faster than normal toothpaste does, and it&#x27;s not liquid</li>
            <li>/&gt;The super pungent smell of the Eco-Dent powder was able to seep through a small silicon GoToob, saturate a lined Dopp kit, and seep into the surrounding carry-on in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 new bottles.  </li>
            <li>like the fact it really foams up and gets the mouth clean with just a little bit of powder.  </li>
            <li>All of this is likely due to the fact that since I stopped using toothpaste (which has glycerin in it), my teeth have been able to remineralize.</li>
            <li>There are no clear instructions on how to use this stuff, so I have no idea if I&#x27;m doing it right or not.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, I was surprised how much cleaner my teeth actually felt, compared to regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The tooth powder is something that takes a little bit of getting used to before you can enjoy it.</li>
            <li>After using a little more I would recommend a different flavor,, Cinnamon is going to take me time to get used to.</li>
            <li>Toothpowder leaves your mouth feeling clean and natural instead of slightly sticky with that sugary or minty aftertaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You feel  the action of the baking soda and the tastes of the cinnamon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do with the rest of the bottle, but I&#x27;m going back to straight baking soda--or maybe I&#x27;ll try baking soda and sea salt, but</li>
            <li>interested me in it was this: It&#x27;s small, light weight, and won&#x27;t be likely to leak all over my stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is not only travel friendly but also devoid of all the chemicals I don&#x27;t want in those &amp;#34;leading brands&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so I go to back to dentist a year later and was told that the tooth in question actually looked a lot better and will only need a deep filling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their entire line of tooth powders.</li>
            <li>Once you get past the funky taste (unless you really like the taste of baking soda), it&#x27;s really not so bad, especially with the zingy cinnamon flavor.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned when I saw the size of the bottle about how long it would last, bit it takes such a small amount of power to get a nice froth.</li>
            <li>Using a powder takes a little getting used to, but your teeth will feel as if you&#x27;ve just had them professionally cleaned, and I love the Cinnamon as well as several other flavors.  </li>
            <li>I like to use natural beauty care products and have tried different brands from the health food store incl.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon can barely be discerned in the taste of the powder.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice a major difference in your teeth and gums within a few weeks of consistent use.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one of those people like me whose mouth never feels quite clean after brushing with toothpaste, you&#x27;ll like switching to powder - at least now and then.</li>
            <li>This really cleans my teeth well and is a healthy alternative to toothpaste with added chemicals, fluoride, and artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li>Side note: If you try the whitening version, use it twice each day for two weeks straight (solely) then alternate with one or two of their other tooth powders thereafter for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Actually, seem to have polished the  tooth enamel .It&#x27;s powder ,so you have to be careful not to loose as much on each application on the brush.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of a non-spicy cinnamon flavor and is a little salty, but understanding this is different than the normal texture and taste of commercial toothpastes, it&#x27;s pretty inoffensive in my opinion.</li>

            <li> breath was still fresh.</li>
            <li> Apr 20/17: Still using this for travelling everywhere after several years and still loving it.  </li>
            <li> Had to buy cream for cracked lips &amp; crustiness and it helped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I love how clean and white this product leaves my teeth.</li>
            <li> People who brush right after eating do themselves a disfavor.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> No more sloughing in my mouth and my dentist is happy with my hygiene.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product for travelling, especially with carryon only.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> I floss at night and brush with my sonycare first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> but I would have to say the same about most toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 years and just emptied my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> If it does, the powder in the tip of the nozzle will start to harden and you won&#x27;t be able to get the powder out next time.  </li>
            <li> Used Sensodyne, which helped most of the time, but then read about how toothpastes prevent re-mineralization and actually exacerbate sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> At home, I find myself reaching more and more for this as I actually am coming to prefer it over regular toothpaste in a tube.</li>
            <li> When you first start brushing with it, it makes your mouth taste fizzy and cinnamon-y.</li>
            <li> I have used Eco-Dent Regular Care Cinnamon, Special Care Tarter and Special Care Whitening, consistently for one year now.</li>
            <li> stuff leaves your teeth and mouth super clean, and actually removes film and stain from your teeth and mouth.</li>
            <li> Certainly not the old Colgate Tooth Powder or Arm and Hammer Tooth Powder, but this is good.</li>
            <li> Product is good however the back is covered with a large product code sticker  that covers the entire label the instruction for use, cautions and ingredients.</li>
            <li> I do not like regular tooth paste because it is just too strong</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need much, especially with a good electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I began using Eco-Dent and found that the sensitivity totally disappeared the very first time I used the product!  </li>
            <li> Cinnamon flavor was sort of a surprise as I expected more of a baking soda taste.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I do enjoy using this &#x27;different&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> It cleans really well</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you try it out!</li>
            <li> Not so much for my children</li>
            <li> as well (like them all, really).</li>
            <li> Really like this toothpowder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can really get 200 brushings out of one bottle, but I can tell it will be quite a</li>
            <li> so u can&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste a lot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially convenient when traveling or backpacking because you can take what you need more easily than with conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Also, as you spray the toothbrush with powder, make sure you rinse the powder that spills over down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like that these products have a more mild, less intensely sweet flavor than standard, commercial toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on the cinnamon flavor, but found that I like it a lot better than their mint, which I previously had.  </li>
            <li> I thought this particular flavor was overpowering</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty strongly that of baking soda, with a little cinnamon, but it isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Eco-Dent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The powder lathers up well and seems to do a good job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the blue Eco-Dent bottle is tall, inflexible, and larger than you would need for most trips, I made the mistake of transferring some of it to another container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, if I eat a lot of blueberries, drink lots of tea etc., my teeth will be slightly less white, white, but still look great.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt very clean and smooth after use, I just shook a little bit onto a dry toothbrush and started brushing.</li>
            <li> This product cleans my teeth a lot faster than normal toothpaste does, and it&#x27;s not liquid</li>
            <li> /&gt;The super pungent smell of the Eco-Dent powder was able to seep through a small silicon GoToob, saturate a lined Dopp kit, and seep into the surrounding carry-on in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 new bottles.  </li>
            <li> like the fact it really foams up and gets the mouth clean with just a little bit of powder.  </li>
            <li> All of this is likely due to the fact that since I stopped using toothpaste (which has glycerin in it), my teeth have been able to remineralize.</li>
            <li> There are no clear instructions on how to use this stuff, so I have no idea if I&#x27;m doing it right or not.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, I was surprised how much cleaner my teeth actually felt, compared to regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The tooth powder is something that takes a little bit of getting used to before you can enjoy it.</li>
            <li> After using a little more I would recommend a different flavor,, Cinnamon is going to take me time to get used to.</li>
            <li> Toothpowder leaves your mouth feeling clean and natural instead of slightly sticky with that sugary or minty aftertaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You feel  the action of the baking soda and the tastes of the cinnamon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do with the rest of the bottle, but I&#x27;m going back to straight baking soda--or maybe I&#x27;ll try baking soda and sea salt, but</li>
            <li> interested me in it was this: It&#x27;s small, light weight, and won&#x27;t be likely to leak all over my stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is not only travel friendly but also devoid of all the chemicals I don&#x27;t want in those &amp;#34;leading brands&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I go to back to dentist a year later and was told that the tooth in question actually looked a lot better and will only need a deep filling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend their entire line of tooth powders.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the funky taste (unless you really like the taste of baking soda), it&#x27;s really not so bad, especially with the zingy cinnamon flavor.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned when I saw the size of the bottle about how long it would last, bit it takes such a small amount of power to get a nice froth.</li>
            <li> Using a powder takes a little getting used to, but your teeth will feel as if you&#x27;ve just had them professionally cleaned, and I love the Cinnamon as well as several other flavors.  </li>
            <li> I like to use natural beauty care products and have tried different brands from the health food store incl.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon can barely be discerned in the taste of the powder.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice a major difference in your teeth and gums within a few weeks of consistent use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those people like me whose mouth never feels quite clean after brushing with toothpaste, you&#x27;ll like switching to powder - at least now and then.</li>
            <li> This really cleans my teeth well and is a healthy alternative to toothpaste with added chemicals, fluoride, and artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> Side note: If you try the whitening version, use it twice each day for two weeks straight (solely) then alternate with one or two of their other tooth powders thereafter for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Actually, seem to have polished the  tooth enamel .It&#x27;s powder ,so you have to be careful not to loose as much on each application on the brush.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a non-spicy cinnamon flavor and is a little salty, but understanding this is different than the normal texture and taste of commercial toothpastes, it&#x27;s pretty inoffensive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but it left my mouth crusty on the corners &amp; lips extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> My mouth actually feels less acidic after i brush and things actually taste different.</li>
            <li> I no longer have that nasty aftertaste in my mouth from brushing and i feel a lot more clean on the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a very effervescent toothpowder - I should note that I had never tried anything but toothpaste before buying this, but it&#x27;s actually common sense - take out the water and other liquids in toothpaste, and you would be left with a concentrated teeth-cleaner.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and each bottle generally lasts me over 6 months with 2 people using from it.</li>
            <li> For 1 bottle, it is actually a little more expensive than other Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> Eco dent came in as expected, I used the tooth powder and it worked.  </li>
            <li> So you thoroughly wet your toothbrush and then spray the tooth powder atop your toothbrush over hte sink.  </li>
            <li> Switched over to Eco-Dent Toothpowder a few years ago and will never buy regular toothpaste again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> certainly not this again.</li>
            <li> Then after a few seconds it dies down, and it lathers well - just like regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t find this locally, so I stock up on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i usually just stick the brush way in the back teeth and keep it away from my tongue until its fully dissolved.</li>
            <li> I waited due to</li>
            <li> Took me forever to it cleaned out of my clothes and other gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small bottles last for months!</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other flavors, but I prefer cinnamon, hands down.</li>
            <li> I bought one in mint flavor and it was the same icky after flavor.  </li>
            <li> I always feel like half of it is ending up in the sink (or at the bottom of the bristles).  </li>
            <li> previously bought a bottle of this to test it out.  </li>
            <li> i brushed with it before seeing mumford&amp;sons (irrelevant, but brag-worthy) ate at panera, went to the concert, drank a little bit, and went to a diner on the way home, AND EVEN AFTER THAT my mouth didn&#x27;t taste gross or anything.</li>
            <li> If not, it will form a little crush in your sink.  </li>
            <li> Just use a little water and make a paste.</li>
            <li> He had a hard time finding a flavor other than mint.</li>
            <li> but the after taste is really yucky to me, sort of like bad canned milk.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will use this all the time, but it will be a travel staple.</li>
            <li> It took me 25 minutes to remove it small piece at a time</li>
            <li> the bottle is small so dont over shoot the tooth brush, works well for tooth powered brushing.</li>
            <li> Regular toothpaste feels weird now.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less expensive...</li>
            <li> This stuff just pours out and its hard to tell if any is even on/in your tooth brush.</li>
            <li> , it feels just like when you were a little kid, and you said something wrong, and had to have your mouth washed out with soap!</li>
            <li> In addition, it has lessened sensitivity to cold from receding gums.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product for two weeks in Europe. My teeth felt very clean and smooth after use, I just shook a little bit onto a dry toothbrush and started brushing. It has a little bit of a non-spicy cinnamon flavor and is a little salty, but understanding this is different than the normal texture and taste of commercial toothpastes, it&#x27;s pretty inoffensive in my opinion. Does not leave any aftertaste after brushing and rinsing. I&#x27;m not sure if I will use this all the time, but it will be a travel staple.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  It leaves a very refreshing taste in my mouth, and on top of that...it does the job of cleaning!</li>
            <li> I love how clean and white this product leaves my teeth. I like to use natural beauty care products and have tried different brands from the health food store incl. tooth soap. This one has given me the best results. Of course, if I eat a lot of blueberries, drink lots of tea etc., my teeth will be slightly less white, white, but still look great. I floss at night and brush with my sonycare first thing in the morning. I learned that this protects the enamel which has a chance to recover after being bombarded with foods including acidic ones during the day. People who brush right after eating do themselves a disfavor. Just floss and rinse all day.</li>
            <li> Way easier to pack and travel with given TSA restrictions on liquids. The taste is pretty strongly that of baking soda, with a little cinnamon, but it isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> There are no clear instructions on how to use this stuff, so I have no idea if I&#x27;m doing it right or not.  Most toothbrushes today have bristles spaced too far apart for the powder to sit on top of.  I always feel like half of it is ending up in the sink (or at the bottom of the bristles).  But I do enjoy brushing without that overpowering &amp;#34;minty-fresh&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> Tasty! Wakes up my mouth in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really like Eco-dent toothpowder, and especially love this intense cinnamon flavor. I wish it was more widely available, but most stores only carry the mint. It&#x27;s nice to find the cinnamon here.</li>
            <li> Eco dent came in as expected, I used the tooth powder and it worked.  To be honest, I assume it cleaned my teeth properly but I would have to say the same about most toothpastes.  Cinnamon flavor was sort of a surprise as I expected more of a baking soda taste.  After using a little more I would recommend a different flavor,, Cinnamon is going to take me time to get used to.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 25 years.  It keeps my teeth cleaner than any paste I have ever used.  Tom&#x27;s baking side tooth paste does not even begin to compare.  This is a superior product.</li>
            <li> I like the powder, but it will be nice to find out before ordering that it is only for 1 bottle instead of 2. Amazon search result says &amp;#34;Eco-Dent Daily Care, Baking Soda Toothpowder, Cinnamon, 2 oz (56 g) (Pack of 2)&amp;#34;. For 1 bottle, it is actually a little more expensive than other Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> The tooth powder is something that takes a little bit of getting used to before you can enjoy it. I&#x27;ve made the mistake of breathing in with it too close to my face and it bites you a bit. That being said, I do enjoy using this &#x27;different&#x27; product. It gets rid of a lot of junk, but still leaves a clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Does what it says it should.  Prompt shipping from seller.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste cleans very well, tastes great, and leaves breath fresh.  It is good for traveling, as it can be carried in a bag or pocket and is not a liquid.  It has no flouride or harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Certainly not the old Colgate Tooth Powder or Arm and Hammer Tooth Powder, but this is good.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 years and just emptied my first bottle.  I purchased 2 new bottles.  One to use daily in my bathroom and the second to put in my luggage so I always have it on a trip.  It cleans really well and it isn&#x27;t full of kind of chemical garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a trick to using this product.  If the powder comes in contact with water it will shortly set up to a solid as it dries.  So you thoroughly wet your toothbrush and then spray the tooth powder atop your toothbrush over hte sink.  Take care to not let the spout touch the toothbrush.  If it does, the powder in the tip of the nozzle will start to harden and you won&#x27;t be able to get the powder out next time.  Also, as you spray the toothbrush with powder, make sure you rinse the powder that spills over down the drain.  You may need to wipe over with your hand while the powder is running.  If not, it will form a little crush in your sink.  By wiping over it at the end of your brushing while the water is running you prevent there ever being a problem.</li>
            <li> Used and I can believe the changes, The power of cleaning and the mouth good feeling after using it.&lt;br /&gt;You feel  the action of the baking soda and the tastes of the cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;  Actually, seem to have polished the  tooth enamel .It&#x27;s powder ,so you have to be careful not to loose as much on each application on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;  Better than the paste on many levels...</li>
            <li> The cinnamon can barely be discerned in the taste of the powder. May as well used regular baking soda than to spend money on this.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those people like me whose mouth never feels quite clean after brushing with toothpaste, you&#x27;ll like switching to powder - at least now and then. Toothpowder leaves your mouth feeling clean and natural instead of slightly sticky with that sugary or minty aftertaste. This baking soda, cinnamon-flavored toothpowder by Eco-Dent tastes great, but rinses away clean. I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff just pours out and its hard to tell if any is even on/in your tooth brush. The first taste is fine but the after taste is really yucky to me, sort of like bad canned milk.  I bought one in mint flavor and it was the same icky after flavor.  I do not like regular tooth paste because it is just too strong but  I could not adjust to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting used to but is a wonderful thing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great--doesn&#x27;t touch everyone&#x27;s toothbrush like the paste--easy to travel with because it&#x27;s not liquid and tastes great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for about 2 years and it works better than toothpaste. My hygienist always tells me how great my teeth look and so easy to clean...!!!</li>
            <li> Very good tooth powder.  I use it for travel to minimize the amount of liquids I carry while flying.  I was hesitant on the cinnamon flavor, but found that I like it a lot better than their mint, which I previously had.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite! I have tried the other flavors, but I prefer cinnamon, hands down. I usually can&#x27;t find this locally, so I stock up on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with sensitivity in my teeth for years.  Used Sensodyne, which helped most of the time, but then read about how toothpastes prevent re-mineralization and actually exacerbate sensitivity.  I began using Eco-Dent and found that the sensitivity totally disappeared the very first time I used the product!  Have never regretted this purchase.  Using a powder takes a little getting used to, but your teeth will feel as if you&#x27;ve just had them professionally cleaned, and I love the Cinnamon as well as several other flavors.  The 2 oz bottle lasts for several months.  Just a great product!</li>
            <li> I found that regular toothpaste was causing the inside of my mouth to regularly slough off tissue; like skin peeling after a sunburn. A woman at a local health food store told me about Eco-Dent and I&#x27;ve been using it for the last couple of years.  No more sloughing in my mouth and my dentist is happy with my hygiene. I like the cinnamon flavor best and was so happy to see it available at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Okay, but not as good as the regular Eco-Dent. Not a problem, just will not reorder the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I prefer tooth powder to toothpaste. This really cleans my teeth well and is a healthy alternative to toothpaste with added chemicals, fluoride, and artificial sweeteners. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Product is good however the back is covered with a large product code sticker  that covers the entire label the instruction for use, cautions and ingredients. What genius decided to do this??? It took me 25 minutes to remove it small piece at a time</li>
            <li> Made your teeth feel very clean but it left my mouth crusty on the corners &amp; lips extremely dry.  Had to buy cream for cracked lips &amp; crustiness and it helped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This product cleans my teeth a lot faster than normal toothpaste does, and it&#x27;s not liquid so I can take it with me when I travel! It&#x27;s not harmful to swallow so children can use, and leaves my mouth a lot fresher in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpowder for 3 months and noticed a big difference after switching from regular toothpaste. I no longer have that nasty aftertaste in my mouth from brushing and i feel a lot more clean on the inside of my mouth. It also tastes great and doesn&#x27;t create as much foam as regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. i brushed with it before seeing mumford&amp;sons (irrelevant, but brag-worthy) ate at panera, went to the concert, drank a little bit, and went to a diner on the way home, AND EVEN AFTER THAT my mouth didn&#x27;t taste gross or anything. breath was still fresh. effin fabulous. the baking powder paste is all you have to get used to. i usually just stick the brush way in the back teeth and keep it away from my tongue until its fully dissolved. good flavor.</li>
            <li> Apr 20/17: Still using this for travelling everywhere after several years and still loving it.  Leaves more room in my liquids bag through security and just lasts forever (my one month estimate was underrated). Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for travelling, especially with carryon only.  I have found a bottle of this will easily last me on a trip for month (2x day minimum use).  Once you get past the funky taste (unless you really like the taste of baking soda), it&#x27;s really not so bad, especially with the zingy cinnamon flavor.  When I first used it, I was surprised how much cleaner my teeth actually felt, compared to regular toothpaste.  At home, I find myself reaching more and more for this as I actually am coming to prefer it over regular toothpaste in a tube.</li>
            <li> Great product and one of the few I can find that doesn&#x27;t use fluoride or glycerine. I highly recommend Eco-Dent.</li>
            <li> This is some good toothpaste.  Ladies and gentlemen,&lt;br /&gt;it get me squeaky clean.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever&lt;br /&gt;go back to regular toothpaste.  A friend I purchased&lt;br /&gt;a tube for did not like the taste.  For me it&lt;br /&gt;was fine.  thumbs up.</li>
            <li> My husband prefers powder over toothpaste. It works well. He had a hard time finding a flavor other than mint. Great!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this product. It is not only travel friendly but also devoid of all the chemicals I don&#x27;t want in those &amp;#34;leading brands&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tooth powder. I love the flavor and it doesn&#x27;t make food taste weird after using. It foams up really nicely and doesn&#x27;t have any wacky ingredients (especially fluoride). A little goes a long way and each bottle generally lasts me over 6 months with 2 people using from it. It&#x27;s especially convenient when traveling or backpacking because you can take what you need more easily than with conventional toothpaste. Great product. I highly recommend that you try it out!</li>
            <li> Not so much for my children but then again, I don&#x27;t like sharing my toothpaste with them anyway.  I like the fizziness and cinnamon taste the best out of all the flavors.  It lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need much, especially with a good electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> the bottle is small so dont over shoot the tooth brush, works well for tooth powered brushing. would i buy again?</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for a different flavor, lemon-lime. But I really liked this one (cinnamon) as well (like them all, really). Here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff leaves your teeth and mouth super clean, and actually removes film and stain from your teeth and mouth. My mouth actually feels less acidic after i brush and things actually taste different. Baking soda is great for cleaning, try household baking soda on stained sinks, pots, pans, your oven, anything. It will remove the gunk. Just use a little water and make a paste. The lemon-lime flavor in this toothpowder is different, but a good switch from mint. Give it a try. Definitely a great, and zero toxicity way to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> Really like this toothpowder. It leaves my teeth and mouth feel clean and refreshed. It also travels well because it&#x27;s not a liquid. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year. I love it. Regular toothpaste feels weird now. I will say this: I think it helps heal oral problems. I was in need of a root canal over a year ago. I waited due to insurance blah blah blah so I go to back to dentist a year later and was told that the tooth in question actually looked a lot better and will only need a deep filling. Now I&#x27;m not saying this did it but the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently in my oral health routine is use this and the rinse.</li>
            <li> tiny bottle for the price</li>
            <li> In an effort to get away from bringing any liquids or gels with me when I travel, I tried both the Eco-Dent Lemon-Lime and Cinnamon flavor toothpowders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I found the Lemon-Lime flavor to be absolutely repulsive, the Cinnamon flavor is a pretty pleasant -- if acquired -- taste. The powder lathers up well and seems to do a good job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the blue Eco-Dent bottle is tall, inflexible, and larger than you would need for most trips, I made the mistake of transferring some of it to another container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The super pungent smell of the Eco-Dent powder was able to seep through a small silicon GoToob, saturate a lined Dopp kit, and seep into the surrounding carry-on in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No amount of cleaning the GoToob, or airing out/Febreze-ing the Dopp kit and carry-on will rid them of the Cinnamon smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story? If you plan to travel with this tooth powder, keep it in the original Eco-Dent bottle, unless you want everything in your bag to smell of Eco-Dent forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing with straight baking soda for a while now, and my teeth have never felt better or cleaner. They&#x27;ve actually rebuilt enamel, and one in which I thought I might have a a cavity is no longer giving me problems. All of this is likely due to the fact that since I stopped using toothpaste (which has glycerin in it), my teeth have been able to remineralize. So, I thought that there MUST be a product out there built upon this kind of thinking, that might even do more or taste better. Well, Eco-Dent looked like the trick, but it has an ingredient that mixes with my saliva to form a soapy texture--that&#x27;s right, it feels just like when you were a little kid, and you said something wrong, and had to have your mouth washed out with soap! So, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do with the rest of the bottle, but I&#x27;m going back to straight baking soda--or maybe I&#x27;ll try baking soda and sea salt, but certainly not this again. Yuck!</li>
            <li> What I got this for was to go in my bugout bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously bought a bottle of this to test it out.  It&#x27;s flavor is acceptable, although the aftertaste isn&#x27;t really that good.  Not obnoxious though.  I find it acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact it really foams up and gets the mouth clean with just a little bit of powder.  I don&#x27;t know if I can really get 200 brushings out of one bottle, but I can tell it will be quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What interested me in it was this: It&#x27;s small, light weight, and won&#x27;t be likely to leak all over my stuff.  On a flight back once from a TDY in the Army, a tube of toothpaste split and leaked paste all over the inside of my duffel bag.  Took me forever to it cleaned out of my clothes and other gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not using this for daily use... or rather, I won&#x27;t when my currently open bottle runs out.  However, for my field gear, I think it suits the job rather nicely.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about these tooth powders. I have used Eco-Dent Regular Care Cinnamon, Special Care Tarter and Special Care Whitening, consistently for one year now. My teeth have never been so clean and healthy (and I had oral issues for years; all of which are now gone). I particularly like that these products have a more mild, less intensely sweet flavor than standard, commercial toothpaste. I highly recommend their entire line of tooth powders. Easy to use and to travel with. The small bottles last for months! You&#x27;ll notice a major difference in your teeth and gums within a few weeks of consistent use. A+++ product...and fluoride free! Side note: If you try the whitening version, use it twice each day for two weeks straight (solely) then alternate with one or two of their other tooth powders thereafter for maintenance.</li>
            <li> My family loves the Eco-Dent powders. We have always had it in it&#x27;s mint flavored option. This time when I checked to buy more I ordered some cinnamon flavored because I love cinnamon. But it just does not have the richness of that cinnamon punch that I love. It is still a great product I just had very high expectations.</li>
            <li> Eco-dent baking soda tooth powder does a better job of keeping tartar and plaque away than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  In addition, it has lessened sensitivity to cold from receding gums.  By using Eco-dent with daily flossing, my dental health has improved to the point where even my dentist and hygienist are impressed.  And, no flouride!  I wish it was a little less expensive...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this. Goodby toothpaste that gums up in the tube so u can&#x27;t use much. This has it beat by a mile.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned when I saw the size of the bottle about how long it would last, bit it takes such a small amount of power to get a nice froth. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll outlast any tube of paste! Quite happy that I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Switched over to Eco-Dent Toothpowder a few years ago and will never buy regular toothpaste again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with a Radius toothbrush, my mouth has never felt so sparkling clean.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I like the Eco-Dent toothpowder. I thought this particular flavor was overpowering and I switched to their whiting version and am quite happy.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpowder. Since using Eco-dent, I&#x27;ve never used paste and probably never will.</li>
            <li> I like how this tooth powder cleans my teeth. My mouth feels refreshed after using the Eco-Dent Toothpowder and I recommend the cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> This is a very effervescent toothpowder - I should note that I had never tried anything but toothpaste before buying this, but it&#x27;s actually common sense - take out the water and other liquids in toothpaste, and you would be left with a concentrated teeth-cleaner. When you first start brushing with it, it makes your mouth taste fizzy and cinnamon-y. Then after a few seconds it dies down, and it lathers well - just like regular toothpaste! You only need a small amount. It&#x27;s great for the price and I will be stocking up on this soon!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste a lot.  It is very refreshing, makes my teeth feel super clean.  The effervescence of it is really nice I think.  So glad to have a natural,product to use that is so good.</li>
