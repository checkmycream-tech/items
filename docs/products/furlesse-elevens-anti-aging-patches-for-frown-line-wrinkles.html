            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>i love these, and when i don&#x27;t have botox for a while -- these are amazing!  </li>
            <li>Furlesse frown line patches are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>-- I turn my own self on.  </li>
            <li>and I got to be honest, each of these two days I&#x27;ve gotten up with no lines between my eyebrows,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>They are not as as effective smoothing out my eleven&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My best guess is that Frownies are \\&quot;stronger\\&quot;, really flatten out the lines.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Equally effective with Frownies.  </li>
            <li>Not as effective as botox of course....</li>
            <li>but definitely effective for about 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>I find them very easy to apply just where I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear at night.  </li>
            <li>They are very comfortable and as they are transparent they could be worn in the day.  </li>
            <li>I wore it a lot during the day around the house, figuring more is better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this no needle solution to relaxing my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Idid most of my furrowing at night from stress).</li>
            <li>Way better and cheaper than botox or surgery (which I would never use),</li>
            <li>Packaging is so darn cute</li>
            <li>Frownies works a bit better but is more bothersome to use.</li>
            <li>I use them more than one time each.</li>
            <li>I wished that I ordered more than one pack.  </li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>My brow feels more relaxed while I&#x27;m wearing it...and through-out the day when I&#x27;m not.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite brand over Frownies, Derma Gel, etc.</li>
            <li>I like that these are unobtrusive and comfortable but I find that Frownies are much more effective at removing my lines.  </li>
            <li>You also get more product with Frownies.</li>
            <li>The benefits are more than aesthetic-</li>
            <li>I feel more confident when using this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for daily usage.</li>
            <li>I think the Elevens ones are better than the Rows</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with Furlesse.</li>
            <li>; I was able to mostly cover it with a baseball hat).  </li>
            <li>Frownies are better</li>
            <li>Furlesse :)</li>
            <li>Easy to use, affordable, and effortless as it works while you are sleeping - couldn&#x27;t love it more.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li>I love how easy Furlesse is to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, who is really help me with the lines between my eyes, I highly recommended !</li>
            <li>I have felt so much more confident every time I wake up and look in the mirror after I remove the patch and see smooth skin.</li>
            <li>They are more comfortable to wear over Frownies.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands, and these are the best.</li>
            <li>easy on, easy off, no redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a person strongly against cosmetic surgery</li>
            <li>But they are amazing stickers, that really do as they say!  </li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and they stick just fine throughout the night.</li>
            <li>I cut that out to use only for frown lines in between my brows, and I am very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not medicated, very comfortable to wear, nearly transparent and just an overall great product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on ordering a huge supply.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and reusable, unlike frownies.  </li>
            <li>SUGGEST TRIMMING IT TO FIT</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning with smooth skin between my eyes.</li>
            <li>When you remove it your skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I see a great improvement the following day.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading all the great reviews and can not believe we are talking about the same product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone who looks at a screen for hours- even if they had no wrinkles to smooth out.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and unobtrusive.  </li>
            <li>But all that really counts is how effective it is.</li>
            <li>You will see fantastic results.</li>
            <li>hey i feel like this if you can find good tape a clear one use it...</li>
            <li>This is such a great product- simple, well designed , easy to use, affordable and effective!</li>
            <li>Very easy to reuse because they do not absorb oil or curl like paper and the gentle adhesive remains on the patch.  </li>
            <li>so dont get all excited, but it does relaxes your frown line.</li>
            <li>The patch goes on easily and stays on all night despite the fact that I use a pretty rich night cream.</li>
            <li>I use them primarily under my eyes, though forehead too, and they seem so effective have just begun sides of mouth also where I barely have any lines, but a smidge.     </li>
            <li>Furlesse Elevens are great, but they must be used consistently nightly and during the day when possible.</li>
            <li>And I liked that it was clear, so</li>
            <li>Furlesse is not bad, but I&#x27;d recommend DermaGen over Furlesse for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>The clear patches are very easy to put on and remove.        </li>
            <li>but on both pretty much and Botox can&#x27;t help that!!!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product and I will not ever live without them.</li>
            <li>If you are seeking a simple, easy, affordable product to reduce fine lines, Furlesse is it!</li>
            <li>and it never fails, each morning I wake up, pull off my Furlesse strip, and my wrinkles are gone!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Granted, when I smile, which is a lot, my lines show up but just at that moment and not permanently.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is definitely more natural and worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Plus, I like to use them on my laugh lines too.</li>
            <li>Worth the effort.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>If they stay away for longer after using them every night, this may be worth it.</li>
            <li>This product works fast, you will notice results basically the next morning, but with continued use they fade more and more.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased Furlesse, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what it was, or how it worked, but it was cheap enough compared to all the anti-wrinkle creams to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I wore it the following night to bed and woke up with a smooth forehead that lasted the greater part of the day.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if I had started to use this product in my 20&#x27;s, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply, stay on the entire night and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>But they are just not as good as Frownies at eliminating those lines, and they also seem harder on the skin...left a reddish triangle that took hours to dissipate every morning!  </li>
            <li>Not only did they smooth out the skin and prevent me from furrowing while I wore them, but they are retraining my brow muscles by keeping them from furrowing and making me more aware when they do.    </li>
            <li>i tried some other brands but none were as good as these.  </li>
            <li>Not the right shape.</li>
            <li>I am SO happy to have these little miracle workers at my disposal!  </li>
            <li>So when you buy these patches don&#x27;t use them until you are certain you have a full packet.</li>
            <li>Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t happen if I hadn&#x27;t worn it so much, but I still have the extra line, so this product actually did more harm than good.</li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;m only paying pennies per night to feel great the next day.</li>
            <li>They are super gentle on my skin so I can wear them all day (at home --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky, I know) and it helps me from furrowing my brow as much.</li>
            <li>I use the patches as part of my normal night time routine, in fact it is the easiest part of my night rituals as you only peel the patch off the sheet and apply to problem area (make sure your not furrowing before you apply!).</li>
            <li>The first few days I used it, I loved it, because it noticibly minimized my frown lines.  </li>
            <li>First let me tell you</li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>They are a  lot better \\&quot;looking\\&quot; wearing them especially in front of others.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>If I place them in the same exact position, they would go on top of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>so I was hesitant at first,</li>
            <li>They are Very Reusable, just by resticking them on the sticker sheet, then resticking them on you!</li>
            <li>If I put them exactly where I need them, they hit my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Furlesse Elevens for about 3 weeks and have been pretty amazed by the results.</li>
            <li>They are fairly sticky and stay firm.</li>
            <li>And unlike what other comments say, it&#x27;s not that strong and peels off really easily.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to put on and you barely see it there.</li>
            <li>It was really promising at first.  </li>
            <li>These work better than the paper type - stick better and are less obvious.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these because let&#x27;s face it, it takes a certain comfort level in your relationship to wear frownies to bed at night, and Furlesse are practically invisible.  </li>
            <li>and while they felt strange at first, I got used to them in about two nights (and slept fine those nights).     </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very visible (though my husband still picks on me at night XD )</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont see to much improvement.  </li>
            <li>These patches really help to reduce the stress in your forehead while you sleep.</li>
            <li>but I think a reasonable value for the effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t show so much and really do the job.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I have been using Furlesse for a couple years now and it really works in preventing the frown lines while I sleep.</li>
            <li>You need to really stretch the skin out, to even out your wrinkle lines, before you glue the patch on.</li>
            <li>I have tried both Frownies and Dermagen patches and I have to say the Furlesse elevens are by far the superior product - though they are also the most expensive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for a simple, easy fix.</li>
            <li>I have really deep wrinkles between my brows and they look much softer in the morning, not completely erased, but overall I&#x27;m happy with the buy.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these months ago and used them daily and then \\&quot;fell off the wagon.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>They are a major advance over Frownies technology- a pliable silicone-like patch is comfortable with no sharp pokey edges; contoured instead of strictly triangular; easier to apply(no glue to activate with water and no holding patch on waiting for glue to set).</li>
            <li>I email ed them today to ask if they could offer full sheet options of only the moon shapes.</li>
            <li>I TRIED AND THESE REALLY DID NOT ADHERE FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES  </li>
            <li>There is an outline left by the patch after it&#x27;s removed but it disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have a really high forehead, and I tried using them sideways, which worked out well.</li>
            <li>Wake up looking fresh and well, younger!</li>
            <li>Occasionally, there is adhesive residue left on my forehead - but it washes easily off.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed the lines becoming less visible.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty deep &#x27;1&#x27; between my eyes that is definitely worse from squinting on bright days.</li>
            <li>Keep an eye out for any new creases that may start around them.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles aren&#x27;t super bad, though I have noticed a difference using these, worth the price of admission, for me!  :)</li>
            <li>When first started using these, they were about $15 but now over the last year or so, they&#x27;ve been incrementally rising the price to close to $20.</li>
            <li>I am on the same exact page as another reviewer.</li>
            <li>Having said this, I&#x27;m only at my first box, but I&#x27;m convinced that this works.</li>
            <li>Furlesse has really helped dimish the deep furrow</li>
            <li>and whenever I take off Furlesse in the morning I&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised with how well it works.</li>
            <li>About a week of using the strips, my brow creases have disappeared--which blows my mind because I&#x27;ve been developing those lines for at least 4 years. :)</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a natural remedy instead of having to go the Botox route for my 11 lines.</li>
            <li>I use them nightly and my furrowed look stays away nearly all day.  </li>
            <li>Furlesse is not bad but it makes the same effect as putting milk in your face and let it dry out...</li>
            <li>With eleven&#x27;s you really need to get the bottom point down far to cover the whole crease effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are worn overnight, and the creases are less noticeable in the morning, but I don&#x27;t see how it could actually reduce or prevent wrinkles longterm, as it is only a temporary fix (and most of my frowning and squinting is done during the day).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product, along with a daily moisturiser between the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>(between the eyebrows) not deminish it completely but after using it for a while helps you to be conscious with your facial muscle.</li>
            <li>I have deep frown lines, and did not have much luck with the Frownies that I initially tried.</li>
            <li>Compare to Furlesse patches, it is easier to use and it works better (I&#x27;d say at least 90% effectiveness!).</li>
            <li>Seem they might last several uses at least, which is what Frownies claim, though I&#x27;ve never been able to do that.    </li>
            <li>There is no question these do work, and without giving you that freakish stepford look so many poor women are sporting.</li>
            <li>The Furlesse patches are clear, so I wear them around the house , or at night without it being easily noticable,  when a few wisps of bangs are pulled down.  </li>
            <li>only downside (aside from the price) is that my packet was missing pretty much every third patch - something I didn&#x27;t notice until a week or so later.</li>
            <li>However, think about how much it costs you to get botox or other plastic procedures.</li>
            <li>Last thing I needed is a new and strange wrinkle.</li>
            <li>The shape of the Furlesse patch was not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>I cut these in half down the middle - the full size is actually a little large for between my eyebrows and would sometimes take a hair or two when removed.</li>

            <li> and I got to be honest, each of these two days I&#x27;ve gotten up with no lines between my eyebrows,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> They are not as as effective smoothing out my eleven&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My best guess is that Frownies are \\&quot;stronger\\&quot;, really flatten out the lines.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Equally effective with Frownies.  </li>
            <li> Not as effective as botox of course....</li>
            <li> but definitely effective for about 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> I find them very easy to apply just where I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear at night.  </li>
            <li> They are very comfortable and as they are transparent they could be worn in the day.  </li>
            <li> I wore it a lot during the day around the house, figuring more is better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this no needle solution to relaxing my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Idid most of my furrowing at night from stress).</li>
            <li> Way better and cheaper than botox or surgery (which I would never use),</li>
            <li> Packaging is so darn cute</li>
            <li> Frownies works a bit better but is more bothersome to use.</li>
            <li> I use them more than one time each.</li>
            <li> I wished that I ordered more than one pack.  </li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> My brow feels more relaxed while I&#x27;m wearing it...and through-out the day when I&#x27;m not.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite brand over Frownies, Derma Gel, etc.</li>
            <li> I like that these are unobtrusive and comfortable but I find that Frownies are much more effective at removing my lines.  </li>
            <li> You also get more product with Frownies.</li>
            <li> The benefits are more than aesthetic-</li>
            <li> I feel more confident when using this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for daily usage.</li>
            <li> I think the Elevens ones are better than the Rows</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with Furlesse.</li>
            <li> ; I was able to mostly cover it with a baseball hat).  </li>
            <li> Frownies are better</li>
            <li> Furlesse :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use, affordable, and effortless as it works while you are sleeping - couldn&#x27;t love it more.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li> I love how easy Furlesse is to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, who is really help me with the lines between my eyes, I highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I have felt so much more confident every time I wake up and look in the mirror after I remove the patch and see smooth skin.</li>
            <li> They are more comfortable to wear over Frownies.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, and these are the best.</li>
            <li> easy on, easy off, no redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a person strongly against cosmetic surgery</li>
            <li> But they are amazing stickers, that really do as they say!  </li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and they stick just fine throughout the night.</li>
            <li> I cut that out to use only for frown lines in between my brows, and I am very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not medicated, very comfortable to wear, nearly transparent and just an overall great product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on ordering a huge supply.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and reusable, unlike frownies.  </li>
            <li> SUGGEST TRIMMING IT TO FIT</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with smooth skin between my eyes.</li>
            <li> When you remove it your skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I see a great improvement the following day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the great reviews and can not believe we are talking about the same product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to anyone who looks at a screen for hours- even if they had no wrinkles to smooth out.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and unobtrusive.  </li>
            <li> But all that really counts is how effective it is.</li>
            <li> You will see fantastic results.</li>
            <li> hey i feel like this if you can find good tape a clear one use it...</li>
            <li> This is such a great product- simple, well designed , easy to use, affordable and effective!</li>
            <li> Very easy to reuse because they do not absorb oil or curl like paper and the gentle adhesive remains on the patch.  </li>
            <li> so dont get all excited, but it does relaxes your frown line.</li>
            <li> The patch goes on easily and stays on all night despite the fact that I use a pretty rich night cream.</li>
            <li> I use them primarily under my eyes, though forehead too, and they seem so effective have just begun sides of mouth also where I barely have any lines, but a smidge.     </li>
            <li> Furlesse Elevens are great, but they must be used consistently nightly and during the day when possible.</li>
            <li> And I liked that it was clear, so</li>
            <li> Furlesse is not bad, but I&#x27;d recommend DermaGen over Furlesse for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The clear patches are very easy to put on and remove.        </li>
            <li> but on both pretty much and Botox can&#x27;t help that!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and I will not ever live without them.</li>
            <li> If you are seeking a simple, easy, affordable product to reduce fine lines, Furlesse is it!</li>
            <li> and it never fails, each morning I wake up, pull off my Furlesse strip, and my wrinkles are gone!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Granted, when I smile, which is a lot, my lines show up but just at that moment and not permanently.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is definitely more natural and worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Plus, I like to use them on my laugh lines too.</li>
            <li> Worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> If they stay away for longer after using them every night, this may be worth it.</li>
            <li> This product works fast, you will notice results basically the next morning, but with continued use they fade more and more.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased Furlesse, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what it was, or how it worked, but it was cheap enough compared to all the anti-wrinkle creams to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I wore it the following night to bed and woke up with a smooth forehead that lasted the greater part of the day.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if I had started to use this product in my 20&#x27;s, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply, stay on the entire night and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> But they are just not as good as Frownies at eliminating those lines, and they also seem harder on the skin...left a reddish triangle that took hours to dissipate every morning!  </li>
            <li> Not only did they smooth out the skin and prevent me from furrowing while I wore them, but they are retraining my brow muscles by keeping them from furrowing and making me more aware when they do.    </li>
            <li> i tried some other brands but none were as good as these.  </li>
            <li> Not the right shape.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy to have these little miracle workers at my disposal!  </li>
            <li> So when you buy these patches don&#x27;t use them until you are certain you have a full packet.</li>
            <li> Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t happen if I hadn&#x27;t worn it so much, but I still have the extra line, so this product actually did more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;m only paying pennies per night to feel great the next day.</li>
            <li> They are super gentle on my skin so I can wear them all day (at home --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky, I know) and it helps me from furrowing my brow as much.</li>
            <li> I use the patches as part of my normal night time routine, in fact it is the easiest part of my night rituals as you only peel the patch off the sheet and apply to problem area (make sure your not furrowing before you apply!).</li>
            <li> The first few days I used it, I loved it, because it noticibly minimized my frown lines.  </li>
            <li> First let me tell you</li>
            <li> and it really works!</li>
            <li> They are a  lot better \\&quot;looking\\&quot; wearing them especially in front of others.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> If I place them in the same exact position, they would go on top of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> so I was hesitant at first,</li>
            <li> They are Very Reusable, just by resticking them on the sticker sheet, then resticking them on you!</li>
            <li> If I put them exactly where I need them, they hit my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Furlesse Elevens for about 3 weeks and have been pretty amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> They are fairly sticky and stay firm.</li>
            <li> And unlike what other comments say, it&#x27;s not that strong and peels off really easily.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to put on and you barely see it there.</li>
            <li> It was really promising at first.  </li>
            <li> These work better than the paper type - stick better and are less obvious.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these because let&#x27;s face it, it takes a certain comfort level in your relationship to wear frownies to bed at night, and Furlesse are practically invisible.  </li>
            <li> and while they felt strange at first, I got used to them in about two nights (and slept fine those nights).     </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t very visible (though my husband still picks on me at night XD )</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont see to much improvement.  </li>
            <li> These patches really help to reduce the stress in your forehead while you sleep.</li>
            <li> but I think a reasonable value for the effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t show so much and really do the job.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Furlesse for a couple years now and it really works in preventing the frown lines while I sleep.</li>
            <li> You need to really stretch the skin out, to even out your wrinkle lines, before you glue the patch on.</li>
            <li> I have tried both Frownies and Dermagen patches and I have to say the Furlesse elevens are by far the superior product - though they are also the most expensive.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for a simple, easy fix.</li>
            <li> I have really deep wrinkles between my brows and they look much softer in the morning, not completely erased, but overall I&#x27;m happy with the buy.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these months ago and used them daily and then \\&quot;fell off the wagon.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> They are a major advance over Frownies technology- a pliable silicone-like patch is comfortable with no sharp pokey edges; contoured instead of strictly triangular; easier to apply(no glue to activate with water and no holding patch on waiting for glue to set).</li>
            <li> I email ed them today to ask if they could offer full sheet options of only the moon shapes.</li>
            <li> I TRIED AND THESE REALLY DID NOT ADHERE FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES  </li>
            <li> There is an outline left by the patch after it&#x27;s removed but it disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have a really high forehead, and I tried using them sideways, which worked out well.</li>
            <li> Wake up looking fresh and well, younger!</li>
            <li> Occasionally, there is adhesive residue left on my forehead - but it washes easily off.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed the lines becoming less visible.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty deep &#x27;1&#x27; between my eyes that is definitely worse from squinting on bright days.</li>
            <li> Keep an eye out for any new creases that may start around them.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles aren&#x27;t super bad, though I have noticed a difference using these, worth the price of admission, for me!  :)</li>
            <li> When first started using these, they were about $15 but now over the last year or so, they&#x27;ve been incrementally rising the price to close to $20.</li>
            <li> I am on the same exact page as another reviewer.</li>
            <li> Having said this, I&#x27;m only at my first box, but I&#x27;m convinced that this works.</li>
            <li> Furlesse has really helped dimish the deep furrow</li>
            <li> and whenever I take off Furlesse in the morning I&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised with how well it works.</li>
            <li> About a week of using the strips, my brow creases have disappeared--which blows my mind because I&#x27;ve been developing those lines for at least 4 years. :)</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a natural remedy instead of having to go the Botox route for my 11 lines.</li>
            <li> I use them nightly and my furrowed look stays away nearly all day.  </li>
            <li> Furlesse is not bad but it makes the same effect as putting milk in your face and let it dry out...</li>
            <li> With eleven&#x27;s you really need to get the bottom point down far to cover the whole crease effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are worn overnight, and the creases are less noticeable in the morning, but I don&#x27;t see how it could actually reduce or prevent wrinkles longterm, as it is only a temporary fix (and most of my frowning and squinting is done during the day).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product, along with a daily moisturiser between the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> (between the eyebrows) not deminish it completely but after using it for a while helps you to be conscious with your facial muscle.</li>
            <li> I have deep frown lines, and did not have much luck with the Frownies that I initially tried.</li>
            <li> Compare to Furlesse patches, it is easier to use and it works better (I&#x27;d say at least 90% effectiveness!).</li>
            <li> Seem they might last several uses at least, which is what Frownies claim, though I&#x27;ve never been able to do that.    </li>
            <li> There is no question these do work, and without giving you that freakish stepford look so many poor women are sporting.</li>
            <li> The Furlesse patches are clear, so I wear them around the house , or at night without it being easily noticable,  when a few wisps of bangs are pulled down.  </li>
            <li> only downside (aside from the price) is that my packet was missing pretty much every third patch - something I didn&#x27;t notice until a week or so later.</li>
            <li> However, think about how much it costs you to get botox or other plastic procedures.</li>
            <li> Last thing I needed is a new and strange wrinkle.</li>
            <li> The shape of the Furlesse patch was not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half down the middle - the full size is actually a little large for between my eyebrows and would sometimes take a hair or two when removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to know that when the other lines start rearing their ugly heads, I will have an answer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t come down far enough to cover lines.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I found these to be more irritating on my skin.</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t really help my small crapey wrinkly</li>
            <li> I was not sure if these would work, but they really do work i wear one every night</li>
            <li> they last a long time...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; would be too easy.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference with the wrinkle between my eyebrows -- which at 28 years old was getting just a little too pronounced for my liking!</li>
            <li> These are so comfortable to wear for the angry elevens</li>
            <li> It was like two beauty treatments in one, but I have to be careful about the rest of my brows since I put my strip low.      </li>
            <li> I plan on using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> Probably for minor imperfections.</li>
            <li> With Furlesse, the angles aren&#x27;t sharp enough to work with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> am also using other topical creams to ease the frown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not vain about aging, but seeing these new lines on my face just reminds me of all the pain and stress we&#x27;ve gone through this past year.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve only used them a few times because it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to cut them to size every night before bed in addition to all my regular nightly routine.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Frownies, the same sort thing but made of brown paper, so obviously cannot be worn in the daytime.</li>
            <li> I recently noticed that my scowls were looking a little deeper</li>
            <li> I have worn them for a month solid every night to bed and everyday I still see the crease where with Frownies, the crease would be eliminated for the day.</li>
            <li> There were only few</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t want to bother with looking like I stuck some paper in my forhead or just don&#x27;t have the time to hold the Frownies the extra few seconds to have it stick, I use Furlesse.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected stick-on pads with botanicals or some ingredient shown to reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did like does not work like expected.</li>
            <li> and I definitely need to re-order--when I was using them on a nightly basis, the furrow between my brows was much less noticeable!</li>
            <li> It started during long commutes before I had my little girl (I should have got myself a pair of sunglasses) and continued when I&#x27;d sleep after I had her because we are going through stress.</li>
            <li> but they are only avail in a variety of odd shape pack with few under eye moons.  </li>
            <li> I have had a very deep frown line between my eyes for the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> About every other night, as opposed to nightly</li>
            <li> With Frownies I can place the point closer to my nose and the 2 other points don&#x27;t interfere with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products on Amazon for my 11 lines between my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Preferable due to their inconspicuousness.  </li>
            <li> Owner responded to my email and sent me samples to try of the other kinds.  </li>
            <li> Extremely helpful</li>
            <li> The size of the patch is in between a Fownie (which is a bit too big) and a Dermagen patch (which is a bit too small for me).</li>
            <li> For me, this wasn&#x27;t a bad thing (I had fine hairs between my brows).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately  Furlesse are not available on Amazon UK but as the shipping cost from the USA is very reasonable I will continue to buy.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is they are a little wide.</li>
            <li> i slap tem on upside down on the sides and under my ees.</li>
            <li> This is an update to a previous review.</li>
            <li> so Furlesse helps me to do that less.</li>
            <li> I am only 43, but have the serious &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;&#x27;s issue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using furlesse for a little over two months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying these every night for a little over a week</li>
            <li> Helps a little with the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> They leave a little residue but it washes off.  </li>
            <li> Instead, they&#x27;re just little sheets of plastic that stick between the eyes and keep your skin from frowning.</li>
            <li> I wear these a few nights a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been furrowing for a few years.</li>
            <li> so you have to keep up the practice of using everyday.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews where people complained that it stuck to their eyebrows and pulled out some hair.  </li>
            <li> Since a person has only 2 hands, and 1 needs to be used to hold on to the patch, sometimes gluing it in between the brows on the forehead can be a little bit difficult.</li>
            <li> They are also too wide for me, without cutting them they cover the inner sides of my eyebrows (and I didn&#x27;t want to even try wearing them this way overnight in case they stuck to my eyebrows and pulled the hair out).</li>
            <li> These little strips are just what the doctor ordered!</li>
            <li> After using almost all of product, I&#x27;ve noticed very little in the appearance of my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Even a few hours with it on is so helpful!</li>
            <li> I usually read the negative comments to filter out the possible fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, maybe I frown too hard in my dreams, OR maybe this patch is not sticky enough, it comes off a bit during the night, causing me to see weird frown lines between my brows in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so not very good value.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my lines were far far much worse in the a.m. because I sleep on my sides when my cheeks push up causing horrifying lines/</li>
            <li> Hard to use on oily skin as well.  </li>
            <li> (at least mine probably are...</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I look and feel less angry.  </li>
            <li> Definitely give them a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But obviously during the day I get that annoying line again, but with these patches every night I make it smoother.</li>
            <li> alas here are the negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just plastic strips, fairly inflexible, no adherence...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a miracle to me because I usually get up with one big crease (I suposse I have terrible dreams).</li>
            <li> The other day I got sick and woke up to a scary vision of myself in the mirror:</li>
            <li> I pass to look for it, but it&#x27;s so faint</li>
            <li> I turned 30 this year and the \\&quot;elevens\\&quot; area (between eyebrows) has seemed flawed by furrow lines.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking grumpy and mad all the time and</li>
            <li> That is frustrating and annoying.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were not so expensive!  </li>
            <li> WHICH IS VERY WEIRD SINCE I HAVE NOT SEEN A PIMPLE IN DECADES</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> Gotta admit-i have bad 11&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the creeping cost increase of this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well.  Comfortable and reusable, unlike frownies.  I accidentally went into the shower with it on.  I removed it and stuck it on the mirror.  I went to work and forgot about it.  That evening  i took it off of the mirror and instead of discarding it I decided to see how well it sticks.  Surprisingly, placing it on glass or a mirror increases its longevity.  I recommend doing this instead of placing it back on the paper it comes attached to. .......... I read other reviews where people complained that it stuck to their eyebrows and pulled out some hair.  SUGGEST TRIMMING IT TO FIT IF NECESSARY--very simple.</li>
            <li> It was really promising at first.  The first few days I used it, I loved it, because it noticibly minimized my frown lines.  And I liked that it was clear, so I wore it a lot during the day around the house, figuring more is better.  But then I developer a horizontal line along the bottom of the patch, inbetween my eyes across the bridge of my nose.  Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t happen if I hadn&#x27;t worn it so much, but I still have the extra line, so this product actually did more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I love these things!  I just wish they were not so expensive!  They are stickers, for goodness sake!  But they are amazing stickers, that really do as they say!  I wear these a few nights a week.  I have tried other brands, and these are the best.</li>
            <li> I have had a very deep frown line between my eyes for the past 10 years.  I applied this patch on it one night and the next morning it was gone.  How is this possible?  I noticed during the day when I frown I would see it appearing again, but it&#x27;s now that deep hole of a line I&#x27;ve had.  I constantly look at myself in any mirror or window I pass to look for it, but it&#x27;s so faint or not there, I could cry with happiness.  To think I was considering botox.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t.  I look so good now -- I turn my own self on.  LOL</li>
            <li> I ran out of Furlesse patches a while ago and I definitely need to re-order--when I was using them on a nightly basis, the furrow between my brows was much less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Furlesse for about one month now and it never fails, each morning I wake up, pull off my Furlesse strip, and my wrinkles are gone! It truly works as well as it says it does. You have to try it to believe it. Surgery and chemical free...and it works~ what more could a girl ask for!?</li>
            <li> I love this product. I wake up in the morning with smooth skin between my eyes. My wrinkles aren&#x27;t deep yet and I plan on using this forever to keep it that way. TRY THIS AWESOME PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  being trying Furlesse just for 2 days and I got to be honest, each of these two days I&#x27;ve gotten up with no lines between my eyebrows, that&#x27;s a miracle to me because I usually get up with one big crease (I suposse I have terrible dreams). But obviously during the day I get that annoying line again, but with these patches every night I make it smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this no needle solution to relaxing my wrinkles.The clear patches are very easy to put on and remove.        I have been using Furlesse for a month and I definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I recently noticed that my scowls were looking a little deeper so I tried Furlesse.  Worked great.  Just don&#x27;t forget to take em off!</li>
            <li> First let me tell you I really am impressed with these anti-wrinkle patches. I am 39 and started getting Botox on and off about 8 yrs ago around my eyes and forehead but it wouldn&#x27;t really help my small crapey wrinkly crows feet eye area....so I took a chance on these. I knew these were for between the eyes but thought i could poss make them work for my eye area.... I noticed that my lines were far far much worse in the a.m. because I sleep on my sides when my cheeks push up causing horrifying lines/wrinkles mostly my left but on both pretty much and Botox can&#x27;t help that!!! (I even use a 100% silk pillowcase)  After using these I awake without wrinkling! I never go to bed without my Ob agi eye cream and after about 20-30 mins or before shutting tv off i slap tem on upside down on the sides and under my ees.I haven&#x27;t had Botox in 6 months. Granted, when I smile, which is a lot, my lines show up but just at that moment and not permanently.  The reason for 4 stars is that these arent shaped for under eyes. .  I will wrote/email the company today so I am hoping they will offer that option.  **there is also another type that works but they are only avail in a variety of odd shape pack with few under eye moons.  Those ones I buy here on Amazon too and are:  Derma gen all one word - I email ed them today to ask if they could offer full sheet options of only the moon shapes. I have just left a review for that product today as well**</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, who is really help me with the lines between my eyes, I highly recommended !</li>
            <li> This is an update to a previous review. I use this product between my eyebrows and on the side of my nose, which gets a crease because I sleep on my side. I love this product because it&#x27;s so easy and it really works! I cut these in half down the middle - the full size is actually a little large for between my eyebrows and would sometimes take a hair or two when removed. Occasionally, there is adhesive residue left on my forehead - but it washes easily off. (This is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.) But I&#x27;m elevens- and crease-free. So simple. I have these on automatic reorder and have been using them for over a year (I&#x27;m 38). I am disappointed in the creeping cost increase of this product. When first started using these, they were about $15 but now over the last year or so, they&#x27;ve been incrementally rising the price to close to $20. That is frustrating and annoying.</li>
            <li> These work great, I like them because they&#x27;re shaped, but for the price, I think tape works just as well.</li>
            <li> Ths truly do help with my &#x27; elevens&#x27;. I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Cannot believe I fell for this.  Frown lines are caused by muscle contraction.  To flatten the skin, after wearing the patches all night, lasts about 10 minutes and the frown lines are back.  Unfortunately, this &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; would be too easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using furlesse for a little over two months and I definitely see a difference. I can&#x27;t believe it. It&#x27;s really not obvious at all. I&#x27;ve even been wearing them in the car. I think I could even wear one  in the grocery store and nobody would notice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Furlesse for a couple of months. About every other night, as opposed to nightly and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. I have a pretty deep &#x27;1&#x27; between my eyes that is definitely worse from squinting on bright days. Furlesse has really helped dimish the deep furrow and whenever I take off Furlesse in the morning I&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised with how well it works. I&#x27;m not one for injections or injectables so Furlesse is perfect for me. Plus, I&#x27;m only paying pennies per night to feel great the next day. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these because let&#x27;s face it, it takes a certain comfort level in your relationship to wear frownies to bed at night, and Furlesse are practically invisible.  But they are just not as good as Frownies at eliminating those lines, and they also seem harder on the skin...left a reddish triangle that took hours to dissipate every morning!  Hard to use on oily skin as well.  Too bad.  They are practically invisible from a distance so I do wear them around the house and while in the car until I run out.  I just re-ordered my beloved Frownies.</li>
            <li> I wear these both at night, as they are intended, and when working on the computer during the day. They are super gentle on my skin so I can wear them all day (at home -- I&#x27;m lucky, I know) and it helps me from furrowing my brow as much. I have definitely noticed a difference with the wrinkle between my eyebrows -- which at 28 years old was getting just a little too pronounced for my liking! Haven&#x27;t tried other products, but these are a marked improvement over a piece of scotch tape between my eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been furrowing for a few years. It started during long commutes before I had my little girl (I should have got myself a pair of sunglasses) and continued when I&#x27;d sleep after I had her because we are going through stress. Wrinkles are starting to set in. I&#x27;m normally not vain about aging, but seeing these new lines on my face just reminds me of all the pain and stress we&#x27;ve gone through this past year. Soooo, I&#x27;ve been investigating how to get rid of them (or soften them) without plastic surgery or botox.     These little strips are just what the doctor ordered! :) After one night, I saw a difference. I find keeping them on into the morning (when I use my laptop) also helped. Not only did they smooth out the skin and prevent me from furrowing while I wore them, but they are retraining my brow muscles by keeping them from furrowing and making me more aware when they do.    They aren&#x27;t very visible (though my husband still picks on me at night XD ) and while they felt strange at first, I got used to them in about two nights (and slept fine those nights).     A couple things I noticed while using them -     1. Keep an eye out for any new creases that may start around them. You may need to readjust your strip&#x27;s position. For me, a crease was created across the bridge of my nose where the bottom of the strip was. Last thing I needed is a new and strange wrinkle. So I just repositioned  it a bunch lower and the creasing stopped.     2. These strips will grab onto hair! So if you have eyebrows that are closer together, hairy or a unibrow, be prepared for a \\&quot;waxing\\&quot; when you pull your furlesse strip off. For me, this wasn&#x27;t a bad thing (I had fine hairs between my brows). It was like two beauty treatments in one, but I have to be careful about the rest of my brows since I put my strip low.      3. The forehead can get sore when starting to use these. Like I said before, the brow muscles get retrained and I think they may start to atrophy (at least mine probably are...Idid most of my furrowing at night from stress). For me, this soreness went away after using the strips for a week.     All that aside, I&#x27;m very pleased with Furlesse. Way better and cheaper than botox or surgery (which I would never use), and it&#x27;s been very effective for me. About a week of using the strips, my brow creases have disappeared--which blows my mind because I&#x27;ve been developing those lines for at least 4 years. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Furlesse now for about 3 months, 4-5 times a night. If you are seeking a simple, easy, affordable product to reduce fine lines, Furlesse is it! The results are amazing! Sometimes I will put my Furlesse patch on in the afternoon if I am going out later in the evening. Even a few hours with it on is so helpful!</li>
            <li> I am on the same exact page as another reviewer. I really wanted to like these because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They are a  lot better \\&quot;looking\\&quot; wearing them especially in front of others.&lt;br /&gt;2) The adhesive is nice! easy on, easy off, no redness.&lt;br /&gt;3) They are more comfortable to wear over Frownies.&lt;br /&gt;4) Packaging is so darn cute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas here are the negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They are not as as effective smoothing out my eleven&#x27;s. I have worn them for a month solid every night to bed and everyday I still see the crease where with Frownies, the crease would be eliminated for the day. My best guess is that Frownies are \\&quot;stronger\\&quot;, really flatten out the lines.&lt;br /&gt;2) The shape of the Furlesse patch was not a good fit for me. With Frownies I can place the point closer to my nose and the 2 other points don&#x27;t interfere with my eyebrows. With Furlesse, the angles aren&#x27;t sharp enough to work with my eyebrows. If I place them in the same exact position, they would go on top of my eyebrows. With eleven&#x27;s you really need to get the bottom point down far to cover the whole crease effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just reordered a box of Frownies because what matters ultimately is no crease!</li>
            <li> its not a miracle ppl so dont get all excited, but it does relaxes your frown line. (between the eyebrows) not deminish it completely but after using it for a while helps you to be conscious with your facial muscle. i am one who frowns even when im I have no reason too i even frown in my sleep. hey i feel like this if you can find good tape a clear one use it...</li>
            <li> No botox needed.  Wake up looking fresh and well, younger!</li>
            <li> I have deep frown lines, and did not have much luck with the Frownies that I initially tried. It did not stick at all.&lt;br /&gt;Furlesse sticks well to my face, despite my moisturiser, and it stays in place all night.&lt;br /&gt;The lines are softening gradualy. I will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using other topical creams to ease the frown marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Furlesse Elevens.</li>
            <li> Furlesse is not bad but it makes the same effect as putting milk in your face and let it dry out...Besides, milk is great for your skin!</li>
            <li> I usually read the negative comments to filter out the possible fake reviews. There were only few so that was a good start. The Furlesse forehead strips didn&#x27;t work so well so I was hesitant at first, but I thought \\&quot;oh well\\&quot; and gave it a try. This is definitely worth the money. After using it twice, my frown lines are definitely smoother. One box has 30 strips so you can use it every day and it would cost you about $240/year. However, think about how much it costs you to get botox or other plastic procedures. This is definitely more natural and worth the investment. Having said this, I&#x27;m only at my first box, but I&#x27;m convinced that this works. And unlike what other comments say, it&#x27;s not that strong and peels off really easily.</li>
            <li> I am a person strongly against cosmetic surgery but I&#x27;ve always struggled with the creases between my eyes. As a light-complected woman, I feel that I&#x27;m always squinting regardless of the weather, and this over time has created some deep furrow lines between my eyes. I was tired of looking grumpy and mad all the time and [[ASIN:B0042SHWXY Furlesse Elevens Anti-Aging Patches for Frown Line Wrinkles]] has given me hope! Easy to use, affordable, and effortless as it works while you are sleeping - couldn&#x27;t love it more. Thank you Furlesse for giving us naturalists some hope.</li>
            <li> I keep switching between Frownies and Furlesse! When I don&#x27;t want to bother with looking like I stuck some paper in my forhead or just don&#x27;t have the time to hold the Frownies the extra few seconds to have it stick, I use Furlesse. It is so easy to put on and you barely see it there. It does help somewhat with the &amp;#34;angry wrinkle&amp;#34; between my eyebrows. Frownies works a bit better but is more bothersome to use.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a natural remedy instead of having to go the Botox route for my 11 lines. I read the reviews on here and tried to give Furlesse a try. I noticed a change within 2 nights of putting them on. After a week, there was a substantial difference! I just ordered a 3 months supply to maintain. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Furlesse frown line patches are amazing.  I use them nightly and my furrowed look stays away nearly all day.  I plan on using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these! I have such deep lines between my eyes, it almost looks like scarring. I&#x27;ve been applying these every night for a little over a week and I have noticed the lines becoming less visible. They are easy to apply, stay on the entire night and easy to take off. It&#x27;s like a mini botox treatment without the the needles, side effects and cost. Definitely give them a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Helps a little with the wrinkles.  I dont see to much improvement.  Probably for minor imperfections. Lines of expression only.</li>
            <li> These patches really help to reduce the stress in your forehead while you sleep. Plus, I like to use them on my laugh lines too. I use them more than one time each. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products on Amazon for my 11 lines between my eyes.  Frownies are somewhat similar , but look like a  cardboard  &amp;#34;bulls eye&amp;#34;  on your forehead.  The Furlesse patches are clear, so I wear them around the house , or at night without it being easily noticable,  when a few wisps of bangs are pulled down.  A  litle bit pricey, but I think a reasonable value for the effectiveness.  The lines do return after a couple of days of non-use...so you have to keep up the practice of using everyday.</li>
            <li> I love how easy Furlesse is to use.  Just peel it off and stick it on.  When you remove it your skin feels so smooth.  I not only wear them at night, I use them through the day.  I have a tendency to squint when I am at the computer so Furlesse helps me to do that less. They are transparent so from a bit of a distance you can&#x27;t tell you have them on.  Love them!!!</li>
            <li> Equally effective with Frownies.  Preferable due to their inconspicuousness.  Application is a bit more difficult than Frownies.  Worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the wait.  I wished that I ordered more than one pack.  It works well to relax the lines on your forehead. It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear at night.  Will order more.</li>
            <li> These work better than the paper type - stick better and are less obvious.  They leave a little residue but it washes off.  Now if I could wear them all day......</li>
            <li> They work fine. Almost invisible and they don&#x27;t bother to sleep, not as good as Botox, but I can see the difference in the morning. I have really deep wrinkles between my brows and they look much softer in the morning, not completely erased, but overall I&#x27;m happy with the buy.</li>
            <li> Its an alright product. Just wished the results lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Not the right shape. Don&#x27;t come down far enough to cover lines.</li>
            <li> Gotta admit-i have bad 11&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve considered Botox but too scared. These do work. It&#x27;s only my 2nd day and i wore them to bed and they didn&#x27;t bother me at all. ONe of the 11&#x27;s is almost gone when i take off the tape. If they stay away for longer after using them every night, this may be worth it.</li>
            <li> This product works fast, you will notice results basically the next morning, but with continued use they fade more and more.  It&#x27;s not medicated, very comfortable to wear, nearly transparent and just an overall great product!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> When I purchased Furlesse, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what it was, or how it worked, but it was cheap enough compared to all the anti-wrinkle creams to give it a try. I guess I expected stick-on pads with botanicals or some ingredient shown to reduce wrinkles. Instead, they&#x27;re just little sheets of plastic that stick between the eyes and keep your skin from frowning. They are worn overnight, and the creases are less noticeable in the morning, but I don&#x27;t see how it could actually reduce or prevent wrinkles longterm, as it is only a temporary fix (and most of my frowning and squinting is done during the day). They are also too wide for me, without cutting them they cover the inner sides of my eyebrows (and I didn&#x27;t want to even try wearing them this way overnight in case they stuck to my eyebrows and pulled the hair out). So, I&#x27;ve only used them a few times because it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to cut them to size every night before bed in addition to all my regular nightly routine.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these! They are Very Reusable, just by resticking them on the sticker sheet, then resticking them on you! Seem they might last several uses at least, which is what Frownies claim, though I&#x27;ve never been able to do that.    I noticed a difference after one day. I use them primarily under my eyes, though forehead too, and they seem so effective have just begun sides of mouth also where I barely have any lines, but a smidge.     My wrinkles aren&#x27;t super bad, though I have noticed a difference using these, worth the price of admission, for me!  :)</li>
            <li> My comments are similar to the others with favorable reviews.  When I wear the patch nightly I see a great improvement the following day.  I feel like I&#x27;m retraining my brows not to furrow...but only time will tell if this helps in any permanent manner.   They definately work on a short-term basis!  My brow feels more relaxed while I&#x27;m wearing it...and through-out the day when I&#x27;m not.  Easy to use!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t show so much and really do the job. Use each multiple times.</li>
            <li> say what you will, I am believer...these things work</li>
            <li> I use Furlesse every night and sometimes during the day.  Furlesse prevents me from making facial expressions that cause the frown lines between my eyes to form.&lt;br /&gt;Furlesse also seems to prevent me from getting tension headaches by relaxing the muscles between my eyes.  I doubt this is a claim that Furlesse makes but I swear it works for me!</li>
            <li> I saw these in a magazine and decided to give them a try.  They are very comfortable and as they are transparent they could be worn in the day.  I usually buy Frownies, the same sort thing but made of brown paper, so obviously cannot be worn in the daytime. Unfortunately  Furlesse are not available on Amazon UK but as the shipping cost from the USA is very reasonable I will continue to buy.  Still a lot cheaper than Botox which only lasts a couple of months so not very good value.  If you don&#x27;t like looking at your frown lines I would recommend giving  Furlesse a try.</li>
            <li> I TRIED AND THESE REALLY DID NOT ADHERE FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES  I ALSO GOT PIMPLES WHICH IS VERY WEIRD SINCE I HAVE NOT SEEN A PIMPLE IN DECADES</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the great reviews and can not believe we are talking about the same product. I used the strips two nights in a row and there was no improvement or reduction in wrinkle lines at all.  Nothing.  This product is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy to have these little miracle workers at my disposal!  I originally bought these months ago and used them daily and then \\&quot;fell off the wagon.\\&quot;  The other day I got sick and woke up to a scary vision of myself in the mirror: deep lines in my 11&#x27;s.  Add to that mid-age (in my 40&#x27;s) and panic set in.  Thankfully before running to get Botox, I remembered my Furlesse in the medicine cabinet!  I wore it the following night to bed and woke up with a smooth forehead that lasted the greater part of the day.  I have been wearing them nightly since and before evenings out and you&#x27;d swear I&#x27;d gotten Botox!  I&#x27;m hooked.  I&#x27;m so happy to know that when the other lines start rearing their ugly heads, I will have an answer.  Thank you Furlesse!</li>
            <li> I was not sure if these would work, but they really do work i wear one every night and my frown line is going away, its a true product and a great price and great seller</li>
            <li> These are my favorite brand over Frownies, Derma Gel, etc. I love them! Re-usable. I have been using them for three years now or so.</li>
            <li> I would buy these again. I like that they are all the same shape. They are fairly sticky and stay firm. Only one has fallen off before morning. My only complaint is they are a little wide. If I put them exactly where I need them, they hit my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I like that these are unobtrusive and comfortable but I find that Frownies are much more effective at removing my lines.  You also get more product with Frownies. Like a previous reviewer, I found these to be more irritating on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as botox of course....but definitely effective for about 3 hours.  I always have some on hand.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product- simple, well designed , easy to use, affordable and effective! There is no question these do work, and without giving you that freakish stepford look so many poor women are sporting. They are a major advance over Frownies technology- a pliable silicone-like patch is comfortable with no sharp pokey edges; contoured instead of strictly triangular; easier to apply(no glue to activate with water and no holding patch on waiting for glue to set). Very easy to reuse because they do not absorb oil or curl like paper and the gentle adhesive remains on the patch.  The benefits are more than aesthetic- they reduce strain and tension aches as well, as I wear them at home on the computer. I would recommend them to anyone who looks at a screen for hours- even if they had no wrinkles to smooth out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product....I wear them at night....prevents wrinkles...you can reuse them...they last a long time...very good price...they come in different shapes</li>
            <li> Amazing. Really works.I highly recommend this product for a simple, easy fix. I feel more confident when using this product.</li>
            <li> I look and feel less angry.  Trying to prevent permanent wrinkles.  Comfortable and unobtrusive.  Owner responded to my email and sent me samples to try of the other kinds.  I have a really high forehead, and I tried using them sideways, which worked out well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Furlesse for a couple years now and it really works in preventing the frown lines while I sleep. I&#x27;m happy with the product!</li>
            <li> If you do not want chemical or injection solutions, this si for you.  It immediately produces results!  Excellent product for daily usage.</li>
            <li> Great invention! Extremely helpful and I saw results within 2 weeks. I think the Elevens ones are better than the Rows but I still use both. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Did nothing...Does not hold well in place.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> i love these, and when i don&#x27;t have botox for a while -- these are amazing!  i can&#x27;t go to sleep without them!  i tried some other brands but none were as good as these.  definitely recommend to temporarily erase that crease between the brows.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and they stick just fine throughout the night. However, after wearing them for only 3 nights in a row, my forehead is red and chapped. It feels like my skin got sun-burned and looks all crinkly like a scab! Has anyone else had this reaction? I feel like perhaps I&#x27;m allergic to the adhesive or something...</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with Furlesse. It is simple to use. But all that really counts is how effective it is. You will see fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Furlesse Elevens for about 3 weeks and have been pretty amazed by the results. I use them at night and whenever I&#x27;m at home (I&#x27;ve also gone out in public wearing one, I&#x27;m not gonna lie; I was able to mostly cover it with a baseball hat).  The patch goes on easily and stays on all night despite the fact that I use a pretty rich night cream. I&#x27;ve even worn one in the shower and it didn&#x27;t budge. There is an outline left by the patch after it&#x27;s removed but it disappears quickly. I&#x27;m planning on ordering a huge supply. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t discover this product sooner!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. I stopped my monthly supply. Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Furlesse Elevens are great, but they must be used consistently nightly and during the day when possible. There is a noted reduction in the deepness of the&amp;#34; Elevens &amp;#34; between my eyebrow. I highly recommend the product, along with a daily moisturiser between the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have tried both Frownies and Dermagen patches and I have to say the Furlesse elevens are by far the superior product - though they are also the most expensive. On the upside you can use them several times before they only longer stick. The size of the patch is in between a Fownie (which is a bit too big) and a Dermagen patch (which is a bit too small for me). I have been wearing them every night for the last 2 weeks and have noticed an improvement of my lines. I find them very easy to apply just where I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (aside from the price) is that my packet was missing pretty much every third patch - something I didn&#x27;t notice until a week or so later. So when you buy these patches don&#x27;t use them until you are certain you have a full packet.</li>
            <li> It is similar to a piece of cut-out scotch tape except that it is a bit stickier than scotch tapes. I bought this for the frown lines in the forehead in between my eye brows. You need to really stretch the skin out, to even out your wrinkle lines, before you glue the patch on. Since a person has only 2 hands, and 1 needs to be used to hold on to the patch, sometimes gluing it in between the brows on the forehead can be a little bit difficult. But it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it works, I&#x27;d say its effectiveness is probably only 50-60% (to me). I am one of those people who have the tendency to frown when I am deep in my sleep. The frowning is unconscious, so I need to tape this patch on before bedtime to prevent the frown lines from being formed. Sometimes, maybe I frown too hard in my dreams, OR maybe this patch is not sticky enough, it comes off a bit during the night, causing me to see weird frown lines between my brows in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes it does work. Therefore, I&#x27;d say maybe it&#x27;s got 50-60% effectiveness. FYI, if your skin tends to get oily, or if you put on moisturizer, don&#x27;t use this. It won&#x27;t stick through the night. I recently bought DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches. I cut that out to use only for frown lines in between my brows, and I am very satisfied with it! Compare to Furlesse patches, it is easier to use and it works better (I&#x27;d say at least 90% effectiveness!). Furlesse is not bad, but I&#x27;d recommend DermaGen over Furlesse for its effectiveness. And it&#x27;s cheaper too. I&#x27;ll write a separate review for that another day.</li>
            <li> just plastic strips, fairly inflexible, no adherence...Frownies are better</li>
            <li> Great product!  These are so comfortable to wear for the angry elevens and I also use them on my temples.</li>
            <li> I did like does not work like expected.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and I will not ever live without them. I have felt so much more confident every time I wake up and look in the mirror after I remove the patch and see smooth skin. I turned 30 this year and the \\&quot;elevens\\&quot; area (between eyebrows) has seemed flawed by furrow lines. NOT ANYMORE! I use the patches as part of my normal night time routine, in fact it is the easiest part of my night rituals as you only peel the patch off the sheet and apply to problem area (make sure your not furrowing before you apply!). THANK YOU Furlesse :) You have a lifetime customer here!</li>
            <li> I am only 43, but have the serious &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;&#x27;s issue.  After using almost all of product, I&#x27;ve noticed very little in the appearance of my wrinkles.  Maybe if I had started to use this product in my 20&#x27;s, it might be worth it.</li>
