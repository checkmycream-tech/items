            <li> DEAD SEA Biox Set Complete!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M really not sure that this product was new.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive but it doesn&#x27;t work any better than drug store stuff.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the slight thermal feel of the mask.</li>
            <li> I had been noticing some very dry and flaky areas that hadn&#x27;t been improving with what I had been using, that have now disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I had with it was that the seal on the cream was damaged and had leaked a little bit.</li>
            <li> I spent over $118  for these products</li>
            <li> There is very little frangrance, which is critical to me.  </li>
            <li> I plan on trying other products in this line</li>
            <li> this product is comapred with the orginal useless, because it ia an imitated product, not at all with the real ingrediences</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I will keep  buying products from Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Premier Biox set don&#x27;t hold what the Sales People say about it.</li>
            <li> and I mean always end up being disappointed and end up going back to Premier cosmetics in particular their BIOX line of products.  </li>
            <li> Especially for the price, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I doubt seriously if this stuff is from the dead sea or any sea.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>

            <li> I was already familiar with the product and have seen results on my skin.  I bought as a gift.  The package arrived in tact and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products, but Premier beats them all. The BIOX set complete works so fast. The best thing is that these are luxurious products. The set includes the cream, serum and mask! At the mall the set costs close to $800. Amazon has the best prices. I am completely satisfied with the PREMIER DEAD SEA Biox Set Complete!</li>
            <li> This is the fist product I&#x27;ve used where I have seen visual results quickly.  The serum is amazing.  It has softened the lines around my eyes and \\&quot;pouchy\\&quot; wrinkled skin under my eyes.  The cream is light and non-greasy. I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any problems with these products.  I can&#x27;t say that my wrinkles are gone, but they look much better.</li>
            <li> The product was a great value and I was very happy when it came even earlier than i expected. The only issue I had with it was that the seal on the cream was damaged and had leaked a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have used this product line now for almost a year and every time I try something else I always and I mean always end up being disappointed and end up going back to Premier cosmetics in particular their BIOX line of products.  I know this cosmetic line gets a bad rap for harrassing you at the mall kiosks but their products are exceptional.  Always buy through Amazon or I couldn&#x27;t afford them.  They make my skin look and act 10 years younger...firmer soft to the touch etc.  Great seller too!!!</li>
            <li> The Dead sea cream leaves your skin soft and clear. I also like the serum, the mask is also good leaves the face soft and clean. I would recommend this product I have been using it for a month and have seen some result.</li>
            <li> This product came in perfect condition and in a timely matter.  i have been using it for 4 years and still swear by it.  it doesnt erase wrinkles you currently have, but it does diminish their appearance and help lessen future wrinkles.  i have sensitive skin and this product never gives me a negative reaction, no breakouts, no rashes, just smooth young looking skin.  much better than most products i have tried, from CVS to Macy&#x27;s.  Especially for the price, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for 3 years and am very pleased with the results.  Lines around the mouth and creases in the chin area have smoothed out a lot.  I have no crows feet!  I&#x27;m 69 and most people think I&#x27;m 50.  I call that excellent results and will continue using the serums and creams.  I expecially like the thermal mask, it warms and soothes.  The other products work a lot better with regular use of the mask.  Don&#x27;t buy this product at the \\&quot;mall\\&quot;, it will cost you 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive but it doesn&#x27;t work any better than drug store stuff.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money and I doubt seriously if this stuff is from the dead sea or any sea.  WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
            <li> very good, great saler. integer and the product arrived on time.  thanks for the great service.  Agora chega, muito obrigado.  Adeus</li>
            <li> this product is comapred with the orginal useless, because it ia an imitated product, not at all with the real ingrediences</li>
            <li> It would be 5 stars if the mask was in a better shape. I&#x27;M really not sure that this product was new. I have the impression that it has been opened before. The texture is not the same that I&#x27;m used to.I have used the Premier products for more than 3 years and I know  them very well. It&#x27;s  the reason why I&#x27;m disapointed and I&#x27;m wondering if I will continue to order by internet.</li>
            <li> Great prices for these products on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using the products for a month now and I&#x27;m beginning to notice a difference in the texture and look of my skin.  I had been noticing some very dry and flaky areas that hadn&#x27;t been improving with what I had been using, that have now disappeared.  I especially like the slight thermal feel of the mask.</li>
            <li> My sister swears by these products so I decided to try them.  Not wanting to pay full price, which is extortionate, I searched Amazon and found this vendor and the products at a great price.  Service was excellent.  One of the products arrived damaged and they replaced it immediately.  As for how well the product works, so far so good.  My skin feels soft and hydrated and the sun damage and lines are reduced.</li>
            <li> Evry Dead Sea product I have from Amazon has been excellent.  I love the fact that all these product penetrate the skin quickly  yet have an effect on my skin.  I will keep  buying products from Dead Sea.  Thank you very much for such a nice skin care regimine.</li>
            <li> Great product that works. Same item was quote at $1500.00 at local mall at kiosk sales pitch. This is the identical product they sell, do not be fooled that it isn&#x27;t. Look at the upc codes, there are identical, as well as all packaging marks.</li>
            <li> These products are amazing.  There is very little frangrance, which is critical to me.  And after just 1 application, there is a noticable improvement in the appearance of my 55-year old skin.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The dead sea product is really really good!! I plan to buy more in the future. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> OK. Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> I returned it.  Never got my money back.  I have a tracking number showing they received and they still refuse to get me my money</li>
            <li> I will never purchase from this person again.  Product was open and spilled into the box.  Sent pictures and never got a response.  I spent over $118  for these products</li>
            <li> This product is EXACTLY what you&#x27;d find in a mall kiosk for only a small portion of the price.  I highly recommend!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Premier Biox set don&#x27;t hold what the Sales People say about it. The wrinkle are not going away</li>
            <li> excellent product!!!!!!!!!! warms up as you rub on your face. really good product &amp; you don&#x27;t have to leave it on for long, about 10 - 15 minutes is all you need. i recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this at a mall and paid way to much but she had amazing results so I tried it. I have not had amazing results but like the product. It does a good job and does not brake me out. I plan on trying other products in this line</li>
