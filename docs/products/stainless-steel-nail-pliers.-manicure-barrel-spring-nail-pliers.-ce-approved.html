            <li>The Stainless Steel Nail Pliers are great.</li>
            <li>They work better than any clippers or pliers</li>
            <li>If it sold for more than fifteen bucks I&#x27;d look elsewhere, but until then...</li>
            <li>You could pay twice as much and not be happy.</li>

            <li>These are pretty good nail clippers.</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you - they are superior to those costing much more.</li>
            <li>great, inexpensive, good workmanship, great feel, a little hard to relock handles.</li>
            <li>Other than that they seem to do a great job on nails.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how to sharpen something like this and returning it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the hassle.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found the same ones on amazon.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for to replace a pair I had inherited from my father 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this style clipper for years to handle my talons and they make short work of even my most heinous of nails.  </li>

            <li>They are sharp, strong and appear to be well made.  </li>
            <li>Fabulously sharp and strong.</li>
            <li>The release bar is kind of sharp, so you have to be careful opening &amp; closing them.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I cannot secure the handles by engaging the safety catch, otherwise I would have given them five stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them on the toenails of my 96 yr old mother and on the lab&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see they were from a company that supplies dog products, but</li>
            <li>If they hold up only time will tell but I really think they will.</li>
            <li>Very well made clipper for human use also.  </li>
            <li>Edges near pivot point&lt;br /&gt;could</li>
            <li>They seem to be good quality and work very well on bad toe nails.</li>
            <li>About the same as my old cutter.</li>
            <li>Strong, sharp, pointy and heavy.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Pivot points near the barrel spring are also very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Also, the design of the cutting blades makes it much easier and more accurate to remove those pesky painful ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> Filing them took FOREVER, so they got too long.  </li>
            <li> These pliers are above average.</li>
            <li> They are sharp with properly aligned cutting surfaces and cut cleanly with little effort.</li>
            <li> Acts like the spring is a little too wide.</li>
            <li> Spring flew out when used the first time, cutting edges do not line up when closed.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my wife thinks I should use my nails as actual nails.  </li>
            <li> Little cumbersome but get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li> A spring broke on the first use and they were so stiff to use, the points were sharp and but the cutting edges very dull.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, takes much less pressure to cut very thick toenails.</li>
            <li> Too big and clunky to cut my difficult nails.</li>
            <li> Buy these and get to work on those neglected toenails, no more excuses.</li>
            <li> After 25 years they became dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68, and my toenails have gotten too thick to cut with clippers or manicure scissors.</li>
            <li> Work well on Hubby&#x27;s thick toenails.  </li>
            <li> I might not have the world&#x27;s toughest toenails, but I&#x27;m up for an honorable mention at the very least.</li>
            <li> Totally useless.</li>
            <li> Very hard to lock or unlock!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Too big and clunky to cut my difficult nails.</li>
            <li> The Stainless Steel Nail Pliers are great. They work better than any clippers or pliers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I had these nail pliers before. After 25 years they became dull. I&#x27;m glad I found the same ones on amazon. Best pliers for my toenails ever.</li>

            <li> These nail pliers are GREAT!!! Solved my Problem!!!</li>
            <li> It cuts nails.  It cuts toe nails too.  It works.</li>
            <li> Good band for the buck.  If it sold for more than fifteen bucks I&#x27;d look elsewhere, but until then...</li>
            <li> About the same as my old cutter.</li>
            <li> Smaller then I thought would be. Much too curved blades. Very hard to lock or unlock!! Price was within reason.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price. The release bar is kind of sharp, so you have to be careful opening &amp; closing them. But a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> These work well and fit my hand perfectly. The price does not reflect the quality. You could pay twice as much and not be happy.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good nail clippers. The only problem is it is about impossable to open and close them from the locked possition and then to put them back into  locked . Acts like the spring is a little too wide. Other than that they seem to do a great job on nails.</li>
            <li> Using these for my personal pedicure routine.  They are sharp, strong and appear to be well made.  They come from an animal care company, but that is just an &amp;#34;oh, well&amp;#34;  as they work great for humans too.</li>
            <li> Cuts very well. The only problem I have is using the clasp to close the blades...It takes a bit of effort though I probably could learn to do it rapidly, eventually.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best bargain in sturdy nail clippers around.  Quality seems very good.  Buy these and get to work on those neglected toenails, no more excuses.</li>
            <li> excellent product,replaced one like it which lasted for years.would have given it 5 star if it came with a  case</li>

            <li> I think these are made for cats &amp; dogs, but they work great for my toenails.  I&#x27;m 68, and my toenails have gotten too thick to cut with clippers or manicure scissors. Filing them took FOREVER, so they got too long.  Didn&#x27;t know what I ewas going to do, and then I found these pliers.</li>

            <li> Work well on Hubby&#x27;s thick toenails.  I was surprised to see they were from a company that supplies dog products, but what the heck... whatever works.  :-)</li>
            <li> I must have gotten the dud.  They don&#x27;t cut.  They crush the nail.  I have no idea how to sharpen something like this and returning it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the hassle.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> nice size to grip making them vastly easier to use. They seem to be good quality and work very well on bad toe nails. If they hold up only time will tell but I really think they will.</li>
