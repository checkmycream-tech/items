            <li> is still dry, no matter how much you floss,brush or even gargle the sour taste at the back of your mouth and foul smell</li>
            <li> I found this by accident looking for a toothpaste that didn&#x27;t contain fluoride or those artificial sweeteners that most pastes now contain.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long while.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and my local vitamin store closed, so I went looking for it elsewhere and found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words you are suffering from Halitosis!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But now I plan to continue to buy this, even if I like the other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love it, 4 stars because of taste, tastes like cloves and I hate cloves</li>
            <li> Not only sensitive to cold, but to chewy foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just the slight clove sensation that goes away in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I noticed lately that I haven&#x27;t had any pain/sensitive tooth aches as I typically have.</li>
            <li> Using for bleeding gum issue, takes a little time to get use to the taste, but leaves teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using regular store tooth paste, as they have all bad chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s reversing the other ill effects I&#x27;ve caused.</li>
            <li> I am so tired of spearmint, peppermint, or wintergreen flavors.</li>
            <li> Now no more bloody brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have one tooth that tends to trap debris and my gum suffers from it.</li>
            <li> Sounds unpleasant, but I couldn&#x27;t brush my teeth without spitting out blood.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now. I will keep using it but I also use another toothpaste sometimes since this one doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride and my dentist said I should continue to use toothpastes with fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has helped a lot with my sensitive teeth. If I use it regularly, I&#x27;m totally fine. If I skip using it for a couple of weeks, my teeth are sensitive again. Not only sensitive to cold, but to chewy foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find that this helped with whitening at all. It does not say that it does, but I had read another review here when I bought it and the reviewer said they noticed their teeth were whiter. I hoped that would be the case with me too, but no change.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long while.  I really like it.  It cleans and makes your mouth feel healthy.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Its a good toothpaste, I&#x27;ve used it before and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste.  It helps with dental sensitivity and periodontal issues that I have.  A little bit goes a long way, so it is not a expensive as it may seem.</li>
            <li> taste like cloves but it helps</li>
            <li> If I could buy a hundred bottles of this I would that&#x27;s just how good it is WOW!! I LOVE this stuff and my 8yr old does too!! since using it I have not had any cavities in 2yrs LOVE, LOVE, LOLVE it. Whenever I can I buy it in bulk so I don&#x27;t run out at all. I love that it whitens and gives me a sparkle clean smile and keeps my teeth clean all day. I don&#x27;t think I would ever go back to fluoride toothpaste again gross!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like mint and most toothpaste have some type of mint in it. I like Vita-Myr because my teeth feel clean after using it and of course there is no mint.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for someone who cannot use regular toothpaste which are too strong as it sheds the insides of her mouth. Good for periodontal disease as well.</li>

            <li> Will not use anything else after using this one.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few natural toothpastes and this one is by far my favorite. It makes my mouth and gums feel so good and clean, and my teeth literally squeak they get so clean. The taste is a lot different than regular toothpaste, but in my opinion, that&#x27;s a good thing. Very fresh and invigorating - worth the price.</li>
            <li> First, I like the interesting taste that others just don&#x27;t have. I am so tired of spearmint, peppermint, or wintergreen flavors. The foaming of this toothpaste was great so it really helps make my teeth and gums feel great.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I just wish it didn&#x27;t have vegetable glycerin in it.</li>
            <li> Not much to say; leaves teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I love the clove oil flavor to this toothpaste.  I have BMS and this is a great toothpaste to help calm down the burn and cleans teeth at the same time.</li>
            <li> Receding gums on both my wife and myself have been HEALING as verified by our dentist since we started using this great product.  Use the mouth wash too! IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and my local vitamin store closed, so I went looking for it elsewhere and found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using this toothpaste I have had no cavities (no guarantee for you, of course--and I didn&#x27;t have many before). (I do floss well also...Reach total care floss, also from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Recently developed sensitive gums and started using this almost a month ago and I think it has helped to lessen the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Really digging this toothpaste. I go between using this and my homemade version (coconut oil, baking soda, essential oil).  My dentist is very impressed with my dental health...No cavities, hardly any tartar or plaque, healthy gums, very white teeth.  She and her hygienists were dying to know what I was using and were very surprised when I told them. Will probably continue using this as well as my homemade version unless I find something better.</li>
            <li> I found this by accident looking for a toothpaste that didn&#x27;t contain fluoride or those artificial sweeteners that most pastes now contain.  Vita-myr leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean and that&#x27;s all I expect from my toothpaste.  If I get a good report from my next dental cleaning, I&#x27;ll know I found the perfect toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s not as minty as the big selling brands.  Yes, it has an odd taste but not unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients really helped with gum sensitivity..</li>
            <li> this toothpaste was recommend to me and works just as described. It leaves a fresh clean taste and is very helpful for dental problems</li>
            <li> Sounds unpleasant, but I couldn&#x27;t brush my teeth without spitting out blood.  Now no more bloody brushing.  I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste several years.  When I quit using Vita-myr, the bleeding came back.  Pricey but it&#x27;s worth it for me.  The only reason I tried to quit using it is the price.  I&#x27;m a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Great Price &amp; Quick Shipping. Highly Recommend. A+++++++</li>
            <li> I completely love this toothpaste.  People need to stop complaining about the cloves. There is no toothpaste after taste at all. Just the slight clove sensation that goes away in 5 minutes. So much better then 30 minutes of toothpaste after taste.  Mouth feels so clean and refreshed afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;  Were not used to natural herbs. Were used to chemicals. People with sensitive teeth and gums will appreciate the cloves.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, but I like the clove effect. Don&#x27;t pass this toothpaste by based on some ones review. If you want great herbal toothpaste then you need to try this out. They ship fast too. I got this while waiting on some thats shipping from Asia and taking a month. But now I plan to continue to buy this, even if I like the other toothpaste. Different herbs will give different benefits. Good to have 2-3 kinds of herbal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Good taste and mouth feel</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I have always enjoyed the taste of cloves and I like that I can brush my teeth and still drink coffee or tea afterwards and not have the taste distorted as I do with minty toothpastes. After about 2 weeks of usage, I am noticing that my teeth are whiter.</li>
