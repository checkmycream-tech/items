            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I works wonderfully on scars.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff</li>
            <li>It will burn your skin and is incredibly painful.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t forget to neutralize with a baking soda paste.</li>
            <li>This is also great to remove moles and warts.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li>it is good for the intention I have when I bough it, to remove warts</li>
            <li>Give the spot a good month to morph.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the end results.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definately without a doubt faded the ink significantly!!</li>
            <li>I cover up may be better ,but, to each is own</li>
            <li>Strong!</li>
            <li>This stuff is STRONG!</li>
            <li>Based on my results, I think it would be safe to use a 50% solution for uses described in the accompanying use and dilution instructions without risk of scarring, but I would not recommend going any stronger.  </li>
            <li>If you have any acne that you want to get rid of permanantly, this is the best and last solution you&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li>I have tried on tattoos, but i would need too many peels to achieve the results i want.</li>

            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>make sure you buy the ph neutralizer to stop the burning.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a tattoo removal and it burn my skin off and the doctor said if it doesn&#x27;t do better I will have to have surgery.</li>
            <li>Getting the 100% allows dilution which gives more versatility and cost-effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I buy the full strength because it is much more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Use the weakest solution that gets the job done - probably better to do 2 or 3 times with a weaker solution than to go to strong.  </li>
            <li>A STRONG one.</li>
            <li>If you have severe acne, light acne, scarring, warts, or need tattoo removal I would suggest using this product.</li>
            <li>I would have loved to feel as confident about myself back then as I do now.</li>

            <li>Be sure to follow the directions exactly.</li>

            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 7/15/15 - 33% solution was effective for nearly everything I tried it on with one application.  </li>
            <li>I recommend not using full strength.</li>
            <li>i am crying and I prided my self on taking great care of my skin what have done?</li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll have new fresh and smooth skin after the peel.</li>
            <li>This will burn and peel the first layer of skin(epidermis) off your face.</li>
            <li>The collagen I use afterwards helps also regenerate cells with healthy ones that grow back.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to have it completely removed and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works but be very carful not to ue it too much.  </li>
            <li>Its working on my wart on my hand very well.</li>
            <li>Even better than what i expected.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this once a month for 3 months.to remove an old unwanted tattoo on my forearm.</li>
            <li>Please, please keep far away from children and animals.</li>

            <li> I was skeptical at first, but it completely removed the plantar from the bottom of my foot.  </li>
            <li> ....works well as long as you know how to use.</li>
            <li> I hope this could be corrected, even taking the long route.</li>
            <li> I just dilute this with water and put it on with a Q-tip, then rinse it off as soon as that area turns grey.  </li>
            <li> Whatever you do, don&#x27;t use it full strength or you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> it just has to have a slight bump to the mole, not big</li>
            <li> I mixed a 33% solution to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; a few spots on my face where my dermatologist had treated a bunch of AK&#x27;s (actinic keratosis).  </li>
            <li> if this is used to remove tattoos , use carefully and it will take lots of treatments .</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only been a few days.</li>
            <li> There are other posts here describing the permanence of the mistake of going to strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use caution to not drip on any other spot of the tattoo you are trying to bleach .</li>
            <li> Took only a small amount too.</li>
            <li> It works, but be very careful because it will burn anything it touches.</li>
            <li> this is how you shave off years to look younger and with less wrinkles, scars and no ACNE!!</li>
            <li> Some advice if you are medium to dark complexion purchase the Jenssen line.  </li>
            <li> TCA can scar or leave dark spots on medium to dark completion.</li>
            <li> but it is designed for medium and dark completion.</li>
            <li> This is the hollywood secret to the stars looking young well into thier 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> You can dilute it down for your needs.</li>
            <li> I just think that is one of the down sides of using a chemical on your face to maintain,  beauty.</li>
            <li> Be very careful!</li>
            <li> Im an RN and have used it previously in a dermatology offfice</li>
            <li> I use this for removing a half sleeve tattoo on my arm.</li>
            <li> I think he used a 50% solution, but I will know in about a week whether I need to go a little stronger.  </li>
            <li> I have a friend that gave me some needles and have noticed when I inject some collagen under the skin where the scar is, it stings a little....</li>
            <li> I had a small mole on my neck</li>
            <li> Be careful -- it can peel and burn like crazy.</li>
            <li> id rather have a small scare that will go away instead of ugly moles.</li>
            <li> so the skin there is very tough.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS!</li>

            <li> Im an RN and have used it previously in a dermatology offfice....works well as long as you know how to use.</li>
            <li> A Bigger bang for your buck because you mix it to the level you need. Some advice if you are medium to dark complexion purchase the Jenssen line.  TCA can scar or leave dark spots on medium to dark completion. The Jenssen line  works just as well as TCA but it is designed for medium and dark completion.</li>
            <li> It did not remove any skin tags or warts. Only irritated the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but it completely removed the plantar from the bottom of my foot.  I am a runner so the skin there is very tough.  I was pleasantly surprised to have it completely removed and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again and recommended</li>
            <li> Follow dilution instructions to have the right strength for your application.  I mixed a 33% solution to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; a few spots on my face where my dermatologist had treated a bunch of AK&#x27;s (actinic keratosis).  I think he used a 50% solution, but I will know in about a week whether I need to go a little stronger.  You don&#x27;t want to go too strong on your first use - much better to try a weaker solution first, then gauge whether to go stronger.  Use the weakest solution that gets the job done - probably better to do 2 or 3 times with a weaker solution than to go to strong.  There are other posts here describing the permanence of the mistake of going to strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/15/15 - 33% solution was effective for nearly everything I tried it on with one application.  Went to second and third applications on two moles.  No scarring.  Based on my results, I think it would be safe to use a 50% solution for uses described in the accompanying use and dilution instructions without risk of scarring, but I would not recommend going any stronger.  You can cause significant injury with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Strong! Be very careful! Did not remove warts. But dried out the skin so much and so deep that it cracked deeply. Tried for a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using TCA acid for several years. I&#x27;m very pleased with the end results. If you have any acne that you want to get rid of permanantly, this is the best and last solution you&#x27;ll ever use. I left a few people i know with severe acne use this, and the acne is completely gone after the first use. This will burn and peel the first layer of skin(epidermis) off your face.You&#x27;ll have new fresh and smooth skin after the peel. Be sure to follow the directions exactly. This does hurt and burn when you put it on, so it&#x27;s not for wimps. you&#x27;ll look like you have a severe sunburn, but in 3-5 days, you&#x27;ll begin to peel. this is how you shave off years to look younger and with less wrinkles, scars and no ACNE!! This is also great to remove moles and warts. I have tried on tattoos, but i would need too many peels to achieve the results i want. This is the hollywood secret to the stars looking young well into thier 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s.Almost any skin problem can be corrected with this, and if you can look up to 10 years younger, and have a week to hide if you&#x27;re concerned about how you look then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Works but be very carful not to ue it too much.  It can burn skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> NEVER REMOVE A MOLE YOURSELF! THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS! CONSULT A DERMATOLOGIST AS THEY ARE YOUR BEST RESOURCE FOR PROPER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT! SHAME ON YOU SELLER!!!</li>
            <li> So far, from around a week of use, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements on my olantar warts with 80% solution (I diluted it). As for the one in my back hand, the wart got black/dark. Hopefully it would subside.</li>
            <li> Its working on my wart on my hand very well.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product! It&#x27;s excellent! I&#x27;m using it to remove a tattoo, and so far it&#x27;s definitely lightening the ink! I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Even better than what i expected. I works wonderfully on scars. I will indeed re order. I am highly satisfyed.</li>
            <li> thanks to your product I no longer have dark spots. I wish I could put my before and after pictures I needed your product fierce!</li>
            <li> worked for me. I had a small mole on my neck and I put this on twice, it made a hell of of a scab and when the scab fell away it was gone. id rather have a small scare that will go away instead of ugly moles. Got rid of all of them. it just has to have a slight bump to the mole, not big and it&#x27;s gone. love it. make sure you buy the ph neutralizer to stop the burning. doesn&#x27;t hurt but just stops burning process. then use band aid till next day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a tattoo removal and it burn my skin off and the doctor said if it doesn&#x27;t do better I will have to have surgery. Don&#x27;t buy this stuff it isn&#x27;t good at all. I have pictures of what it did if you want to see it facebook me at debbie.huggins1984@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with scars for years. Getting the 100% allows dilution which gives more versatility and cost-effectiveness. I&#x27;ve tried multiple skin peels and TCA works the best, hands down. Wish I had found out about it years and years ago. I heal well naturally, but months over years is a long time. I would have loved to feel as confident about myself back then as I do now. If you have severe acne, light acne, scarring, warts, or need tattoo removal I would suggest using this product. Be careful -- it can peel and burn like crazy. I would suggest not being in public too much and to be EXTREMELY careful about administrating the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works BUT you must dilute it. It will burn your skin and is incredibly painful.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t forget to neutralize with a baking soda paste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a month for 3 months.to remove an old unwanted tattoo on my forearm. This stuff is STRONG! Not for amatures! It&#x27;s definately without a doubt faded the ink significantly!! But also causes a lot of peeling, burning, itching,etc. Must be used with caution and properly diluted with water.</li>
            <li> use caution to not drip on any other spot of the tattoo you are trying to bleach . if this is used to remove tattoos , use carefully and it will take lots of treatments . you will be left with faded scar tissue. I cover up may be better ,but, to each is own</li>
            <li> I buy the full strength because it is much more cost effective.  You can dilute it down for your needs. It&#x27;s enough to complete the amount of applications that are required.  I use this for removing a half sleeve tattoo on my arm. Superfast delivery.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a wart on my foot.  It&#x27;s still there but it&#x27;s only been a few days.</li>
            <li> Please READ all Brown skinned people. DO not I repeat do not use this. Save your money, use another alternative to fade superficial acne scars. My face was so beautiful, I only put it on three small areas of my face diluted to only 25%, and now my golden brown skin in those areas are now dark, almost fertilizer black in color. i am crying and I prided my self on taking great care of my skin what have done? Save yourself and just don&#x27;t do it. I researched and researched everything weeks before hand and did everything to the t. I just think that is one of the down sides of using a chemical on your face to maintain,  beauty. I hope this could be corrected, even taking the long route. Please take my advice and don&#x27;t do it all women of color.</li>
            <li> Finally. Something to help me get rid of hypertropic scars. I bought this with some copper peptide solution (RenLee--I think I got it separately from this site). Both together are helping me get rid of scars on my back from acne and a burn mark on my arm. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t use it full strength or you&#x27;ll be sorry. I just dilute this with water and put it on with a Q-tip, then rinse it off as soon as that area turns grey.  I don&#x27;t really need to worry about the baking soda because soap is also alkaline too, so don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t have baking soda on hand. And also, don&#x27;t expect this to be an instant fix. It&#x27;s just something that speeds up cell turnover. The collagen I use afterwards helps also regenerate cells with healthy ones that grow back. I have a friend that gave me some needles and have noticed when I inject some collagen under the skin where the scar is, it stings a little....then the skin seems to grow back healthier. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never use this on my face though because that&#x27;s my money-maker!!</li>
            <li> Came damaged and cracked didn&#x27;t want to get burned so threw away</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT,JEST COST TO MUCH.</li>
            <li> This is an acid. A STRONG one. Follow the directions.</li>
            <li> It works, but be very careful because it will burn anything it touches. I recommend not using full strength. Took only a small amount too.</li>
            <li> it is good for the intention I have when I bough it, to remove warts</li>
            <li> it totally dissolved a skin tag I had on my inner thigh but it did take about 5 re applications.  Awesome stuff</li>
            <li> Took care of brown spots I have had for years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress the caution enough. This will take care of sebaceous hyperplasia.Dab only the bump itself and not any surround skin. Use a tiny amount on something like a tip (pull off as much of the cotton as you can ) apply only once for just a few seconds. Avoid peeling as much as possible. Give the spot a good month to morph.  I just did sixteen at once on my face. I don&#x27;t recommend this unless you can tolerate the solitary confinement. Please, please keep far away from children and animals.</li>
            <li> It needs to be diluted if using. Will burn if not used properly and leave a red mark for a while. But it does what it needs to do, burns layer of skin. So far reduced my acne scars. Not too noticeable but only did it once.</li>
