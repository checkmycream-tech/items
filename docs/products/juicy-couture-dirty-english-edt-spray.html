            <li>Smelled so good on him.</li>
            <li>He loved it.</li>
            <li>It is a Man&#x27;s scent and it&#x27;s just so intoxicating, unique and delicious smelling.</li>
            <li>just about all of the womens line(which is exceptional).  </li>
            <li>Lol I love it though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for colder weathers and it lasts more than 8 hours for me.</li>

            <li>Love the fragrance of this on my Man!</li>

            <li>The lid closes with a nice metallic clink.</li>
            <li>He even showed it off this his guy friend saying how much he liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice and woody and organic smelling.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied customer- good bang for the buck on this stuff.</li>
            <li>the perfume is wonderful, the shipment was fast....</li>
            <li>One shouldn&#x27;t buy a scent because they like it, or because it&#x27;s popular.</li>
            <li>I was told by a friend that it smelled really nice</li>
            <li>I smelled it on a friend at a party and was able to find it at a really good price,</li>
            <li>AND WAS A NICE X-MAS GIFT.</li>
            <li>Warm, inviting, and underratedâ€¦</li>
            <li>Came in original sealed box in great condition</li>
            <li>This is a cheap fragrance but a good one.</li>
            <li>I own about 60 bottles and growing and this is another that is more of a decorative piece than anything else.  </li>
            <li>Nicely packaged and hoping the boys love it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Who knew that nice cologne can be so inexpensive :) ...</li>
            <li>The girl likes it a lot, nice wood leather smell not to strong, reminds me of winter parties and James Bond kind of feel.  </li>
            <li>Great price and the shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li>The package included perfume samples, it was very thoughtful of the seller.</li>
            <li>Smelled good but wore off way to quickly.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have nothing with oud in it and would love to see what Gucci PH smelled like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an authentic bottle with matching serial number on the box and bottle.</li>
            <li>OK if you like cider wood</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>like so many men&#x27;s colognes or aftershave</li>
            <li>we women love (and let&#x27;s face it...</li>
            <li>It was not a bad price and my husband loves the spray!!</li>
            <li>Sniff this one out for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t asked for more ....</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for Christmas hoping to find another scent for him, but this smelled much better in the bottle than on him.  </li>
            <li>The ladies love the stuff,,enough said.</li>
            <li>for many hours.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get yours before they eventually all run out of stock....</li>
            <li>Worked excellent back then.</li>
            <li>The aftershave was absolutely immobile inside the packaging and when it arrived I experienced no uneasiness while opening the package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had authentic bottles before and this is not like it.</li>
            <li>Been my sons favorite for years now.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on the cologne.  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>No matter what your &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; is, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>Chicks love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>I pick up mostly on the Leather and Sandalwood notes.</li>
            <li>My wife love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>I love having it in my collection.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Sexy without the musk</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Dior Homme crowds :-).</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne on my Husband.</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>So buy it up while it is still available!</li>
            <li>simply put, it&#x27;s the best men&#x27;s fragrance (for me) ever produced.  </li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>I THOUGH FOR SURE</li>
            <li>Great price and came really fast</li>
            <li>I learnt one more time (fool) - never buy any cologne online.</li>
            <li>It came in very nice condition thanks a lot</li>
            <li>Its not to strong and its not to light it just smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Great product and shipped pretty quick</li>
            <li>Now, you smell mostly alcohol, cheap cedar, and cheaper musk.</li>
            <li>More importantly, my girlfriend likes it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong in scent.</li>
            <li>I only used it on nice occasions because it smells so good</li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s smells strong</li>
            <li>I LOVE this scent, and am happy I was able to find such a large bottle of it for an affordable price!</li>
            <li>I remember when I first got this fragrance loved it then and still love it now really one of my favs.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite cologne!</li>
            <li>Might be a good option for those old guys with strong perfumes but just not for me.</li>
            <li>Almost a light fragrance...</li>
            <li>idk why it was so cheap through amazon when i bought this</li>
            <li>Kenneth Cole RSVP(Excellent cheap scent/</li>
            <li>discontinued but still readily available).  </li>
            <li>again it smells cheap.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this cologne</li>
            <li>Amazing scent, Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I wish it was still available in stores.</li>
            <li>it definitely seems like something he would have on lol.</li>
            <li>This was such a great deal considering in the stores</li>
            <li>I still enjoy smelling this on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>Performance is modest at best, lasting 4 hours top and within armâ€™s length.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your dayâ€¦</li>
            <li>I was not sure if it would smell that great because I had never smelt it before, but I wanted to get my boyfriend a really nice cologne for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Smells great.. but does not stay on for long, atleast the one which I received.</li>
            <li>The retailers version was significantly lighter in color than the product i had received.</li>
            <li>It came with a plastic cap and smelled nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>This smelled like soap and the original has a leather smell.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s about time to give up on finding the original.</li>
            <li>Powerful seduction!</li>
            <li>so I was initially excited to find it online.  </li>
            <li>Therefore you will be under the radar and offer a unique smell during nights in the bar/club.  </li>
            <li>Despite these performance challenges, I do recommend adding Dirty English to your collection â€“ it is a pleasant scent, the bottle is cool, good flexibility for most events, and the price is incredible.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is woodsy, clean and suit me to a T.</li>
            <li>Clean not musky at all.</li>
            <li>At first it looks and smell like original, but after it wears out very quickly - it has cheap smell...  </li>
            <li>Figured I would try it out due to many good reviews</li>
            <li>It was by no means inadequate, and I was fairly certain the product would be intact, I just wasn&#x27;t as sure as I was with the aftershave tonic.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this 4 years ago and it is what I wear for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to tell that this was an original and not a fake.</li>
            <li>The hubby loves it too, and couldnt believe it was at such a good price.</li>
            <li>Not an offensive loud scent, warm and inviting.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be true with a lot of colognes...</li>
            <li>I bough my second bottle,  amazing fragance, girls stop for watching me when the smell touch them, very happy to gei it half price!</li>
            <li>It smells strong and manly and makes for a good alternative from the other colognes I wear.</li>
            <li>the women who buy such for their men mostly do so because they...the women....are the ones lovin&#x27; it :-)  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the clever design of the bottle, with a wristlet and charms on top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is a personal favorite and is very unique.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>sure what appeal this had when it was fresh, new to the market, and selling well.</li>
            <li>Worth looking at.</li>
            <li>it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is a great men&#x27;s fragrance that not only has a good complex aroma but also is a manly smell.</li>
            <li>I think it may be his chemistry, because I&#x27;ve smelled it on other men and it smelled really good on them.</li>
            <li>Son loves this scent and the price was right.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing right now, buying a bottle for him for his birthday in a month.</li>
            <li>Very fast.</li>
            <li>It comes with a plastic cap, and is made by a new company &amp;#34;under license&amp;#34; from the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle, has a warm, outdoor Cedar essence with undertones that keep it interesting.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments when wearing this fragrance, mainly compliments on its overtly masculine presence.  </li>
            <li>but it only cost $25 including shipping and tax thanks to a super cheap item eligible for super saver shipping that brought me over the $25 mark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Juicy couture cologne is an okay fragrance,it&#x27;s different from my collection.</li>
            <li>my first spicy cologne</li>
            <li>shipped like i did ;]</li>
            <li>Anyone interested in a woodsy scent on a budget grab</li>
            <li>It has a cheap smell and it smells old.</li>
            <li>and I love buying different colognes to try them out.</li>
            <li>The cologne however was a bit on the light side as far as the packaging went.</li>
            <li>My wife bought the first bottle of this 4 or 5 years ago</li>
            <li>This is was a gift for my brother, but I have to say that I really do like this scent!</li>
            <li>first then I turned around and purchased it for myself.</li>
            <li>love this cologne enough</li>
            <li>it was exactly what i wanted to get for my boyfriend</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever had an issue like this, but it looks nothing like what is pictured.</li>
            <li>Get lots of positive comments.  </li>
            <li>It came in the mail pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>Dirty English is a nicely done blend of spicy and herbal notes that is ideal for fall and winter.  </li>
            <li>It is strong enough to last, but not too strong and overpowering.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Dirty English is a great fragrance, no longer being produced, do a search see for yourself, Juicy Couture licensed the productions rights to a major fragrance distributor, I forget the name, however even their site does not list it as a current</li>
            <li>I was certain the product would be intact.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite cologne and I must start wearing it often to make up for wearing uni&#x27;s like Le Male and Prada Amber from time to time.</li>
            <li>Very manly, and more of a nighttime cologne, regardless of the fact I wear it almost every single</li>
            <li>I will not purchase again, probably not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>but it is very musky..</li>
            <li>A very \\&quot;enticing\\&quot; fragrance, so if you plan on never having sex don&#x27;t ever use it.</li>
            <li>Again, very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line is if you want to smell like a real man, then buy this cologne.</li>
            <li>Does not compare favorably to the &#x27;real thing&#x27;.</li>
            <li>also a very alluring one too.</li>
            <li>This is one cologne that I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t know if it would be too much for my boyfriend to use it</li>
            <li>and I like it so much till I searched all over and found it here.</li>
            <li>the picture shows the real one, this is not what you will get.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much, however.  </li>
            <li>If you are real man</li>
            <li>He still hasn&#x27;t convinced me that he really likes it.</li>
            <li>but it ended to be more than I expected.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 3 times as much.</li>
            <li>this is by far my personal favorite.</li>
            <li>but it gives you that original scent that doesn&#x27;t last...</li>
            <li>small spray for work, couple more at night!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a wuss by any means, but only action super stars and Greek gods should smell this manly and sexy.</li>
            <li>The box was a little old,so it wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for a gift...</li>
            <li>This works for me and is my second full bottle.  </li>
            <li>Do not need to use much when applying, it is very strong and will last very long afterwards...</li>
            <li>Was expecting more from this juice but was left with a smoky, amber note that died down to musk quickly.  </li>
            <li>was the main manufacture on the bottle</li>
            <li>It is a big bold scent.  </li>
            <li>Most recently a woman at Wataburger stopped me mid sentence to tell me I smelled</li>
            <li>I collect perfumes and colognes and i am telling you this product has no smell and although the original paperwork for this purchase is long gone</li>
            <li>Cap is plastic, no charm, cheap sticker on the front of the bottle, and it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly the same, close but not the same.</li>
            <li>Very cheap for shipping if not free</li>
            <li>It is strong and difference than any other cologne I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>the store its around $65.00,,,,Anyway back to the cologne,,,very nice and long lasting,a twist on all the other britsh style scents,,its excellent for both day or night and casual or dress up events....</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying especially since it can be had for $28 for a 3.4oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>/&gt;the packing slip said $70 which i think is what it normally costs (but i wasn&#x27;t overcharged or anything).</li>
            <li>As I stated with the tonic, this is a scent that I have not been able to find in stores for the past three years, but I like it so much that I never forgot about it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like the normal stuff I buy</li>
            <li>It has a heavy musk and presence which some may not have a taste for and also some may not be able to pull off.  </li>
            <li>But like I said this cologne is for real men not little boys.</li>
            <li>I would also add that Dirty English is an excellent entry level fragrance for those beginning their collection and looking for a decent fragrance at a bargain price.  </li>
            <li>a new comer of the cologne</li>
            <li>will try to reign in my bright ideas the next time I walk through TJ Maxx and will focus instead on the bath and body section which has products that at least do not smell like industrial accidents in distilleries.r over.</li>
            <li>will try to reign in my bright ideas the next time I walk through TJ Maxx and will focus instead on the bath and body section which has products that at least do not smell like industrial accidents in distilleries.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell manly, it&#x27;s not for you, but if you want to smell seductive, the Dirty English is your best friend.</li>
            <li>Classic Smell that is no longer made as far as I know.</li>
            <li>So, if you like a very masculine scent you found one in &amp;#34;Dirty English&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Maybe back then it smelled exactly like Gucci PH,</li>
            <li>Ok So I am skeptical when it comes to reading reviews because there are so many mixed signals.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>Most likely due to its lack of popularity among the mass target market.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the exact same, and it&#x27;s gold.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the original....</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again and shop for others this way in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells mostly woodsy up front, with a little musk and possibly some leather, but as it lingers you&#x27;ll notice it get a bit sweeter.</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely masculine smelling cologne, which was unexpected coming from a woman&#x27;s clothing store.</li>
            <li>This cologne makes me feel like a much manlier man than I actually am.</li>
            <li>It smells like an musky old man who is demon possessed.</li>
            <li>I never thought a scent would capture so many negative character descriptions.</li>
            <li>When I say old</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were made in two completely seperate companies.&lt;br /&gt;Frangrence.net</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t like the spicey smell of cologne, but someone I was dating at the time absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>They once said, &#x27;I love Dirty english, but you won&#x27;t be able to find it anywhere...</li>
            <li>I like the masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Smells like a mixture of old spice and pine trees.</li>
            <li>Now my bf will stop using old man cologne.</li>
            <li>Dirty English is an exceptional fragrance, bold and daring and unlike anything else you will find at the perfume counter.</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT REAL DIRTY ENGLISH!!!!</li>
            <li>Has a leathery and dirty vibe to it very nice fragrance for fall/ winter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i highly recommend it, especially if you can get it for $25</li>
            <li>You would get a better bargain for your money by buying bottles of Old Spice and Brut, which have about the same sillage and longevity, but at least smell like they cost $2 or $3 per bottle to make instead of $0.79.&lt;br</li>

            <li>All in all, the product arrived exactly when and how I expected it.</li>
            <li>The actual glass bottle was brand new and even had the plastic wrapped on the topper.</li>
            <li>Dirty English is a great smelling fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is not worth the $20 I paid for it at TJ Maxx, and is certainly not worth more than that.</li>
            <li>This is not worth the $20 I paid for it at TJ Maxx, and is certainly not worth more than that.</li>
            <li>A fine dark and spicy scent, but with limited staying power.</li>
            <li>I had in mind that it would be a little bitter, old and strong smell</li>
            <li>I even compared a legitimate old bottle of this cologne and the manufacturer labels on the bottom of the bottle are different.</li>
            <li>Homme\\&quot; that everyone on Basenotes raves about, and it has synthetic oud in it, the scent element du jour of a few years ago which is now quite rare in mens colognes.</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent that lasts all day long</li>
            <li>I will not waste your time by telling you all the notes but this fragrance has a smoky woods, leathery base with top notes of mild citrus.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than Spiced, Masculine but not TOO masculine.</li>
            <li>the first time i am coming across some perfume that is so heavy.</li>
            <li>but  was surprised to see it still for sale on amazon for less then half of original price,well this is definitely not the same cologne,  the bottle is much cheesier the lid is plastic, the originals were a very solid pewter and  the charms and leather strap are missing.</li>
            <li>after reading other bad reviews I decided to buy it because it was sold by and ships from amazon, I&#x27;ve bought this colgone many times even on amazon and this is not the original which I thought had gone out of production a couple years ago</li>
            <li>This is my second bye of this cologne on Amazon,whats strange is my first bye cost about the same as I paid for this one and was half the size,,then again</li>
            <li>Maybe even Daniel Craig&#x27;s James Bond from Casino Royale would be wearing this while driving that Aston Martin with beautiful Vesper Lynd riding shotgun on the way to a high stakes poker tournament against evil Frenchman LeChifre (who is probably wearing Le Male)t.</li>

            <li> Satisfied customer- good bang for the buck on this stuff.</li>
            <li> the perfume is wonderful, the shipment was fast....</li>
            <li> One shouldn&#x27;t buy a scent because they like it, or because it&#x27;s popular.</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend that it smelled really nice</li>
            <li> I smelled it on a friend at a party and was able to find it at a really good price,</li>
            <li> AND WAS A NICE X-MAS GIFT.</li>
            <li> Warm, inviting, and underratedâ€¦</li>
            <li> Came in original sealed box in great condition</li>
            <li> This is a cheap fragrance but a good one.</li>
            <li> I own about 60 bottles and growing and this is another that is more of a decorative piece than anything else.  </li>
            <li> Nicely packaged and hoping the boys love it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Who knew that nice cologne can be so inexpensive :) ...</li>
            <li> The girl likes it a lot, nice wood leather smell not to strong, reminds me of winter parties and James Bond kind of feel.  </li>
            <li> Great price and the shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li> The package included perfume samples, it was very thoughtful of the seller.</li>
            <li> Smelled good but wore off way to quickly.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have nothing with oud in it and would love to see what Gucci PH smelled like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an authentic bottle with matching serial number on the box and bottle.</li>
            <li> OK if you like cider wood</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> like so many men&#x27;s colognes or aftershave</li>
            <li> we women love (and let&#x27;s face it...</li>
            <li> It was not a bad price and my husband loves the spray!!</li>
            <li> Sniff this one out for sure.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t asked for more ....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas hoping to find another scent for him, but this smelled much better in the bottle than on him.  </li>
            <li> The ladies love the stuff,,enough said.</li>
            <li> for many hours.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get yours before they eventually all run out of stock....</li>
            <li> Worked excellent back then.</li>
            <li> The aftershave was absolutely immobile inside the packaging and when it arrived I experienced no uneasiness while opening the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had authentic bottles before and this is not like it.</li>
            <li> Been my sons favorite for years now.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on the cologne.  </li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.</li>

            <li> Chicks love it.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.</li>

            <li> I love having it in my collection.</li>

            <li> Sexy without the musk</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Dior Homme crowds :-).</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne on my Husband.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> So buy it up while it is still available!</li>
            <li> simply put, it&#x27;s the best men&#x27;s fragrance (for me) ever produced.  </li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> I THOUGH FOR SURE</li>
            <li> Great price and came really fast</li>
            <li> I learnt one more time (fool) - never buy any cologne online.</li>
            <li> It came in very nice condition thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Its not to strong and its not to light it just smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped pretty quick</li>
            <li> Now, you smell mostly alcohol, cheap cedar, and cheaper musk.</li>
            <li> More importantly, my girlfriend likes it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong in scent.</li>
            <li> I only used it on nice occasions because it smells so good</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s smells strong</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent, and am happy I was able to find such a large bottle of it for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> I remember when I first got this fragrance loved it then and still love it now really one of my favs.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite cologne!</li>
            <li> Might be a good option for those old guys with strong perfumes but just not for me.</li>
            <li> Almost a light fragrance...</li>
            <li> idk why it was so cheap through amazon when i bought this</li>
            <li> Kenneth Cole RSVP(Excellent cheap scent/</li>
            <li> discontinued but still readily available).  </li>
            <li> again it smells cheap.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this cologne</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I wish it was still available in stores.</li>
            <li> it definitely seems like something he would have on lol.</li>
            <li> This was such a great deal considering in the stores</li>
            <li> I still enjoy smelling this on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Performance is modest at best, lasting 4 hours top and within armâ€™s length.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your dayâ€¦</li>
            <li> I was not sure if it would smell that great because I had never smelt it before, but I wanted to get my boyfriend a really nice cologne for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Smells great.. but does not stay on for long, atleast the one which I received.</li>
            <li> The retailers version was significantly lighter in color than the product i had received.</li>
            <li> It came with a plastic cap and smelled nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> This smelled like soap and the original has a leather smell.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s about time to give up on finding the original.</li>
            <li> Powerful seduction!</li>
            <li> so I was initially excited to find it online.  </li>
            <li> Therefore you will be under the radar and offer a unique smell during nights in the bar/club.  </li>
            <li> Despite these performance challenges, I do recommend adding Dirty English to your collection â€“ it is a pleasant scent, the bottle is cool, good flexibility for most events, and the price is incredible.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is woodsy, clean and suit me to a T.</li>
            <li> Clean not musky at all.</li>
            <li> At first it looks and smell like original, but after it wears out very quickly - it has cheap smell...  </li>
            <li> Figured I would try it out due to many good reviews</li>
            <li> It was by no means inadequate, and I was fairly certain the product would be intact, I just wasn&#x27;t as sure as I was with the aftershave tonic.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this 4 years ago and it is what I wear for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to tell that this was an original and not a fake.</li>
            <li> The hubby loves it too, and couldnt believe it was at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Not an offensive loud scent, warm and inviting.  </li>
            <li> I find this to be true with a lot of colognes...</li>
            <li> I bough my second bottle,  amazing fragance, girls stop for watching me when the smell touch them, very happy to gei it half price!</li>
            <li> It smells strong and manly and makes for a good alternative from the other colognes I wear.</li>
            <li> the women who buy such for their men mostly do so because they...the women....are the ones lovin&#x27; it :-)  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the clever design of the bottle, with a wristlet and charms on top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a personal favorite and is very unique.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> sure what appeal this had when it was fresh, new to the market, and selling well.</li>
            <li> Worth looking at.</li>
            <li> it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great men&#x27;s fragrance that not only has a good complex aroma but also is a manly smell.</li>
            <li> I think it may be his chemistry, because I&#x27;ve smelled it on other men and it smelled really good on them.</li>
            <li> Son loves this scent and the price was right.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing right now, buying a bottle for him for his birthday in a month.</li>
            <li> Very fast.</li>
            <li> It comes with a plastic cap, and is made by a new company &amp;#34;under license&amp;#34; from the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, has a warm, outdoor Cedar essence with undertones that keep it interesting.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments when wearing this fragrance, mainly compliments on its overtly masculine presence.  </li>
            <li> but it only cost $25 including shipping and tax thanks to a super cheap item eligible for super saver shipping that brought me over the $25 mark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Juicy couture cologne is an okay fragrance,it&#x27;s different from my collection.</li>
            <li> my first spicy cologne</li>
            <li> shipped like i did ;]</li>
            <li> Anyone interested in a woodsy scent on a budget grab</li>
            <li> It has a cheap smell and it smells old.</li>
            <li> and I love buying different colognes to try them out.</li>
            <li> The cologne however was a bit on the light side as far as the packaging went.</li>
            <li> My wife bought the first bottle of this 4 or 5 years ago</li>
            <li> This is was a gift for my brother, but I have to say that I really do like this scent!</li>
            <li> first then I turned around and purchased it for myself.</li>
            <li> love this cologne enough</li>
            <li> it was exactly what i wanted to get for my boyfriend</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever had an issue like this, but it looks nothing like what is pictured.</li>
            <li> Get lots of positive comments.  </li>
            <li> It came in the mail pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> Dirty English is a nicely done blend of spicy and herbal notes that is ideal for fall and winter.  </li>
            <li> It is strong enough to last, but not too strong and overpowering.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Dirty English is a great fragrance, no longer being produced, do a search see for yourself, Juicy Couture licensed the productions rights to a major fragrance distributor, I forget the name, however even their site does not list it as a current</li>
            <li> I was certain the product would be intact.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite cologne and I must start wearing it often to make up for wearing uni&#x27;s like Le Male and Prada Amber from time to time.</li>
            <li> Very manly, and more of a nighttime cologne, regardless of the fact I wear it almost every single</li>
            <li> I will not purchase again, probably not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> but it is very musky..</li>
            <li> A very \\&quot;enticing\\&quot; fragrance, so if you plan on never having sex don&#x27;t ever use it.</li>
            <li> Again, very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line is if you want to smell like a real man, then buy this cologne.</li>
            <li> Does not compare favorably to the &#x27;real thing&#x27;.</li>
            <li> also a very alluring one too.</li>
            <li> This is one cologne that I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know if it would be too much for my boyfriend to use it</li>
            <li> and I like it so much till I searched all over and found it here.</li>
            <li> the picture shows the real one, this is not what you will get.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much, however.  </li>
            <li> If you are real man</li>
            <li> He still hasn&#x27;t convinced me that he really likes it.</li>
            <li> but it ended to be more than I expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> this is by far my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> but it gives you that original scent that doesn&#x27;t last...</li>
            <li> small spray for work, couple more at night!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a wuss by any means, but only action super stars and Greek gods should smell this manly and sexy.</li>
            <li> The box was a little old,so it wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for a gift...</li>
            <li> This works for me and is my second full bottle.  </li>
            <li> Do not need to use much when applying, it is very strong and will last very long afterwards...</li>
            <li> Was expecting more from this juice but was left with a smoky, amber note that died down to musk quickly.  </li>
            <li> was the main manufacture on the bottle</li>
            <li> It is a big bold scent.  </li>
            <li> Most recently a woman at Wataburger stopped me mid sentence to tell me I smelled</li>
            <li> I collect perfumes and colognes and i am telling you this product has no smell and although the original paperwork for this purchase is long gone</li>
            <li> Cap is plastic, no charm, cheap sticker on the front of the bottle, and it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly the same, close but not the same.</li>
            <li> Very cheap for shipping if not free</li>
            <li> It is strong and difference than any other cologne I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> the store its around $65.00,,,,Anyway back to the cologne,,,very nice and long lasting,a twist on all the other britsh style scents,,its excellent for both day or night and casual or dress up events....</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying especially since it can be had for $28 for a 3.4oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> /&gt;the packing slip said $70 which i think is what it normally costs (but i wasn&#x27;t overcharged or anything).</li>
            <li> As I stated with the tonic, this is a scent that I have not been able to find in stores for the past three years, but I like it so much that I never forgot about it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the normal stuff I buy</li>
            <li> It has a heavy musk and presence which some may not have a taste for and also some may not be able to pull off.  </li>
            <li> But like I said this cologne is for real men not little boys.</li>
            <li> I would also add that Dirty English is an excellent entry level fragrance for those beginning their collection and looking for a decent fragrance at a bargain price.  </li>
            <li> a new comer of the cologne</li>
            <li> will try to reign in my bright ideas the next time I walk through TJ Maxx and will focus instead on the bath and body section which has products that at least do not smell like industrial accidents in distilleries.r over.</li>
            <li> will try to reign in my bright ideas the next time I walk through TJ Maxx and will focus instead on the bath and body section which has products that at least do not smell like industrial accidents in distilleries.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell manly, it&#x27;s not for you, but if you want to smell seductive, the Dirty English is your best friend.</li>
            <li> Classic Smell that is no longer made as far as I know.</li>
            <li> So, if you like a very masculine scent you found one in &amp;#34;Dirty English&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Maybe back then it smelled exactly like Gucci PH,</li>
            <li> Ok So I am skeptical when it comes to reading reviews because there are so many mixed signals.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> Most likely due to its lack of popularity among the mass target market.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the exact same, and it&#x27;s gold.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the original....</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy again and shop for others this way in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells mostly woodsy up front, with a little musk and possibly some leather, but as it lingers you&#x27;ll notice it get a bit sweeter.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely masculine smelling cologne, which was unexpected coming from a woman&#x27;s clothing store.</li>
            <li> This cologne makes me feel like a much manlier man than I actually am.</li>
            <li> It smells like an musky old man who is demon possessed.</li>
            <li> I never thought a scent would capture so many negative character descriptions.</li>
            <li> When I say old</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were made in two completely seperate companies.&lt;br /&gt;Frangrence.net</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t like the spicey smell of cologne, but someone I was dating at the time absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> They once said, &#x27;I love Dirty english, but you won&#x27;t be able to find it anywhere...</li>
            <li> I like the masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Smells like a mixture of old spice and pine trees.</li>
            <li> Now my bf will stop using old man cologne.</li>
            <li> Dirty English is an exceptional fragrance, bold and daring and unlike anything else you will find at the perfume counter.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT REAL DIRTY ENGLISH!!!!</li>
            <li> Has a leathery and dirty vibe to it very nice fragrance for fall/ winter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i highly recommend it, especially if you can get it for $25</li>
            <li> You would get a better bargain for your money by buying bottles of Old Spice and Brut, which have about the same sillage and longevity, but at least smell like they cost $2 or $3 per bottle to make instead of $0.79.&lt;br</li>

            <li> All in all, the product arrived exactly when and how I expected it.</li>
            <li> The actual glass bottle was brand new and even had the plastic wrapped on the topper.</li>
            <li> Dirty English is a great smelling fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is not worth the $20 I paid for it at TJ Maxx, and is certainly not worth more than that.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the $20 I paid for it at TJ Maxx, and is certainly not worth more than that.</li>
            <li> A fine dark and spicy scent, but with limited staying power.</li>
            <li> I had in mind that it would be a little bitter, old and strong smell</li>
            <li> I even compared a legitimate old bottle of this cologne and the manufacturer labels on the bottom of the bottle are different.</li>
            <li> Homme\\&quot; that everyone on Basenotes raves about, and it has synthetic oud in it, the scent element du jour of a few years ago which is now quite rare in mens colognes.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent that lasts all day long</li>
            <li> I will not waste your time by telling you all the notes but this fragrance has a smoky woods, leathery base with top notes of mild citrus.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than Spiced, Masculine but not TOO masculine.</li>
            <li> the first time i am coming across some perfume that is so heavy.</li>
            <li> but  was surprised to see it still for sale on amazon for less then half of original price,well this is definitely not the same cologne,  the bottle is much cheesier the lid is plastic, the originals were a very solid pewter and  the charms and leather strap are missing.</li>
            <li> after reading other bad reviews I decided to buy it because it was sold by and ships from amazon, I&#x27;ve bought this colgone many times even on amazon and this is not the original which I thought had gone out of production a couple years ago</li>
            <li> This is my second bye of this cologne on Amazon,whats strange is my first bye cost about the same as I paid for this one and was half the size,,then again</li>
            <li> Maybe even Daniel Craig&#x27;s James Bond from Casino Royale would be wearing this while driving that Aston Martin with beautiful Vesper Lynd riding shotgun on the way to a high stakes poker tournament against evil Frenchman LeChifre (who is probably wearing Le Male)t.</li>
            <li> If you want to make other dudes scared of you, go right ahead because this smells like you just escaped jail after killing 2 guards and are looking for the next victim.</li>
            <li> It smells quite different, and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> : when you first smell this, it does have a dirty english scent.&lt;br /&gt;However, to someone that has used this cologne many times in the past.</li>
            <li> it is very close to dirty english, but it is not DIRTY ENGLISH.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a leathery, maybe even flat soda, boozy smell.</li>
            <li> Smell do not last as long as it use to.</li>
            <li> companies pay people to leave good reviews, while other rival companies may leave bad reviews just to deter consumers</li>
            <li> I literally bought a second 3.4oz bottle, just so when this one runs dry, I already will have another!</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the warning of several other reviewers as I&#x27;ve had the same experience.</li>
            <li> I read the bad reviews and honestly don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re coming from.</li>
            <li> Too bad they&#x27;ve stopped making it, it&#x27;s getting more and more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> The reformulation of this already cheap product has been farmed out to cynical mercenaries who seem to have produced a product that is mostly carrier oil and alcohol, with some immensely uninspired fragrance elements stuck in to appease the undemanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When a company not really known for its fragrances notes declining sales, they reach a different conclusion...</li>
            <li> I read a review a long time ago before I purchased this and the guy said it seemed like something Colin Ferrel would wear, and I would have to agree....</li>
            <li> I meet.&lt;br /&gt;Followed by a long look of desire in her eyes&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The current version of Dirty English is a vile brew, redeemed only by the fact that it fades quickly and does not project.</li>
            <li> Deep, musky scent has several women (that were previously uninterested) dying for a date.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Dirty English\\&quot; is a very unique scent that has the properties to set you apart from the crowd.</li>
            <li> Same as the other reviewers, there is only a faint scent that quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> Dark, smoky, mysterious and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> completely covered myself with 10+ sprays and 30 minutes later could barely smell a trace.&lt;br /&gt;The real dirty english used to last me the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And last but not least Dirty English is a total ladie catcher...</li>
            <li> Its not modern and</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle to replace an almost empty one, and there is no comparison in terms of smell.</li>
            <li> item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap needs to be solid &amp; heavy, originals came with two trinkets on a leather chord as pictured, what arrived was not as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However if you have a taste for such fragrances as Burberry London, Polo Green, Givenchy Gentleman, Dior&#x27;s Fahrenheit, you will appreciate this fragrance and what the designers were going for.  </li>
            <li> a company known for its fragrances notes that product XYZ is not selling well, they just kill it, because they figure if they turn it into utter s***e by reformulating it down to the less than a dollar ingredient cost per bottle, they will embarrass the company name.</li>
            <li> As a few other buyers mentioned it is not the same.</li>
            <li> I paid the same price for a bottle less than half this size at Target.</li>
            <li> A very average scent from an above average designer.  </li>
            <li> One girl said it smelled like a man-whore and the other said it smelled like Collin Farrel.</li>
            <li> Even after getting opinions from other people both men and women.</li>
            <li> had I not first tried a sampler in a retail store.</li>
            <li> This cologne is unlike any of the other colognes that I wear.</li>
            <li> Juicy Couture could care less what you think about their parfums as long as you buy their tight pants, so they don&#x27;t mind ripping off money from fools.</li>
            <li> And that is what surprised me, that the only mens release from this house was so mediocre.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Dirty English\\&quot; has a woody base along with a sweet citrus scent as a top note.</li>
            <li> .because is not the real one is completely fake .and</li>
            <li> Fragrancenet.com sells this along with a few other online retailers.</li>
            <li> However, when opening the box I found that the black leather strap and pendants were not on the bottle.</li>
            <li> The cologne, however arrived on time, and was a bit less packed up.</li>
            <li> I frequently purchase Dirty English men&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> I did no simply stumble upon the cologne by dumb luck, I went out and looked for it.</li>
            <li> Hence, the current version of Dirty English.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne in the same purchase along with the Dirty English aftershave tonic.</li>
            <li> The bottle is so heavy.</li>
            <li> My son uses it and was the one who gave me the request to order for a few gifts.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I&#x27;m missing him, and I am home by myself</li>
            <li> I found this in a trial size years ago and it finally dried up.</li>
            <li> This is not a genuine product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s fake or really old.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little confused, because a woman&#x27;s clothing company produced a cologne for men, however don&#x27;t be skeptical because this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BOO - very, very BOO! :-(</li>
            <li> I have used dirty english for a long time and I know the scent well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After realizing this was so weak, I looked at an old bottle of Dirty english I had to compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of the bottle had manufacture</li>
            <li> It shipped in a few days, received in plenty of time before Christmas!</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> This has a very heavy musk and lives up to its &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; name and if you do not like musky fragrances or they do not suit your body chemistry</li>
            <li> like an ALMOST dirty english that lasts 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; dirty English.</li>
            <li> the bottle is cheaper now, no cute little chain and charm, just fake plastic chain twining around the cap and no charm at all.</li>
            <li> I mean the smell is like from the 70s or maybe 60s.</li>
            <li> Very hard to wear as well, night out or cold weather is the only way I would pull this off.</li>
            <li> These are not pleasant smells in the least.</li>
            <li> Projection is subtle and longevity is 5plus hours sometimes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle.</li>
            <li> This is very weak and the bottle is missing the charms.</li>
            <li> and it is not fair to the women.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item I bought way back but did not have the time to write a review on was the worst purchase I have made through amazon i a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually wear lacoste, guilty gucci, euphoria, versace, armani aqua di gio and yves saint laurent (the one that looks like a body) and this one now.</li>
            <li> I go absolutely crazy when my husband wears his Juicy Dirty English cologne!</li>
            <li> Projection and longevity are poor, even if over sprayed.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> so i am therefore assuming that the seller was behind this.</li>
            <li> Never get tired of it..</li>
            <li> Received a bootleg version of this cologne.</li>
            <li> i hope someone can track the source of this product and verify the authenticity of what they are selling otherwise other people might fall for this terrible waste of US DOLLARS.</li>
            <li> and they probably saw no use in adding it to the product...was a little disappointed though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had random woman compliment me on the way I smell.</li>
            <li> I was sent a fake bottle.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it is just a knock off.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but I think I waisted $24.</li>
            <li> It has become impossible to find in stores</li>
            <li> The smell of it wasn&#x27;t bad, it just lasted around five minutes before it fades.</li>
            <li> Yep, bad thinking there, self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but almost no one advertises the correct bottle in the pictures, so you don&#x27;t know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> Too bad I cannot return it - amazon says</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy it, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed ...that is suck.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a cologne I start to hate it</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this cologne.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY, VERY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had received the product but it turned out to be a FAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells horrible.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE SMELL.</li>
            <li> Awful smell.</li>

            <li> Timely delivery. Product exactly as promised. Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nice, and spicey.  Almost a light fragrance...great price, though.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this cologne.  The smell of it wasn&#x27;t bad, it just lasted around five minutes before it fades. I will not purchase again, probably not the real thing.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> What I received was a knock-off, a fake.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance does not last, I was fooled, I hope you won&#x27;t be...I had to give it 1 Star, but I would give it...ZERO STARS!!!</li>
            <li> Saw this in TJ Maxx for twenty clams and thought \\&quot;hmm, this was compared to the discontinued \\&quot;Gucci Pour Homme\\&quot; that everyone on Basenotes raves about, and it has synthetic oud in it, the scent element du jour of a few years ago which is now quite rare in mens colognes. I have nothing with oud in it and would love to see what Gucci PH smelled like. What a bargain!\\&quot;. Yep, bad thinking there, self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a company known for its fragrances notes that product XYZ is not selling well, they just kill it, because they figure if they turn it into utter s***e by reformulating it down to the less than a dollar ingredient cost per bottle, they will embarrass the company name. When a company not really known for its fragrances notes declining sales, they reach a different conclusion... Hence, the current version of Dirty English. Juicy Couture could care less what you think about their parfums as long as you buy their tight pants, so they don&#x27;t mind ripping off money from fools. The reformulation of this already cheap product has been farmed out to cynical mercenaries who seem to have produced a product that is mostly carrier oil and alcohol, with some immensely uninspired fragrance elements stuck in to appease the undemanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what appeal this had when it was fresh, new to the market, and selling well. Maybe back then it smelled exactly like Gucci PH, maybe back then you could smell the oud, the leather, the booze, the vetiver, the breath of angels, whatever. Now, you smell mostly alcohol, cheap cedar, and cheaper musk. These are not pleasant smells in the least. The current version of Dirty English is a vile brew, redeemed only by the fact that it fades quickly and does not project. Axe smells nicer and costs less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the bottle is cheaper now, no cute little chain and charm, just fake plastic chain twining around the cap and no charm at all. This is a badge of shame for the proud owner of this overpriced junk to gaze upon and despair over. This is not worth the $20 I paid for it at TJ Maxx, and is certainly not worth more than that. You would get a better bargain for your money by buying bottles of Old Spice and Brut, which have about the same sillage and longevity, but at least smell like they cost $2 or $3 per bottle to make instead of $0.79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to reign in my bright ideas the next time I walk through TJ Maxx and will focus instead on the bath and body section which has products that at least do not smell like industrial accidents in distilleries.r over.

            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for our anniversary, it smells good but it is very musky.. He liked it.</li>
            <li> Good deal but it gives you that original scent that doesn&#x27;t last... Amazon&#x27;s perfume might be defectives because the one I tested at the store lasted days on my clothes...</li>
            <li> I imagine that if Indiana Jones wore cologne, this would be his daily wear while he&#x27;s swinging from tall things with his whip and shooting swordsman in the face point blank. Maybe even Daniel Craig&#x27;s James Bond from Casino Royale would be wearing this while driving that Aston Martin with beautiful Vesper Lynd riding shotgun on the way to a high stakes poker tournament against evil Frenchman LeChifre (who is probably wearing Le Male)t. This is an absolutely masculine smelling cologne, which was unexpected coming from a woman&#x27;s clothing store. It&#x27;s got a leathery, maybe even flat soda, boozy smell. I asked some girls at work to tell me what they thought. One girl said it smelled like a man-whore and the other said it smelled like Collin Farrel. Both acceptable answers in my book. This is my new favorite cologne and I must start wearing it often to make up for wearing uni&#x27;s like Le Male and Prada Amber from time to time. This cologne makes me feel like a much manlier man than I actually am. I&#x27;m not a wuss by any means, but only action super stars and Greek gods should smell this manly and sexy. The sillage is good and the longevity is probably 6-8 hours on me. Definitely worth buying especially since it can be had for $28 for a 3.4oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Kaufman Fragrances, who shipped my bottle: My 3.4oz bottle of Dirty English arrived 2 days before the earliest arrival date and came nicely packed with lots of packing peanuts protecting it. It was an unopened box. It&#x27;s an authentic bottle with matching serial number on the box and bottle. The bottle itself is very fancy looking and heavy. The lid closes with a nice metallic clink. I have a 1oz bottle of DE I bought from Perfumania to compare the scent to and they are identical.</li>
            <li> OK if you like cider wood</li>
            <li> GREAT cologne, best scent I&#x27;ve ever owned. Goes great with a suit and tie or just a t-shirt. Deep, musky scent has several women (that were previously uninterested) dying for a date. A very \\&quot;enticing\\&quot; fragrance, so if you plan on never having sex don&#x27;t ever use it.</li>
            <li> I love this it smells so good. The hubby loves it too, and couldnt believe it was at such a good price. He even showed it off this his guy friend saying how much he liked it.</li>
            <li> Again, very prompt delivery.  The fragrance....like so many men&#x27;s colognes or aftershave we women love (and let&#x27;s face it...the women who buy such for their men mostly do so because they...the women....are the ones lovin&#x27; it :-)  So why not wear it ourselves?  This fragrance is woodsy, clean and suit me to a T.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for about two years. Had to buy my last bottle here on amazon because they no longer sell it at Macys. Bottom line is if you want to smell like a real man, then buy this cologne. My girlfriend loves the way it smells, she says thats the way a man is supposed to smell. I&#x27;ve even had random woman compliment me on the way I smell. Do yourself a favor and buy it, you will not be disappointed.  But like I said this cologne is for real men not little boys.</li>
            <li> Smells great.. but does not stay on for long, atleast the one which I received.</li>
            <li> I like the way this smells as does my girlfriend.  Nice and woody and organic smelling.  Not an offensive loud scent, warm and inviting.  I get alot of compliments on this......</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! It shipped in a few days, received in plenty of time before Christmas! It was not a bad price and my husband loves the spray!!</li>
            <li> So good that someone decided to steal it out my car...</li>
            <li> My brother and husband love it!</li>
            <li> great deal on my favorite scent!</li>
            <li> The box was a little old,so it wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for a gift...The actual glass bottle was brand new and even had the plastic wrapped on the topper. The package included perfume samples, it was very thoughtful of the seller.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap fragrance but a good one. This one last 6-8 hours no problem. Has a leathery and dirty vibe to it very nice fragrance for fall/ winter. Sniff this one out for sure. Worth looking at.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if it would smell that great because I had never smelt it before, but I wanted to get my boyfriend a really nice cologne for Christmas. It is an amazing smell was not expecting that. the bottle is so awesome looking too, if you&#x27;re someone who values things to look nice &amp; smell nice. My dad loves it, but my boyfriend i don&#x27;t know about yet because it&#x27;s not Christmas yet. Hopefully he does. Lol I love it though.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s great for colder weathers and it lasts more than 8 hours for me. I would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> A fine dark and spicy scent, but with limited staying power.</li>
            <li> Dirty English is an exceptional fragrance, bold and daring and unlike anything else you will find at the perfume counter. It&#x27;s delicious and geared toward the sensualist. If you want to smell manly, it&#x27;s not for you, but if you want to smell seductive, the Dirty English is your best friend.</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer- good bang for the buck on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t asked for more ....the perfume is wonderful, the shipment was fast....I love it !!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas hoping to find another scent for him, but this smelled much better in the bottle than on him.  I think it may be his chemistry, because I&#x27;ve smelled it on other men and it smelled really good on them.</li>
            <li> I had received the product but it turned out to be a FAKE!!!! I do not recommend buying from fragrancenet or fragrancenet.com.&lt;br /&gt;I had issued a return with no problem but the person i had talked to tried arguing with me that the product is 100% authentic but its not it is 100% FAKE. The item was not shrink wrapped like the box should had been and i had went to an actual retailer to compare. The retailers version was significantly lighter in color than the product i had received. Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> Juicy couture cologne is an okay fragrance,it&#x27;s different from my collection.I only where this one in the fall or when I&#x27;m on a night out with the fellas.Projection is subtle and longevity is 5plus hours sometimes.</li>
            <li> This is my second bye of this cologne on Amazon,whats strange is my first bye cost about the same as I paid for this one and was half the size,,then again I saw a bottle for $112.00 with shipping around $10.00 for the 3.4oz size by a third party seller here on Amazon,,,THATS JUST WRONG!!!!!At the store its around $65.00,,,,Anyway back to the cologne,,,very nice and long lasting,a twist on all the other britsh style scents,,its excellent for both day or night and casual or dress up events....And last but not least Dirty English is a total ladie catcher...The ladies love the stuff,,enough said.</li>
            <li> Great deal! I paid the same price for a bottle less than half this size at Target. I get lots of compliments from ladies on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Came without a box. Does not compare favorably to the &#x27;real thing&#x27;. The color is not the same and neither us the smell. It&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
            <li> Great scent.....also a very alluring one too. Do not need to use much when applying, it is very strong and will last very long afterwards...for many hours. It was easy to tell that this was an original and not a fake. However, when opening the box I found that the black leather strap and pendants were not on the bottle. I believe this to be because this product has been discontinued and they probably saw no use in adding it to the product...was a little disappointed though. So, if you like a very masculine scent you found one in &amp;#34;Dirty English&amp;#34;. Make sure you get yours before they eventually all run out of stock....it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> idk why it was so cheap through amazon when i bought this but it only cost $25 including shipping and tax thanks to a super cheap item eligible for super saver shipping that brought me over the $25 mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the packing slip said $70 which i think is what it normally costs (but i wasn&#x27;t overcharged or anything). maybe they discontinued it? can&#x27;t see why they&#x27;d do that, it&#x27;s amazing and i get compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s my first spicy cologne and i think it smells manly. i&#x27;m used to Acqua Di Gio and Jean Paul Goutier (both citrusy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend it, especially if you can get it for $25 shipped like i did ;]</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews I read on amazon. This cologne smells horrible. Even after getting opinions from other people both men and women. NOBODY likes it! It smells like an musky old man who is demon possessed. If you want to attract women do not buy this cologne, it will scare them away. If you want to make other dudes scared of you, go right ahead because this smells like you just escaped jail after killing 2 guards and are looking for the next victim. I never thought a scent would capture so many negative character descriptions. It has a metallic musky leathery scent. HORRIBLE SMELL.</li>
            <li> Alluring, manly scent for those nights out or at home</li>
            <li> A very average scent from an above average designer.  Was expecting more from this juice but was left with a smoky, amber note that died down to musk quickly.  Projection and longevity are poor, even if over sprayed.  I own about 60 bottles and growing and this is another that is more of a decorative piece than anything else.  I&#x27;ve gotten my girlfriend just about all of the womens line(which is exceptional).  And that is what surprised me, that the only mens release from this house was so mediocre. Very hard to wear as well, night out or cold weather is the only way I would pull this off. Anyone interested in a woodsy scent on a budget grab Kenneth Cole RSVP(Excellent cheap scent/discontinued but still readily available).  And if money is not a problem, Gucci Pour homme.</li>
            <li> Worked excellent back then.</li>
            <li> I like it because it does&#x27;nt get to  a room before you do. It has a understated elegance, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of the cologne, I got it. It has a cheap smell and it smells old. When I say old I mean the smell is like from the 70s or maybe 60s. Its not modern and again it smells cheap.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cologne.  Get lots of positive comments.  Too bad they&#x27;ve stopped making it, it&#x27;s getting more and more difficult to find.  Thankfully Amazon had it and at a great price to.</li>
            <li> Figured I would try it out due to many good reviews and I love buying different colognes to try them out. I was not happy with this purchase it&#x27;s strong in scent. I can see what they were going for, but that&#x27;s just not for me. I purchased this and the carlos santana cologne and both were just not satisfactory. No compliments for either cologne.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne in the same purchase along with the Dirty English aftershave tonic. As I stated in that review the tonic arrived two days before the earliest estimated delivery date. The cologne, however arrived on time, and was a bit less packed up. The aftershave was absolutely immobile inside the packaging and when it arrived I experienced no uneasiness while opening the package. I was certain the product would be intact. The cologne however was a bit on the light side as far as the packaging went. It was by no means inadequate, and I was fairly certain the product would be intact, I just wasn&#x27;t as sure as I was with the aftershave tonic. All in all, the product arrived exactly when and how I expected it. As I stated with the tonic, this is a scent that I have not been able to find in stores for the past three years, but I like it so much that I never forgot about it. I did no simply stumble upon the cologne by dumb luck, I went out and looked for it. I suggest this product to anyone and everyone. You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after testing in in a local store. Loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its great.The bottle is so heavy.I buy a lot of perfumes and thi sis the first time i am coming across some perfume that is so heavy.</li>
            <li> just as said on the website. exactly what I wanted! It came in the mail pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> My wife bought the first bottle of this 4 or 5 years ago and I have been wearing it ever since!  She loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the normal stuff I buy I think its a knockoff smells like alcohol and thats all</li>
            <li> I was sent a fake bottle. I&#x27;ve had authentic bottles before and this is not like it. It came with a plastic cap and smelled nothing like the original. This smelled like soap and the original has a leather smell. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Smell do not last as long as it use to. I have to keep applying it though out the day</li>
            <li> Ok So I am skeptical when it comes to reading reviews because there are so many mixed signals.&lt;br /&gt;Some companies pay people to leave good reviews, while other rival companies may leave bad reviews just to deter consumers&lt;br /&gt;from a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I however, am neither. I have used dirty english for a long time and I know the scent well.&lt;br /&gt;To a new comer of the cologne: when you first smell this, it does have a dirty english scent.&lt;br /&gt;However, to someone that has used this cologne many times in the past. I can tell the scent was a bit weak.&lt;br /&gt;I completely covered myself with 10+ sprays and 30 minutes later could barely smell a trace.&lt;br /&gt;The real dirty english used to last me the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After realizing this was so weak, I looked at an old bottle of Dirty english I had to compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of the bottle had manufacture information.&lt;br /&gt;They were made in two completely seperate companies.&lt;br /&gt;Frangrence.net was the main manufacture on the bottle I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAKE! it is very close to dirty english, but it is not DIRTY ENGLISH.&lt;br /&gt;More like an ALMOST dirty english that lasts 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt listen to the reviews. I should have!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
            <li> I find this is always my best buy. Of course it is Amazon.Been my sons favorite for years now. Recommend this for the good deal and scent,</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this cologne and I receive a lot of compliments from people when they smell the aroma in my presence, especially my  girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this 4 years ago and it is what I wear for special occasions.  I only used it on nice occasions because it smells so good and it is not fair to the women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can&#x27;t help themselves when they smell it. It works 60% of the time, every time.</li>
            <li> This is was a gift for my brother, but I have to say that I really do like this scent!</li>
            <li> I loved this scent.  It is a big bold scent.  I have received many compliments on the cologne.  This is one cologne that I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use Juicy for myself so I didn&#x27;t know if it would be too much for my boyfriend to use it but ladies let&#x27;s just say that man smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> purchased this and saved over $10 versus dept. store. Will certainly buy again and shop for others this way in the future.</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the warning of several other reviewers as I&#x27;ve had the same experience. I bought a bottle to replace an almost empty one, and there is no comparison in terms of smell. Same as the other reviewers, there is only a faint scent that quickly dissipates. I purchased it from PerfumesWorld... They refunded it thankfully.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS. It is amazing. You will like it. No matter what your &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; is, you&#x27;ll love it. Great for all seasons. Spring, summer, fall and winter.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s favorite. Given as gift and he was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like it for winter time.</li>
            <li> Chicks love it. Enough said.</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome! It smells awesome, comes in a cool bottle, and is a very good choice if you&#x27;re looking for a good deal!!</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t like the spicey smell of cologne, but someone I was dating at the time absolutely loves it.  They once said, &#x27;I love Dirty english, but you won&#x27;t be able to find it anywhere...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Ohh yeah?  Watch me...&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this cologne and I like it so much till I searched all over and found it here. I bought a bottle for him first then I turned around and purchased it for myself. I get plenty of compliments about this fragrance...thank you</li>
            <li> Beware of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; dirty English. As a few other buyers mentioned it is not the same. It comes with a plastic cap, and is made by a new company &amp;#34;under license&amp;#34; from the original manufacturer. It smells quite different, and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long. Fragrancenet.com sells this along with a few other online retailers. I think it&#x27;s about time to give up on finding the original. It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but almost no one advertises the correct bottle in the pictures, so you don&#x27;t know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> This item I bought way back but did not have the time to write a review on was the worst purchase I have made through amazon i a long time. A close second which happened ealier was also from a perfume purchase.  This product has no smell! I collect perfumes and colognes and i am telling you this product has no smell and although the original paperwork for this purchase is long gone i hope someone can track the source of this product and verify the authenticity of what they are selling otherwise other people might fall for this terrible waste of US DOLLARS. I cannot believe that juicy couture would produce such a product so i am therefore assuming that the seller was behind this. For anyone making a purchase of such an item in the future set your mind on sampling the product as soon as it arrives,and take the time to rate the product or contact the seller if the item does not come out as you expect.</li>
            <li> Came in original sealed box in great condition</li>
            <li> This item arrived in perfect condition. Delivery was way before the deadline!  Nicely packaged and hoping the boys love it for Christmas. My son uses it and was the one who gave me the request to order for a few gifts. You cant beat the price! Will definitely do business with them again. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a cologne I start to hate it .because is not the real one is completely fake .and I am disappointed ...that is suck.</li>
            <li> Great customer satisfactiom guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dirty English is a great fragrance, no longer being produced, do a search see for yourself, Juicy Couture licensed the productions rights to a major fragrance distributor, I forget the name, however even their site does not list it as a current item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap needs to be solid &amp; heavy, originals came with two trinkets on a leather chord as pictured, what arrived was not as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issue returning</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent, and am happy I was able to find such a large bottle of it for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. At first I was a little confused, because a woman&#x27;s clothing company produced a cologne for men, however don&#x27;t be skeptical because this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells mostly woodsy up front, with a little musk and possibly some leather, but as it lingers you&#x27;ll notice it get a bit sweeter. Very manly, and more of a nighttime cologne, regardless of the fact I wear it almost every single day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cologne enough I literally bought a second 3.4oz bottle, just so when this one runs dry, I already will have another!</li>
            <li> I go absolutely crazy when my husband wears his Juicy Dirty English cologne! It is a Man&#x27;s scent and it&#x27;s just so intoxicating, unique and delicious smelling. Sometimes when I&#x27;m missing him, and I am home by myself I&#x27;ll spritz it around the house...it&#x27;s comforting. The bottle it comes in is very stylish too! I pick up mostly on the Leather and Sandalwood notes. It&#x27;s a scent best worn in Fall and Winter.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT REAL DIRTY ENGLISH!!!! DOESN&#x27;T EVEN SMELL THE SAME (smells almost similar!!!!!!) after reading other bad reviews I decided to buy it because it was sold by and ships from amazon, I&#x27;ve bought this colgone many times even on amazon and this is not the original which I thought had gone out of production a couple years ago but  was surprised to see it still for sale on amazon for less then half of original price,well this is definitely not the same cologne,  the bottle is much cheesier the lid is plastic, the originals were a very solid pewter and  the charms and leather strap are missing. the picture shows the real one, this is not what you will get. does not smell the same&lt;br /&gt;the label says the juicy couture name is used under license, but this is not the Original at all, DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne. My wife love it. It is strong and difference than any other cologne I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it. Period. I found this in a trial size years ago and it finally dried up. Took me years to find but when i found it here...I couldn&#x27;t help get it. It&#x27;s subtle. I only use one spray and it goes along way. Stuff like this activate on heat so I spray under shirt and go!</li>
            <li> Its a great scent, refreshing and noticable. A lot of people have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing and they thought I was making up &amp;#34;dirty english&amp;#34;. This scent says &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; all over it.</li>
            <li> Great price and the shipping was fast!  Thank you</li>
            <li> I frequently purchase Dirty English men&#x27;s products.  I like the masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, Fast shipment. Out of all the cologne&#x27;s in the world...this is by far my personal favorite. I wish it was still available in stores. But still a happy customer.</li>
            <li> One shouldn&#x27;t buy a scent because they like it, or because it&#x27;s popular. They should buy a scent because of how it smells on someone&#x27;s body, in combination of its scent and that of the body. This works for me and is my second full bottle.  But I wouldn&#x27;t have known that or purchased on-line had I not first tried a sampler in a retail store.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent that lasts all day long</li>
            <li> The girl likes it a lot, nice wood leather smell not to strong, reminds me of winter parties and James Bond kind of feel.  Good for a date night ending with coffie</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne.  More importantly, my girlfriend likes it.  Don&#x27;t use too much, however.  I believe it&#x27;s made by the same folks who make English Leather.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Dirty English\\&quot; has a woody base along with a sweet citrus scent as a top note. \\&quot;Dirty English\\&quot; is a very unique scent that has the properties to set you apart from the crowd. I love having it in my collection. Not to mention the clever design of the bottle, with a wristlet and charms on top of the bottle. It&#x27;s a great cologne at a good price.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this fragrance and I fell in love. It&#x27;s subtle, has a warm, outdoor Cedar essence with undertones that keep it interesting. Sexy without the musk</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for years and it is the best along with Hugo Boss. I also bought that one for him for Christmas and I like it as well.</li>
            <li> Everyone tells my husband he smells good. I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is a great men&#x27;s fragrance that not only has a good complex aroma but also is a manly smell. This has a good woody smell with spicy undertones for a great balanced smell for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Dirty English is a great smelling fragrance.  It is strong enough to last, but not too strong and overpowering.  Awesome smell.</li>
            <li> If you are real man then this is your fragrance, it&#x27;s not for the sissy boys Dior Homme crowds :-).</li>
            <li> I bough my second bottle,  amazing fragance, girls stop for watching me when the smell touch them, very happy to gei it half price! Exelent! Powerful seduction!</li>
            <li> Son loves this scent and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne on my Husband. Its not to strong and its not to light it just smells really nice. Ive brought him cologne before but we both like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Smells like a mixture of old spice and pine trees. Awful smell. I was told by a friend that it smelled really nice so I purchased it as a gift for my uncle. He still hasn&#x27;t convinced me that he really likes it. Says it&#x27;s smells strong and he MIGHT have to start wearing it lol.</li>
            <li> its defiantly strong but it smell very nice,</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite cologne. I call it &amp;#34;Sex in a bottle&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than Spiced, Masculine but not TOO masculine. Sensual and arousing. Clean not musky at all. (Sandle wood).</li>
            <li> Classic Smell that is no longer made as far as I know. So buy it up while it is still available!</li>
            <li> I was suprised that they even had it will buy it again when its gone. Also item came before it said it will</li>
            <li> This is not a genuine product.  I am VERY, VERY disappointed.  It has become impossible to find in stores so I was initially excited to find it online.  Sadly, it is just a knock off.  BOO - very, very BOO! :-(</li>
            <li> This cologne is unlike any of the other colognes that I wear. I usually wear lacoste, guilty gucci, euphoria, versace, armani aqua di gio and yves saint laurent (the one that looks like a body) and this one now. It smells strong and manly and makes for a good alternative from the other colognes I wear. It is something that makes me feel like wearing a suit and going out to dinner with my wife. I read a review a long time ago before I purchased this and the guy said it seemed like something Colin Ferrel would wear, and I would have to agree....it definitely seems like something he would have on lol. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> i would 100% recomend this product...saves you alot of money and gas..it was exactly what i wanted to get for my boyfriend</li>
            <li> Now my bf will stop using old man cologne. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I remember when I first got this fragrance loved it then and still love it now really one of my favs.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite cologne! I always get compliments!</li>
            <li> I had in mind that it would be a little bitter, old and strong smell but it ended to be more than I expected. Might be a good option for those old guys with strong perfumes but just not for me.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped pretty quick, I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne for my man and now he&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne...and so do I.  This was such a great deal considering in the stores it&#x27;s 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> I could go on and on about this fragrance but I won&#x27;t.....simply put, it&#x27;s the best men&#x27;s fragrance (for me) ever produced.  Dark, smoky, mysterious and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is it is very short on lasting power and projection.  But buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> I get longer hugs from every woman I meet.&lt;br /&gt;Followed by a long look of desire in her eyes&lt;br /&gt;and a flattering compliment as she reluctantly&lt;br /&gt;tears herself away from my arms.  My next&lt;br /&gt;purchase will be Viagra.....</li>
            <li> Smelled good but wore off way to quickly.</li>
            <li> It came in very nice condition thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Great product brought as gift he loves it, me too.</li>
            <li> I still enjoy smelling this on my boyfriend. I smelled it on a friend at a party and was able to find it at a really good price,</li>
            <li> This is very weak and the bottle is missing the charms. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s fake or really old.</li>
            <li> Arrived smelling of the beautiful sandwood I remembered. Very fast. Very cheap for shipping if not free</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend of the family. They love it.</li>
            <li> I THOUGH FOR SURE THIS WAS DONE IN 2011. ITEM CAME AS DESCRIBED AND WAS A NICE X-MAS GIFT. IT IS STILL BEING USED</li>
            <li> Smelled so good on him. He loved it. It was one of the best purchases I ever made. And the look on his face was priceless.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great price and came really fast</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I think I waisted $24. Who knew that nice cologne can be so inexpensive :) ...At first it looks and smell like original, but after it wears out very quickly - it has cheap smell...  Too bad I cannot return it - amazon says its \\&quot;flammable\\&quot; ...&lt;br /&gt;Would like to have my money back though. I learnt one more time (fool) - never buy any cologne online.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter who loves it.  Since she has not opened it yet, I am assuming she once again will be very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a personal favorite and is very unique.  I will not waste your time by telling you all the notes but this fragrance has a smoky woods, leathery base with top notes of mild citrus. It has a heavy musk and presence which some may not have a taste for and also some may not be able to pull off.  This has a very heavy musk and lives up to its &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; name and if you do not like musky fragrances or they do not suit your body chemistry well, do not purchase this fragrance.  However if you have a taste for such fragrances as Burberry London, Polo Green, Givenchy Gentleman, Dior&#x27;s Fahrenheit, you will appreciate this fragrance and what the designers were going for.  I have received many compliments when wearing this fragrance, mainly compliments on its overtly masculine presence.  It is to my understanding the designers have decided to discontinue the fragrance. Most likely due to its lack of popularity among the mass target market.  Therefore you will be under the radar and offer a unique smell during nights in the bar/club.  But purchase now! and beware of fakes.</li>
            <li> I read the bad reviews and honestly don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re coming from. I used to get this all the time 4 or 5 years ago, but ran out of my 1.7  ounce bottle. My wife found it on here and ordered me the 3.4 ounce bottle. It smells just like it did way back then, and I&#x27;ve already gotten several compliments on the smell. Most recently a woman at Wataburger stopped me mid sentence to tell me I smelled good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before that my best friend also commented on it and told me it smelled good so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing right now, buying a bottle for him for his birthday in a month. So as a person who used this years ago, and is now using it again. This stuff is the exact same, and it&#x27;s gold.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance of this on my Man! Never get tired of it.. small spray for work, couple more at night!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the original....I find this to be true with a lot of colognes...</li>
            <li> Received a bootleg version of this cologne. First time I&#x27;ve ever had an issue like this, but it looks nothing like what is pictured. I even compared a legitimate old bottle of this cologne and the manufacturer labels on the bottom of the bottle are different. Cap is plastic, no charm, cheap sticker on the front of the bottle, and it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly the same, close but not the same. The fragrance also doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour. Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Warm, inviting, and underratedâ€¦ Dirty English is a nicely done blend of spicy and herbal notes that is ideal for fall and winter.  Performance is modest at best, lasting 4 hours top and within armâ€™s length. Despite these performance challenges, I do recommend adding Dirty English to your collection â€“ it is a pleasant scent, the bottle is cool, good flexibility for most events, and the price is incredible.  I would also add that Dirty English is an excellent entry level fragrance for those beginning their collection and looking for a decent fragrance at a bargain price.  4.0 Stars out of 5 Stars.  Enjoy your dayâ€¦</li>
