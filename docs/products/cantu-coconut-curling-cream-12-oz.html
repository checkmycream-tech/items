            <li>A lot of curlies gave it a great review after trying it in their Curlbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have some great ingredients.</li>
            <li>I suppose it would be great for winter sealing if you&#x27;re going to twist</li>

            <li>smell great.</li>

            <li>It smells good and does good for my hair.</li>
            <li>This product smells good and helps with frizzy hair issues.</li>
            <li>Besides all those chemicals just aren&#x27;t good for you and who knows what controls there might not be over that industry.  </li>
            <li>Seem to have good holding and moisturizing quality</li>
            <li>Just like everyone else that has made a review about this product when I opened up the jar I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>With all the oils and good stuff that&#x27;s in it, I&#x27;m wondering why would they muck it all up with Vaseline?</li>
            <li>but this one smelled light and wonderful.</li>
            <li>Seller was prompt and price was good</li>
            <li>This item is yet another example of your superior product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the results it gives my hair, it feels fly away and umanaged.</li>
            <li>and i am very glad that i did.</li>
            <li>but I like the twist and lock gel much better !</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair feel!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Do better Cantu!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I saw this, it was cheap, and smelled great.</li>
            <li>This product felt good on my hair and has a lovely smell.  </li>
            <li>I use to always wonder what smelled so nice on her</li>
            <li>You know the kind</li>
            <li>better price wise as well ..</li>
            <li>I am absolutely delighted with the results in stopping my hair loss aside from the bonus of leaving the hair soft, manageable and smelling great!</li>
            <li>It smells nice without giving me allergies and makes my hair curly but not frizzy.</li>
            <li>This product  smells nice</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, creamy, moisturizing (not oily) and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Cantu&#x27;s natural hair line is excellent!!!</li>
            <li>So far this has to be the best curling cream I have came across and used.</li>
            <li>Very light and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I love the coconut scent.</li>
            <li>I know of a couple of people who absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product.</li>
            <li>It smells so wonderful, especially if you like the coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I just love it, plus it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>I do not even have to use gel for the style to stay I love it.</li>
            <li>I have also used Carols daughter Healthy Hair Butter which also brings out the curl pattern</li>
            <li>I 100% love this product and the line.</li>
            <li>There is literally no reason to pay more than that for this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>and I love the smell :)</li>
            <li>The Cantu leave in conditioner holds more than this product.  </li>
            <li>Considering that I LOVE the Cantu leave in conditioner, this is a product that I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product, I ordered a sample to try it out.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>, i thibk its an ok product.</li>
            <li>And i mentioned definition with a YES, because it did do that lovely.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I feel in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched so many reviews on YOUTUBE</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair creme.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling cream.  </li>
            <li>My curls have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Plus I think if they took out the petrolatum and replaced it with ANY oil it would be a better product.</li>
            <li>So this going on top of it was the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>This makes your hair crunchy and the coconut smell is too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought this for my mother, and she seems to enjoy it</li>
            <li>Since then I use a quarter size amount over the moisturizing curl cream and it obsorbs much better.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it smells divine.</li>
            <li>I am biracial and have that &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34; most of my friends would say.</li>
            <li>That is how much i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so you will have some i just prefer alot more</li>
            <li>so just be sure your nature hair before  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Curling Cream.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for hair textures that are mixed.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product, using on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product it doesn&#x27;t give me as many curls as the Eco</li>
            <li>I love the cream itself</li>
            <li>I cowash in the am, and put the Cantu curling cream on top of my leave in and voila...instant coils.  </li>
            <li>Love it a lot.</li>
            <li>However, I can feel my new growth and it feels beautiful.</li>
            <li>Perfect for busy women who just want to do something quick with their hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love it , great on natural hair</li>
            <li>The cream is white and have a very good consistency...</li>
            <li>I have long curly frizzy hair &amp; it makes my curls smooth silky &amp; smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Works best if your hair is wet</li>
            <li>Great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a full size soon!</li>
            <li>All we can do is preserve the hair and keep it strong (protein) and moist (water and condish) and sealed (oil that includes vaseline) and a styling aid ( gel or the alike) and keep ends trimmed once a year or as needed.</li>
            <li>I have 4c hair that strongly dislikes gel like products.  </li>
            <li>so i didnt get the curls that i was wanting , that curl strong definition.</li>
            <li>Cantu needs to do more aggressive marketing of this product as there are so many people with natural hair and more getting the message that kinky hair is okay after all.  </li>
            <li>this works fine on my hair.    </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge accomplishment.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product from a local Rite aid and I am beyond happy.</li>
            <li>I bought mines from Walmart for a really cheap price.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the texture God gave you be blessed.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff countless times, with great results.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>cream also smells fantastic, but I guess if you don&#x27;t like tropical smells or the smell of pina colada/ coconut</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve read several great reviews on online</li>
            <li>I use sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it in combination with my fave sulfate free conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also smells fantastic and makes me feel like I&#x27;m on a tropical vacation.</li>
            <li>For a while I felt like I had to do way too much to achieve a nice coil effect in my hair.  </li>
            <li>it not only smells good but moisturizes like heaven in a jar way better than the shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie way</li>
            <li>, it left her hair defined and frizz free ALL DAY!!!  </li>
            <li>I find that when my hair stops responding to my normal hair care regimen, I switch my leave-in for this and it works awesome, but then I have to switch back to my leave in because this stops working.</li>
            <li>Amazon generally has good deals, but this isn&#x27;t one of them..</li>
            <li>I first was looking at this product it was because my hair has so many fly-aways</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this</li>
            <li>I have used other &amp;#34;frizz free&amp;#34; products formulated for curly hair, that made her hair look beautiful before school</li>
            <li>My hair feels soooo soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I try my best to be vigilant about reading the ingredients and apparently I missed the one ingredient that I consider a big no-no.</li>
            <li>The entire Cantu line is good for 4b and 4c hair.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my grand daughters</li>
            <li>But it is full of Petrolatum..</li>
            <li>Petroleum is not bad for the hair... dont believe the hype...</li>
            <li>At about 95% dry I carefully pulled them apart and the coils were moist, coiled, soft, defined, smelled great, and just perfect.</li>
            <li>Whilst that might be the best advertisement hence my determination to give feedback by the time I heard of the product my hair was/is already seriously damaged.  </li>
            <li>Cantu Shea Butter Coconut Curling Cream is great, has a really strong scent so should use early enough to allow scent to dissipate a bit.  </li>
            <li>I then apply Cantu Super Shine Hair Silk in 4 sections followed by Cantu Curling Cream and finish it off with Eco styler gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first tried this when I received a free sample in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I first received this product as a free sample quite a while ago</li>
            <li>Now if you use this on &amp;#34;dry hair&amp;#34; you will need to rub this in good to prevent white residue but honestly there is no white build up.</li>
            <li>I got it for my daughters hair which is biracial, curly, fine but EXTREMELY frizzy, she has the type of hair that gets frizzy just by staring at it too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ve gone through many, many products.  </li>
            <li>I rub it in pretty good and have no issue with white residue on &amp;#34;wet hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The first time i used this in a wash and go, along with the gel, but I used too much and experienced A LOT of white residue.</li>
            <li>I use just a little bit in conjunction with my Eco-Styler Argon Oil gel, and get great styling results and no crunch.</li>
            <li>the next morning my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I just started to go natural and most if my hair is permed.</li>
            <li>I love Mixed Chicks, but it&#x27;s just too pricey for the amount that we use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit this worked nearly as good as Mixed Chicks</li>
            <li>Totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li>This cream curls my hair nicely and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>then im sure it will work better and also try the other cantu shea butter products they work well</li>
            <li>My hair curls right up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in transition right now</li>
            <li>It gives my wave a gnarlier bend in all the right places.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>I knew i found the right product the way my hair took to it.</li>
            <li>I apply this right after i wash and condition my hair.</li>
            <li>I usually do not like the strong smell of Cantu products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an instant refresher with perfect curl restoration and a price point (less than $6 at CVS in NYC)</li>
            <li>The smell may be strong if you have a sensitive nose,  </li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair, with this product to the hair is soft and manageable, the only thing I dislike is that you feel the smell of coconut, but the texture is good, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and it also smells good.</li>
            <li>I purchased it at Walmart for a very reasonable price and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t even put it on my hair--it smells very yucky!</li>
            <li>and i NEVER thought i would say that because shea moisture used to be my first choice.</li>
            <li>I twisted my hair for the first time and I must tell you this product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I have mostly 4b hair with some 4a in the front and back.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I style my hair after working out on weekdays with expensive products so that I look my utmost best at work.</li>
            <li>I read a review stating that, but now I know exactly what she meant.</li>
            <li>and she has asked me to buy more several times.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair, i applied this on and instantly i noticed how my hair looked and felt better.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or anything good price as well</li>
            <li>So make sure you only use the hair silk or pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li>IT GIVES AMAZING DEFINITION AND MOISTURE TO MY HAIR IN TWISOUTS AND OTHER SETTING STYLES.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled about this and will tell other naturals about it too.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and using it after I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li>I use several Cantu products and each time I am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I make my own natural products and should have stuck to my remedies, just wanted to try something different</li>
            <li>I am almost positive I am.</li>
            <li>A simple and cheap jar of blue magic.</li>
            <li>great styling cream for curl definition -- on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>It works great wet, but I need it in the morning when his hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Ive decided to revisit this product a year and a half later (great decision).</li>
            <li>but it flakes quite easily, leaving sticky white residue visible all over your hair if you so much as TOUCH your hair after the product dries.</li>
            <li>Hydrates and really sets off my waves.</li>
            <li>I have 3b/3c with some straight hair and a whole lot of frizz</li>
            <li>do much for you since it enhances what you ALREADY HAVE).</li>
            <li>In terms of offering, &#x60;intense moisture&#x60;, I don&#x60;t know about all that.</li>
            <li>Plus it hold the curls in your hair really well.</li>
            <li>Either way, I don&#x27;t really like how this product sometimes dries my hair looking really stringy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also note that since using this product my hair has been growing extremely fast.</li>
            <li>It leave&#x27;s my hair feeling very moist.  </li>
            <li>and he wants it to grow curly</li>
            <li>I feel like it leaves too much build</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I use cantu as a gel substitue on my twist outs and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>It did wash away with my regular sulfate free shampoo, so</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>just really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>In fact, i absolutely would like to try the whole cantu line.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny, but not greasy and it really controls my frizz without making my hair feel like there is tons of product in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and defines my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my 4a/b naps.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes and softens my hair.</li>
            <li>I do think this product worked better when my hair was soaking wet compared to damp/dry.</li>
            <li>I love this product and keep it stocked up for my daily natural styling needs.  </li>
            <li>Because of my particular hair damage I went ahead and bought the Cantu line which includes the leave in repair conditioner and the daily grow strong strengthener as well as the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I will say, though not thrilled w/ some ingredients, I loved how my coils turned out.</li>
            <li>i use a small amount per section, and add an oil on top and some gel and twist!</li>
            <li>with most people with ethnic hair, I wash my hair maybe once a week or every other week.</li>
            <li>I am sure there are other products out there that would achieve this for my hair</li>
            <li>Such as you live out of the country or in an area where this product isn&#x27;t readily available.</li>
            <li>but when i use this product gor my twistouts, my hair feels soft and very moisturized!</li>
            <li>When I first went natural</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and a little goes a super long way.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good on wet or dry hair, too!</li>
            <li>So, combing was easy, and I didn&#x27;t have a wide tooth comb on hand either.</li>
            <li>I recently did the big chop and seen the many wonders that this product was creating</li>
            <li>i had all kinds of products on my hair from the classic stiffening gel to mousse.</li>
            <li>I would recommend their whole natural hair line to all textures!</li>
            <li>I am one of those naturals that really like using all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>As I Am because I love that line of natural hair care but being that I&#x27;m on a budget I checked out other brands.</li>
            <li>Though the label clearly says it contains no mineral oil, it has petrolatum very high up on the list.</li>
            <li>it,s great for my hair but so expensive.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard at all.</li>
            <li>i am 4b in the back and a more loose pattern in the front.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>This is moisturizing at first but leaves a white residue in my hair even thought I don&#x27;t use a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first thing that his you when you open it</li>
            <li>I was struggling to find the right product to use for my hair for a long time until i received this sample in the mail.</li>
            <li>I used Cantu in the past and it was ok, but noticed they had a natural hair care line.</li>
            <li>Makes my curly hair naturally soft and shows the natural curls with no frizz!</li>
            <li>only complaint I have is that, now I love the product I can&#x27;t find it anywhere except online!</li>
            <li>It was clearly made for people with looser hair textures like 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My hair is chemically and heat damaged so some parts of my hair don&#x27;t get curls when i style it now that I&#x27;m going natural.</li>
            <li>This product enhanced my natural curl patterns (</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this to me once she convinced me to go natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d only pay that much if it were from the Shea Moisture line.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think it costs that much at the local beauty supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive</li>
            <li>I have been natural off and on since 1997 and owned a natural hair salon.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that within an hour, my curls completely fell.  </li>
            <li>I am still in the process of regrowth and strengthening my very negroid hair following a period of stress that had me panicking that I was going bald.  </li>
            <li>I feel the Leave In Creme responds better to this, as my hair sucks up the product</li>
            <li>I also heat style my hair quite frequently so to say it&#x27;s been damaged is quite an</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really like this product anymore because it sometimes leaves white residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>With using petroleum and mineral oil the usage of shampoo would just be way too frequent.</li>
            <li>With this product is does make your hair soft</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>you purchase this product if natural</li>
            <li>but it makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product and it has defined my curls and makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li>I am 7 months post BC and am not one of those people who obsess over hair-relaxed or natural.  </li>
            <li>After breast cancer, chemo and radiation, my hair came back super curly and dry.  </li>
            <li>First things first: This product can work on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li>The only hassle is that it does the style typically will not last more than 3 days.</li>
            <li>I mean, the kind that looks like white tiny balls on the head...</li>
            <li>Earlier this week I had decided to use Suave Moroccan oil in place of the Cantu Super Shine Hair Silk and it resulted in a gooey mess, left way too much residue.</li>
            <li>Yes, your hair will be white at first, but it does dry clear.</li>
            <li>Firstly, i live in the Caribbean and currently humidity is at its peak.</li>
            <li>When I saw this at Walmart, I grabbed 2 jars so I would have an extra jar on hand because I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this new product.</li>
            <li>It left my hair moisturized, shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>This product definitely adds moisture and helps blends my relaxed hair with my natural roots.</li>
            <li>Cantu&#x27;s products are on the low end for natural hair care and it delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li>My son has mixed hair so it can get wild at times</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s the only thing that can get my 4c/4b hair to look shiny.</li>
            <li>If u have naturally curly hair, the only way to go</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m throwing out all these products geared to make money off us and going back old school to what worked.</li>
            <li>It decreased frizz and my curls were more defined.</li>
            <li>We experience little to no humidity here, so staying hydrated and finding the right moisturizer for the hair became a chore for me.</li>
            <li>and it still helps to define flat or old coils...</li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas where the air is dry.</li>
            <li>Also clean (co washed) and clarified (at least once a month).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls and leaves them more defined than any products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised as to how long the sample lasted me.</li>
            <li>His curls stay curly all day, no goopy mess, no white mess, it rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>Wow, it made my hair so manageable after the wash, that I didn&#x27;t need to blow dry.</li>
            <li>Far as the performance of the product, it didn&#x27;t define any curls once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>I tried my daughters container of this on dry hair spritzed w/ a mixture of water and Direct Leave In.</li>
            <li>I have regular black folk hair with a little water, leave in conditioner and this product it curls just fine.</li>
            <li>Before all these so called natural hair products... all I had to work with was water, condish and oils and gels and my natural hair grew down my back.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great...</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Walmart yesterday for a great price and it works.  </li>
            <li> A lot of curlies gave it a great review after trying it in their Curlbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have some great ingredients.</li>
            <li> I suppose it would be great for winter sealing if you&#x27;re going to twist</li>
            <li> But it does smell great.</li>
            <li> smell great.</li>

            <li> It smells good and does good for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and helps with frizzy hair issues.</li>
            <li> Besides all those chemicals just aren&#x27;t good for you and who knows what controls there might not be over that industry.  </li>
            <li> Seem to have good holding and moisturizing quality</li>
            <li> Just like everyone else that has made a review about this product when I opened up the jar I loved the smell.</li>
            <li> With all the oils and good stuff that&#x27;s in it, I&#x27;m wondering why would they muck it all up with Vaseline?</li>
            <li> but this one smelled light and wonderful.</li>
            <li> Seller was prompt and price was good</li>
            <li> This item is yet another example of your superior product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the results it gives my hair, it feels fly away and umanaged.</li>
            <li> and i am very glad that i did.</li>
            <li> but I like the twist and lock gel much better !</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair feel!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Do better Cantu!</li>

            <li> This product felt good on my hair and has a lovely smell.  </li>
            <li> I use to always wonder what smelled so nice on her</li>
            <li> You know the kind</li>
            <li> better price wise as well ..</li>
            <li> I am absolutely delighted with the results in stopping my hair loss aside from the bonus of leaving the hair soft, manageable and smelling great!</li>
            <li> It smells nice without giving me allergies and makes my hair curly but not frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product  smells nice</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, creamy, moisturizing (not oily) and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Cantu&#x27;s natural hair line is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> So far this has to be the best curling cream I have came across and used.</li>
            <li> Very light and non greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I love the coconut scent.</li>
            <li> I know of a couple of people who absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.</li>
            <li> It smells so wonderful, especially if you like the coconut smell.</li>
            <li> I just love it, plus it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> I love the results.</li>
            <li> I do not even have to use gel for the style to stay I love it.</li>
            <li> I have also used Carols daughter Healthy Hair Butter which also brings out the curl pattern</li>
            <li> I 100% love this product and the line.</li>
            <li> There is literally no reason to pay more than that for this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> and I love the smell :)</li>
            <li> The Cantu leave in conditioner holds more than this product.  </li>
            <li> Considering that I LOVE the Cantu leave in conditioner, this is a product that I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product, I ordered a sample to try it out.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> , i thibk its an ok product.</li>
            <li> And i mentioned definition with a YES, because it did do that lovely.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I feel in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched so many reviews on YOUTUBE</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair creme.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling cream.  </li>
            <li> My curls have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Plus I think if they took out the petrolatum and replaced it with ANY oil it would be a better product.</li>
            <li> So this going on top of it was the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair crunchy and the coconut smell is too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this for my mother, and she seems to enjoy it</li>
            <li> Since then I use a quarter size amount over the moisturizing curl cream and it obsorbs much better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it smells divine.</li>
            <li> I am biracial and have that &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34; most of my friends would say.</li>
            <li> That is how much i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> so you will have some i just prefer alot more</li>
            <li> so just be sure your nature hair before  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Curling Cream.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for hair textures that are mixed.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product, using on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product it doesn&#x27;t give me as many curls as the Eco</li>
            <li> I love the cream itself</li>
            <li> I cowash in the am, and put the Cantu curling cream on top of my leave in and voila...instant coils.  </li>
            <li> Love it a lot.</li>
            <li> However, I can feel my new growth and it feels beautiful.</li>
            <li> Perfect for busy women who just want to do something quick with their hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love it , great on natural hair</li>
            <li> The cream is white and have a very good consistency...</li>
            <li> I have long curly frizzy hair &amp; it makes my curls smooth silky &amp; smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Works best if your hair is wet</li>
            <li> Great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a full size soon!</li>
            <li> All we can do is preserve the hair and keep it strong (protein) and moist (water and condish) and sealed (oil that includes vaseline) and a styling aid ( gel or the alike) and keep ends trimmed once a year or as needed.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair that strongly dislikes gel like products.  </li>
            <li> so i didnt get the curls that i was wanting , that curl strong definition.</li>
            <li> Cantu needs to do more aggressive marketing of this product as there are so many people with natural hair and more getting the message that kinky hair is okay after all.  </li>
            <li> this works fine on my hair.    </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a huge accomplishment.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product from a local Rite aid and I am beyond happy.</li>
            <li> I bought mines from Walmart for a really cheap price.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the texture God gave you be blessed.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff countless times, with great results.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> cream also smells fantastic, but I guess if you don&#x27;t like tropical smells or the smell of pina colada/ coconut</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve read several great reviews on online</li>
            <li> I use sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it in combination with my fave sulfate free conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also smells fantastic and makes me feel like I&#x27;m on a tropical vacation.</li>
            <li> For a while I felt like I had to do way too much to achieve a nice coil effect in my hair.  </li>
            <li> it not only smells good but moisturizes like heaven in a jar way better than the shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie way</li>
            <li> , it left her hair defined and frizz free ALL DAY!!!  </li>
            <li> I find that when my hair stops responding to my normal hair care regimen, I switch my leave-in for this and it works awesome, but then I have to switch back to my leave in because this stops working.</li>
            <li> Amazon generally has good deals, but this isn&#x27;t one of them..</li>
            <li> I first was looking at this product it was because my hair has so many fly-aways</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this</li>
            <li> I have used other &amp;#34;frizz free&amp;#34; products formulated for curly hair, that made her hair look beautiful before school</li>
            <li> My hair feels soooo soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I try my best to be vigilant about reading the ingredients and apparently I missed the one ingredient that I consider a big no-no.</li>
            <li> The entire Cantu line is good for 4b and 4c hair.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my grand daughters</li>
            <li> But it is full of Petrolatum..</li>
            <li> Petroleum is not bad for the hair... dont believe the hype...</li>
            <li> At about 95% dry I carefully pulled them apart and the coils were moist, coiled, soft, defined, smelled great, and just perfect.</li>
            <li> Whilst that might be the best advertisement hence my determination to give feedback by the time I heard of the product my hair was/is already seriously damaged.  </li>
            <li> Cantu Shea Butter Coconut Curling Cream is great, has a really strong scent so should use early enough to allow scent to dissipate a bit.  </li>
            <li> I then apply Cantu Super Shine Hair Silk in 4 sections followed by Cantu Curling Cream and finish it off with Eco styler gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first tried this when I received a free sample in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I first received this product as a free sample quite a while ago</li>
            <li> Now if you use this on &amp;#34;dry hair&amp;#34; you will need to rub this in good to prevent white residue but honestly there is no white build up.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughters hair which is biracial, curly, fine but EXTREMELY frizzy, she has the type of hair that gets frizzy just by staring at it too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ve gone through many, many products.  </li>
            <li> I rub it in pretty good and have no issue with white residue on &amp;#34;wet hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this in a wash and go, along with the gel, but I used too much and experienced A LOT of white residue.</li>
            <li> I use just a little bit in conjunction with my Eco-Styler Argon Oil gel, and get great styling results and no crunch.</li>
            <li> the next morning my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I just started to go natural and most if my hair is permed.</li>
            <li> I love Mixed Chicks, but it&#x27;s just too pricey for the amount that we use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit this worked nearly as good as Mixed Chicks</li>
            <li> Totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This cream curls my hair nicely and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> then im sure it will work better and also try the other cantu shea butter products they work well</li>
            <li> My hair curls right up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in transition right now</li>
            <li> It gives my wave a gnarlier bend in all the right places.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> I knew i found the right product the way my hair took to it.</li>
            <li> I apply this right after i wash and condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually do not like the strong smell of Cantu products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an instant refresher with perfect curl restoration and a price point (less than $6 at CVS in NYC)</li>
            <li> The smell may be strong if you have a sensitive nose,  </li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair, with this product to the hair is soft and manageable, the only thing I dislike is that you feel the smell of coconut, but the texture is good, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and it also smells good.</li>
            <li> I purchased it at Walmart for a very reasonable price and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t even put it on my hair--it smells very yucky!</li>
            <li> and i NEVER thought i would say that because shea moisture used to be my first choice.</li>
            <li> I twisted my hair for the first time and I must tell you this product is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I have mostly 4b hair with some 4a in the front and back.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I style my hair after working out on weekdays with expensive products so that I look my utmost best at work.</li>
            <li> I read a review stating that, but now I know exactly what she meant.</li>
            <li> and she has asked me to buy more several times.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, i applied this on and instantly i noticed how my hair looked and felt better.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or anything good price as well</li>
            <li> So make sure you only use the hair silk or pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> IT GIVES AMAZING DEFINITION AND MOISTURE TO MY HAIR IN TWISOUTS AND OTHER SETTING STYLES.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled about this and will tell other naturals about it too.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and using it after I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> I use several Cantu products and each time I am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I make my own natural products and should have stuck to my remedies, just wanted to try something different</li>
            <li> I am almost positive I am.</li>
            <li> A simple and cheap jar of blue magic.</li>
            <li> great styling cream for curl definition -- on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> It works great wet, but I need it in the morning when his hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Ive decided to revisit this product a year and a half later (great decision).</li>
            <li> but it flakes quite easily, leaving sticky white residue visible all over your hair if you so much as TOUCH your hair after the product dries.</li>
            <li> Hydrates and really sets off my waves.</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c with some straight hair and a whole lot of frizz</li>
            <li> do much for you since it enhances what you ALREADY HAVE).</li>
            <li> In terms of offering, &#x60;intense moisture&#x60;, I don&#x60;t know about all that.</li>
            <li> Plus it hold the curls in your hair really well.</li>
            <li> Either way, I don&#x27;t really like how this product sometimes dries my hair looking really stringy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also note that since using this product my hair has been growing extremely fast.</li>
            <li> It leave&#x27;s my hair feeling very moist.  </li>
            <li> and he wants it to grow curly</li>
            <li> I feel like it leaves too much build</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use cantu as a gel substitue on my twist outs and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> It did wash away with my regular sulfate free shampoo, so</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> just really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> In fact, i absolutely would like to try the whole cantu line.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny, but not greasy and it really controls my frizz without making my hair feel like there is tons of product in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and defines my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my 4a/b naps.</li>
            <li> Thanks a million</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes and softens my hair.</li>
            <li> I do think this product worked better when my hair was soaking wet compared to damp/dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product and keep it stocked up for my daily natural styling needs.  </li>
            <li> Because of my particular hair damage I went ahead and bought the Cantu line which includes the leave in repair conditioner and the daily grow strong strengthener as well as the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I will say, though not thrilled w/ some ingredients, I loved how my coils turned out.</li>
            <li> i use a small amount per section, and add an oil on top and some gel and twist!</li>
            <li> with most people with ethnic hair, I wash my hair maybe once a week or every other week.</li>
            <li> I am sure there are other products out there that would achieve this for my hair</li>
            <li> Such as you live out of the country or in an area where this product isn&#x27;t readily available.</li>
            <li> but when i use this product gor my twistouts, my hair feels soft and very moisturized!</li>
            <li> When I first went natural</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and a little goes a super long way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good on wet or dry hair, too!</li>
            <li> So, combing was easy, and I didn&#x27;t have a wide tooth comb on hand either.</li>
            <li> I recently did the big chop and seen the many wonders that this product was creating</li>
            <li> i had all kinds of products on my hair from the classic stiffening gel to mousse.</li>
            <li> I would recommend their whole natural hair line to all textures!</li>
            <li> I am one of those naturals that really like using all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> As I Am because I love that line of natural hair care but being that I&#x27;m on a budget I checked out other brands.</li>
            <li> Though the label clearly says it contains no mineral oil, it has petrolatum very high up on the list.</li>
            <li> it,s great for my hair but so expensive.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard at all.</li>
            <li> i am 4b in the back and a more loose pattern in the front.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> This is moisturizing at first but leaves a white residue in my hair even thought I don&#x27;t use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first thing that his you when you open it</li>
            <li> I was struggling to find the right product to use for my hair for a long time until i received this sample in the mail.</li>
            <li> I used Cantu in the past and it was ok, but noticed they had a natural hair care line.</li>
            <li> Makes my curly hair naturally soft and shows the natural curls with no frizz!</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that, now I love the product I can&#x27;t find it anywhere except online!</li>
            <li> It was clearly made for people with looser hair textures like 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My hair is chemically and heat damaged so some parts of my hair don&#x27;t get curls when i style it now that I&#x27;m going natural.</li>
            <li> This product enhanced my natural curl patterns (</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me once she convinced me to go natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only pay that much if it were from the Shea Moisture line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think it costs that much at the local beauty supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive</li>
            <li> I have been natural off and on since 1997 and owned a natural hair salon.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that within an hour, my curls completely fell.  </li>
            <li> I am still in the process of regrowth and strengthening my very negroid hair following a period of stress that had me panicking that I was going bald.  </li>
            <li> I feel the Leave In Creme responds better to this, as my hair sucks up the product</li>
            <li> I also heat style my hair quite frequently so to say it&#x27;s been damaged is quite an</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really like this product anymore because it sometimes leaves white residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> With using petroleum and mineral oil the usage of shampoo would just be way too frequent.</li>
            <li> With this product is does make your hair soft</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li> you purchase this product if natural</li>
            <li> but it makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and it has defined my curls and makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li> I am 7 months post BC and am not one of those people who obsess over hair-relaxed or natural.  </li>
            <li> After breast cancer, chemo and radiation, my hair came back super curly and dry.  </li>
            <li> First things first: This product can work on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> The only hassle is that it does the style typically will not last more than 3 days.</li>
            <li> I mean, the kind that looks like white tiny balls on the head...</li>
            <li> Earlier this week I had decided to use Suave Moroccan oil in place of the Cantu Super Shine Hair Silk and it resulted in a gooey mess, left way too much residue.</li>
            <li> Yes, your hair will be white at first, but it does dry clear.</li>
            <li> Firstly, i live in the Caribbean and currently humidity is at its peak.</li>
            <li> When I saw this at Walmart, I grabbed 2 jars so I would have an extra jar on hand because I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this new product.</li>
            <li> It left my hair moisturized, shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> This product definitely adds moisture and helps blends my relaxed hair with my natural roots.</li>
            <li> Cantu&#x27;s products are on the low end for natural hair care and it delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li> My son has mixed hair so it can get wild at times</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s the only thing that can get my 4c/4b hair to look shiny.</li>
            <li> If u have naturally curly hair, the only way to go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing out all these products geared to make money off us and going back old school to what worked.</li>
            <li> It decreased frizz and my curls were more defined.</li>
            <li> We experience little to no humidity here, so staying hydrated and finding the right moisturizer for the hair became a chore for me.</li>
            <li> and it still helps to define flat or old coils...</li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas where the air is dry.</li>
            <li> Also clean (co washed) and clarified (at least once a month).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls and leaves them more defined than any products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> and I was surprised as to how long the sample lasted me.</li>
            <li> His curls stay curly all day, no goopy mess, no white mess, it rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> Wow, it made my hair so manageable after the wash, that I didn&#x27;t need to blow dry.</li>
            <li> Far as the performance of the product, it didn&#x27;t define any curls once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I tried my daughters container of this on dry hair spritzed w/ a mixture of water and Direct Leave In.</li>
            <li> I have regular black folk hair with a little water, leave in conditioner and this product it curls just fine.</li>
            <li> Before all these so called natural hair products... all I had to work with was water, condish and oils and gels and my natural hair grew down my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturalista (19 months) and have what you would call 4A hair-fine, but thick, tightly coiled, S shaped hair strands that requires a lot of moisture and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the makers of the product don&#x27;t KNOW that Petrolatum and mineral oil are the same, or they are trying to pull a fast one before anyone notices.</li>
            <li> My hair was not greasy or sticky which usually occur when I use certain gel products for the curling effect.</li>
            <li> The cream brought back my natural curls and waves and made my hair feel much less</li>
            <li> I used this for a flat twist out</li>
            <li> this item is for natural hair only i had a little perm in my hair</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dry and thirsty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is something that I intended to only use before bed, but instead find my self using it each time my curls dry out.</li>
            <li> When I applied it to my hair it left my hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> hair has been dyed very frequently in the past 3 years and the ends have been bleached several times.</li>
            <li> It was great,it kept the hair moist &amp; soft &amp; I only needed to apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> when i applied it to my sopping wet hair in the shower it went on white.</li>
            <li> Except for my 7.99 which was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I go to places such as Target and CVS where they sell other CANTU products, yet this one isn&#x27;t carried.  </li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning my hair, I braided my pony tail and sprayed with distilled water and added the cantu curl cream, next morning I took out my braid and scrunched my hair, and added a hair clip, about an hour later I noticed my hair was dry and a little frizzy looking.</li>
            <li> I use it on damp hair and flexi rod my hair until dry.</li>
            <li> and when I normally dry my hair it frizzes up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> my hair becomes dry after awhile</li>
            <li> So my 3C/4A shiny curls look like dry &#x27;fro curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of that, plus it leaves your hair greasy, but kinda dry.</li>
            <li> My hair no longer looks dry and unmanagable.</li>
            <li> And I also have used this on my hair while it was dry</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair that goes down my back.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for people with thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I remembered it being very moisturizing but not good for wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> IT works wonderfully on dry hair!</li>
            <li> the only thing I was dissapointed with was the mess I had to get it out of from shipping.</li>
            <li> , this curl cream did not work for me, it left my hair dry looking, even though I added green tea oil to hold in moisture.</li>
            <li> You only need a little.</li>
            <li> and as it dried throughout the day my hair felt very dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> I use it about every other day and my hair is no longer dry and brittle, but it&#x27;s  not greasy either.</li>
            <li> I have nothing against using mineral oil, but for my hair it just makes it hard and greasy and really offers</li>
            <li> After I take my hair down, I style it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick and sits on your hair for a long time white.</li>
            <li> If you have a Wal-mart nearby, this product is only a little over or under $4!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long (belly button length), thick, blonde, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other product but this at the moment.  </li>
            <li> Well, I have no stellar review for this product.</li>
            <li> After spending money on this along with a plethora of other &amp;#34;natural hair&amp;#34; products to no avail, I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> Put it on when your hair is almost dry, but still a little damp, and then just finger your curls.</li>
            <li> A little spritz of water, rub in the shea butter (no effect yet), let it naturally dry and boom!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to cut my hair at least 3 times since mid  april to maintain my pixie cut, and my bangs I cut myself in between salon visits.</li>
            <li> I need a product that weighs down some, but also defines curl and provides moisture.</li>
            <li> It does not weight down.</li>
            <li> I use it while its wet and seal it with plain coconut oil and then use this too.</li>
            <li> But because they&#x27;re pricey, I don&#x27;t typically use those products to style my hair on weekends.</li>
            <li> I had previously added shea butter to my hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> It was all wrapped up but when I opened it the lid was cracked and cream was all over ( luckily not A lot of it was wasted)</li>
            <li> but I have to use a little gel with that to maintain the curls.</li>
            <li> However, after a while it just feels a little heavy(greasy).</li>
            <li> I feel like this one is a little thinner and does not moisturize as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few weeks now and it looks like I haven&#x27;t even touched it because of how little you have to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t be too heavy handed with this</li>
            <li> hair is dead and need to be sealed to prevent split ends and Retain length ...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on this nonsense.</li>
            <li> I also added a little melted raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> so I have to find something to tame his head.</li>
            <li> I left my flat twist in for 1 day and a half and was shocked at how I didn&#x27;t have a lot of definiton.  </li>
            <li> I usually co-wash then apply gel and then apply a small amount of this.</li>
            <li> To the person who said this only works on 3 type hair you&#x27;re wrong.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s called a \\&quot;curling\\&quot; cream.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and I desperately needed something that will provide moisture to both my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Miss Jessie&#x27;s in the past which is ridiculously priced and doesn&#x27;t curl my hair like this.</li>
            <li> I hair is different (thin and complicated) though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and it weighs my hair done yet</li>
            <li> If you are use to thick, creamy products and don&#x27;t mind petrolatum</li>
            <li> If you are use to thick, creamy products and don&#x27;t mind petrolatum</li>
            <li> its not too thick or runny.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Either way, I think it&#x27;s a weak move on their part.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Walmart about a month ago in my quest to leave gel behind.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so curly, I basically gave up on using products, but this coconut cream is a game</li>
            <li> I used this Coconut Curling Cream but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> cream is moisturizing but my hair felt of an unpleasant residue.</li>
            <li> NO :(&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s How disappointed I was.</li>

            <li> So I really needed an alternative from using water every morning to get my messy bun look, that I adore. I love this stuff.  The smell may be strong if you have a sensitive nose,  but I love the coconut scent. Hydrates and really sets off my waves. Try it. Works fabulous with flex rods!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well for my rod sets</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the results it gives my hair, it feels fly away and umanaged. I&#x27;ve tried it twice with the same results. Doesn&#x27;t give my hair any shine, just looks fly away and umanageable. I hair is different (thin and complicated) though. I know of a couple of people who absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Gives great definition.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. I use it about every other day and my hair is no longer dry and brittle, but it&#x27;s  not greasy either. And this is a great price.</li>
            <li> I just used this to wash and braid my hair to wear under a wig. Wow, it made my hair so manageable after the wash, that I didn&#x27;t need to blow dry. So, combing was easy, and I didn&#x27;t have a wide tooth comb on hand either. What I also like about this product is that, it keeps the hair moisturized. It&#x27;s been a week, and my braids don&#x27;t feel try at the tips.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a local Rite aid and I am beyond happy. My hair is chemically and heat damaged so some parts of my hair don&#x27;t get curls when i style it now that I&#x27;m going natural. I have 3b/3c with some straight hair and a whole lot of frizz but when I use this in my hair along with Cantu Hydrating Cream Conditioner as a leave in and Cantu Coconut Oil Shine and Hold Mist and tada my damage ends become curly 3b!</li>
            <li> wasnt sticky!  smelled great!  defined curls without any greasy or sticky feeling to the touch. I def. recommend this for all types of curls!</li>
            <li> I love this product and keep it stocked up for my daily natural styling needs.  It&#x27;s light, creamy, moisturizing (not oily) and smells so good.</li>
            <li> This product felt good on my hair and has a lovely smell.  Very light and non greasy.  Happy with the price.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I like the twist and lock gel much better ! This product made my curls look great tho. Definitely a staple product along with the twist and lock gel lols</li>
            <li> The product is great works well with my 4B hair type...but I gave 5 stars because their customer service is impeccable...just amazing!!!</li>
            <li> let me tell you, this cream is NOT FOR WASH AND GO&#x27;S.. atleast for me. when i applied it to my sopping wet hair in the shower it went on white. and as it dried throughout the day my hair felt very dry and coarse. i am 4b in the back and a more loose pattern in the front. but when i use this product gor my twistouts, my hair feels soft and very moisturized! i use a small amount per section, and add an oil on top and some gel and twist! the next morning my hair looks amazing. i started learning that my hair likes thicker creams, and this is perfect, just not in a wash and go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturalista (19 months) and have what you would call 4A hair-fine, but thick, tightly coiled, S shaped hair strands that requires a lot of moisture and tangles easily. This product enhanced my natural curl patterns (if your hair doesn&#x60;t have curls, it wouldn&#x60;t do much for you since it enhances what you ALREADY HAVE). In terms of offering, &#x60;intense moisture&#x60;, I don&#x60;t know about all that. It left my hair feeling dry and thirsty. So its not that great as a moisturizing agent. Keep in mind this product has PETROLATUM in it, which blocks the absorption of moisture into the hair shaft (I wish I had noticed this before buying it). I did try Elasta&#x60;s Olive Oil &amp; Mango butter anti-breakage leave in conditioner (BUT IT HAS SILICONES IN IT, UGHH), BUT wow! the difference was immediate. It left my hair moisturized, shiny and soft! So yeah, Cantu Coconut creme is great for enhancing curls but that&#x60;s it.&lt;br /&gt; Smells great and the ingredients are wholesome.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me once she convinced me to go natural. I use to always wonder what smelled so nice on her and I found out it was this cream here she uses on her hair. It smells so wonderful, especially if you like the coconut smell. It&#x27;s also a great curling cream. I am addicted to it. Plus it hold the curls in your hair really well. It&#x27;s not hard at all. I just started to go natural and most if my hair is permed. I use it for the two stands twists and Bantu knots and it comes out great. I use it while its wet and seal it with plain coconut oil and then use this too. I just love it, plus it&#x27;s affordable. I bought mines from Walmart for a really cheap price. I think was like $4-$5</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning. I has tried once before for 11 months but resorted by to a relaxer. I think Cantu products will help me make it all the way. This product definitely adds moisture and helps blends my relaxed hair with my natural roots.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My hair curls right up. I use it on damp hair and flexi rod my hair until dry. After I take my hair down, I style it on my dry hair. I love the results. I&#x27;m in transition right now and it works well on my processed hair. However, I can feel my new growth and it feels beautiful. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this when I received a free sample in the mail.  I love how it makes my hair feel!  While it seems to be marketed to African Americans, it works well on any curly hair.  Just don&#x27;t over do it!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders... SOMETIMES. I find that when my hair stops responding to my normal hair care regimen, I switch my leave-in for this and it works awesome, but then I have to switch back to my leave in because this stops working. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair. Either way, I don&#x27;t really like how this product sometimes dries my hair looking really stringy.</li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas where the air is dry. We experience little to no humidity here, so staying hydrated and finding the right moisturizer for the hair became a chore for me. I&#x27;ve been living here for 3 years and have tried every product on the planet to keep my short hair moisturized. A friend who lives in Chicago told me about this product and I found it at Walmart, bought it and tried it out. First things first: This product can work on dry or wet hair. I usually co-wash then apply gel and then apply a small amount of this. I rub it in pretty good and have no issue with white residue on &amp;#34;wet hair&amp;#34;. Now if you use this on &amp;#34;dry hair&amp;#34; you will need to rub this in good to prevent white residue but honestly there is no white build up. You know the kind I mean, the kind that looks like white tiny balls on the head...well you won&#x27;t get that with this. Also I find this product mixes with a lot of different gels. Just don&#x27;t be too heavy handed with this and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll also note that since using this product my hair has been growing extremely fast. I&#x27;ve had to cut my hair at least 3 times since mid  april to maintain my pixie cut, and my bangs I cut myself in between salon visits. This stuff is the business!</li>
            <li> It was great,it kept the hair moist &amp; soft &amp; I only needed to apply a small amount. I will definitely continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Great for hair. Terribad for a beard. I no longer use product for my gentleman&#x27;s cut. I just use this stuff. It gives my wave a gnarlier bend in all the right places.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target I have used the cowash and leave in conditioner which both are great. Cantu&#x27;s products are on the low end for natural hair care and it delivers what it promises. I have used Miss Jessie&#x27;s in the past which is ridiculously priced and doesn&#x27;t curl my hair like this. I do not even have to use gel for the style to stay I love it. I have regular black folk hair with a little water, leave in conditioner and this product it curls just fine. I have also used Carols daughter Healthy Hair Butter which also brings out the curl pattern but I have to use a little gel with that to maintain the curls. Use what works on your hair do not go broke trying to find a product to give your hair curls that it was not created to have. Enjoy the texture God gave you be blessed.</li>
            <li> This product smels great, and I do have luck with it for my twist outs. However, after a while it just feels a little heavy(greasy). However, I don&#x27;t throw out my prodcuts and since it does moisturize my hair, I will use it up. I purchased it at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I 100% love this product and the line. It smells good and does good for my hair. It met my expectations, no complaints.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t even put it on my hair--it smells very yucky!</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff countless times, with great results. I use just a little bit in conjunction with my Eco-Styler Argon Oil gel, and get great styling results and no crunch. Yes, your hair will be white at first, but it does dry clear. I only use this stuff on damp or drenched hair after I have done a liquid, oil and creamy leave-in. I use this stuff strictly for the styling part of my regimen and it works great and my hair is still well-moisturized even by the end of the day if I do everything else first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend paying $7.99 for this stuff, however. If you have a Wal-mart nearby, this product is only a little over or under $4! There is literally no reason to pay more than that for this product. I&#x27;d only pay that much if it were from the Shea Moisture line. Anyway, hope that helps. I don&#x27;t even think it costs that much at the local beauty supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only buy it here if you MUST. Such as you live out of the country or in an area where this product isn&#x27;t readily available. Amazon generally has good deals, but this isn&#x27;t one of them..</li>
            <li> Cantu&#x27;s natural hair line is excellent!!! every product i have tried from the co wash to this stuff is awesome!! it not only smells good but moisturizes like heaven in a jar way better than the shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie way better price wise as well ..and i NEVER thought i would say that because shea moisture used to be my first choice. My hair feels soooo soft and smells amazing. JUST GO AND BUY!!! I would recommend their whole natural hair line to all textures!</li>
            <li> Cantu Shea Butter Coconut Curling Cream, 12 Ounce This is the best stuff EVER!!! I have long curly frizzy hair &amp; it makes my curls smooth silky &amp; smells amazing!!! I will never use anything else!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT WONDERFUL SMELL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and it weighs my hair done yet it defines it. It makes my hair prickly. I won&#x27;t be buying it again 👎</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair that goes down my back. This product smells good and helps with frizzy hair issues.</li>
            <li> great styling cream for curl definition -- on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Has great oils in it. Natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive and my hair LOVES IT!</li>
            <li> This cream does the job and smells very nice. It isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or anything good price as well</li>
            <li> Gosh!!!! Petroleum is not bad for the hair... dont believe the hype... read up... hair is dead and need to be sealed to prevent split ends and Retain length ... I have been natural off and on since 1997 and owned a natural hair salon. Before all these so called natural hair products... all I had to work with was water, condish and oils and gels and my natural hair grew down my back. All we can do is preserve the hair and keep it strong (protein) and moist (water and condish) and sealed (oil that includes vaseline) and a styling aid ( gel or the alike) and keep ends trimmed once a year or as needed. Also clean (co washed) and clarified (at least once a month). Why do people make it so dang hard!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT WORKS IF YOU LEARN WHAT YOUR HAIR NEEDS and WHEN IT NEEDS IT!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff makes my hair feel and I love the smell :)</li>
            <li> This product smells GREAT!  It leave&#x27;s my hair feeling very moist.  I used this for a flat twist out and I have to say that within an hour, my curls completely fell.  I left my flat twist in for 1 day and a half and was shocked at how I didn&#x27;t have a lot of definiton.  The Cantu leave in conditioner holds more than this product.  Considering that I LOVE the Cantu leave in conditioner, this is a product that I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product, I ordered a sample to try it out. My son has mixed hair so it can get wild at times and he wants it to grow curly so I have to find something to tame his head. This works great. It works great wet, but I need it in the morning when his hair is dry. IT works wonderfully on dry hair! His curls stay curly all day, no goopy mess, no white mess, it rubs in easily. I will be buying a full size soon!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  I am still in the process of regrowth and strengthening my very negroid hair following a period of stress that had me panicking that I was going bald.  Cantu needs to do more aggressive marketing of this product as there are so many people with natural hair and more getting the message that kinky hair is okay after all.  Besides all those chemicals just aren&#x27;t good for you and who knows what controls there might not be over that industry.  I had to hear of the Cantu treatment via my daughter who had heard it from a friend - i.e. &amp;#34;word of mouth&amp;#34;.  Whilst that might be the best advertisement hence my determination to give feedback by the time I heard of the product my hair was/is already seriously damaged.  Because of my particular hair damage I went ahead and bought the Cantu line which includes the leave in repair conditioner and the daily grow strong strengthener as well as the shampoo and conditioner.  You don&#x27;t have to as my daughter only got the curling cream together with the shampoo and conditioner.  I am absolutely delighted with the results in stopping my hair loss aside from the bonus of leaving the hair soft, manageable and smelling great!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in the mail. I got it for my daughters hair which is biracial, curly, fine but EXTREMELY frizzy, she has the type of hair that gets frizzy just by staring at it too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ve gone through many, many products.  I love Mixed Chicks, but it&#x27;s just too pricey for the amount that we use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit this worked nearly as good as Mixed Chicks, it left her hair defined and frizz free ALL DAY!!!  That&#x27;s a huge accomplishment.  I have used other &amp;#34;frizz free&amp;#34; products formulated for curly hair, that made her hair look beautiful before school but when I picked her up at the end of the day, it looked like a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that, now I love the product I can&#x27;t find it anywhere except online! I go to places such as Target and CVS where they sell other CANTU products, yet this one isn&#x27;t carried.  However, I will place an order via Amazon because I appreciate the results.</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c black/Japanese hair. I need a product that weighs down some, but also defines curl and provides moisture. I used this Coconut Curling Cream but was not impressed. I prefer to use the Cantu Leave-In Conditioning/Repair Creme. I feel like this one is a little thinner and does not moisturize as well. I feel like it leaves too much build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most people with ethnic hair, I wash my hair maybe once a week or every other week. I use the same product daily. I feel the Leave In Creme responds better to this, as my hair sucks up the product and I can use the product every day without a ton of buildup on my scalp and on the hair itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see my review of the Cantu Leave-In Repair Creme.</li>
            <li> I requested a sample of this via mail, once I used it I knew I would never use another hair product. It smells amazing and a little goes a super long way. Problem was I couldn&#x27;t find the regular size anywhere locally so I had it ordered from Amazon (comes out of NY I believe) and it took about 7 days before I finally received it. Totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I love this. It leaves my hair very moisturized. A little goes long way. I have 4c type hair and it makes my koils and pop.</li>
            <li> Works on my coarse hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair, with this product to the hair is soft and manageable, the only thing I dislike is that you feel the smell of coconut, but the texture is good, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I had received a sample size of it in the mail a while back but couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores. Since getting this I realized it leaves a almost greasy like texture on my hair but a bit of water helps combat that.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Works best if your hair is wet</li>
            <li> I first received this product as a free sample quite a while ago and I was surprised as to how long the sample lasted me. You need almost no cream to see results and I quite like the way my hair looks after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been dyed very frequently in the past 3 years and the ends have been bleached several times. I also heat style my hair quite frequently so to say it&#x27;s been damaged is quite an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first was looking at this product it was because my hair has so many fly-aways and when I normally dry my hair it frizzes up quite a bit. The cream brought back my natural curls and waves and made my hair feel much less damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream also smells fantastic, but I guess if you don&#x27;t like tropical smells or the smell of pina colada/ coconut this might bother you.</li>
            <li> OK. So i didnt purchase this product from amazon, but i viewed it here and read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Firstly, i live in the Caribbean and currently humidity is at its peak. I have 4b and 4c textured hair and i&#x27;ve used this product only twice already. What i&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;1. my hair shrinks&lt;br /&gt;2. my hair feels &#x27;gooey&#x27; and or sticky (hate)&lt;br /&gt;3. my hair becomes dry after awhile&lt;br /&gt;4. Definition? YES!!!&lt;br /&gt;5. Smell? YES!!! (awesome)&lt;br /&gt;6. Shine? NO :(&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i thibk its an ok product. I mentioned humidity as that may also affect the results i will get after use. And i mentioned definition with a YES, because it did do that lovely. I may use again, but just not something i&#x27;ll stick with.</li>
            <li> Love it. Gives my hair curls and keeps it moisturized. Smells pleasant. The entire Cantu line is good for 4b and 4c hair.</li>
            <li> After breast cancer, chemo and radiation, my hair came back super curly and dry.  I saw this pm Amazon and got a sample.  I feel in love with it.  My hair is softer and has lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair that strongly dislikes gel like products.  I use cantu as a gel substitue on my twist outs and it works very well. The only hassle is that it does the style typically will not last more than 3 days.</li>
            <li> I love it , great on natural hair</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I&#x27;ve watched so many reviews on YOUTUBE and I&#x27;ve read several great reviews on online but this product simply does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is moisturizing but my hair felt of an unpleasant residue. I tried different application techniques and I just didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Makes my curly hair naturally soft and shows the natural curls with no frizz!</li>
            <li> To the person who said this only works on 3 type hair you&#x27;re wrong.    I have 3c, 4a with 4b and this works fine on my hair.    It makes my hair look awesome. But I don&#x27;t really like this product anymore because it sometimes leaves white residue in my hair. I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair creme.  I use sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  Then after my hair is washed I leave this in.  It smells nice without giving me allergies and makes my hair curly but not frizzy. I don&#x27;t use any other product but this at the moment.  I highly recommend this for people with thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great... I twisted my hair for the first time and I must tell you this product is awesome.  It moisturize my hair and defined my curls! !! I Love it! !! I also added a little melted raw Shea butter. .must have product for me now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Walmart yesterday for a great price and it works.  I love this curling cream.  It left my hair soft and it also smells good.</li>
            <li> When I first went natural I tried this product. I remembered it being very moisturizing but not good for wash and go&#x27;s. I have mostly 4b hair with some 4a in the front and back. Ive decided to revisit this product a year and a half later (great decision). THIS PRODUCT MAY NOT DO WELL FOR WASH AND GO&#x27;s (although it does make my hair curlier when applied). IT GIVES AMAZING DEFINITION AND MOISTURE TO MY HAIR IN TWISOUTS AND OTHER SETTING STYLES. This is a must buy, especial if your hair is kinky/curly at the same time.</li>
            <li> My curls have never looked better. I am so excited about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I style my hair after working out on weekdays with expensive products so that I look my utmost best at work. But because they&#x27;re pricey, I don&#x27;t typically use those products to style my hair on weekends. So my 3C/4A shiny curls look like dry &#x27;fro curls eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with this cantu shea butter, oh.my.GOD!! A little spritz of water, rub in the shea butter (no effect yet), let it naturally dry and boom! My shiny curls are back without the use of my much more expensive products or my extensive shower regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something that I intended to only use before bed, but instead find my self using it each time my curls dry out. It&#x27;s an instant refresher with perfect curl restoration and a price point (less than $6 at CVS in NYC) that&#x27;s unbeatable. I am thrilled about this and will tell other naturals about it too.</li>
            <li> yeah it,s great for my hair but so expensive.....</li>
            <li> Cantu Shea Butter Coconut Curling Cream is great, has a really strong scent so should use early enough to allow scent to dissipate a bit.  Seem to have good holding and moisturizing quality</li>
            <li> When it came to sending in my product on time, I couldn&#x27;t complain. Just like everyone else that has made a review about this product when I opened up the jar I loved the smell. I recently did the big chop and seen the many wonders that this product was creating so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and purchase it. When I applied it to my hair it left my hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this shea butter.  It works very well on my grand daughters curls</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Walmart about a month ago in my quest to leave gel behind. I saw this, it was cheap, and smelled great. (Yes, I cracked the seal and smelled it! LoL!!)I figured what the heck? A lot of curlies gave it a great review after trying it in their Curlbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Well, I have no stellar review for this product. It&#x27;s not 100% \\&quot;bad\\&quot;. It does have some great ingredients. It would be a big big hit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  But it is full of Petrolatum.. Yes this product has mineral oil in it. Though the label clearly says it contains no mineral oil, it has petrolatum very high up on the list. I&#x27;m not sure if the makers of the product don&#x27;t KNOW that Petrolatum and mineral oil are the same, or they are trying to pull a fast one before anyone notices. Either way, I think it&#x27;s a weak move on their part. Plus I think if they took out the petrolatum and replaced it with ANY oil it would be a better product. With all the oils and good stuff that&#x27;s in it, I&#x27;m wondering why would they muck it all up with Vaseline? Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Far as the performance of the product, it didn&#x27;t define any curls once your hair is dry. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s called a \\&quot;curling\\&quot; cream. It&#x27;s really thick and sits on your hair for a long time white. I&#x27;m not fond of that, plus it leaves your hair greasy, but kinda dry. I read a review stating that, but now I know exactly what she meant. My hair was filmy and didn&#x27;t accept any moisture for DAYS and then it still felt like water was just beading on my hair. It did wash away with my regular sulfate free shampoo, so I guess that&#x27;s a plus for those who use petroleum, but want to still stay \\&quot;modified CG\\&quot;. I have nothing against using mineral oil, but for my hair it just makes it hard and greasy and really offers no benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I suppose it would be great for winter sealing if you&#x27;re going to twist/braid your hair away. Or if you do twist outs it may work. But for wash n gos, that&#x27;s a big \\&quot;No\\&quot; in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But it does smell great.

            <li> I must say naturals have been RAVING about the Cantu Shea Butter Line. I was not a fan of the ingredients in the Cantu Leave In Repairing Cream. So when this product came out from Cantu I was all over it. I try my best to be vigilant about reading the ingredients and apparently I missed the one ingredient that I consider a big no-no. I am one of those naturals that really like using all natural ingredients! Sue me! I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair with clarifying shampoo weekly. I am a co-washer and I use shampoo once a month. With using petroleum and mineral oil the usage of shampoo would just be way too frequent. With this product is does make your hair soft but also it makes it greasy. I had previously added shea butter to my hair/scalp. So this going on top of it was the icing on the cake. I&#x27;ve only used it about three times but I am considering giving it away. I am almost positive I am. I am a product junkie at this point anyway so I will not be missing much. Except for my 7.99 which was a complete waste of money. Do better Cantu!</li>
            <li> Great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> So far this has to be the best curling cream I have came across and used. I purchased it at Walmart for a very reasonable price and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. The cream is white and have a very good consistency...its not too thick or runny. It&#x27;s just right. I usually do not like the strong smell of Cantu products but this one smelled light and wonderful. I used it on my twist outs and it came out great. My hair was not greasy or sticky which usually occur when I use certain gel products for the curling effect. This left my hair shiny and silky and now its a staple product in my overall hair care.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair crunchy and the coconut smell is too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this for my mother, and she seems to enjoy it and she has asked me to buy more several times.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t bought this yet you should go get it now. Absolutely fabulous!!! Great moisturizer &amp; so far it&#x27;s the only thing that can get my 4c/4b hair to look shiny. I use it for twist outs or as the cream in my LCO moisturizing method. Heard its also great for wash &amp; go&#x27;s so I have to try that too.</li>
            <li> When I saw this at Walmart, I grabbed 2 jars so I would have an extra jar on hand because I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this new product. I have natural curly hair so I was hoping for a miracle because my hair needs a lot of moisture. After washing and conditioning my hair, I braided my pony tail and sprayed with distilled water and added the cantu curl cream, next morning I took out my braid and scrunched my hair, and added a hair clip, about an hour later I noticed my hair was dry and a little frizzy looking. I was very disappointed, this curl cream did not work for me, it left my hair dry looking, even though I added green tea oil to hold in moisture. I make my own natural products and should have stuck to my remedies, just wanted to try something different, I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, I took the second jar back for a refund that&#x27;s How disappointed I was.</li>
            <li> This give me an all day groomed look!</li>
            <li> my hair likes it. thanks</li>
            <li> This is moisturizing at first but leaves a white residue in my hair even thought I don&#x27;t use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this in a wash and go, along with the gel, but I used too much and experienced A LOT of white residue. 😡 I had to wash it out. Since then I use a quarter size amount over the moisturizing curl cream and it obsorbs much better. It does define my curls and provides moisture; however I still experience some frizz in the crown of my head. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and I desperately needed something that will provide moisture to both my scalp and hair. I love this product and it smells divine. I have been using this for over a year and I purchased it at Wal Greens where I find that they carry diverse ethnic hair care products.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  I think I have become a product junkie and this shea butter just really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I tried my daughters container of this on dry hair spritzed w/ a mixture of water and Direct Leave In. I made my hair semi damp and finger coiled my hair before leaving to go to work. I will say, though not thrilled w/ some ingredients, I loved how my coils turned out. At about 95% dry I carefully pulled them apart and the coils were moist, coiled, soft, defined, smelled great, and just perfect. I will consider getting some for myself.</li>
            <li> I am biracial and have that &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34; most of my friends would say. i had all kinds of products on my hair from the classic stiffening gel to mousse. I even had a relaxer done but it made my hair break. I have thick curly hair sometimes wavy depending on the weather.&lt;br /&gt;if it&#x27;s humid forget it, talk about frizz for days. I was struggling to find the right product to use for my hair for a long time until i received this sample in the mail. After washing my hair, i applied this on and instantly i noticed how my hair looked and felt better. I knew i found the right product the way my hair took to it. So i decided to order online and i am very glad that i did. My hair no longer looks dry and unmanagable. In fact, i absolutely would like to try the whole cantu line. That is how much i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Seller was prompt and price was good this item is for natural hair only i had a little perm in my hair so i didnt get the curls that i was wanting , that curl strong definition. But i did have a some curls so you will have some i just prefer alot more so i continue to grow ot my perm then im sure it will work better and also try the other cantu shea butter products they work well also i am still using all cantu product so just be sure your nature hair before  you purchase this product if natural im sure you will have the best curls....</li>
            <li> HEAD OVER HEELS for this product.  Was referred by a friend.  The scent is light and pleasant.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls and leaves them more defined than any products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  Sometimes I use it in combination with my fave sulfate free conditioner.  it&#x27;s good on wet or dry hair, too! Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair product. My hair looks shiny, but not greasy and it really controls my frizz without making my hair feel like there is tons of product in it. You only need a little. I&#x27;ve had mine for a few weeks now and it looks like I haven&#x27;t even touched it because of how little you have to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long (belly button length), thick, blonde, curly hair. Because my hair is so curly, I basically gave up on using products, but this coconut cream is a game changer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells fantastic and makes me feel like I&#x27;m on a tropical vacation. Perfect for busy women who just want to do something quick with their hair in the morning. Put it on when your hair is almost dry, but still a little damp, and then just finger your curls. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I was at Target and needed a leave in and styling cream. I was going to get As I Am because I love that line of natural hair care but being that I&#x27;m on a budget I checked out other brands. I used Cantu in the past and it was ok, but noticed they had a natural hair care line. I went ahead and purchased the Cantu Leave-In conditioner and the Curling Cream. I absolutely love the Curling Cream. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and defines my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine: I shampoo and condition my hair. I part my hair in 4 sections and apply the Cantu Leave-In Conditioner. I then apply Cantu Super Shine Hair Silk in 4 sections followed by Cantu Curling Cream and finish it off with Eco styler gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are great! Disclaimer: You must use all 4 products I mentioned to get the best results. Earlier this week I had decided to use Suave Moroccan oil in place of the Cantu Super Shine Hair Silk and it resulted in a gooey mess, left way too much residue. So make sure you only use the hair silk or pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> softens my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for hair textures that are mixed. I have sections of type 3 and 4 throughout my hair and this allows me to moisturize and give my hair a uniform look</li>
            <li> If u have naturally curly hair, the only way to go</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my 4a/b naps. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on this nonsense. It felt like I was applying milk to my hair. No softening or curling effect whatsoever. It was clearly made for people with looser hair textures like 3&#x27;s. After spending money on this along with a plethora of other &amp;#34;natural hair&amp;#34; products to no avail, I&#x27;m done with it. I&#x27;m throwing out all these products geared to make money off us and going back old school to what worked. A simple and cheap jar of blue magic.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product, using on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice but it flakes quite easily, leaving sticky white residue visible all over your hair if you so much as TOUCH your hair after the product dries. maybe it just wasn&#x27;t for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Love this product it doesn&#x27;t give me as many curls as the Eco but it makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and it has defined my curls and makes my hair feel so soft and I definitely love â¤ the smell!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair smells of coconut. It&#x27;s the first thing that his you when you open it</li>
            <li> I love the cream itself the only thing I was dissapointed with was the mess I had to get it out of from shipping. It was all wrapped up but when I opened it the lid was cracked and cream was all over ( luckily not A lot of it was wasted)</li>
            <li> I use several Cantu products and each time I am not disappointed!  This item is yet another example of your superior product.  Thanks a million</li>
            <li> This cream curls my hair nicely and the curls last all day. This product  smells nice and it&#x27;s very thick. I apply this right after i wash and condition my hair. It really moisturizes and softens my hair. It decreased frizz and my curls were more defined. I do think this product worked better when my hair was soaking wet compared to damp/dry.</li>
            <li> I am 7 months post BC and am not one of those people who obsess over hair-relaxed or natural.  For a while I felt like I had to do way too much to achieve a nice coil effect in my hair.  With this...I cowash in the am, and put the Cantu curling cream on top of my leave in and voila...instant coils.  I am sure there are other products out there that would achieve this for my hair but I&#x27;ll stick to this for a while.  And I also have used this on my hair while it was dry and it still helps to define flat or old coils...</li>
            <li> Great. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and using it after I flat iron my hair. It does not weight down. My hair still has lots of body and the hair straightening last until I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it a lot. defines my curls with a shine and controls my frizz</li>
