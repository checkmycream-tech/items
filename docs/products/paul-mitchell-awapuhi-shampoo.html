            <li>I LOVE AWAPUHI BY PAUL MITCHELL.  </li>
            <li>If your hair needs a better shampoo, again, there are many products, however this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a shampoo I like more than this one.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>My mother has been a hairdresser for 45+ years and used this product in our family for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>This is a great daily shampoo that really does clean and make your hair look great!</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo a lot, it smells great and really leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>VERY COOL.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, I have very fine hair that tends to get oily very fast.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the one I had originally set to buy, but they didn&#x27;t have what I wanted</li>
            <li>Your hair is very clean and combs through easily after shampooing and leaves it very manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL SQUEEKY CLEAN</li>
            <li>CLEAN FEEL</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean, and there is no toxic &#x27;hair dresser&#x27; smell after my shampoo.  </li>
            <li>JUST SMELLS CLEAN.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;smell is nice, not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;multi purpose, can be used as a body wash also, leaving skin soft.</li>
            <li>It makes such a differnece to use a good shampoo, not a cheaper one with fillers.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for my dry hair!!  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well wrapped for protection.  </li>
            <li>I will totally be buying more!</li>
            <li>I have fine, normal hair and this shampoo did not work well at all!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for a few years along with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s de-tangler, well, you have a great combination for your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great everyday and clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Using a little bit gives a lot of rich, creamy lather that easily rinses off leaving your hair shiny, smooth and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand what was the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars only because it smells good and hair tenders smooth but should fight the basic thing I brought it for!</li>
            <li>I have used Paul Mitchell products in the past and loved the way it made my hair feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>VERY OLD!!!  </li>
            <li>so this product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>These 2 bottles that I purchased through amazon.com were not the real thing!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel clean and healthy without feeling like it is dried out.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much shampoo so the bottle lasts forever, becoming cheaper, in my opinion, than even the basic brands you buy at the department stores.</li>
            <li>It is also reasonably price for the quantity.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair much softer.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo other than to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Since it lists itself as also a bodywash on the bottle (not that many other shampoos are not, or body washes cannot serve as a shampoo)</li>
            <li>I bought this bottle because I&#x27;d recently bought Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger and fell in LOVE with the way the Wild Ginger made my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo, or whatever it is, left a film on my hair that made it super greasy.  </li>
            <li>It still gets my hair clean and moisturized, but it&#x27;s not quite up to the standard of the Wild Ginger.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp and if I used it too much</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for my dry coarse hair.</li>
            <li>so I was hired as the new florist at a grocery store.</li>
            <li>I first tried this shampoo when a local salon had a sale on litre sized bottles.</li>
            <li>I bought this and realized quickly it is old!  </li>
            <li>Has a nice but natural and subtle scent.</li>
            <li>So soft and silky</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on Paul Mitchell if it&#x27;s not from a salon.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft any hydrated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy shampoo</li>
            <li>This shampoo really does a deep cleanse on your hair.</li>
            <li>but it makes a real difference to hydrate grey hair</li>
            <li>So, this is like sooooo expensive, but all the awapuhi stuff is my absolute favorite Paul Mitchel line.</li>
            <li>If you wash your hair every night as I do, Awapuhi will not dry out your hair.  </li>
            <li>I was recommend this by my hairdresser, was a little dubious at first</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>

            <li> I was recommend this by my hairdresser, was a little dubious at first</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> A large bottle will last you a long time as using just a little bit will make it last.</li>
            <li> There is one strange problem with it however.</li>
            <li> This product however left my hai feeling greasy and weighted down.</li>
            <li> My shampoo would irritate my scalp and make it all red and itchy, or my hair would look dull or feel gross.</li>
            <li> You can use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t destroy your hair.</li>
            <li> Total sham.</li>
            <li> This is the worse company that I have ever shop in my whole life.</li>
            <li> They can be pricey, but if you buy the larger sized bottles it cuts the cost over the small bottles.  </li>
            <li> it does not irritate my skin as much as other salon hair products.</li>
            <li> AND HAS NO FUNNY FRUITY SMELLS.</li>
            <li> This was ordered through Amazon.com due to some physical restrictions that temporarily left me unable yo go shopping in the store</li>
            <li> If it is still not good enough for you, seek unscented specialty products.</li>
            <li> Clarifies, cleanses, and does not add weight with heavy conditioners.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not fantastic and</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair and made it look dead.</li>
            <li> If you&lt;br /&gt;want to waste your money, then you can buy there.</li>
            <li> so I use it once every few weeks to keep the build up off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years for my thin, flat hair.</li>
            <li> I usually but this.  </li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner in the past (bought from a salon) and</li>
            <li> I brought this because I used a small sachet in the one of the hotels I was staying at</li>
            <li> so its been hard for me to find something that works this well.</li>
            <li> This is sometimes hard to locate so having it shipped saved miles and frustration.</li>
            <li> It was also a late night interview as she said she was tired.</li>
            <li> Awaphu Shampoo does not leave a residue on your hair to leave it dull and unable to comb through.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, but my hair becomes worse after i use this product.</li>
            <li> The lettering comes off the bottle so after a while you got a bunch black letters stuck around the base of this bottle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad.  </li>
            <li> REAL DIRTY ONE SUDS WILL DO.....</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;hair feels squeeky clean.&lt;br /&gt;smell is nice, not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;multi purpose, can be used as a body wash also, leaving skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love Paul Mitchell products!  They can be pricey, but if you buy the larger sized bottles it cuts the cost over the small bottles.  This shampoo smells great and is mild on your hair.</li>
            <li> This was ordered through Amazon.com due to some physical restrictions that temporarily left me unable yo go shopping in the store I usually but this.  I would recommend this product.  Love this shampoo for my dry coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a great price!</li>
            <li> My husband has fine, blond hair and this product seems to work the best for his hair type. It is also reasonably price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Amazon manages to, somehow, have the best prices on most of its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo&#x27;s great in quality, good for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped soon (with Prime), came in good condition, and was a great bargain. So no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have no comment on this it&#x27;s Paul Mitchell need I say anymore....well since this reveiw field requires more words ...it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> The lady that interviewed me said she liked the smell of my shampoo so I was hired as the new florist at a grocery store. She said I smelled nice, like a flower... It helped. It was also a late night interview as she said she was tired. And I just had a coffee. That helps.</li>
            <li> I LOVE AWAPUHI BY PAUL MITCHELL.  IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL SQUEEKY CLEAN AND IF YOUR HAIR ISN&#x27;T REAL DIRTY ONE SUDS WILL DO.....LOTS OF SHAMPOOS NOW DON&#x27;T LET YOU HAVE THAT CLEAN FEEL BUT THIS DOES...........LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo a lot, it smells great and really leaves my hair feeling clean. I will totally be buying more! I have always been a bit thrify when it comes to hair products, and my hair showed it. My shampoo would irritate my scalp and make it all red and itchy, or my hair would look dull or feel gross. This product makes my hair feel clean and healthy without feeling like it is dried out. I have fine, thin hair so its been hard for me to find something that works this well. I am VERY pleased!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo at a fair price. Only thing I would like to see is a pump on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was recommend this by my hairdresser, was a little dubious at first but it makes a real difference to hydrate grey hair</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for my dry hair!!  It makes such a differnece to use a good shampoo, not a cheaper one with fillers.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  Using a little bit gives a lot of rich, creamy lather that easily rinses off leaving your hair shiny, smooth and squeaky clean.  Awaphu Shampoo does not leave a residue on your hair to leave it dull and unable to comb through.  Your hair is very clean and combs through easily after shampooing and leaves it very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for a few years along with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s de-tangler, well, you have a great combination for your hair.  So soft and silky and I receive compliments on my hair because it is so shiny.  A large bottle will last you a long time as using just a little bit will make it last. If you wash your hair every night as I do, Awapuhi will not dry out your hair.  I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo other than to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is sometimes hard to locate so having it shipped saved miles and frustration. Have used this shampoo for years and it is the best I&#x27;ve found for my hair.</li>
            <li> Worth the money. Women, don&#x27;t keep wasting money on trying every crappy &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; shampoo comes out just buy this one as it the best.</li>
            <li> Since it lists itself as also a bodywash on the bottle (not that many other shampoos are not, or body washes cannot serve as a shampoo) it does not irritate my skin as much as other salon hair products. If it is still not good enough for you, seek unscented specialty products. Baby shampoo and Eucerin washes are very good, yet neither would I recommend for very processed hair. If your hair needs a better shampoo, again, there are many products, however this is my favorite. I use a Redkin conditioner for my processed hair.</li>
            <li> I suspect all the reviews about this product. Can&#x27;t complain, but my hair becomes worse after i use this product.</li>
            <li> The pic of the bottle is what i ordered.But,not what i received!I like what i like and don&#x27;t like surprises on my orders!Makes me feel like they sent me something that doesn&#x27;t sell well for them!</li>
            <li> I first tried this shampoo when a local salon had a sale on litre sized bottles. It wasn&#x27;t the one I had originally set to buy, but they didn&#x27;t have what I wanted so I went with this. I am so glad I did! You don&#x27;t have to use much shampoo so the bottle lasts forever, becoming cheaper, in my opinion, than even the basic brands you buy at the department stores. My hair feels soft and clean. I have yet to find a shampoo I like more than this one.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on Paul Mitchell if it&#x27;s not from a salon.  I bought this and realized quickly it is old!  VERY OLD!!!  It smells so bad.  I have used this conditioner in the past (bought from a salon) and it smelled great!  This stuff smells awful.  It still works well, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but it does smell.  I then thought to look at the bottom of the bottle.  I believe it expired in September 2011.  I bought it in October 2012.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell products in the past and loved the way it made my hair feel so clean.  This product however left my hai feeling greasy and weighted down.</li>
            <li> Clarifies, cleanses, and does not add weight with heavy conditioners. Great as body wash also. I highly recommend for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle because I&#x27;d recently bought Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger and fell in LOVE with the way the Wild Ginger made my hair feel.  I figured since it was still Paul Mitchell and still Awapuhi it would have the same affect on my hair.  It&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s not fantastic and it definitely isn&#x27;t the same.  But if you want to save yourself some money and buy this giant bottle instead, I&#x27;d recommend it.  It still gets my hair clean and moisturized, but it&#x27;s not quite up to the standard of the Wild Ginger.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this item. I&#x27;m on my tenth bottle or something like that. There is one strange problem with it however. The lettering comes off the bottle so after a while you got a bunch black letters stuck around the base of this bottle.</li>
            <li> After looking about and asking about shampoos, I decided on the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo, 33.8 Ounce.  This is a very nice choice, and does what it is supposed to do.  It leaves my hair feeling clean, and there is no toxic &#x27;hair dresser&#x27; smell after my shampoo.  A very nice product.  I believe I have finally found what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> For the value, this is an excellent product to buy.  My mother has been a hairdresser for 45+ years and used this product in our family for many, many years.  When I set out on my own I continued to use this product.  I have a refillable container so this product was exactly what I was looking for.  It arrived quickly and well wrapped for protection.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It makes your hair much softer. Has a nice but natural and subtle scent. You can use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t destroy your hair.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this shampoo but couldn&#x27;t find it at the stores anymore. Bought it for work and the gym.</li>
            <li> VERY COOL. THIS IS THE ONLY SHAMPOO I USE ON MY HEAD. IT LATHERS WELL AND HAS NO FUNNY FRUITY SMELLS. JUST SMELLS CLEAN.</li>
            <li> These 2 bottles that I purchased through amazon.com were not the real thing!  The color and consistency of the shampoo were not the same as the actual product that I have purchased for years.  The shampoo, or whatever it is, left a film on my hair that made it super greasy.  Yuck! Total sham.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft any hydrated. I&#x27;ve been using this for years for my thin, flat hair. It&#x27;s not a heavy shampoo so it feels weightless on my hair. It&#x27;s also a great everyday and clarifying shampoo. MULTI-USE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I have very fine hair that tends to get oily very fast. This is a great daily shampoo that really does clean and make your hair look great!</li>
            <li> So, this is like sooooo expensive, but all the awapuhi stuff is my absolute favorite Paul Mitchel line. It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and shiny. Love.</li>
            <li> I brought this because I used a small sachet in the one of the hotels I was staying at and I did not had dandruff issue (lot of dandruff and itchiness) for a day which is a big thing for me so I brought this big bottle which did not work out for me. I don&#x27;t understand what was the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars only because it smells good and hair tenders smooth but should fight the basic thing I brought it for!</li>
            <li> I have fine, normal hair and this shampoo did not work well at all! It dried out my hair and made it look dead. I now use it as body wash</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and loves it</li>
            <li> This is the worse company that I have ever shop in my whole life.If you&lt;br /&gt;want to waste your money, then you can buy there.</li>
            <li> I have always gotten the product in a smaller bottle but I like how I have the bigger bottle know. It will last me for a while.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really does a deep cleanse on your hair. I have a sensitive scalp and if I used it too much it irritates it because it strips your scalp of the oils it needs. It removes build up so I use it once every few weeks to keep the build up off.</li>
