            <li>My eyes area looks so much better!  </li>
            <li>It seemed to be a great moisturizer and my fine lines did disappear.</li>
            <li>At the beginning, it seemed to work, it has a nice texture, the eye area looked plumped.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t even know how to explain how shiseido dries.</li>
            <li>I do believe that my eye area has been getting better from day 1.</li>
            <li>I think everyone should try it and see how it works. :-)</li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>Stays on nicely, blocks light, and no pressure on eyelids.</li>
            <li>On top of that there is no indication you even have anything on your eyes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never found a better eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it and $30 cheaper than Dillards</li>

            <li>I have red many great reviews about it, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled the first couple of days I used it.</li>
            <li>I repeated that experiment again and confirmed that irritation, so I threw the rest away.</li>
            <li>and they have a fabulous return policy.</li>
            <li>This is richer than the Future Solution night cream, and works great all over the face.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine told me she uses Shiseido eye cream religiously (and she looks great).</li>
            <li>It smells good, it softens the skin, but there are reasons why it&#x27;s still waiting to be patented: it&#x27;s another useless product promisisng wonderful things that do not happen...</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I would never buy this again, luckily I bought it at Nordstrom</li>
            <li>First purchase was from Macy&#x27;s after a free sample.  </li>
            <li>Not as great as expected.maybe too heavy to absorbef.seems to make eye area puffy for me</li>
            <li>It really made a huge difference in evening out my under eye area.  </li>
            <li>I started to develop redness after more use, developed a couple milia and then stopped using it</li>
            <li>It used to be a good quality product that really worked for my under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x60;t dry after like many other products do, creating more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I really like it I have gotta say.</li>
            <li>an seems to actually lighten the skin, not just cover it with a light</li>
            <li>It moisturizes the eye area perfectly and the small lines around the eyes are almost instantly less visible.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But most importantly, one jar 0.5 oz (15ml) lasted me about 2.5 mo., while other eye creams with the same amount lasted only 1-1.5 mo.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work that well for dark circles, but my fine lines are so diminished, I look 20 again.  </li>
            <li>It is very thick but sinks in beautifully.</li>
            <li>it is very thick, creamy and luxurious - I love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not thinking about finding a different one, because it is really effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You might need a few extra dabs to get excess off if you used too much, but excess is removed easily with a fingertip while the necessary amount clings to skin through everything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing if you have dry skin like me</li>
            <li>The rep told me that I did not need to use the &#x27;scooper&#x27; for each use, and that it would make the lotion last much longer - 6 months after daily usage.  </li>
            <li>Most creams I&#x27;ve used must be applied extremely evenly and will still clump up a little bit.</li>
            <li>It is a little tough to smooth in, so I lightly pat it around my eye area before smoothing in.</li>
            <li>and it has helped me to get rid of my crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes completely with 2x daily use.</li>
            <li>Directly after using it my eyes look naturally brighter with almost completely eliminated dark circles.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really help with the dark circles, or puffiness, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after I recommend finding a different product.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive so sometimes expensive eye creams end up making my eye feel allergic; this cream goes a long way and is very rich without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>It seems to get rid of fine lines by &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; with irritating ingredients.&lt;br</li>

            <li> However, it did nothing for my very fine lines (except make them worse), nothing for my dark circles and nothing for melasma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Shiseido products in the past and found them to be extraordinary.</li>
            <li> My typical response to not seeing immediate results would be to glob it on to cover up my circles, which inevitably led to them getting worse or not getting any better.</li>
            <li> first saw improvement after about 2 months use, but I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I haven&#x60;t been using this cream for very long, so I will have to update later.</li>
            <li> But for some reason last 6 months I noticed my dark circles are coming back eventough</li>
            <li> The results are both immediate and long term.</li>
            <li> Shiseido is the only eye cream that I have found myself constantly using less.</li>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical purchasing this at this price, but I have to say it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> so it may take longer for other people.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands before, but over time those other brands either made my skin irritated and/or have not helped smoothing out my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a positive note, yes it is very thick and you will use very little.</li>
            <li> I really like this but way too expensive to keep buying.</li>
            <li> Will keep trying others at less cost.</li>
            <li> It was like a balloon inflating and then deflating into a crinkly mess.</li>
            <li> waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use the cream everyday.</li>
            <li> I have serious dark under eye circles and have been searching for a cream the would help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream exclusively the past 2 years</li>
            <li> However, after a few days, I noticed that my lines would look worse when the effect wore off.</li>
            <li> this product is very expensive and provides no better results than my over the counter eye cream.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> A jar lasts about 9-10 months for me and even though it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> this is a fake?</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as great as expected.maybe too heavy to absorbef.seems to make eye area puffy for me</li>
            <li> It works just it says it does. It made the wrinkles in the corner fade, the darkness under  my eyes fade and I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> At the beginning, it seemed to work, it has a nice texture, the eye area looked plumped. But after I used it for a month or so, I noticed the pores on my eyelids were clogged!! My eyes also felt irritated when I woke up in the morning. I stopped using it for a week and the irritation went away. I repeated that experiment again and confirmed that irritation, so I threw the rest away.</li>
            <li> it is very thick, creamy and luxurious - I love it!  Very moisturizing if you have dry skin like me</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m not impressed. I tried this product for weeks and it did nothing but irritate my skin. It seems to get rid of fine lines by &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; with irritating ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled the first couple of days I used it. It seemed to be a great moisturizer and my fine lines did disappear. However, after a few days, I noticed that my lines would look worse when the effect wore off. It was like a balloon inflating and then deflating into a crinkly mess. I started to develop redness after more use, developed a couple milia and then stopped using it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, yes it is very thick and you will use very little. It does go on well under makeup. However, it did nothing for my very fine lines (except make them worse), nothing for my dark circles and nothing for melasma. I would never buy this again, luckily I bought it at Nordstrom and they have a fabulous return policy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream exclusively the past 2 years and it has helped me to get rid of my crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes completely with 2x daily use. It doesn&#x27;t really help with the dark circles, or puffiness, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after I recommend finding a different product. A jar lasts about 9-10 months for me and even though it&#x27;s expensive I&#x27;m not thinking about finding a different one, because it is really effective.&lt;br /&gt;I first saw improvement after about 2 months use, but I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s so it may take longer for other people.  I have tried other brands before, but over time those other brands either made my skin irritated and/or have not helped smoothing out my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( Nivea, L&#x27;Oreal, Estee Lauder, Clinique, Neutrogena, Garnier, Olay, Origins all ended up in the trash )</li>
            <li> I haven&#x60;t been using this cream for very long, so I will have to update later. This is the most expensive eye cream I have ever bought, thinking if this wouldn&#x60;t work, nothing will. I have red many great reviews about it, so I bought it. I really like it I have gotta say. It is very thick but sinks in beautifully. It doesn&#x60;t dry after like many other products do, creating more wrinkles. It moisturizes the eye area perfectly and the small lines around the eyes are almost instantly less visible. I do believe that my eye area has been getting better from day 1. I think everyone should try it and see how it works. :-)</li>
            <li> I really like this but way too expensive to keep buying. Will keep trying others at less cost.</li>
            <li> Outstanding. Have bought several. Stays on nicely, blocks light, and no pressure on eyelids. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have shopped around for eye creams for years. I have serious dark under eye circles and have been searching for a cream the would help. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have the patience many people do. My typical response to not seeing immediate results would be to glob it on to cover up my circles, which inevitably led to them getting worse or not getting any better. Shiseido is the only eye cream that I have found myself constantly using less. It is a little tough to smooth in, so I lightly pat it around my eye area before smoothing in. I have never used a better eye cream, Ive used some great ones but nothing compares to this. The results are both immediate and long term. Directly after using it my eyes look naturally brighter with almost completely eliminated dark circles. On top of that there is no indication you even have anything on your eyes. Most creams I&#x27;ve used must be applied extremely evenly and will still clump up a little bit. Once this has been applied evenly it will soak in perfectly. You might need a few extra dabs to get excess off if you used too much, but excess is removed easily with a fingertip while the necessary amount clings to skin through everything.&lt;br /&gt;I notice that with a lot of eye creams you might get results as it sits there, but once it dries the effects are dramatically different. I honestly don&#x27;t even know how to explain how shiseido dries. It rests in to your eye an seems to actually lighten the skin, not just cover it with a light cream.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only eye cream I will ever buy</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical purchasing this at this price, but I have to say it was well worth it.  The jar lasts for months (my last one lasted about 5 months).  It really made a huge difference in evening out my under eye area.  It doesn&#x27;t work that well for dark circles, but my fine lines are so diminished, I look 20 again.  Love this!</li>
            <li> this product is very expensive and provides no better results than my over the counter eye cream.  waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Shiseido still makes this product but I&#x27;ve never found a better eye cream.  My skin is sensitive so sometimes expensive eye creams end up making my eye feel allergic; this cream goes a long way and is very rich without being greasy.  I love that it also helps treat the aging lip crinkles!</li>
            <li> First purchase was from Macy&#x27;s after a free sample.  The rep told me that I did not need to use the &#x27;scooper&#x27; for each use, and that it would make the lotion last much longer - 6 months after daily usage.  This stuff is great!  My eyes area looks so much better!  I will buy this product forever.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> 5 gold stars. Well packed and well received. Love this product. Been using it for years</li>
            <li> Love it and $30 cheaper than Dillards</li>
            <li> It smells good, it softens the skin, but there are reasons why it&#x27;s still waiting to be patented: it&#x27;s another useless product promisisng wonderful things that do not happen...</li>
            <li> Great product! But most importantly, one jar 0.5 oz (15ml) lasted me about 2.5 mo., while other eye creams with the same amount lasted only 1-1.5 mo. It has a bit thicker consistency than most eye creams.</li>
            <li> I use it for the whole face and it works great. I&#x27;m in the midwest where the weather is very dry in the winter. This is richer than the Future Solution night cream, and works great all over the face. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last 6 years. It used to be a good quality product that really worked for my under eye dark circles. But for some reason last 6 months I noticed my dark circles are coming back eventough I use the cream everyday. I wonder if they changed the chemistry of the product. Considering switching to another eye cream.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this product. A friend of mine told me she uses Shiseido eye cream religiously (and she looks great). My experience has been that after application, it sits on top of my skin looking pasty until I remove it. I haven&#x27;t seen any benefit. I&#x27;ve used other Shiseido products in the past and found them to be extraordinary. Not the case here. Is it possible this is a fake?</li>
