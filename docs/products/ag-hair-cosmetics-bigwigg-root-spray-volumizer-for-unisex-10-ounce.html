            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>MY FINE HAIR BODY YET DOESN&#x27;T BUILD UP PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of root volumizers for my fine wavy hair....</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and this gives me the added lift that I need.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, this product gives my hair volum,without feeling like I need to shampoo.</li>
            <li>Gives my fine hair body and creates volume to my &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>Thank  you so much!!!</li>
            <li>a great product I think we should be able to writ as little or as less as we want if we are writing a review you should be happy I am even doing it</li>
            <li>Gave it 4 worthy attempts - NADA.  </li>
            <li>Bigwigg gives my hair great volume without making it greasy and there is no strong smell.</li>
            <li>You spray it on your roots right out of the shower</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t sink into my scalp, but instead stays right at the root where it&#x27;s sprayed.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair extreme volume with great look at the same moment.</li>
            <li>but this certainly comes close.</li>
            <li>I certainly gave this product a try</li>
            <li>Her stylist turned her onto this and the price at amazon was very competitive compared to a salon price..</li>
            <li>Really adds a ton of volume</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>(-as in very).  </li>
            <li>This product is a real NO GO.</li>
            <li>IF you really want a product that works, try NEXUS volumizer or AVEDA volumizer products (-not the new one</li>
            <li>It gives my roots just enough volume so my hair isn&#x27;t flat on top.</li>
            <li>I like it a little better than redken for the way it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li>REALLY SURPRISED after seeing what was written!</li>
            <li>This product is definitely comparable to redken&#x27;s guts which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>As my hair has gotten longer, I&#x27;ve had a hard time keeping volume in the top of my hair, but this has solved that problem.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try, you will be surprised.</li>
            <li>and you get major volume after blow drying.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave my fine, thick hair feeling like it has a ton of product in it.</li>
            <li>( Makes my fine straight hair look a little oily, after a few hours. )</li>
            <li>but for someone with hair fine and thin like mine?  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use too much, just a little on the roots and rub it into  the surrounding area.</li>

            <li> While AG Hair Cosmetics Bigwigg Root Spray Volumizer did give some volume to my hair, it unfortunately also made it somewhat stiff and frizzy. Of course I have very thin hair, so maybe it works better on thicker hair, but then what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> Good product, does what it says.</li>
            <li> This is the best root volumizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I used to use AG products for a long time but then stopped. After I tried different brands I see that AG is the best. It gives my hair extreme volume with great look at the same moment. Simply love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best root volumizer I have ever used. My friend (and hair stylist!) uses it on me when I go to her salon and I finally bought it myself and I just love it. You spray it on your roots right out of the shower and you get major volume after blow drying. Doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue (which I&#x27;m usually prone to). I also love the AG fastfood leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> LIKE IT -GIVES MY FINE HAIR BODY YET DOESN&#x27;T BUILD UP PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;ON MY HAIR.  WILL ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> a great product I think we should be able to writ as little or as less as we want if we are writing a review you should be happy I am even doing it</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of this product from a friend and I loved it.  I was unable to find this product locally,so I decided to try on-line.  Was so happy to find it and Amazon carried it at a good price. Thank  you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great, hair looks great! Yes, I am very impressed with this root volumizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while now and it&#x27;s part of my daily &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;, now.</li>
            <li> My wife hates how flat her thin hair lays on her head. This works great to give her fullness. Her stylist turned her onto this and the price at amazon was very competitive compared to a salon price..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do fix my hair without this product. It gives my roots just enough volume so my hair isn&#x27;t flat on top.</li>
            <li> Works great, but does seem to leave to much of a shine on my hair. ( Makes my fine straight hair look a little oily, after a few hours. )</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of root volumizers for my fine wavy hair....most don&#x27;t do much, but this stuff is great.  It sprays on almost like a mousse--the formula puffs up after spraying--so it doesn&#x27;t sink into my scalp, but instead stays right at the root where it&#x27;s sprayed.  Then I run my fingers through the roots to distribute it.  Really adds a ton of volume and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  Plus, it tames flyaways and fuzziness.  This is a must-have product for me, and the answer to most of my bad hair days.  It also counteracts greasiness on days when I can&#x27;t shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this root volumizer. I have baby fine hair and this gives me the added lift that I need.  There are no miracles in hair&lt;br /&gt;care, but this certainly comes close.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, this product gives my hair volum,without feeling like I need to shampoo. Give it a try, you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while.  You can&#x27;t use too much, just a little on the roots and rub it into  the surrounding area.</li>
            <li> As my hair has gotten longer, I&#x27;ve had a hard time keeping volume in the top of my hair, but this has solved that problem.  I use it with Spray Body for day-to-day hair.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair feel so much thicker and fuller and has a wonderful scent! I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years-love it! Gives my fine hair body and creates volume to my &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> Bigwigg gives my hair great volume without making it greasy and there is no strong smell. Recommend this hair product.</li>
            <li> I have used every volumizing product out there.  This is by far the best for follicularly challenged women.  The vendor was excellent.  I had the product in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I certainly gave this product a try after RAVE review(s) read (seriously?!)  I found it to be less than beneficial for my fine and thin hair.  Gave it 4 worthy attempts - NADA.  REALLY SURPRISED after seeing what was written! (-as in very).  IF you really want a product that works, try NEXUS volumizer or AVEDA volumizer products (-not the new one Invati...wayyyyyy over \\&quot;hyped\\&quot; just their regular volumizer you spray on after washing your hair then blow dry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AG is a huge disappointment, again, I can&#x27;t speak for these other reviews - but for someone with hair fine and thin like mine?  This product is a real NO GO.</li>
