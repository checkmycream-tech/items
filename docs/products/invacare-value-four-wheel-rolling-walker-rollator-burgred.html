            <li>The brakes work great and it is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I love that about it.      </li>
            <li>It gives her much more mobility than she had before.</li>
            <li>The Invacare Value Four Wheel Rolling Walker Rollator Burg/Red is a wonderful assistant to help patients get back on their feet.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding.  </li>
            <li>The item is just excellent for my needs and current level of ability.</li>
            <li>The best recommendation I can make for this product is that I have just ordered that second one.  </li>
            <li>Service was excellent; arrived just several days after it was ordered.    </li>
            <li>Overall, a great buy -- and service to match!</li>
            <li>I am the father of 4 wonderful young-ones, the two boys are eight and thirteen and my two girls are ages Twelve and Ten.  </li>
            <li>If I bought one at the store thru my insurance it would have cost more.</li>
            <li>would feel quite safe--</li>
            <li>OK...</li>
            <li>THIS LIL MACHINE HAS BROUGHT MUCH JOY TO THIS 84 YEAR KID, THANKS A MILLION...</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s able to take it and use it everywhere.  </li>
            <li>She is able to get around much better than before</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I would love to have one!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>this is the BEST walker ever!We needed an extra rolling walker to keep in the car for outings.</li>
            <li>We also got the cup holder which they love.  </li>
            <li>but she is so glad she has one to help her in the house.</li>
            <li>and she has found many uses for it</li>
            <li>and she is more stable when walking from room to room with things.  </li>
            <li>Seems like most pricing out there is a bit</li>
            <li>The walker was everything that said to be and more.</li>
            <li>Most have a wire basket.  </li>
            <li>Nice and light weight for me to get in and out of the car for my husband.  </li>
            <li>I also like the security of her being able to keep her purse in the compartment below.</li>
            <li>i will recommend this to those who have a hardtime walking wo a cane and have more security on walking around.</li>
            <li>i sure love this rollator but not for myself</li>
            <li>The four wheeled walker is so much better than the 2  wheeler with 2 tennis balls on the front.  </li>
            <li>I researched all the walkers until I found one that met her requirements, then read ALL the comments, questions and reviews to make sure I was ordering the correct item.  </li>
            <li>and she is walking better.  </li>
            <li>I have no regreats and am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to lift and store!  </li>
            <li>She is able to collaspe and expand the walker easily to take in the car and use for shopping.</li>
            <li>It weighs more than my others so it is not that easy to swing into a car.</li>
            <li>He wanted one for in the house and one to keep in the van, The price sure made it easy.</li>
            <li>My grandmother is a VERY picky woman and I dreaded this purchase thinking nothing would really make her happy, but she has nothing but praise for this walker!  </li>
            <li>importantly, my Mom feels safe when using it.</li>
            <li>Moms a talker, now she can sit and talk (and rest) in comfort, she says the walker is more comfortable than some chairs.</li>
            <li>It gives me great pleasure to know that your company cares that much about the customer that you would keep me informed about the shippment and get it to her so quickly.  </li>
            <li>She stated that this rollator felt very sturdy, is very easy for her to maneuver and the seat is perfect to sit for brief periods.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fold up.  </li>
            <li>Went together easily without tools.</li>
            <li>The cloth basket will hold a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Easy communication with the seller.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So easy to manuver Basically, comes out of the box assembled.</li>
            <li>Folds easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and folds up to but in the car.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s collapsable and easily transported in a car.</li>
            <li>easy to assemble out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I have seen lots of other rollators, but Invacare Rollator is the most beautiful, convenient, comfortable and cheapest around!</li>
            <li>rveryone is happy-  very fast dekivery thanks from grandma</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to move about.  </li>
            <li>The seat is surprisingly comfortable and the walker rolls easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, easy to handle and push.</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast and was very easy to put together.  </li>
            <li>He walks securely and loves the stability he has with this</li>
            <li>Thanks, Loving Daughter</li>
            <li>The light construction that makes it a fantastic walker gives one pause about trusting it to actually bear one&#x27;s weight for any great distance while seated.  </li>
            <li>This item came as stated in great shape and in a short time as told.</li>
            <li>Light.  </li>
            <li>She uses it everywhere and sits on the comfortable seat when she needs a rest.</li>
            <li>It attaches in front of the seat, which isn&#x27;t as secure as sitting under the seat.  </li>
            <li>She greatly prefers it to a standard walker.  </li>
            <li>I would have bought the aqua rollator, but there was no inventory available in that color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Found this for a great deal, and the quality is 2nd to none.</li>
            <li>Folds nicely to easily fit in the front seat of my Honda Civic coupe</li>
            <li>BUT, It won&#x27;t fit in the trunk.</li>
            <li>My problem is that it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>However - after several weeks - its been great and no mishaps.</li>
            <li>It is very stable and makes me able to do many things.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S MY NUMBER TWO LOVE AFTER MY WONDERFULL LIVE IN LADY LOVE....</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I ORIGINALLY REVIEWED.</li>
            <li>Useful!</li>
            <li>She loves that she is able to walk a bit faster with her hot wheels.  </li>
            <li>walker was such a great value, I figured it was worth</li>
            <li>This one had the soft seat and a basket, plus it came in nice colors.  </li>
            <li>My mother in law loved this while living here doing laps in the back yard.</li>
            <li>My wife who needed a better walker was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to get around with rollator.</li>
            <li>I use the rollator when I go to the super market.  </li>
            <li>A high-quality product, shipped well and quickly.</li>
            <li>walker arrived quickly...</li>
            <li>Stores quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is almost perfect; the only improvement would have been the use of more high grade metal in its makeup to provide that confidence of strength...</li>
            <li>The basket under the seat is pretty cool though, but that was the only good thing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely FIVE STARS!!</li>
            <li>and the seat is great for a little rest during his marathons to the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>They fit through the hallways at home and make going outdoors so much easier.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, she liked it better than her old one (which we paid like $149 way back in 2004.)  </li>
            <li>but it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The basket is nice to hold my phone and talking clock, and the seat is handy especially if I run out of energy going from one room to the next.</li>
            <li>I dont think the pad is worth the $50 difference in price, so</li>
            <li>I bought this four wheel rolling walker for my grandma and it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This is worth</li>
            <li>I bought the first for use after my recent hip replacement and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>just right for me.</li>
            <li>I was willing to overlook that because the blue was a nice color.</li>
            <li>It is easy to set up &amp; was light enough for a frail person to handle.  </li>
            <li>At first I was concerned that this was too big or too high for her, but I just couldn&#x27;t resist the good price advertised.  </li>
            <li>This walker is light, it was easy to assemble, and the shade of red is \\&quot;pretty, but not to flashy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Due to a car accident she has lost most of the use in her right foot, a regular walker was not sturdy enough, but she love this, says she is able to get around so much better now.</li>
            <li>The item was easy to assemble for someone like me who is 66 years old and have arthritis on her hands.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to assemble just the handle bars and back rest.</li>
            <li>However, I cannot convey it (or much else either -- not the rollator&#x27;s fault!)</li>
            <li>To save the lives of as many people as possible!  </li>
            <li>My first thought was that it was used.  </li>
            <li>Prefer to use a VA supplied Dolomite unit with larger tires and better brakes.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I REALLY LIKE IT!  </li>
            <li>So be aware of the difference.  </li>
            <li>Amazon shipped supper fast!</li>
            <li>I. have seen this same item in stores for much more money.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this walker!</li>
            <li>She refused it at first.</li>
            <li>I bought red (her favorite color)</li>
            <li>They both have visited at different times and in both cases they love it.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Half the price of the local drug store and very good quality.</li>
            <li>I got a large travel bag that hangs on the bars and can get a very large load of groceries in the travel bag when I need to.</li>
            <li>That said, I appreciated their willingess to stand behind their product: Good customer service!</li>
            <li>okay if you don&#x27;t have to sit for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li>She even puts her trash on the seat and takes it out to the garbage  easily because the wheels are big and work well on the dirt.  </li>
            <li>It is just strong enough to support me as I walk.  </li>
            <li>When trekking around the Mayo Clinic, I have found this small &#x27;resting&#x27; wing exceptionally helpful.  </li>
            <li>My need was for a light weight 4-wheel walker to use around the house, but strong enough for outside walking.    </li>
            <li>very high quality product--well made and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s narrow enough to use in my home and works great on the carpet.</li>
            <li>It also provides a comfortable seat for resting before heading back.</li>
            <li>Thanks Home Health.</li>
            <li>SEE ADDITIONAL NOTE AT END OF REVIEW, THANKS.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about walkers</li>
            <li>She was really in need of this product.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>They make it so much easier and faster to get around.  </li>
            <li>But, she likes it too much to part with it.  </li>
            <li>The walker arrived much quicker than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Really fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The stroller handles the bag very well.</li>
            <li>This was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Price was reasonable too.  </li>
            <li>It is very light-weight but very sturdy and folds up to take in the car (or on an airplane).  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and the color is so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than the walker I had that didn&#x27;t have wheels.  </li>
            <li>It makes me very mobile.</li>
            <li>The ease of assembly from the box was much appreciated.</li>
            <li>told her it was really mine, just loaning it to her.</li>
            <li>Now she wants decals on it</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this walker.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The Rollator is much easier for her</li>
            <li>Again, I was willing to overlook that because it was one near the floor.</li>
            <li>Now I can safely do these things and sit down If I get too dizzy.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t have this capacity, the more traditional aluminum fold out (with only 2 wheels on 4 corners)</li>
            <li>It gives her the stability she needs to move about, particularly in public, while allowing her a place to catch a quick rest.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s older now and is in need of a walker.  </li>
            <li>However, people who own rollators have all told me that bigger wheels are better if you like to go over uneven terrain like loose gravel or grass.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>The walker is sturdy and well made, but the seat was just way too high for her.  </li>
            <li>Just adjust handles to desired high.</li>
            <li>But due to the light weight I don&#x27;t think I would want to see him use it if he were much over 200 lbs.  </li>
            <li>I feel so safe walking with my sturdy little cadillac.</li>
            <li>Works better than the little grocery cart I have.</li>
            <li>Wow, it was shipped to her so fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to maneuver and small enough to fit through the doorways in my home.</li>
            <li>I managed to snag the last model of a Drive brand with 8\\&quot; wheels for just $10 more, and instead of a wire basket that pens and small items can fall out of, the Drive  model has a zip-close saddle bag -- also useful for CONCEALING a wallet, keys, pill bottles, or femme-care products.  </li>
            <li>They assured me that it was new.</li>
            <li>This will provide her with a new ability to take walks without fear of stumbling or falling.  </li>
            <li>This one was a little high to sit on easily.  </li>
            <li>so much more than I had expected, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>The walker is the same high quality as others costing 2-3 x as much.  </li>
            <li>He built his home in Jamestown North Dakota back in 1955, I spent many summers here from the time I was an infant until just before I was married in 1997 at the courthouse in Grafton North Dakota, knowing it would be extremely therapeutic for my memory.   </li>
            <li>Also, PADDED seats are better than hard, and DO splurge for a cup-holder that clips to the rungs.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 89 year old mother and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>So it seemed reasonable, especially at the price, to have one at either end of the stairwell.  </li>
            <li>I have very severe back problems.</li>
            <li>This item came ready to deploy, with the only assembly being the handlebars, which required 2 included screws and no tools.  </li>
            <li>I met up with an old friend from collage &amp; one thing led to another...!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 95 year old father who came to visit over Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I bought this walker for my 85 year old aunt who has difficulty walking.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I really have is that the seat is not padded like the one I purchased two years ago for $125.</li>
            <li>My 88 year old mom loves it.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t get too much can get several groceries items in it.</li>
            <li>And he just complained even more.</li>
            <li>dad&#x27;s using his old one</li>
            <li>My 87 year old mother did NOT want a walker.  </li>
            <li>Bought the roller for my 91 year old mother.</li>
            <li>This was bought to replace the old beaten up one he had.  </li>
            <li>A very usefull product for some time after release following hip surgery.</li>
            <li>At the rehab facility they tried to get me to use a similar but obviously much inferior rolling walker.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly to walk down a long hall from the front entrance to my condo.</li>
            <li>It had very little assembly which makes it easy for anyone.</li>
            <li>The assembly directions were poor, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>She loves how easy it is to push and loves the seat with the small compartment to carry things.  </li>
            <li>I had paid over $40 more for similar walkers for my parents in the past.  </li>
            <li>This rollator is sturdy indeed (weight limit 300 pounds), has enough space in the seat for my \\&quot;seat\\&quot;, collapses easily by raising the seat with one hand, and is lightweight enough for me to lift into my car, despite stenosis, scoliosis, and assorted other issues.</li>
            <li>Package arrived as expected, well packaged, and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband wanted and it came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>It has made a major improvement in her mobility.    </li>
            <li>I think it may be a little too high for someone that is much shorter than me.</li>
            <li>Basket is large enough to hold multiple items, and is instantly removable.</li>
            <li>After my 90 year old mother who resists using a standard walker saw it, she wanted one herself.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this walker as a second for my 85 year old mother.</li>
            <li>Barely ant assembly.</li>
            <li>Pretty average.  </li>
            <li>The red color is great, giving just enough flavor from the usual grey or black of such devices.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the one my dad had previously this one was cheaply made and he complained about it when he first got it.</li>
            <li>A very steady walker, great braking capability, larger wheel base provides more stability--I find it more difficult walking behind however.</li>
            <li>It was neither too high nor too wide for my mom&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>Shipped ready to use except for handlebar, that installed in less that 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Have searched everywhere for larger pneumatic tires but evidently they are not available.</li>
            <li>She has had many falls over the past few years, so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love that about it.      </li>
            <li> It gives her much more mobility than she had before.</li>

            <li> The item is just excellent for my needs and current level of ability.</li>

            <li> I am the father of 4 wonderful young-ones, the two boys are eight and thirteen and my two girls are ages Twelve and Ten.  </li>
            <li> If I bought one at the store thru my insurance it would have cost more.</li>
            <li> would feel quite safe--</li>
            <li> OK...</li>
            <li> THIS LIL MACHINE HAS BROUGHT MUCH JOY TO THIS 84 YEAR KID, THANKS A MILLION...</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s able to take it and use it everywhere.  </li>
            <li> She is able to get around much better than before</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I would love to have one!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> this is the BEST walker ever!We needed an extra rolling walker to keep in the car for outings.</li>
            <li> We also got the cup holder which they love.  </li>
            <li> but she is so glad she has one to help her in the house.</li>
            <li> and she has found many uses for it</li>
            <li> and she is more stable when walking from room to room with things.  </li>
            <li> Seems like most pricing out there is a bit</li>
            <li> The walker was everything that said to be and more.</li>
            <li> Most have a wire basket.  </li>
            <li> Nice and light weight for me to get in and out of the car for my husband.  </li>
            <li> I also like the security of her being able to keep her purse in the compartment below.</li>
            <li> i will recommend this to those who have a hardtime walking wo a cane and have more security on walking around.</li>
            <li> i sure love this rollator but not for myself</li>
            <li> The four wheeled walker is so much better than the 2  wheeler with 2 tennis balls on the front.  </li>
            <li> I researched all the walkers until I found one that met her requirements, then read ALL the comments, questions and reviews to make sure I was ordering the correct item.  </li>
            <li> and she is walking better.  </li>
            <li> I have no regreats and am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to lift and store!  </li>
            <li> She is able to collaspe and expand the walker easily to take in the car and use for shopping.</li>
            <li> It weighs more than my others so it is not that easy to swing into a car.</li>
            <li> He wanted one for in the house and one to keep in the van, The price sure made it easy.</li>
            <li> My grandmother is a VERY picky woman and I dreaded this purchase thinking nothing would really make her happy, but she has nothing but praise for this walker!  </li>
            <li> importantly, my Mom feels safe when using it.</li>
            <li> Moms a talker, now she can sit and talk (and rest) in comfort, she says the walker is more comfortable than some chairs.</li>
            <li> It gives me great pleasure to know that your company cares that much about the customer that you would keep me informed about the shippment and get it to her so quickly.  </li>
            <li> She stated that this rollator felt very sturdy, is very easy for her to maneuver and the seat is perfect to sit for brief periods.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fold up.  </li>
            <li> Went together easily without tools.</li>
            <li> The cloth basket will hold a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Easy communication with the seller.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So easy to manuver Basically, comes out of the box assembled.</li>
            <li> Folds easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and folds up to but in the car.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s collapsable and easily transported in a car.</li>
            <li> easy to assemble out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I have seen lots of other rollators, but Invacare Rollator is the most beautiful, convenient, comfortable and cheapest around!</li>
            <li> rveryone is happy-  very fast dekivery thanks from grandma</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to move about.  </li>
            <li> The seat is surprisingly comfortable and the walker rolls easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, easy to handle and push.</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast and was very easy to put together.  </li>
            <li> He walks securely and loves the stability he has with this</li>
            <li> Thanks, Loving Daughter</li>
            <li> The light construction that makes it a fantastic walker gives one pause about trusting it to actually bear one&#x27;s weight for any great distance while seated.  </li>
            <li> This item came as stated in great shape and in a short time as told.</li>
            <li> Light.  </li>
            <li> She uses it everywhere and sits on the comfortable seat when she needs a rest.</li>
            <li> It attaches in front of the seat, which isn&#x27;t as secure as sitting under the seat.  </li>
            <li> She greatly prefers it to a standard walker.  </li>
            <li> I would have bought the aqua rollator, but there was no inventory available in that color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Found this for a great deal, and the quality is 2nd to none.</li>
            <li> Folds nicely to easily fit in the front seat of my Honda Civic coupe</li>
            <li> BUT, It won&#x27;t fit in the trunk.</li>
            <li> My problem is that it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> However - after several weeks - its been great and no mishaps.</li>
            <li> It is very stable and makes me able to do many things.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S MY NUMBER TWO LOVE AFTER MY WONDERFULL LIVE IN LADY LOVE....</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I ORIGINALLY REVIEWED.</li>
            <li> Useful!</li>
            <li> She loves that she is able to walk a bit faster with her hot wheels.  </li>
            <li> walker was such a great value, I figured it was worth</li>
            <li> This one had the soft seat and a basket, plus it came in nice colors.  </li>
            <li> My mother in law loved this while living here doing laps in the back yard.</li>
            <li> My wife who needed a better walker was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to get around with rollator.</li>
            <li> I use the rollator when I go to the super market.  </li>
            <li> A high-quality product, shipped well and quickly.</li>
            <li> walker arrived quickly...</li>
            <li> Stores quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is almost perfect; the only improvement would have been the use of more high grade metal in its makeup to provide that confidence of strength...</li>
            <li> The basket under the seat is pretty cool though, but that was the only good thing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely FIVE STARS!!</li>
            <li> and the seat is great for a little rest during his marathons to the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> They fit through the hallways at home and make going outdoors so much easier.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, she liked it better than her old one (which we paid like $149 way back in 2004.)  </li>
            <li> but it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The basket is nice to hold my phone and talking clock, and the seat is handy especially if I run out of energy going from one room to the next.</li>
            <li> I dont think the pad is worth the $50 difference in price, so</li>
            <li> I bought this four wheel rolling walker for my grandma and it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is worth</li>
            <li> I bought the first for use after my recent hip replacement and I loved it so much</li>
            <li> I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> just right for me.</li>
            <li> I was willing to overlook that because the blue was a nice color.</li>
            <li> It is easy to set up &amp; was light enough for a frail person to handle.  </li>
            <li> At first I was concerned that this was too big or too high for her, but I just couldn&#x27;t resist the good price advertised.  </li>
            <li> This walker is light, it was easy to assemble, and the shade of red is \\&quot;pretty, but not to flashy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Due to a car accident she has lost most of the use in her right foot, a regular walker was not sturdy enough, but she love this, says she is able to get around so much better now.</li>
            <li> The item was easy to assemble for someone like me who is 66 years old and have arthritis on her hands.</li>
            <li> It was super easy to assemble just the handle bars and back rest.</li>
            <li> However, I cannot convey it (or much else either -- not the rollator&#x27;s fault!)</li>
            <li> To save the lives of as many people as possible!  </li>
            <li> My first thought was that it was used.  </li>
            <li> Prefer to use a VA supplied Dolomite unit with larger tires and better brakes.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I REALLY LIKE IT!  </li>
            <li> So be aware of the difference.  </li>
            <li> Amazon shipped supper fast!</li>
            <li> I. have seen this same item in stores for much more money.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this walker!</li>
            <li> She refused it at first.</li>
            <li> I bought red (her favorite color)</li>
            <li> They both have visited at different times and in both cases they love it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the local drug store and very good quality.</li>
            <li> I got a large travel bag that hangs on the bars and can get a very large load of groceries in the travel bag when I need to.</li>
            <li> That said, I appreciated their willingess to stand behind their product: Good customer service!</li>
            <li> okay if you don&#x27;t have to sit for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> She even puts her trash on the seat and takes it out to the garbage  easily because the wheels are big and work well on the dirt.  </li>
            <li> It is just strong enough to support me as I walk.  </li>
            <li> When trekking around the Mayo Clinic, I have found this small &#x27;resting&#x27; wing exceptionally helpful.  </li>
            <li> My need was for a light weight 4-wheel walker to use around the house, but strong enough for outside walking.    </li>
            <li> very high quality product--well made and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s narrow enough to use in my home and works great on the carpet.</li>
            <li> It also provides a comfortable seat for resting before heading back.</li>
            <li> Thanks Home Health.</li>
            <li> SEE ADDITIONAL NOTE AT END OF REVIEW, THANKS.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about walkers</li>
            <li> She was really in need of this product.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> They make it so much easier and faster to get around.  </li>
            <li> But, she likes it too much to part with it.  </li>
            <li> The walker arrived much quicker than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Really fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The stroller handles the bag very well.</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Price was reasonable too.  </li>
            <li> It is very light-weight but very sturdy and folds up to take in the car (or on an airplane).  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and the color is so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than the walker I had that didn&#x27;t have wheels.  </li>
            <li> It makes me very mobile.</li>
            <li> The ease of assembly from the box was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> told her it was really mine, just loaning it to her.</li>
            <li> Now she wants decals on it</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this walker.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The Rollator is much easier for her</li>
            <li> Again, I was willing to overlook that because it was one near the floor.</li>
            <li> Now I can safely do these things and sit down If I get too dizzy.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t have this capacity, the more traditional aluminum fold out (with only 2 wheels on 4 corners)</li>
            <li> It gives her the stability she needs to move about, particularly in public, while allowing her a place to catch a quick rest.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s older now and is in need of a walker.  </li>
            <li> However, people who own rollators have all told me that bigger wheels are better if you like to go over uneven terrain like loose gravel or grass.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The walker is sturdy and well made, but the seat was just way too high for her.  </li>
            <li> Just adjust handles to desired high.</li>
            <li> But due to the light weight I don&#x27;t think I would want to see him use it if he were much over 200 lbs.  </li>
            <li> I feel so safe walking with my sturdy little cadillac.</li>
            <li> Works better than the little grocery cart I have.</li>
            <li> Wow, it was shipped to her so fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to maneuver and small enough to fit through the doorways in my home.</li>
            <li> I managed to snag the last model of a Drive brand with 8\\&quot; wheels for just $10 more, and instead of a wire basket that pens and small items can fall out of, the Drive  model has a zip-close saddle bag -- also useful for CONCEALING a wallet, keys, pill bottles, or femme-care products.  </li>
            <li> They assured me that it was new.</li>
            <li> This will provide her with a new ability to take walks without fear of stumbling or falling.  </li>
            <li> This one was a little high to sit on easily.  </li>
            <li> so much more than I had expected, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> The walker is the same high quality as others costing 2-3 x as much.  </li>
            <li> He built his home in Jamestown North Dakota back in 1955, I spent many summers here from the time I was an infant until just before I was married in 1997 at the courthouse in Grafton North Dakota, knowing it would be extremely therapeutic for my memory.   </li>
            <li> Also, PADDED seats are better than hard, and DO splurge for a cup-holder that clips to the rungs.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 89 year old mother and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> So it seemed reasonable, especially at the price, to have one at either end of the stairwell.  </li>
            <li> I have very severe back problems.</li>
            <li> This item came ready to deploy, with the only assembly being the handlebars, which required 2 included screws and no tools.  </li>
            <li> I met up with an old friend from collage &amp; one thing led to another...!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 95 year old father who came to visit over Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I bought this walker for my 85 year old aunt who has difficulty walking.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I really have is that the seat is not padded like the one I purchased two years ago for $125.</li>
            <li> My 88 year old mom loves it.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t get too much can get several groceries items in it.</li>
            <li> And he just complained even more.</li>
            <li> dad&#x27;s using his old one</li>
            <li> My 87 year old mother did NOT want a walker.  </li>
            <li> Bought the roller for my 91 year old mother.</li>
            <li> This was bought to replace the old beaten up one he had.  </li>
            <li> A very usefull product for some time after release following hip surgery.</li>
            <li> At the rehab facility they tried to get me to use a similar but obviously much inferior rolling walker.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly to walk down a long hall from the front entrance to my condo.</li>
            <li> It had very little assembly which makes it easy for anyone.</li>
            <li> The assembly directions were poor, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> She loves how easy it is to push and loves the seat with the small compartment to carry things.  </li>
            <li> I had paid over $40 more for similar walkers for my parents in the past.  </li>
            <li> This rollator is sturdy indeed (weight limit 300 pounds), has enough space in the seat for my \\&quot;seat\\&quot;, collapses easily by raising the seat with one hand, and is lightweight enough for me to lift into my car, despite stenosis, scoliosis, and assorted other issues.</li>
            <li> Package arrived as expected, well packaged, and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband wanted and it came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It has made a major improvement in her mobility.    </li>
            <li> I think it may be a little too high for someone that is much shorter than me.</li>
            <li> Basket is large enough to hold multiple items, and is instantly removable.</li>
            <li> After my 90 year old mother who resists using a standard walker saw it, she wanted one herself.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this walker as a second for my 85 year old mother.</li>
            <li> Barely ant assembly.</li>
            <li> Pretty average.  </li>
            <li> The red color is great, giving just enough flavor from the usual grey or black of such devices.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the one my dad had previously this one was cheaply made and he complained about it when he first got it.</li>
            <li> A very steady walker, great braking capability, larger wheel base provides more stability--I find it more difficult walking behind however.</li>
            <li> It was neither too high nor too wide for my mom&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> Shipped ready to use except for handlebar, that installed in less that 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Have searched everywhere for larger pneumatic tires but evidently they are not available.</li>
            <li> She has had many falls over the past few years, so</li>
            <li> Lightweight enough for me to &#x27;fold&#x27; and maneuver in and out of the rear end of my small Blazer, yet sturdy and large enough for me to convey myself and a modicum of &#x27;stuff&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am almost 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and the seat is a little high.</li>
            <li> Basic assembly was easy enough BUT one of the bolt covers was the WRONG SIZE.</li>
            <li> However, I did not use it very long for my total knee replacement because my physical therapist had me using one crutch about a week after my surgery.</li>
            <li> The basket is somewhat small, but the design of the seat is very convenient when I need to stop &amp; rest.</li>
            <li> Flying internationally, my parents were limited with luggage and didn&#x27;t want to bring Dad&#x27;s rolling walker.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because it is smaller than the first one he had.  </li>
            <li> I know Diana came up with that excuse to release herself of guilt.  </li>
            <li> This walker is a bit larger than I expected, but that is just a plus for me.  </li>
            <li> The purpose of the seat is not clear...</li>
            <li> The rest is the same as other rollators.</li>
            <li> After a single trip to the supermarket one of the FACTORY INSTALLED hinge bars ( which allow the walker to fold ) came loose.</li>
            <li> I ordered this walker for my 85 year old Mother who was having trouble walking without assistance.&lt;br /&gt;Since I knew little about this item, I went to Amazon to do some research.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have degenerative arthritis and have trouble walking, especially with \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; like my cameras and accessories.  </li>
            <li> Not a very glamorous</li>
            <li> I usually have my husband assemble all this sort of stuff, but I could actually do it myself.     </li>
            <li> It took seconds to assemble the hand rail and it was extremely sturdy.  </li>
            <li> BUT I WAS NOT AWARE IT WAS MADE IN CHINA</li>
            <li> other words</li>
            <li> One is for traveling and the other is for home.</li>
            <li> I was immediately in a two and one half  month coma, when I woke up</li>
            <li> I was unable to retrieve the screw due to the now VERY UNSTABLE walker, so I had to abandon it.</li>
            <li> The walker was delivered promptly, but with a hard plastic seat and an unattached  wire basket that must be removed before the walker can be folded and which falls out regularly.  </li>
            <li> up and down the stairs that lie between &#x27;home&#x27; and &#x27;out&#x27;.</li>
            <li> As I wheeled it down the hallway, folks asked &amp;#34;Where</li>
            <li> Mom rolls down the hall to the kitchen and uses the seat to sit at the table.  </li>
            <li> and she loves the basket where she can put her magazine or other little things to tote around.</li>
            <li> I had this thing together in less than five minutes and for me,that&#x27;s unheard of.</li>
            <li> it helped my leg heal a little quicker</li>
            <li> I could see that she was getting a little wobbly when walking and does have a cane that she uses when going out but won&#x27;t use in the house.</li>
            <li> Solid tires are small and not much good off pavement.</li>
            <li> The reason for this was that I utilize this rollator heavily at home, and also use it whenever I am &#x27;out and about&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Those are just a few things to consider when shopping for a rollator.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in just a few days and did not require tools for assembly.</li>
            <li> She had two firm requests - a padded seat, and a flexible fabric under the seat bag for carrying items.  </li>
            <li> To our new home in Casper Wyoming that we had bought and moved into one week prior to my tragic accident,  </li>
            <li> So I can set up a Trust to provide financial assistance to the other poor souls who have suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury &amp; their families!</li>
            <li> It was less expensive than at the big box stores.</li>
            <li> At 83 and after two-heart by-pass surgeries, she has a difficult time moving around and after her last walker was stolen, she desperately needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> (But with very little cushion).    </li>
            <li> The saving grace for me is how heavy it is NOT!  </li>
            <li> as a wheelchair, I am not sure that I would entrust it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I would not have bought such a poorly designed Car!    </li>
            <li> They gave me a small discount, which I didn&#x27;t ask for.</li>
            <li> but I was too lazy.</li>
            <li> (she is a church going women who sees the wrong shade of red as scandalous)...</li>
            <li> cuz i have small built</li>
            <li> I admit that I was trying to save some money by purchasing this item at Amazon rather that a legitimate health care supplier because I have a limited income, but if the items sold at Amazon could be DANGEROUS due to shoddy workmanship, then they SHOULD NOT be sold by ANYONE.  </li>
            <li> The seat is a marvel, just in case, she gets tired and needs to sit down</li>
            <li> It helps me walk, and it helps me do the things that are hard for me to do without it.  </li>
            <li> It has increased my mobility by at least 75 percent.  </li>
            <li> The basket allows me to carry things which, when only using a cane, was impossible.  </li>
            <li> Tough to beat the price.</li>
            <li> She is a bit unsteady on her feet and walks very slowly.  </li>
            <li> Now, she does not have to sit on window sills and fire hydrants when she is tired or in pain from her arthritis.  </li>
            <li> I was told I HAD TWO BROKEN FEMURS, TWO SHATTERED KNEECAPS,  </li>
            <li> A BROKEN FOOT  AND A TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury).  </li>
            <li> he loves it,especially the fact that he can sit on it when he gets to tired.</li>
            <li> The seat is thinly cushioned and some users will need to add a cushion for comfort.</li>
            <li> a chair to sit on when tired.</li>
            <li> I feel if I had not been so trusting of the false advertising that the RIO had \\&quot;A 5-Star-Crash-test-Rating\\</li>
            <li> Husband had a previous one that was stolen while in a Rehab center and missed it terribly.</li>
            <li> Since I am blind and tend to run into things, the rubber wheels keep from damaging furniture.</li>
            <li> Ill take this Invacare Value Roller any day.</li>
            <li> unfortunately we will all need one of these some day.</li>
            <li> Handgrips have a small sloping wing that just fits the pad of the hand at the base of the thumb.</li>
            <li> Mother was desperate for a walker, so she made do with this one while I looked for the one she wanted, but we both felt we had been deliberately misled.</li>
            <li> My one suggestion would be to make one for blind people with a sensor to keep from running into things - ha ha!</li>
            <li> The item shipped was THE WRONG COLOR !</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This walker is a great value.  I find it to be beyond expectation.</li>
            <li> She really loved it.  She had to take it to every doctor&#x27;s appointment to show it off.  She only got to use it for a week but it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I had this thing together in less than five minutes and for me,that&#x27;s unheard of. I usually have my husband assemble all this sort of stuff, but I could actually do it myself.     IT&#x27;S LIGHTWEIGHT.  I love that about it.      Good product.  Sturdy.  Good price. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my second rollator.  I bought the first for use after my recent hip replacement and I loved it so much I used it for gardening and for helping me lug my baggage around the airport. I have degenerative arthritis and have trouble walking, especially with \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; like my cameras and accessories.  It was so wonderful I offered it to my mother-in-law who was recovering from a hip fracture at 96.  She fell in love with it, too, and says she is doing great and has so much more freedom now, and she can rest if she needs to.  I found myself without my rollator, so I bought another.  This is a tool everyone could probably find a use for.  It helps me walk, and it helps me do the things that are hard for me to do without it.  It&#x27;s lightweight, too, so does not cause pain when I lift it into my car.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 89 year old mother and she loves it.  It gives her much more mobility than she had before.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I needed the walker for my mother during a recent visit.  It took seconds to assemble the hand rail and it was extremely sturdy.  I had paid over $40 more for similar walkers for my parents in the past.  I was very pleased with both the quality of the product and the price.</li>
            <li> The Invacare Value Four Wheel Rolling Walker Rollator Burg/Red is a wonderful assistant to help patients get back on their feet.  It also provides a comfortable seat for resting before heading back.</li>
            <li> so much more than I had expected, especially for the price!  Outstanding.  The saving grace for me is how heavy it is NOT!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I feel so safe walking with my sturdy little cadillac. I made the right choice.It was all assembled except for the handle bars, which took only 2 minutes to put on.</li>
            <li> I order the rollator walker that was shipped and sold by Home Health SuperStore on 7 Feb, 2012 with an estimated arrival date of 13 Feb 2012. Package arrived as expected, well packaged, and exactly what was ordered. Thanks Home Health.</li>
            <li> SEE ADDITIONAL NOTE AT END OF REVIEW, THANKS.  The item is just excellent for my needs and current level of ability. Lightweight enough for me to &#x27;fold&#x27; and maneuver in and out of the rear end of my small Blazer, yet sturdy and large enough for me to convey myself and a modicum of &#x27;stuff&#x27;. I just ordered a second one, in fact. The reason for this was that I utilize this rollator heavily at home, and also use it whenever I am &#x27;out and about&#x27;.  However, I cannot convey it (or much else either -- not the rollator&#x27;s fault!) up and down the stairs that lie between &#x27;home&#x27; and &#x27;out&#x27;. So it seemed reasonable, especially at the price, to have one at either end of the stairwell.  I have very severe back problems. I needed a sturdy, lightweight mobility aid. This rollator is sturdy indeed (weight limit 300 pounds), has enough space in the seat for my \\&quot;seat\\&quot;, collapses easily by raising the seat with one hand, and is lightweight enough for me to lift into my car, despite stenosis, scoliosis, and assorted other issues. Basket is large enough to hold multiple items, and is instantly removable. Handgrips have a small sloping wing that just fits the pad of the hand at the base of the thumb. When trekking around the Mayo Clinic, I have found this small &#x27;resting&#x27; wing exceptionally helpful.  The best recommendation I can make for this product is that I have just ordered that second one.  ADDITIONAL NOTE 1/4/2012 -- I see that my review has been attached by Amazon (?) to a similar product but the rollator now has a weight restriction of 225 pounds, not 300. THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I ORIGINALLY REVIEWED. Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> PARK AND RIDE!  Purchased this item for my father who has Parkinson&#x27;s.  He walks securely and loves the stability he has with this and the seat is great for a little rest during his marathons to the pharmacy.  I recently purchased another one for him to keep at my brother&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t know much about walkers but this was a hit!</li>
            <li> The Invacare Value Four Wheel Rolling Walker Rollator in Red.  Wow, it was shipped to her so fast and I thank you for that.  She was really in need of this product.  It gives me great pleasure to know that your company cares that much about the customer that you would keep me informed about the shippment and get it to her so quickly.  Now, she does not have to sit on window sills and fire hydrants when she is tired or in pain from her arthritis.  She loves the Color too.  Thanks, Loving Daughter</li>
            <li> This item came ready to deploy, with the only assembly being the handlebars, which required 2 included screws and no tools.  The red color is great, giving just enough flavor from the usual grey or black of such devices.  I got the unit because I have difficulty walking; with this device, I can literally zoom about the house or the yard, no longer stuck to the speed of a cane.  It is just strong enough to support me as I walk.  It is light and easy to move about.  The basket allows me to carry things which, when only using a cane, was impossible.  The purpose of the seat is not clear...as a wheelchair, I am not sure that I would entrust it.  The light construction that makes it a fantastic walker gives one pause about trusting it to actually bear one&#x27;s weight for any great distance while seated.  Overall, this is almost perfect; the only improvement would have been the use of more high grade metal in its makeup to provide that confidence of strength...but that would have increased the sales price...</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to lift and store!  Great for getting around when you need more than a cane for balance.  Has brakes and a seat so you can stop and rest wherever you are.</li>
            <li> Service was excellent; arrived just several days after it was ordered.    My need was for a light weight 4-wheel walker to use around the house, but strong enough for outside walking.    I got just what I wanted.  The basket is somewhat small, but the design of the seat is very convenient when I need to stop &amp; rest. (But with very little cushion).    Overall, a great buy -- and service to match!</li>
            <li> Really great price on this, here through Amazon.  However, people who own rollators have all told me that bigger wheels are better if you like to go over uneven terrain like loose gravel or grass.  I managed to snag the last model of a Drive brand with 8\\&quot; wheels for just $10 more, and instead of a wire basket that pens and small items can fall out of, the Drive  model has a zip-close saddle bag -- also useful for CONCEALING a wallet, keys, pill bottles, or femme-care products.  Those are just a few things to consider when shopping for a rollator.  Also, PADDED seats are better than hard, and DO splurge for a cup-holder that clips to the rungs.  You may also want a clip-on cane holder.</li>
            <li> This alker gave me the ability to have thanksgiving, over 1500 miles away from my home, to take my 4 kids to Denny&#x27;s.  On December eight two thousand and three, I was driving a RIO, Just northeast of Midwest Wyoming, I had a head-on collision, the airbag and seatbelt did not function. I was immediately in a two and one half  month coma, when I woke up I was told I HAD TWO BROKEN FEMURS, TWO SHATTERED KNEECAPS,  A BROKEN FOOT  AND A TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury).  I am the father of 4 wonderful young-ones, the two boys are eight and thirteen and my two girls are ages Twelve and Ten.  Their mother says I died in the accident and we finalized our divorce settlement on November 18 2008.  Because I guess I&#x27;m \\&quot;not the man she married.\\&quot;  I know Diana came up with that excuse to release herself of guilt.  She told me, when she flew in to Minneapolis to rent a U-Hall so she could load up a lot of ours &amp; our 4 kids belongings in Binford North Dakota so she could haul what only she thought had value.  To our new home in Casper Wyoming that we had bought and moved into one week prior to my tragic accident,  \\&quot;I had an affair.  I met up with an old friend from collage &amp; one thing led to another...!\\&quot;  I offered to forgive her.  She must not have loved me.  In our Divorce settlement I allowed her and my 4 kids to keep our home in Casper and I settled for our home in Binford, North Dakota.  Since the divorce I bought the home of my Grandfather. He built his home in Jamestown North Dakota back in 1955, I spent many summers here from the time I was an infant until just before I was married in 1997 at the courthouse in Grafton North Dakota, knowing it would be extremely therapeutic for my memory.   I feel if I had not been so trusting of the false advertising that the RIO had \\&quot;A 5-Star-Crash-test-Rating\\&quot; I would not have bought such a poorly designed Car!    ACTIII  I am trying to start another Trust that will Allow me to garnish support if it is GOD&#x27;s will to reach these two inspiringgoals!    Goal1.  To save the lives of as many people as possible!  By passing on my Testimony on to the world!    Goal2.  To obtain lots of donations to my GOD given Mission!  So I can set up a Trust to provide financial assistance to the other poor souls who have suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury &amp; their families! I will be delighted if you heed my advice and pass my testimony on to many, many others please pass my testimony to as many people as you can?  And ask them to pass it along to others also?

            <li> I bought this walker for my aging mother who struggles with back problems.  She did need some help with assembly. But she is very pleased with the quality and stable construction.  The ability to adjust the height is one of the features she has noted.  She is able to collaspe and expand the walker easily to take in the car and use for shopping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 95 year old father who came to visit over Christmas.  Flying internationally, my parents were limited with luggage and didn&#x27;t want to bring Dad&#x27;s rolling walker.  This Invacare rolling walker was perfect and easy to put together.  The price was excellent and with free shipping it was a great purchase.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this walker - it gives me more support than my cane did. It&#x27;s easy to maneuver and small enough to fit through the doorways in my home. Since I am blind and tend to run into things, the rubber wheels keep from damaging furniture. The basket is nice to hold my phone and talking clock, and the seat is handy especially if I run out of energy going from one room to the next. My one suggestion would be to make one for blind people with a sensor to keep from running into things - ha ha!</li>
            <li> This has been a great product for my Mom.  She uses it to get around the house now that her legs can be unsteady.  I am very satisfied.  There were some scratches on one of the parts. My first thought was that it was used.  They assured me that it was new. I declined returning it over the scratches.  They gave me a small discount, which I didn&#x27;t ask for. That said, I appreciated their willingess to stand behind their product: Good customer service!</li>
            <li> Bought for myself. If I bought one at the store thru my insurance it would have cost more. It was super easy to assemble just the handle bars and back rest. It&#x27;s narrow enough to use in my home and works great on the carpet. Very sturdy. Basket is not metal it&#x27;s fabric so nothing will fall out. Got in 2 days!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000X21996 Invacare Value Four Wheel Rolling Walker Rollator Burg/Red]]This is a great purchase! The item arrived in 2 days; very easy to assemble. I bought it for my mom&#x27;s birthday [her 85th] and she just loves it! Her gait had become somewhat unsteady and she had refused to use a cane. She stated that this rollator felt very sturdy, is very easy for her to maneuver and the seat is perfect to sit for brief periods. This will provide her with a new ability to take walks without fear of stumbling or falling.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS ITEM BUT I WAS NOT AWARE IT WAS MADE IN CHINA AND I AM MAKING THE BIG EFFORT TO BUY ONLY ITEMS MADE IN USA. I was going to send it back but my landlord recycled the box.  Please join me in asking Amazon to list where the items they sell are made. I buy almost everything from them. Their number is 800-201-7575.  If enough of us call we can make an impact. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I bought this walker for my 85 year old aunt who has difficulty walking.  It is easy to set up &amp; was light enough for a frail person to handle.  After my 90 year old mother who resists using a standard walker saw it, she wanted one herself.  It has made a major improvement in her mobility.    Although, I would recommend a sturdier model for an over weight person.</li>
            <li> I purchased this walker as a second for my 85 year old mother. This will be her outside walker that she will use to wander the yard and work in her garden. It arrived in just a few days and did not require tools for assembly. The removable support bar simply snaps in and the basket just hooks on. The walker is a very good value, is well made and sturdy, convenient to fold/store/carry, and is an attractive red color. The only issue I really have is that the seat is not padded like the one I purchased two years ago for $125. I dont think the pad is worth the $50 difference in price, so Ill take this Invacare Value Roller any day.</li>
            <li> I just got it short term I really liked the carrying bag it helped my leg heal a little quicker</li>
            <li> got this for my mom - she uses it all the time and loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Solidly built - recommend it.</li>
            <li> A very steady walker, great braking capability, larger wheel base provides more stability--I find it more difficult walking behind however. I use this out in the garage to get to one place or another. It weighs more than my others so it is not that easy to swing into a car. I believe people up to about 300 lbs. would feel quite safe--I&#x27;m 190 and this walker is SOLID!</li>
            <li> This item came as stated in great shape and in a short time as told. It had very little assembly which makes it easy for anyone. It helped the person to get around when needed. A good investment.</li>
            <li> YOU MAY THINK I&#x27;m NUTS, BUT THATS OK...THIS LIL FOUR WHEELED CHAIR IS MY BEST FRIEND..TAKES ME TO THE MAIL BOX TWICE A DAY,,,TAKES ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WHEN THE BELL SOUNDS,,,HELPS ME MAKE COFFEE IN THE AM....IT&#x27;S MY NUMBER TWO LOVE AFTER MY WONDERFULL LIVE IN LADY LOVE....WE TWO GO FOR WALKS ETC, AND I&#x27;M THE FASTEST RIDE  ON THE BLOCK..  THIS LIL MACHINE HAS BROUGHT MUCH JOY TO THIS 84 YEAR KID, THANKS A MILLION...</li>
            <li> I brought the rolling walker for a dear friend who is in a wheelchair. he loves it,especially the fact that he can sit on it when he gets to tired.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the local drug store and very good quality. rveryone is happy-  very fast dekivery thanks from grandma</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these walkers with wheels.  They make it so much easier and faster to get around.  They fit through the hallways at home and make going outdoors so much easier.  The only reason I gave this four(4) stars instead of five(5) is, because, the model I ordered for my sister, is not what she received.  But, she likes it too much to part with it.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> The walker arrived much quicker than I thought it would. My 88 year old mom loves it. She can sit and catch her breath if we&#x27;re doing a lot of walking.</li>
            <li> Great walker for the price.  Easy to assemble.  Easy to fold up.  Light.  Love it!  And my mother loves it too.  She&#x27;s able to take it and use it everywhere.  She is very pleased.</li>
            <li> The walker is the same high quality as others costing 2-3 x as much.  Sturdy, finished nicely, a great product.  Adjustable for all sizes.  One caveat, the user needs to learn how to use the brakes, while using it for support while moving to or from the walker to a chair.  For those who don&#x27;t have this capacity, the more traditional aluminum fold out (with only 2 wheels on 4 corners) is probably safer.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Went together easily without tools. The seat is thinly cushioned and some users will need to add a cushion for comfort.</li>
            <li> Great value, I was hopeing to get a walker to use after my knee surgery but thought I was going to pay a fortune. Luckily Amazon was there to help with a great value price wise plus a good quality product.</li>
            <li> She loves his walker. Barely ant assembly. Really fast delivery. She and I are extremely happy with this purchase.would recommend this</li>
            <li> This is a very good invention.  I use it often.</li>
            <li> Solid tires are small and not much good off pavement. Have searched everywhere for larger pneumatic tires but evidently they are not available. Prefer to use a VA supplied Dolomite unit with larger tires and better brakes.</li>
            <li> I bought this four wheel rolling walker for my grandma and it was well worth it.  She is able to get around much better than before and she loves the basket where she can put her magazine or other little things to tote around.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because it is smaller than the first one he had.  But he loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this rollator because I was having dizzy spells and overall weakness from medications. It was getting to the point that I was struggling to walk to store and walk the dog. Now I can safely do these things and sit down If I get too dizzy. The seat is surprisingly comfortable and the walker rolls easily. Even can use it in the kitchen when making things that require me to stand for longer periods. This walker is a bit larger than I expected, but that is just a plus for me.  I am almost 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and the seat is a little high. I think it may be a little too high for someone that is much shorter than me. The cloth basket will hold a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs easily. If I don&#x27;t get too much can get several groceries items in it. I got a large travel bag that hangs on the bars and can get a very large load of groceries in the travel bag when I need to. The stroller handles the bag very well. Works better than the little grocery cart I have.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad around Christmas 2013 and one of the brakes broke by mid March 2014. Compared to the one my dad had previously this one was cheaply made and he complained about it when he first got it. I should&#x27;ve returned it then but I was too lazy. Then the dang thing breaks. And he just complained even more. I bought some brakes to try to repair, but those were too short and cost $43 on Amazon! Hopefully I can return them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried to contact the seller but to no avail. They did send an automated message telling me they would respond soon, a week later and I&#x27;m still waiting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad&#x27;s using his old one and it still works. Should&#x27;ve saved my money and not have bought this. The basket under the seat is pretty cool though, but that was the only good thing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother and she loves it! She uses it everywhere and sits on the comfortable seat when she needs a rest. I have seen lots of other rollators, but Invacare Rollator is the most beautiful, convenient, comfortable and cheapest around! We are very happy to have purchased this for my mother.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Sturdy! Useful! Helpful!</li>
            <li> I use the rollator when I go to the super market.  My husband pushes the grocery cart &amp; that gives me time to look at different items.  It&lt;br /&gt;really has been a life saver because of my recent back problems.  I love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My 87 year old mother did NOT want a walker.  She is a bit unsteady on her feet and walks very slowly.  She has had many falls over the past few years, so I thought that a walker would be a good idea.  She swore she didn&#x27;t need/want it when I showed it to her.  I told her to think of it as a purse on wheels.  When I dropped her off at her independent living facility, I told her to use the walker all the way to her door to see how it worked.  I drove around the building and met her at her apartment.  \\&quot;I REALLY LIKE IT!  It&#x27;s like driving a Cadillac!\\&quot;  Now, the rollator is her constant companion.  It is very easy to maneuver.  She loves that she is able to walk a bit faster with her hot wheels.  Another plus is the seat that she can rest on whenever she waits in line.  The bit of cargo space is a great place for her to tuck her \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; sweater.  She loves it and I love it!</li>
            <li> The product came with a metal basket as described in the ad, but it doesn&#x27;t sit under the seat.  It attaches in front of the seat, which isn&#x27;t as secure as sitting under the seat.  So be aware of the difference.  Otherwise this is a nice lightweight walker</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected.  Truly the best of all Walkers that I reviewed.  Price was reasonable too.  I gave this to a friend in a Nursing Home.  As I wheeled it down the hallway, folks asked &amp;#34;Where did you get that?  I would love to have one!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> We purchased this walker for a relative and she loves it!  The one we got has a storage area under the seat, and she seems to like that.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together and easy to maneuver. The only downfall is that it is quite an effort to fold it</li>
            <li> I really liked this walker. However, I did not use it very long for my total knee replacement because my physical therapist had me using one crutch about a week after my surgery.</li>
            <li> This rollator saved my mother&#x27;s life!!  It gave her mobility that nothing else would.  It is very light-weight but very sturdy and folds up to take in the car (or on an airplane).  It has locking brakes that makes it stationary to provide assistance when attempting to stand from a sitting position (like from a chair or the side of the bed).  Mom rolls down the hall to the kitchen and uses the seat to sit at the table.  It allows her to join the family for meals.  She carries her book and eyeglasses in the basket.  This is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold in allowing handicapped people to retain mobility.  Absolutely FIVE STARS!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom who lives in a sprawling carpeting apartment building.  She greatly prefers it to a standard walker.  The assembly directions were poor, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> A high-quality product, shipped well and quickly. Easy communication with the seller. Best of all, the person for  whom it was purchased loves it and gets around much better with it.</li>
            <li> the seat is not6 comfortale.</li>
            <li> Bought the roller for my 91 year old mother. Rolling walker was very easy to set up and rolls very easily on all surfaces. She loves how easy it is to push and loves the seat with the small compartment to carry things.  Tough to beat the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this walker for my 85 year old Mother who was having trouble walking without assistance.&lt;br /&gt;Since I knew little about this item, I went to Amazon to do some research.&lt;br /&gt;This walker was such a great value, I figured it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The walker arrived quickly...2 days later! My boyfriend assembled it and we were both impressed with the quality of the product. It is very sturdy and the color is so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, my Mom feels safe when using it.</li>
            <li> For those who have their an ailing parent now living with them... this is the BEST walker ever!We needed an extra rolling walker to keep in the car for outings. This rolling walker is the BEST bang for your buck!Very sturdy,easy to assemble (5 minutes...no tools needed).In my opinion,this is the Best rolling walker....look no further!</li>
            <li> I bought this Rollator for my 95 year-old mother who is only 80 lbs. and 4&#x27;10\\&quot;.  At first I was concerned that this was too big or too high for her, but I just couldn&#x27;t resist the good price advertised.  I also didn&#x27;t expect the item to arrive until after 4 days from the time I ordered it online.  To my surprise, it arrived the next day!!! And I didn&#x27;t have to pay extra for next day delivery.    The item was easy to assemble for someone like me who is 66 years old and have arthritis on her hands. It only took me 15 minutes to put it together. It was neither too high nor too wide for my mom&#x27;s use.  As a matter of fact, she liked it better than her old one (which we paid like $149 way back in 2004.)  This one had the soft seat and a basket, plus it came in nice colors.  I would have bought the aqua rollator, but there was no inventory available in that color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this three weeks ago, and it has already paid for itself.  It has increased my mobility by at least 75 percent.  Shipped ready to use except for handlebar, that installed in less that 5 minutes.  I would recomment this to everyone.</li>
            <li> We purchased two of these.  One for my mother and one for my husband&#x27;s mother.  They are so easy to use.  Both my mother and my husband&#x27;s fought the idea of using a walker.  But after they got them they have both found good uses for them.  They use them to set their dinners on and walk them to the living room where they eat without spilling anymore.  We also got the cup holder which they love.  My mom uses hers to carry her laundry from the dryer to her room to put away.  She said she never thought she would use a walker but she is so glad she has one to help her in the house. I could see that she was getting a little wobbly when walking and does have a cane that she uses when going out but won&#x27;t use in the house. I told her to think of this as a tool to help her around the house and she has found many uses for it and she is more stable when walking from room to room with things.  She even puts her trash on the seat and takes it out to the garbage  easily because the wheels are big and work well on the dirt.  Great investment! Just a note of caution, they do come in different heights.  Both my mom and my mom-in-law are very short.  This one was a little high to sit on easily.  Check the height measurements before purchasing.</li>
            <li> unfortunately we will all need one of these some day. Seems like most pricing out there is a bit excessive.&lt;br /&gt;Found this for a great deal, and the quality is 2nd to none.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Invacare Value Rollator for a patient of mine.  The walker was everything that said to be and more. Amazon shipped supper fast!</li>
            <li> very high quality product--well made and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received it 3 days after ordering!! wouold recommend this walker to anyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needing this type of assistance</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my MIL. She requested it. Not a very glamorous I know but it&#x27;s what she wanted. She is thrilled. It arrived within two days even during the holiday rush. It gives her the stability she needs to move about, particularly in public, while allowing her a place to catch a quick rest.</li>
            <li> Most awesome gizmo in the universe.  I bought this for a friend who had triple by pass surgery.  LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> We got this for my father in law. He wanted one for in the house and one to keep in the van, The price sure made it easy. I would recommend it to anybody that needs one.</li>
            <li> The bag folds up with the rollator. Most have a wire basket.  The rest is the same as other rollators.</li>
            <li> i bought this for when i had hip surgery and LOVED it im only 33 so i wanted something not as clinical looking as traditional walkers and the seat/ storage area was great for holding my purse and taking breaks ( which was needed) if i were in a store or a longline folds up nicely! good quality product</li>
            <li> My grandmother is a VERY picky woman and I dreaded this purchase thinking nothing would really make her happy, but she has nothing but praise for this walker!  At 83 and after two-heart by-pass surgeries, she has a difficult time moving around and after her last walker was stolen, she desperately needed a new one.  We read countless reviews and settled on this one and it was everything we could have asked for for her.  This walker is light, it was easy to assemble, and the shade of red is \\&quot;pretty, but not to flashy\\&quot; (she is a church going women who sees the wrong shade of red as scandalous)...She says that it glides like a butterfly and make her feel 10 years younger.....</li>
            <li> Loved the walker!  Much easier to use than the walker I had that didn&#x27;t have wheels.  I would recommed it to anyone who needs a walker.  I take it restaurants to sit on (it&#x27;s easier to get in/out of than a chair).</li>
            <li> I recently had foot surgery. I am able to put my knee on the seat and push with my good foot. It makes me very mobile. It is very stable and makes me able to do many things. It is also a good value. I. have seen this same item in stores for much more money.</li>
            <li> This was bought to replace the old beaten up one he had.  He likes the brakes and the seat/basket.  Rolls along nicely.  No complaints and does the job.  Price was very good value.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to have a walker in the house and for my car.  I bought this one because it is sturdy but lightweight so it can be lifted in and out of SUV.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> People shrink when they age.  I bought this for my mom, who was never tall to begin with.  The walker is sturdy and well made, but the seat was just way too high for her.  And it wouldn&#x27;t go any lower.  Had to donate it.</li>
            <li> My wife who needed a better walker was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to get around with rollator. The ease of assembly from the box was much appreciated. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product! My wife is petite and had a walker with only two wheels, and was struggling. She absolutely loves this walker! So easy to manuver Basically, comes out of the box assembled. Just adjust handles to desired high.</li>
            <li> the price is good but there is a reason it is so inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;in other words if you are buying it for a cranky senior&lt;br /&gt;expect some complaints</li>
            <li> I chose five stars because the walker met all my expectations.  The brakes work great and it is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Pretty average.  Nice and light weight for me to get in and out of the car for my husband.  But due to the light weight I don&#x27;t think I would want to see him use it if he were much over 200 lbs.  But I would buy it again for us.  It works.  And the price was right.</li>
            <li> Handle brake broke  and I have no way to fix it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Seat okay if you don&#x27;t have to sit for a long period of time.  Folds easily.  Stores quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom. She refused it at first. I bought red (her favorite color) told her it was really mine, just loaning it to her. Now she loves it. Moms a talker, now she can sit and talk (and rest) in comfort, she says the walker is more comfortable than some chairs. I also like the security of her being able to keep her purse in the compartment below. Now she wants decals on it so she can personalize it. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. The item shipped was THE WRONG COLOR ! I ordered burgundy, I received blue. I was willing to overlook that because the blue was a nice color. Basic assembly was easy enough BUT one of the bolt covers was the WRONG SIZE. Again, I was willing to overlook that because it was one near the floor. After a single trip to the supermarket one of the FACTORY INSTALLED hinge bars ( which allow the walker to fold ) came loose. I was unable to retrieve the screw due to the now VERY UNSTABLE walker, so I had to abandon it. I DID make it back to the car, and home. NOW, I will have to ask my son in law to try to find a REPLACEMENT SCREW and re-assemble the thing with LOC TITE !  I admit that I was trying to save some money by purchasing this item at Amazon rather that a legitimate health care supplier because I have a limited income, but if the items sold at Amazon could be DANGEROUS due to shoddy workmanship, then they SHOULD NOT be sold by ANYONE.  I WOULD NOT recommend this product to ANYONE who must rely on it for a safe walking platform !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my elderly mother.  She absolutely loves this walker.  It arrived very fast and was very easy to put together.  A great value!</li>
            <li> Does everything its supposed to do! Husband had a previous one that was stolen while in a Rehab center and missed it terribly.</li>
            <li> We purchased this walker so that my mother  and a family friend would have assistance when they came to visit. They both have visited at different times and in both cases they love it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my wife&#x27;s mother.  She&#x27;s older now and is in need of a walker.  The one she had was inadequate, but this one meets all her needs.  It&#x27;s easy to use and folds up to but in the car.  We&#x27;re happy that she&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> i will recommend this to those who have a hardtime walking wo a cane and have more security on walking around. a chair to sit on when tired. i sure love this rollator but not for myself cuz i have small built so i found a junior size just right for me., same brand as a matter of fact. thank you for building mobility equip for those in need. keep the good work!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband wanted and it came sooner than expected. It was less expensive than at the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this walker for my Mom.  It helped keep Mom mobile longer. The four wheeled walker is so much better than the 2  wheeler with 2 tennis balls on the front.  The seat is a marvel, just in case, she gets tired and needs to sit down quick.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rate the invacare  walker a  &amp;#34;6&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Brakes don&#x27;t work -( HAND).</li>
            <li> A very usefull product for some time after release following hip surgery. I use it mostly to walk down a long hall from the front entrance to my condo.Folds nicely to easily fit in the front seat of my Honda Civic coupe BUT, It won&#x27;t fit in the trunk. NOTE: At the rehab facility they tried to get me to use a similar but obviously much inferior rolling walker. I vehemently resisted and only ordered from Amazon two days before release. The walker arrived on the third day after it was ordered..</li>
            <li> This order arrived fast and in perfect condition. It is exactly as described. It is sturdy and lightweight. I used it immediately with no getting used to (I was used to a cane only). It&#x27;s collapsable and easily transported in a car. Great buy. Great service. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this walker for my mother.  She had two firm requests - a padded seat, and a flexible fabric under the seat bag for carrying items.  I researched all the walkers until I found one that met her requirements, then read ALL the comments, questions and reviews to make sure I was ordering the correct item.  You guessed it!  The walker was delivered promptly, but with a hard plastic seat and an unattached  wire basket that must be removed before the walker can be folded and which falls out regularly.  Mother was desperate for a walker, so she made do with this one while I looked for the one she wanted, but we both felt we had been deliberately misled.</li>
            <li> It fits through the doorways, which is why I bought it.  My problem is that it&#x27;s so light it isn&#x27;t very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Purchhsed for my elderly mom who had been using a &#x27;regular&#x27; walker.  The Rollator is much easier for her and she is walking better.  Wish I had purchased this 2 years ago.  My only issue is she isn&#x27;t used to using the hand brake - I worry she may forget to use it.  However - after several weeks - its been great and no mishaps. It was shipped and arrived ahead of scheduled;  easy to assemble out of the box.  I have no regreats and am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> My mother in law loved this while living here doing laps in the back yard. Good quality.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this. It&#x27;s light weight, easy to handle and push. We have two of these. One is for traveling and the other is for home.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my daughter.  Due to a car accident she has lost most of the use in her right foot, a regular walker was not sturdy enough, but she love this, says she is able to get around so much better now.</li>
