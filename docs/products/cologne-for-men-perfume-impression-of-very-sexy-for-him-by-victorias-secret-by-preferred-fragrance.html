            <li> Little behind the ears</li>
            <li> I bought this not realizing it was a knockoff brand which was silly on my part but</li>
            <li> even think about it&lt;br /&gt;bad smell in a bad bottle.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>

            <li> I bought this for my fianc√© for Christmas. He already wears very sexy by VS and this cologne does not smell like it at all. Despite all the great reviews I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift for my father and I pretty sure he would love the smell.thank you for this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brand name for years, and bought this to try it out because the price was a ton better.  When it comes to the smell I can&#x27;t tell any difference at all.  Smells exactly the same to me as the brand name.  The only big difference I noticed is that the scent does not last as long as the brand name, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Buy this cologne for my 13 years, daily use its fragrance is very fresh and enjoyable. placed it every day for school. I recommend it. excellent price.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I own the original very sexy for him. My gf got.it for me. It is a ssweeter scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed and smelled both one after another. Very close smell. If I didn&#x27;t have the original with me I probably wouldn&#x27;t have noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good. The scent actually Lasts a lot longer than id expected. Directly of a sweather the smell will stick to the sweater all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not something you wanna shower with. Little behind the ears n neck is the trick!</li>
            <li> Just like the real thing.... Would definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> I bought this not realizing it was a knockoff brand which was silly on my part but was very pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually a pretty good cologne! In fact probably the best cologne I have found in a while that hasn&#x27;t costed over $35!</li>
            <li> I love the original scent from Victoria&#x27;s Sercret but couldnt afford it any more. Once I found this, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> The cologne I bought was packaged nicely and came within the expected time of delivery. The cologne smells very nice but of course doesn&#x27;t last very long because of the price. So either spray yourself a boat-load before you leave or carry it with you when you go out. Smells very good though so there&#x27;s that. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Smells very similar to VS&#x27;s very sexy for men and lasts for quite some time.  Great imitation for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, thinking that at a very reasonable price it couldn&#x27;t be all that bad of a cologne; and I was right.  My husband said he smelt the original on a co-worker and when he wore this one to work, his co-worker thought he was wearing the same fragrance.  The only regret is the scent seems to fade away after a few hours which is usually the case with most imitations I have purchase in the past.  Overall,  its a winner!!</li>
            <li> Better to buy from Victoria secrets corporate store .. It&#x27;s kind of goofed up&lt;br /&gt;Not really happy... For him black bottle is grt from Victoria store I do not prefer here some brands</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t even think about it&lt;br /&gt;bad smell in a bad bottle.&lt;br /&gt;and it leaks.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this cologne by mistake confusing it for the original so once it arrived  I was kinda bummed about the fact that it&#x27;s an imitation of the original Very Sexy for men. To my surprise it smells almost identical to the original!! it&#x27;s a very pleasant scent!! I really like it!! And for the price I&#x27;m totally going to purchase again once I&#x27;m out of it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price. Smells remarkably like higher priced brand name products. I got it as a Christmas present and the guy I gave it to thought it was awesome and didnt mind that I bought the off brand.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the Victoria Secrets Very Sexy. But of 1/10 of the cost. I am more than happy with this purchase</li>
