            <li>The dentists were recommending this brush to patients, and there was a rebate deal and a special on top of that (occassionally, there are still these deals going on, so keep an eye out for them...</li>
            <li>I was happy to get my item so quickly and everything was brand new.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush was recommended by my dentist because of continued tarter buildup on my lower teeth between checkups I have been using it for two weeks, and definitely  seeing great results.</li>
            <li>I was going to try another brand but had such good luck with Oral B that I decided to buy the 5000 Series and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention your teeth feel sooooo clean, fresh and smooth after you use it!</li>
            <li>i bought one for each of my family members and they all experienced the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)</li>
            <li>I chose a new one and was send something not so nice.</li>
            <li>My teeth are shiner and it feels clean.  </li>
            <li>After brushing with this toothbrush my teeth feel as clean as when she does them.</li>
            <li>Feelin&#x27; clean, it a clean machine.</li>
            <li>Clean teeth w/o enamel damage.</li>
            <li>Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is by far way better than any sonicare that I have used before!</li>
            <li>I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>P&amp;G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time.</li>
            <li>P&amp;G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time.</li>
            <li>I have compared the Oral-b to many electric toothbrushes and this one really does the job well.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with my last unit.  </li>
            <li>I like this one better then a normal toothbrush, feel the difference on your cleaner teeth and with the display is easier</li>
            <li>After doing some research I quickly learned that the Oral B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 was the top of the line.  </li>
            <li>I have been happy I spent the extra money on this toothbrush because it has so many bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li>But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn&#x27;t enough for me.  </li>
            <li>,Be sure to purchase direct from Amazon not site sellers.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads aren&#x27;t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  </li>
            <li>At first I experienced slight bleeding of my mug</li>
            <li>There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that I purchase this product instead of several other comparable brands.  </li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>However it is nice to know how long you are brushing</li>
            <li>From the polishing mode to the gum massaging, it is a very capable brush.</li>
            <li>I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>(This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)  8.</li>
            <li>I have never owned a different electric toothbrush, so I cannot make comparisons, but I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have recommended this toothbrush to all of my friends and family which they all seem to be pleased with it as well.</li>
            <li>but it stopped after the first day.    </li>
            <li>My dentist recommend this two years ago and wow, does it clean.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist gives me positive comments and that I should continue using the brush.</li>
            <li>it was full of old tooth stuff from someone else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes before (Phillips Sonicare, Braun) and this one is far superior.</li>
            <li>It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t necessary to have the timer you will do fine without it.  </li>
            <li>Very timely arrival.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look really shiny</li>
            <li>If dentists are in the business of working on teeth and filling cavities, do you really want a brush that 4 out of 5 dentists recommend?</li>
            <li>My daughter has a simular model that was given to her by her orthodontist,she really likes using it</li>
            <li>I did much research (reading reviews on all brushes) before buying this one.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much,</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to brush or doesn&#x27;t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li>They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Noting attracts girls like clean white teeth...</li>
            <li>It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cheaper electric brushes and they certainly didn&#x27;t live up.  </li>
            <li>When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  </li>
            <li>or if I&#x27;m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\&quot; clean mouth.  </li>
            <li>or if I&#x27;m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\&quot; clean mouth.  </li>
            <li>It is more powerful, cleans easily, and has a neat little timer that I thought was just a dumb gimmick at first-</li>
            <li>and I have been using our new toothbrushes for almost two months now.  </li>
            <li>I know I can save some $$ on replacement heads when I need to get some new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I could not give it as a new Christmas gift</li>
            <li>Tried new batteries, charging, etc.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend it to all friends, family, co-workers, strangers... and to anyone who wants a cleaner mouth, really.  </li>

            <li>I bought this three years ago and it&#x27;s working just the same as the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>what product out there would make sure he doesn&#x27;t brush hard and for the 3 min required time.</li>
            <li>I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  </li>
            <li>I just opened the box from, Oral-b Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Electric Toothbrush Dental Professional Excl...</li>
            <li>bottom line don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this model (dental professional exclusive 5000 series) because it an investment that will pay off.</li>
            <li>Plus P&amp;G offers coupons on their website all the time, so</li>

            <li>when I have just had them professionally cleaned at the dentist office.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this a while back ago but didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I fully tested it out for a several months.</li>
            <li>I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy another one for my other half who is reluctant to go \\&quot;Electric\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>I was planning to give it to my wife for a Christmas gift,But item was received with the bottom of the box pried open and taped loosely closed with two sided tape,And the contents sound loose inside box.  </li>
            <li>and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up.</li>
            <li>They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!  </li>
            <li>Another benefit is the replacement heads are much, much, cheaper then other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up)</li>
            <li>The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it&#x27;s time for a new brush head.  </li>

            <li> I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)</li>
            <li> I chose a new one and was send something not so nice.</li>
            <li> My teeth are shiner and it feels clean.  </li>
            <li> After brushing with this toothbrush my teeth feel as clean as when she does them.</li>
            <li> Feelin&#x27; clean, it a clean machine.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth w/o enamel damage.</li>
            <li> Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is by far way better than any sonicare that I have used before!</li>
            <li> I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> P&amp;G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time.</li>
            <li> P&amp;G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time.</li>
            <li> I have compared the Oral-b to many electric toothbrushes and this one really does the job well.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with my last unit.  </li>
            <li> I like this one better then a normal toothbrush, feel the difference on your cleaner teeth and with the display is easier</li>
            <li> After doing some research I quickly learned that the Oral B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 was the top of the line.  </li>
            <li> I have been happy I spent the extra money on this toothbrush because it has so many bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn&#x27;t enough for me.  </li>
            <li> ,Be sure to purchase direct from Amazon not site sellers.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads aren&#x27;t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  </li>
            <li> At first I experienced slight bleeding of my mug</li>
            <li> There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I purchase this product instead of several other comparable brands.  </li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> However it is nice to know how long you are brushing</li>
            <li> From the polishing mode to the gum massaging, it is a very capable brush.</li>
            <li> I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)  8.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a different electric toothbrush, so I cannot make comparisons, but I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Overall I have recommended this toothbrush to all of my friends and family which they all seem to be pleased with it as well.</li>
            <li> but it stopped after the first day.    </li>
            <li> My dentist recommend this two years ago and wow, does it clean.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist gives me positive comments and that I should continue using the brush.</li>
            <li> it was full of old tooth stuff from someone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes before (Phillips Sonicare, Braun) and this one is far superior.</li>
            <li> It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly.</li>

            <li> My teeth look really shiny</li>
            <li> If dentists are in the business of working on teeth and filling cavities, do you really want a brush that 4 out of 5 dentists recommend?</li>
            <li> My daughter has a simular model that was given to her by her orthodontist,she really likes using it</li>
            <li> I did much research (reading reviews on all brushes) before buying this one.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much,</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to brush or doesn&#x27;t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist.</li>

            <li> It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cheaper electric brushes and they certainly didn&#x27;t live up.  </li>
            <li> When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  </li>

            <li> and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up.</li>
            <li> They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!  </li>
            <li> Another benefit is the replacement heads are much, much, cheaper then other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up)</li>
            <li> The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it&#x27;s time for a new brush head.  </li>
            <li> Since I am looking to replace my brush again and reading what the latest models are I&#x27;m not sure one needs an LED screen to tell you if you are brushing to hard or not.  </li>
            <li> This makes me feel like I&#x27;ve made a long term investment in myself, hopefully reducing costly dental bills in the future.  </li>

            <li> As fantastic as this toothbrush is, it is incomprehensible to me why Braun provides a 1980s-type NiCd rechargeable battery in this toothbrush that comes with infamous memory disaster (always wait until battery is fully depleted before you recharge).  </li>

            <li> I bought this three years ago and it&#x27;s working just the same as the first day I used it. It is the best decision I made when it comes to dental care. My dental hygienist gives me positive comments and that I should continue using the brush. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like Philips Sonicair much better.  Not horrible.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by my dentist because of continued tarter buildup on my lower teeth between checkups I have been using it for two weeks, and definitely  seeing great results. This is a small investment compared to the price that will be paid for gum and or teeth loss do to conventional brushing. I will report back after my next checkup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral B for many years now.  I&#x27;m on my second unit and about to replace it as you can only recharge a battery so many times.  When you have teeth that are not straight like I do the back sides of your teeth are very hard to reach and the smaller round head on the brush I find reaches the hard to get areas better than the longer rectangular brushes.  Doesn&#x27;t straighten your teeth though.  Since I am looking to replace my brush again and reading what the latest models are I&#x27;m not sure one needs an LED screen to tell you if you are brushing to hard or not.  I tend to think that is glamor over substance.  After all the brush is just rotating in an oscillating motion purre and simple.  It works and works well.  My model hesistates at the end of two minutes and I generally am about 3/4 of way done with brushing when that happens.  You still need to floss and thats expected.  I have been very pleased with my last unit.  I didn&#x27;t save the box and the model number isn&#x27;t on it so I cant say which one it is.  I&#x27;ll likely get the professional Series without all the bells and whistles.  Good product and will continue to use till new technology comes up with something better.</li>
            <li> So I am a dental health freak... I love brushing and flossing my teeth all the time! I know most people don&#x27;t like my husband, so I set out to find the best toothbrush for him. He is the type that brushes very quick and hard which has resulted in gum recession (not a good thing at ALL). I did my research (probably 10 hours during a time period of 2 weeks). I even asked my dentist and hygienist what product out there would make sure he doesn&#x27;t brush hard and for the 3 min required time. Some recommended sonicare and others recommended Oral B 5000. So I set out to do my research extensively, since paying up to $100 for a toothbrush is not dimes and pennies for our house hold. There are other sellers selling this item but most are more than $100. This ad is probably your best shot at the cheapest price!  Ok now for the research details:  1. It is lighter than most electric brushes out there  2. It HAS A TIMER! This is probably among the top 3 reasons I bought this!  3. Up to 4 people can use it. Since you can change the bristle tip (color rings identify it to the person)  4. Its battery lasts for all of us to brush at night  5. The timer sends a signal to the toothbrush (its vibration changes for a second) to let you know it&#x27;s time to brush on another side.  6. It massages your gums and prevents you from brushing HARD!  7. It is durable! (This is crucial since more than one person uses it in my house hold)  8. You can buy the bristle head that is best for you  9. It&#x27;s not that expensive compared to Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 (their best one)  10. My dentist and hygienist recommended it (they are friends of mine and not trying to sell me something)  I would say the only con would be that you have to wait for the other person to finish using it (3 min max). Thats duable trust me!  Overall I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to brush or doesn&#x27;t know how long to brush for, or even yet just wants an AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH. It guides you so you know you are getting a great cleaning. Not to mention your teeth feel sooooo clean, fresh and smooth after you use it! So as you can tell I love it and I am very satisfied with my purchase! Good luck and hope it works amazing for you as it does for me and my family!</li>
            <li> I was happy to get my item so quickly and everything was brand new.  I was dissappointed that it did not come in a oral b box because I wanted to use a rebate I had that needed the upc code from the box.  I have been happy I spent the extra money on this toothbrush because it has so many bells and whistles.  It stops me from over brushing with the timer and actually tells me when to switch sides.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a different electric toothbrush, so I cannot make comparisons, but I love this toothbrush.  I wish I had bought something like this years ago.  You will not regret buying this.  It was very easy to use; just plug it in, push the head on and brush away.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this toothbrush.  I got it about a year ago from my dentist&#x27;s office, and absolutely love it.  The dentists were recommending this brush to patients, and there was a rebate deal and a special on top of that (occassionally, there are still these deals going on, so keep an eye out for them...the savings is very significant!).  I use the floss action brush heads, and my teeth feel so nice and clean after I brush.  They feel as clean as when I just get back from the dentist. I could never get my teeth this clean with a normal toothbrush.  I also use the sensitive head on my son occassionally.  I am always afraid he isn&#x27;t brushing his teeth well enough, and with this, I worry less, and he really likes it.  The brush heads have the fading colors like other toothbrushes that tell you it&#x27;s time for a new brush head.  The replacement heads aren&#x27;t exactly cheap (usually a little over $20 for three of the floss action), but I feel it is well worth the investment to have such a nice toothbrush and the great clean feeling it leaves after brushing.  They last a long time, and I have definitely have $20 on much less worthy things!  The toothbrush is very easy to use.  Put your brush head on, push the button, and go.  Charging is easy, too.  It sits on the charger, you don&#x27;t have to plug the actual brush handle into anything.  The timer is a very nice addition.  It communicates with the brush and comes set to make it do a special vibration pattern every 30 seconds as a cue to move on to another quadrant of your mouth, and another final vibration after the 2 minute time.  I can be several rooms away and they can still communicate.  Also, if you turn the brush off in the middle of brushing and back on not too much longer later, it still keeps your progress where you stopped, and you can also continue brushing after the two minutes are up. It will still keep tracking the time.  It also comes with a nice travel case, charger and holding tray with separate slots for up to four brush heads.  The battery charge lasts a long time, as well.  I have had absolutely no problems with this product and have recommended it to friends and family members (many of whom also now own it and like it, too!)</li>
            <li> I just opened the box from, Oral-b Professional Care Smartseries 5000 Electric Toothbrush Dental Professional Excl...&lt;br /&gt;Sold by Hugo Cesar De La Rosa (LoneStarResale)&lt;br /&gt;Condition: new&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it was full of old tooth stuff from someone else. I chose a new one and was send something not so nice. I would not by from Lone Stare.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist kept recommending that I purchase an electric toothbrush.  She specifically recommended the Oral B electric toothbrush.  After doing some research I quickly learned that the Oral B Professional Care Smartseries 5000 was the top of the line.  I recently purchased this product and have seen a noticeable improvement in my dental checkups.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is by far way better than any sonicare that I have used before! The timers is a plus which guides you and even tells you if your pressing too hard. I first bought this a while back ago but didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I fully tested it out for a several months. I bought mine from Oral Care Deals so this review is from their product, and I was very pleased by them. One thing that I absolutely LOVED about this toothbrush was its ability to change the brush tip, which also comes with colored rings that you can identify which person it belongs too. I initially was looking for an electric toothbrush for me and my husband but when i came across this one i found out that we can both use it and all we have to do is to change the brush tip. It comes with a brush tip holder that you can place 4 tips one, so basically 4 people can use this one brush, now thats awesome by itself! We found that the battery is long lasting so you don&#x27;t need to charge it after a few brushes. the grip is comfortable and its easy on the wrist! every time I brush I get the same feeling as i do when i go to my dentist for my six month cleaning. My dentist even said this is the best one on the market right now. Overall I have recommended this toothbrush to all of my friends and family which they all seem to be pleased with it as well. bottom line don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this model (dental professional exclusive 5000 series) because it an investment that will pay off.</li>
            <li> Shipped to Kuwait from the USA via USPS - to a APO.  Very timely arrival.  Although on an Army installation the voltage is 220 (vs 110).  When I initially plugged in the unit, it didn&#x27;t appear as if it would charge but after several seconds did begin charging.  Have had no problems and am very satisfied.  Would purchase another unit.</li>
            <li> As fantastic as this toothbrush is, it is incomprehensible to me why Braun provides a 1980s-type NiCd rechargeable battery in this toothbrush that comes with infamous memory disaster (always wait until battery is fully depleted before you recharge).  And then, it takes 9 hours to fully charge the battery.  In this price category the toothbrush should come with a Lithium-based rechargeable battery that provide constant power (i.e., speed), and not like this NiCd battery that becomes slower and slower.  5 stars for the toothbrush itself, but no star for the outdated battery technology, makes it 3 stars in my book maximum.</li>
            <li> I had tried a different auto toothbrush that is supposed to be good for your gums, but I hated it.  My son got this one and encouraged me to get one.  It is great!  My teeth look really shiny and I know it is doing a better job of brushing.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  A dentist friend of my son says that if you use this every day your oral health will improve greatly.  My son then used it and his hygienist couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  So, I bought one and am now using it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I bought it three years ago and its still going strong.  I replace the heads about once every month or two.  Despite being a bit expensive to replace so often (99 cents vs. $3.50 at HEB) compared to a standard toothbrush, I have to say that my teeth feel cleaner and gums are healthier because of this brush.  I have recommended it to my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s an odd thought... If dentists are in the business of working on teeth and filling cavities, do you really want a brush that 4 out of 5 dentists recommend?</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I purchase this product instead of several other comparable brands.  I read all the reviews and decided to go with this one.  I noticed a difference in just three days.  At first I experienced slight bleeding of my mug but it stopped after the first day.    My teeth are shiner and it feels clean.  I am going to buy another one for my other half who is reluctant to go \\&quot;Electric\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended this toothbrush above all other electric brushes on the market. She was right. After brushing with this toothbrush my teeth feel as clean as when she does them. i bought one for each of my family members and they all experienced the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Feelin&#x27; clean, it a clean machine. Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it. The RF timer is a great thing. Clean teeth w/o enamel damage.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that hates going to the dentist!  While I have been blessed with a cavity free mouth, I still hate enduring the scrape of the dentist&#x27;s tools against my teeth. And I know it&#x27;s just a matter of time until the dentist breaks out his drill...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out my regular tooth brush (you know, the kind the dentist gives out for free after he tortures you with your regular teeth cleaning) was not adequate for my needs.  You can probably chalk it up to \\&quot;user error\\&quot;....  I wasn&#x27;t brushing properly, nor long enough to really keep a clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a bunch of research on electric toothbrushes to see what the fuss was about. Turns out a circular motion cleans a greater surface area of the tooth more completely.  hmmm...  more research led me to this model - the motorized head rotates in the recommended pattern and the handle buzzes/vibrates in 30 or 45 second intervals to help you judge the brushing time of each section of your mouth.  Recommended time is 30 seconds per quadrant.  But to be honest, the buzzy feature wasn&#x27;t enough for me.  What really sold me on this model was the digital display that counts down (or counts up) the amount of time you have been brushing.  If you look at the picture of the box, you can see the digital display, it&#x27;s a little bit bigger than a business card, and about an inch thick.  As you are brushing, the display will track the quadrant you are brushing, and when your brush handle buzzes, the digital display will move to the next quadrant - giving you a visual que to move on to the next section of your mouth. It will even tell you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard! When you have completed brushing for a full two minutes (30 seconds per quadrant), the digital display will show a smiley face - and if you brush for another 30 seconds... the smiley face will wink at you!  :  It&#x27;s a flirty toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I have been using our new toothbrushes for almost two months now.  We absolutely love them.  We recieved them two days after I placed the order on Amazon.com.  I had to charge them for about 8 hours prior to the first use, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal. I never have to wonder if I&#x27;m brushing properly or if I&#x27;m brushing long enough, and I always feel like I have that \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\&quot; clean mouth.  The handle holds its&#x27; charge for a long time, I can brush for 2 1/2 minutes twice a day, for 9 days before having to recharge - however, I usually keep the brush handle in the charger when it&#x27;s not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited to see this model came with a travel case.  The travel case is a hard, sturdy plastic to protect the brush handle, and the detachable brush.  It is easy to close and open, and it holds everything securly. My toothbrush will never again travel in a ziploc baggie.  :) Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a little bit of sticker shock when I purchased two of these at the same time, and then again when I saw the cost of replacement brush heads.  But I feel like I am taking good care of my teeth, and I know my next dentist appointment will be less stressful.  Also - I know P&amp;G/Oral-B produced a good, quality product that will last a longgg time. This makes me feel like I&#x27;ve made a long term investment in myself, hopefully reducing costly dental bills in the future.  Plus P&amp;G offers coupons on their website all the time, so I know I can save some $$ on replacement heads when I need to get some new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model isn&#x27;t just an electric toothbrush - It&#x27;s quality control for your mouth!  I totally recommend it to all friends, family, co-workers, strangers... and to anyone who wants a cleaner mouth, really.  Happy Brushing.o days after I placed the order on Amazon.com.

            <li> My son&#x27;s love the toothbrushes....And i got them at a very good price....Rock on electric toothbrushes....Noting attracts girls like clean white teeth...LOL</li>
            <li> My daughter has a simular model that was given to her by her orthodontist,she really likes using it and it works great for her.  I purchased one like this from seller; Alexa&#x27;s store on Amazon. I was planning to give it to my wife for a Christmas gift,But item was received with the bottom of the box pried open and taped loosely closed with two sided tape,And the contents sound loose inside box.  I could not give it as a new Christmas gift,No one would give a pre-opened oral hygiene product,it may be tampered with or unsafe.  Seller refuses to accept return, And does not respond courteously as expected from Amazon or it&#x27;s sellers.  I assume these are good products,Be sure to purchase direct from Amazon not site sellers. Amazon cares about their buyers.  A simular model Oral-B was purchased a couple of days before Christmas and my wife is 100% satisfied with this product.   In all it seems everyone is satisfied with this product. Be sure to purchase from a trusted place.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before.  I did much research (reading reviews on all brushes) before buying this one.  It is WONDERFUL.....After brushing my teeth, they feel like they do, when I have just had them professionally cleaned at the dentist office.  Another benefit is the replacement heads are much, much, cheaper then other electric toothbrushes.  It really isn&#x27;t necessary to have the timer you will do fine without it.  However it is nice to know how long you are brushing and it is also nice to have the time of day located on your mirror.  It is also nice to be able to have more then one user, because it comes with colored circles to place on attachments to know who it belongs to.  I like it so much, that I take it with me on vacation.  Don&#x27;t hesitate buying, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I like this one better then a normal toothbrush, feel the difference on your cleaner teeth and with the display is easier</li>
            <li> I have compared the Oral-b to many electric toothbrushes and this one really does the job well.  From the polishing mode to the gum massaging, it is a very capable brush.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!  I&#x27;ve used cheaper electric brushes and they certainly didn&#x27;t live up.  This provides a \\&quot;just from the dentist\\&quot; feel and even my dentist noticed a reduction in plaque and asked if I switched brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes before (Phillips Sonicare, Braun) and this one is far superior. It is more powerful, cleans easily, and has a neat little timer that I thought was just a dumb gimmick at first- but isn&#x27;t. The timer is a 2 minute visual display that begins when the brush is turned on. It is in the form of a circle divided into 4 sections that are gradually shaded in as time progresses. I find myself going slower and more thoroughly because of it.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush from Oral B.  I was going to try another brand but had such good luck with Oral B that I decided to buy the 5000 Series and am glad I did.  Hold a good long charge and does a great job of thoroughly cleaning teeth.  Love it</li>
            <li> My dentist recommend this two years ago and wow, does it clean. I cant imagine ever having to use a regular tooth brush again. No cavities since either. Polishing head works great. It even tells you when you should change the toothbrush location to a different part of your mouth during cleaning.</li>
            <li> Purchased on 2/10/2012.  It just stopped working.  Tried new batteries, charging, etc. Nothing worked.  Will not buy again.  Waste of money.</li>
