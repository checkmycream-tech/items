            <li>i will order again soon :)</li>

            <li>This is my favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>love using these toothbrushes and strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, they are so soft that it is a pleasure to brush!</li>
            <li>So the idea for me was to find the softest bristles possible for an ideal brushing condition experience.</li>
            <li>great for teeth and soft</li>
            <li>The Oral Pre-Health All-in-One 40 Soft Toothbrush really does a excellent job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>cleans well, easy on the gums</li>
            <li>My mouth feels super clean afterwards, including a nice gum massage.</li>
            <li>; on the back is good for kind of cleaning the inside of your lips as you brush.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush out there, hands down.</li>
            <li>but they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Toothbrushes look great but arrived open.</li>
            <li>I received this toothbrush free to try from Smiley360</li>
            <li>I used to always use the free toothbrush the dentist gave me after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and feel good on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Oral B for great products and thanks Smiley360 for letting me try them.</li>
            <li>After brushing my teeth feel as smooth as clean porcelain.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, costs a little more, but in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel just as clean as after using an electric brush.  </li>
            <li>It makes your mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>and she was right!  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;free&#x27; toothbrush from my dentist was not cleaning my teeth/gums and this brush provides a much more thorough cleaning, even with the soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>These are soft on gums and really make you feel like you are getting a good cleaning during each brush.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my teeth felt so clean, just like after getting the cleaned at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>#34;wow, where did you get that toothbrush.&amp;#34; I just look at them, smile and say, &amp;#34;why, amazon.com, of course,</li>
            <li>This is a pretty cool toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I used to be a big fan of Colgate 360 brushes but these Oral-B ones just feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love the color choices and the design is actually convienant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  Hahahahaha!  </li>
            <li>I Think this toothbrush really cleans well!</li>
            <li>I love how these toothbrushes have a tongue-scraper on the back.</li>
            <li>I recently decided I needed to take better care of my teeth</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and they do provide a better cleaning than a standard tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I could be wrong, maybe they are better than the normal kind of brush, but they don&#x27;t feel good, and I doubt if it is actually cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Nice big soft brushes.</li>
            <li>I guess thats the good thing about buying a 2 pack, but i would like optimal softness for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>The crossaction bristles really leave my teeth feeling cleaner and smoother.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what i really want</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended this particular toothbrush</li>
            <li>The handles are big enough to be able to get a grip on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I normally use oral b electric toothbrush but on vacations, I like to bring manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>Brand new?</li>
            <li>It simply feels like a much higher quality toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft the bristles are, so no matter how hard I brush sometimes</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft as described,</li>
            <li>I feel like the softness has left me much too soon though.</li>
            <li>Not too soft, yet not abrasive.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit more solid and firm, but this is still \\&quot;Soft\\&quot;, I guarantee.  </li>
            <li>When I use other toothbrushes (like when traveling) I don&#x27;t feel as if my teeth are clean until I get back to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They are the same high quality as the stores and the tooth brushes have the tongue and cheek scrapers built in.</li>
            <li>now no other toothbrushes compare.</li>
            <li>soft bristles with the white gum stimulators / cheek cleaners.</li>
            <li>If your dentist recommends soft bristles and your toothbrush goes flat after about 20 uses, you should give these brushes a try.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner than with any other toothbrush I have used...including electric toothbrushes!  </li>

            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner than with any other toothbrush I have used...including electric toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li> This exact model is hard to find in stores around us, but my son and I swear by this toothbrush:</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even open the package after I realized it was this strange rubber bristles.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush exceeded my expectations by a long shot!  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth or tend to brush to hard, these toothbrushes definitely help.</li>
            <li> This was a single twin pack, for a 2-count of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush I threw the other toothbrushes in the trash.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works as an actual tongue cleaner because I just brush my tongue with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I found the description confusing - &amp;#34;Twin Pack, 2-Count&amp;#34; to me sounded as two twin packs, or four toothbrushes total.</li>
            <li> I would not have purchased this if I had understood this to mean two toothbrushes total.</li>
            <li> The cost of the tooth brushes are slightly cheaper than the stores.</li>
            <li> It has little dealies along the edge which massage gums.</li>
            <li> I think i have a unfortunate habit of brushing much too hard.</li>
            <li> However, I was brushing too hard in the beginning and made my  teeth hurt.  </li>
            <li> We used to use vibrating toothbrushes, but these work just as well and are less expensive.</li>
            <li> maybe a little expensive</li>
            <li> (not that they are in bad shape but you only get one shot at this.)</li>

            <li> Love this toothbrush. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about the rubber bristles on the edges but they are fantastic. Like a massage for your mouth. Makes me want to brush longer. Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes look great but arrived open. Will post an update once I receive some that aren&#x27;t open.</li>
            <li> Best manual toothbrush out there.  My dental hygienist recommended this particular toothbrush and she was right!  Me and my husband love them!  Your teeth feel just as clean as after using an electric brush.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. The crossaction bristles really leave my teeth feeling cleaner and smoother.  After brushing my teeth feel as smooth as clean porcelain.</li>
            <li> When people see my toothbrush, they stop and say, &amp;#34;wow, where did you get that toothbrush.&amp;#34; I just look at them, smile and say, &amp;#34;why, amazon.com, of course, where else?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband bought these by mistake and we decided to give them a try!  I like that they vibrate and help clean my teeth  the most effective way! But the are a lil pricey at the pharmacy where I bought them so the Amazon price is great! I replace my brush every 9 to 12 weeks! The price was why I gave them a four star instead of five!</li>
            <li> it is good but nothing to brag about</li>
            <li> We used to use vibrating toothbrushes, but these work just as well and are less expensive. I like the tongue cleaner on the back. My dentist said I do a great job brushing and I feel like I can give some credit to these brushes.</li>
            <li> best of the best, cant find it cheaper than here!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth or tend to brush to hard, these toothbrushes definitely help. I love how soft the bristles are, so no matter how hard I brush sometimes, I&#x27;m not hurting my gums or my teeth. I love the color choices and the design is actually convienant. These are the only manual toothbrushes I will use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more efficient toothbrush. After reading the reviews I decided to give this toothbrush a try.  I am happy I did. After using this toothbrush I threw the other toothbrushes in the trash. The Oral Pre-Health All-in-One 40 Soft Toothbrush really does a excellent job cleaning my teeth. The bristles are soft and feel good on my teeth. This is the only toothbrush I will use for now on. My grandson love it too!</li>

            <li> I gave these toothbrushes to my son and his wife.  They like these toothbrushes.  The brushes are soft as described,</li>
            <li> This toothbrush exceeded my expectations by a long shot!  My teeth feel so much cleaner than with any other toothbrush I have used...including electric toothbrushes!  The bristles are a bit more solid and firm, but this is still \\&quot;Soft\\&quot;, I guarantee.  It simply feels like a much higher quality toothbrush.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Hahahahaha!  I caught my Boxer puppy chewing on it two days after I got it, so I feel that I have to update my review to include what a wonderful chew toy it makes!  She loves it, too!</li>
            <li> Best manual toothbrush I&#x27;ve used. I normally use oral b electric toothbrush but on vacations, I like to bring manual toothbrush so I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging my toothbrush. I Think this toothbrush really cleans well!</li>
            <li> Best brush out there.  Price here compares favorably.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been cleaned by my hygienist.  However, I was brushing too hard in the beginning and made my  teeth hurt.  Now it&#x27;s okay since I&#x27;ve eased up on the pressure while brushing.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;This twin pack is a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I love using these toothbrushes and strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like it i will order again soon :)</li>
            <li> Nice big soft brushes.</li>
            <li> I think i have a unfortunate habit of brushing much too hard. So the idea for me was to find the softest bristles possible for an ideal brushing condition experience. Brand new? these are close to perfect. I feel like the softness has left me much too soon though. I guess thats the good thing about buying a 2 pack, but i would like optimal softness for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush free to try from Smiley360 and I love it.  The first time I used it my teeth felt so clean, just like after getting the cleaned at the dentist.  I could feel it cleaning between my teeth also.  I will be getting one for each family member soon.  Thanks Oral B for great products and thanks Smiley360 for letting me try them.</li>
            <li> My favorite manual toothbrushes. They came on time.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what i really want</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I was ordering the rubbery tooth brush.  I didn&#x27;t even open the package after I realized it was this strange rubber bristles.  I already have one of these that I don&#x27;t like to use.  I could be wrong, maybe they are better than the normal kind of brush, but they don&#x27;t feel good, and I doubt if it is actually cleaning my teeth.  However, it is just a personal preference, so don&#x27;t let that stop you from trying it.</li>
            <li> I love how these toothbrushes have a tongue-scraper on the back. It&#x27;s nice not needing to worry about packing a tongue-scraper in addition to your brush, when you travel. :)</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes and love the subscribe and save program to have these sent every 3 months. Perfect for a busy lifestyle!</li>
            <li> Glad I found these here. My favorite. Not too soft, yet not abrasive. The rubber bristles on the outside massage the gums.</li>
            <li> Cleaned my teeth and now I receive more kisses from the wife.</li>
            <li> These are soft on gums and really make you feel like you are getting a good cleaning during each brush.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool toothbrush. It has little dealies along the edge which massage gums.</li>
            <li> love these, the bristles get all in teeth and gum area without falling off.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, they are so soft that it is a pleasure to brush! My mouth feels super clean afterwards, including a nice gum massage. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Oral B has the very best toothbrush products.  I have a smaller mouth and it seems to work out so perfect for me but my boyfriend has a larger mouth  and they work equally as well for him.  Don,t stop making them ever please.</li>
            <li> This exact model is hard to find in stores around us, but my son and I swear by this toothbrush: soft bristles with the white gum stimulators / cheek cleaners. When I use other toothbrushes (like when traveling) I don&#x27;t feel as if my teeth are clean until I get back to this toothbrush. There are probably powered toothbrushes that &amp;#34;work better&amp;#34; but for those who need (like I do) or prefer (as does my son) to use a manual toothbrush, this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> cleans well, easy on the gums</li>
            <li> You might be reading this because you want to know how good the toothbrushes are or maybe you are just wondering why anyone would buy toothbrushes online. The cost of the tooth brushes are slightly cheaper than the stores. If there is a sale for this type of toothbrush, it might be cheaper in the store. We have a family of 7 people and often have their grandparents staying the night, so we need a lot of toothbrushes. With that said, I&#x27;m very happy with the tooth brushes. They are the same high quality as the stores and the tooth brushes have the tongue and cheek scrapers built in. I just wish they sold bigger packs!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothbrush. It makes your mouth feel really clean. The tip kind of scrubs your teeth while the rubber thingies massage your gums and the &amp;#34;tongue scraper&amp;#34; on the back is good for kind of cleaning the inside of your lips as you brush. Not sure how well it works as an actual tongue cleaner because I just brush my tongue with the toothbrush. I used to be a big fan of Colgate 360 brushes but these Oral-B ones just feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I used to always use the free toothbrush the dentist gave me after a cleaning. I recently decided I needed to take better care of my teeth (not that they are in bad shape but you only get one shot at this.) I was very happy choosing the Oral-B Pro-Health brush. You can&#x27;t beat the price and they do provide a better cleaning than a standard tooth brush.</li>
            <li> great for teeth and soft</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. The handles are big enough to be able to get a grip on. The head is just the correct size to brush with without hurting your gums. This two pack is the same price as one toothbrush in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I found the description confusing - &amp;#34;Twin Pack, 2-Count&amp;#34; to me sounded as two twin packs, or four toothbrushes total. This was a single twin pack, for a 2-count of toothbrushes. I would not have purchased this if I had understood this to mean two toothbrushes total. Hence the three-star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes in and of themselves would get five stars.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush out there, hands down.</li>
