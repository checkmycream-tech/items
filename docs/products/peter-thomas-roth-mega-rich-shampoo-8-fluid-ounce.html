            <li>Leaves my hair soft and very bright.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems to me a fancy product like that should come in a more resilient&lt;br /&gt;bottle, not in an oversized hotel sample.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Maybe a chemist would be able to tell you.</li>

            <li>The Peter Thomas Roth website had the shampoo for more money than I paid on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>After about two weeks I got the lovely shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for years after getting a sample in my hotel in Prague.</li>
            <li>Like most of the reviews here, I too encountered this shampoo while staying at a Hilton.  </li>
            <li>love the PTR shampoo and conditioner, and while the price is steep, it is still cheaper than what most salons have/charge for those brands</li>
            <li>you combine the shampoo and conditioner from PTR, it really does an amazing job at treating your hair and scalp to an exhilarating experience.</li>

            <li>It is my all-time favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Like many of the others that have reviewed this shampoo, I too stayed at a Hilton and used it.</li>
            <li>Seems to me that if they lowered the price they would probably sell more</li>
            <li>I do love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I do feel the packaging should be better</li>
            <li>I like it a lot and love the smell.  </li>
            <li>but still better then many others out there.</li>
            <li>I love Peter Thomas Roth products</li>

            <li>All this serves to make me feel more put together and confident.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Peter Thomas Roth mega rich shampoo leaves your hair soft and luxurious and delightfully fragrant.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is vibrant for a good morning wake up,  but not feminine, and the way it leaves my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>This has a nice clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and my hair looks and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo it leaves your hair extremely clean and fresh</li>
            <li>My wife and I both find it to be a very rich shampoo.</li>
            <li>I originally used this shampoo during a stay at a Hilton hotel and really liked the way it made my hair feel and the gender-neutral smell.</li>
            <li>high cost for shampoo but great product.</li>
            <li>, I just loved it very much.</li>
            <li>I first used it while staying at Hilton and loved it.</li>
            <li>We received this as a hotel guest sample at the Hilton and WOW - fell in love with the shampoo, conditioner and the body lotion - gives great shine, volume and LOVE the smell....</li>
            <li>The shampoo was good at first (during the time i used at the hotel).  </li>
            <li>Just love love this shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves all the family&#x27;s hair in wonderful condition (very manageable and it gently removes built up residue from minerals in the well water, etc).  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, have fine hair and it gives it body.</li>
            <li>My hair can be very dry and in a hotel, it&#x27;s downright brittle after a day or two at a conference, but this shampoo was great!  </li>
            <li>I wish it were more easily available</li>
            <li>This shampoo feels great and leaves my hair feeling soft, but manageable.  </li>
            <li>It cleans but leaves my hair shiny and full of body!</li>
            <li>It has a light scent, and left my hair incredibly shiny and silky.  </li>
            <li>styling is easy.  </li>
            <li>First tried this product at Hilton and really liked it.</li>
            <li>It might work fine if you had oily hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that is lifeless.</li>
            <li>I have fine, highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair -- but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>Because my hair is so fine, I don&#x27;t use a conditioner either.  </li>
            <li>Itâ€™s fortifying and makes my hair feel strong and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Best hair product hands down!</li>
            <li>and it made my hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>The shampoo is foam-rich and the conditioner makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>paraben free,</li>
            <li>My husband and I had tried this at a hotel where we stayed and liked it so much we ordered it when we returned home.</li>
            <li>He liked it so much that we decided to purchase the shampoo for home.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of cruelty free options to try.</li>
            <li>anyone wants an amazing shampoo,  this is it.</li>
            <li>found out about it from a hotel stay &amp; liked it so much, decided to order it!&lt;br /&gt;luv</li>
            <li>I bought these products for my mom as well, and she experienced the same issue.</li>
            <li>I enjoy a lot of PTR products</li>
            <li>My Girlfriend Loved it and will want more later on, some time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff for colored hair or natural hair color.</li>
            <li>Everytime I use this product it leaves my hair smelling good and soft.......</li>
            <li>Many higher end shampoos can easily go for $30 a bottle.</li>
            <li>I just love them right away.</li>
            <li>is that I can go through one bottle in under 2 months and the price is kind of high.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is rich and lathers luxuriously.</li>
            <li>I now use PTR Mega Rich exclusively.</li>
            <li>Rich lather.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Peter Thomas Roth Mega Rich Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of the mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use the PTR Mega Rich Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>Not as rich and moisturizing as I would like.</li>
            <li>Hair feels really clean.</li>
            <li>No buildup, clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>, my hair feels great and doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li>Love this gentile, yet clean, pure shampoo  </li>
            <li>do not do anything special except treat myself to this shampoo</li>
            <li>This shampoo feels very bubbly and fresh, a bit of a lemon zinging through that great clear shampoo does wonders.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiny and full of body...</li>
            <li>We brought home the samples and then ordered the full size from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo does leave my hair nice and soft but it takes a lot of product to lather and it contains Sulfates which I am avoiding.  </li>
            <li>It feels super clean.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>my hair, which is medium length &amp; color treated to cover grays, feels soft and has a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I should have known not to buy something that is primarily given complimentary at hotels</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this is that it has a pleasing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, which is now wavy, and usualy frizzy, so I spend a lot of time blow drying with a large brush to straighten and smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t skip the Peter Thomas Roth Mega-Rich conditioner - these two products go hand in hand to give you a full head of clean and fresh hair.</li>
            <li>I also really enjoy how it somehow makes my hair easier to manage and fall in place better naturally while my hair is getting</li>
            <li>If you get lucky when you stay at an upscale Hilton they will supply samples of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>5 stars, quick turnaround by seller</li>
            <li>Prompt handling of order with quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product but this particular item is sold at 8.5 fl oz, but when the product arrived, it is only 8.0 fl oz., not 8.5.  </li>
            <li>I really its fragrance while it&#x27;s not too strong for the nose.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely harsh on hair, especially fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>and I have had more people tell me in the past year that my hair looks great - and comment on how fast it has grown....</li>
            <li>The best shampoo for thick hair!</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and this stuff gives body and shine, and my blow dry-round brush style holds all day.</li>
            <li>We both have fine hair, mine much thicker and</li>
            <li>Great product but a little over priced.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t create a bunch of lather, which is nice, because it actually feels like it&#x27;s cleaning my scalp and hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>: It leaves my hair feeling so fresh, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>but he says its as good as he expected..</li>
            <li>hair feels soft and more manageable ...</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the pain and suffering done to animals for cosmetic research.</li>
            <li>I feel it is worth the money however</li>
            <li>Worth every penny,</li>
            <li>well worth</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect shampoo -- does not dry out my hair or weigh it down.</li>
            <li>but I find I have to use a fairly large amount to thoroughly clean my har.</li>
            <li>I loved the conditioner...love, love, love it but found the shampoo to dry my hair out and causes it to be limp.</li>
            <li>If you want to treat your scalp right, get this product, gentlemen.  </li>
            <li>The majority of reviews for this shampoo are positive and I agree!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo more thatn any other I have ever used!</li>
            <li>it only takes a small amount to make your hair feel so clean and smells great!!</li>
            <li>I also have dry hair because I color, and these hair products have been a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both of us like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Very good for thin hair.</li>
            <li>It worked great in the hard water of the hotel.  </li>
            <li>I love Peter Thomas Roth products and especially his shampoo, Would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about it.</li>
            <li>We were first introduced to this shampoo and conditioner when we stayed at a Hilton hotel.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a bigger bottle with more of a quantity discount?</li>
            <li>I used this first as one of the toiletries offered at a Hilton Hotel.  </li>
            <li>and that is saying a lot for me as I am generally pretty frugal.</li>
            <li>The hair was soft and smooth</li>
            <li>, the price is higher than your mass market hair products but in all reality, this is a mid-range price.</li>
            <li>I really think this stuff would catch on if they did!</li>
            <li>I have used Peter Thomas Roth skin care, and a leave in conditioner, but this is the first time I am using the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to take the bottle I ordered into the house yet because the odor (very heavy perfume smell) is so overwhelming.</li>
            <li>the way it makes hair feel so clean &amp; soft!</li>
            <li>After the samples ran out I continued to use up the rest of my regular products and then ordered a full size bottle of mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>Well, this a very large bottle which was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoos either give me flyaway hair or overly flat hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I just buy it on Amazon, the price is reasonable and much easier to hit &amp;#34;Buy&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>Crappy hotel shampoo and conditioner is not professional, and I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended ... a little pricey but good product</li>
            <li>This has a very good foaming and lather so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is OK but it seems to dry out my hair and leaves it flying around.  </li>
            <li>I still need to do extra moisturizing every couple of days, but this shampoo is easy on my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it really helped my hair stay static free and really shiny all winter long when I usually have the most issues with it.  </li>
            <li>This was too large for the items and they were damaged upon arrival.  </li>
            <li>Got a large sample of this and used it about three times.  </li>
            <li>Just bought the large tube, so I&#x27;m sold on this.</li>
            <li>just like many other commenting fans, I too first tried this while staying at a Hilton in NYC -&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I think both men and women will enjoy this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It seems to make my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much nicer and thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I found them at Amazon.com when I came back to China.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She wants to say thank you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pricey though.</li>
            <li>gentle yet</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, something like tea, and it s a &#x27;foo-foo&#x27; thing I do for myself.</li>
            <li>I have bleached hair and this shampoo really keeps my hair moist and prevents breakage.</li>
            <li>I was very surprises about it</li>
            <li>My friends have even commented on how my hair looks on the most rough and tumble days (hiking, biking, swimming, running, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair really well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>You do not have to use much as it lathers up very well.</li>
            <li>have too much conditioner built in.</li>
            <li>Not drying and very creamy.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>least, the cardboard package smelled good in the mailbox...</li>
            <li>I have been pretty lucky to stay at some nice hotels such as Hilton, Intercontinental, Hyatt Regency, Resistance, Andaz, Indigo and a few others.</li>
            <li>I too first learned of this product while staying at a Hilton Resort in New Orleans.</li>
            <li>My husband first discovered this shampoo at a New York hotel where we stay whenever we are in the city.  </li>
            <li>Having been in the sun and water for 3 weeks it kept my colored hair from fading and becoming dry.  </li>
            <li>The online offering is not only convenient, but priced right as well!</li>
            <li>, so consumers should note that I have very long, fine hair, which is wavy because of graying, and I color</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t do near as much as what PTR does for me!</li>
            <li>I just shampoo, use a volumizing gel, and blow dry for a great, long lasting style that I can brush through!  </li>
            <li>Itâ€™s extremely nourishing as it really helps hair get shiny, strong and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Now at last I have found it online, will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them and the body lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little herby and fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>- I just wish it lathered a little bit more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to pay for a bit of indulgence but this is a bit too expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, just expensive for the amount.</li>
            <li>I normally use salon shampoos.  </li>
            <li>hairdresser (who I had not seen in several months for a long overdue trim) even commented on how healthy my hair was</li>
            <li>It gives my normal wavy hair softness and volume.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money considering the quality you are getting.</li>
            <li>I suffer from extremely oily and baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>have fine non chemically treated hair - tend to wash every other day (unless on the weekends) -</li>
            <li>This helped tame my frizz for sure, but I read PTR now tests on animals because they ship to China and it is required for import.</li>
            <li>A significant difference in the soft feel and the shininess of my hair which has always been dry.  </li>
            <li>My gray looked more alive and my hair was fluffy</li>
            <li>It lasted many months as only a pea-sized dot is needed on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and so soft and manageable when used with their mega rich conditioner (also very expensive) and as I said, this stuff really really is good.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, but I was a bit surprised it took two different shipments, as I ordered the pair of 8 oz tubes at the same time.  </li>
            <li>glued aluminum soft lid was unglued (for both ordered bottles !)</li>
            <li>I have been an avid user ever since and refuse to go back to anything else!  </li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so silky and soft!</li>
            <li>It is a light shampoo which doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, back to oily, flat hair.</li>
            <li>- it is a bit pricey compared to other products on the market but a little goes a very long way - not to mention the smell is amazing and clean</li>
            <li>With these hair products I can actually allow my hair to air dry, and it looks soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>If I miss a day, it&#x27;s usually fine for a few hours, then</li>
            <li>I started using it because it was the one shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my 25 year old daughter&#x27;s head itch.  </li>
            <li>It seems like I have tried nearly every volumizer, thickener, oil-free product on the market.</li>
            <li>I use this with the shampoo at the same time so that it rinses out very well.</li>
            <li>This is far from that experience.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft, and shinny with lots of volume.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I AM FAIRLY OLD</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised).</li>
            <li>you are really sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I could NOT get a comb through my long locks after using this product just once for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The second day I shampooed and conditioned my hair, I noticed it felt very silky.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot for business and usually carry my own trusted brand as usually the brands/types of shampoo/conditioner within hotels are not the best and leave my hair dry and difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li>so much that I purchased it at $18 a pop for my home use, but because it&#x27;s 2-3 times as expensive as other shampoo that&#x27;s yet decent though not as good.  </li>
            <li>I had used tiny bottles obtained in hotels before, and finally broke down and ordered more.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life that actually visibly improved my hair from Day 1.</li>
            <li>I really am not a beauty product fan - I am super low maintenance due to impatience - but this shampoo is totally worth it to</li>
            <li>I normally only use high quality salon products, or luxury shampoos,  although I have never worked as hair stylist, I did do cosmetology 25 years ago, and I feel these products are tops.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just noticed my hair has a tendency to be straight and doesn&#x27;t hold curls as long after using the curling iron.</li>
            <li>I live in a rural area and had to order it.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets very sweaty from my workouts and this stuff gets out the bad and keeps in the good.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair way to dry (though admittedly very voluminous).</li>
            <li>Just received and used right away in excitement, and according to past reviews by other users, I thought my long blonde, color treated hair would be so soft and smooth after using it...</li>
            <li>and I find it necessary to use more than I usually do with other shampoos, which, given the cost, I find this to be something I will only use for certain occasions and not on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny, silky yet feeling extremely clean and a little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li>A little pricey and wish it would give a little more sudsy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Really brings out the curl in my frizzy fine hair, but too expensive to get on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>In general, this is not the daily shampoo to use cuz&#x27;</li>
            <li>Way more than I&#x27;d normally pay for shampoo, but I&#x27;ve reduced the number of times I wash my hair to a couple times a week (unless my hair is particularly dirty for some reason), so it evens out.</li>
            <li>Unlike the conditioner, it just takes a little and lasts a long times, making the price very reasonable.</li>

            <li> Leaves hair shiny , full buddy with great smell</li>
            <li> Start your grooming routine right!!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this shampoo while staying in a very nice hotel and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> right now I am using the conditioner kiss my face which is great</li>
            <li> All you have to do is brush it out and it looks great for the whole day!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and very bright.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to me a fancy product like that should come in a more resilient&lt;br /&gt;bottle, not in an oversized hotel sample.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Maybe a chemist would be able to tell you.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product I will be buying more</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is perfect for my Northern European curly hair.</li>
            <li> Healthy hair, healthy scalp.  </li>
            <li> The Peter Thomas Roth website had the shampoo for more money than I paid on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> After about two weeks I got the lovely shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This is better than anything I have purchased from my salon.  </li>

            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I love</li>

            <li> AND MY HAIR SEEMS TO LAY BETTER,  </li>
            <li> I have never found a shampoo I like better</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo...</li>
            <li> and my hairdresser has remarked on how healthy it is.</li>
            <li> I love this Peter Thomas Roth Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years after getting a sample in my hotel in Prague.</li>
            <li> Like most of the reviews here, I too encountered this shampoo while staying at a Hilton.  </li>
            <li> love the PTR shampoo and conditioner, and while the price is steep, it is still cheaper than what most salons have/charge for those brands</li>
            <li> you combine the shampoo and conditioner from PTR, it really does an amazing job at treating your hair and scalp to an exhilarating experience.</li>
            <li> and you are sure to love it.</li>
            <li> It is my all-time favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Like many of the others that have reviewed this shampoo, I too stayed at a Hilton and used it.</li>
            <li> Seems to me that if they lowered the price they would probably sell more</li>
            <li> I do love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I do feel the packaging should be better</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and love the smell.  </li>
            <li> but still better then many others out there.</li>
            <li> I love Peter Thomas Roth products</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t like this, even though it really smells great.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but this is definitely top of the line.</li>
            <li> He (and I) love it.  </li>
            <li> Let me see, how many lines will they let me write.  </li>
            <li> All this serves to make me feel more put together and confident.  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth mega rich shampoo leaves your hair soft and luxurious and delightfully fragrant.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is vibrant for a good morning wake up,  but not feminine, and the way it leaves my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> This has a nice clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and my hair looks and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo it leaves your hair extremely clean and fresh</li>
            <li> My wife and I both find it to be a very rich shampoo.</li>
            <li> I originally used this shampoo during a stay at a Hilton hotel and really liked the way it made my hair feel and the gender-neutral smell.</li>
            <li> high cost for shampoo but great product.</li>
            <li> , I just loved it very much.</li>
            <li> I first used it while staying at Hilton and loved it.</li>
            <li> We received this as a hotel guest sample at the Hilton and WOW - fell in love with the shampoo, conditioner and the body lotion - gives great shine, volume and LOVE the smell....</li>
            <li> The shampoo was good at first (during the time i used at the hotel).  </li>
            <li> Just love love this shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves all the family&#x27;s hair in wonderful condition (very manageable and it gently removes built up residue from minerals in the well water, etc).  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, have fine hair and it gives it body.</li>
            <li> My hair can be very dry and in a hotel, it&#x27;s downright brittle after a day or two at a conference, but this shampoo was great!  </li>
            <li> I wish it were more easily available</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels great and leaves my hair feeling soft, but manageable.  </li>
            <li> It cleans but leaves my hair shiny and full of body!</li>
            <li> It has a light scent, and left my hair incredibly shiny and silky.  </li>
            <li> styling is easy.  </li>
            <li> First tried this product at Hilton and really liked it.</li>
            <li> It might work fine if you had oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that is lifeless.</li>
            <li> I have fine, highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair -- but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so fine, I don&#x27;t use a conditioner either.  </li>
            <li> Itâ€™s fortifying and makes my hair feel strong and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Best hair product hands down!</li>
            <li> and it made my hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> The shampoo is foam-rich and the conditioner makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> paraben free,</li>
            <li> My husband and I had tried this at a hotel where we stayed and liked it so much we ordered it when we returned home.</li>
            <li> He liked it so much that we decided to purchase the shampoo for home.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of cruelty free options to try.</li>
            <li> anyone wants an amazing shampoo,  this is it.</li>
            <li> found out about it from a hotel stay &amp; liked it so much, decided to order it!&lt;br /&gt;luv</li>
            <li> I bought these products for my mom as well, and she experienced the same issue.</li>
            <li> I enjoy a lot of PTR products</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend Loved it and will want more later on, some time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff for colored hair or natural hair color.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this product it leaves my hair smelling good and soft.......</li>
            <li> Many higher end shampoos can easily go for $30 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I just love them right away.</li>
            <li> is that I can go through one bottle in under 2 months and the price is kind of high.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is rich and lathers luxuriously.</li>
            <li> I now use PTR Mega Rich exclusively.</li>
            <li> Rich lather.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Peter Thomas Roth Mega Rich Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of the mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use the PTR Mega Rich Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> Not as rich and moisturizing as I would like.</li>
            <li> Hair feels really clean.</li>
            <li> No buildup, clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> , my hair feels great and doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> Love this gentile, yet clean, pure shampoo  </li>
            <li> do not do anything special except treat myself to this shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels very bubbly and fresh, a bit of a lemon zinging through that great clear shampoo does wonders.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and full of body...</li>
            <li> We brought home the samples and then ordered the full size from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo does leave my hair nice and soft but it takes a lot of product to lather and it contains Sulfates which I am avoiding.  </li>
            <li> It feels super clean.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> my hair, which is medium length &amp; color treated to cover grays, feels soft and has a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I should have known not to buy something that is primarily given complimentary at hotels</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is that it has a pleasing fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, which is now wavy, and usualy frizzy, so I spend a lot of time blow drying with a large brush to straighten and smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t skip the Peter Thomas Roth Mega-Rich conditioner - these two products go hand in hand to give you a full head of clean and fresh hair.</li>
            <li> I also really enjoy how it somehow makes my hair easier to manage and fall in place better naturally while my hair is getting</li>
            <li> If you get lucky when you stay at an upscale Hilton they will supply samples of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> 5 stars, quick turnaround by seller</li>
            <li> Prompt handling of order with quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product but this particular item is sold at 8.5 fl oz, but when the product arrived, it is only 8.0 fl oz., not 8.5.  </li>
            <li> I really its fragrance while it&#x27;s not too strong for the nose.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely harsh on hair, especially fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> and I have had more people tell me in the past year that my hair looks great - and comment on how fast it has grown....</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and this stuff gives body and shine, and my blow dry-round brush style holds all day.</li>
            <li> We both have fine hair, mine much thicker and</li>
            <li> Great product but a little over priced.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t create a bunch of lather, which is nice, because it actually feels like it&#x27;s cleaning my scalp and hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> : It leaves my hair feeling so fresh, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> but he says its as good as he expected..</li>
            <li> hair feels soft and more manageable ...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth the pain and suffering done to animals for cosmetic research.</li>
            <li> I feel it is worth the money however</li>
            <li> Worth every penny,</li>
            <li> well worth</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shampoo -- does not dry out my hair or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> but I find I have to use a fairly large amount to thoroughly clean my har.</li>
            <li> I loved the conditioner...love, love, love it but found the shampoo to dry my hair out and causes it to be limp.</li>
            <li> If you want to treat your scalp right, get this product, gentlemen.  </li>
            <li> The majority of reviews for this shampoo are positive and I agree!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo more thatn any other I have ever used!</li>
            <li> it only takes a small amount to make your hair feel so clean and smells great!!</li>
            <li> I also have dry hair because I color, and these hair products have been a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both of us like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Very good for thin hair.</li>
            <li> It worked great in the hard water of the hotel.  </li>
            <li> I love Peter Thomas Roth products and especially his shampoo, Would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about it.</li>
            <li> We were first introduced to this shampoo and conditioner when we stayed at a Hilton hotel.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a bigger bottle with more of a quantity discount?</li>
            <li> I used this first as one of the toiletries offered at a Hilton Hotel.  </li>
            <li> and that is saying a lot for me as I am generally pretty frugal.</li>
            <li> The hair was soft and smooth</li>
            <li> , the price is higher than your mass market hair products but in all reality, this is a mid-range price.</li>
            <li> I really think this stuff would catch on if they did!</li>
            <li> I have used Peter Thomas Roth skin care, and a leave in conditioner, but this is the first time I am using the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to take the bottle I ordered into the house yet because the odor (very heavy perfume smell) is so overwhelming.</li>
            <li> the way it makes hair feel so clean &amp; soft!</li>
            <li> After the samples ran out I continued to use up the rest of my regular products and then ordered a full size bottle of mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> Well, this a very large bottle which was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Most shampoos either give me flyaway hair or overly flat hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I just buy it on Amazon, the price is reasonable and much easier to hit &amp;#34;Buy&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> Crappy hotel shampoo and conditioner is not professional, and I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended ... a little pricey but good product</li>
            <li> This has a very good foaming and lather so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is OK but it seems to dry out my hair and leaves it flying around.  </li>
            <li> I still need to do extra moisturizing every couple of days, but this shampoo is easy on my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it really helped my hair stay static free and really shiny all winter long when I usually have the most issues with it.  </li>
            <li> This was too large for the items and they were damaged upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> Got a large sample of this and used it about three times.  </li>
            <li> Just bought the large tube, so I&#x27;m sold on this.</li>
            <li> just like many other commenting fans, I too first tried this while staying at a Hilton in NYC -&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, I think both men and women will enjoy this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much nicer and thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I found them at Amazon.com when I came back to China.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She wants to say thank you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very pricey though.</li>
            <li> gentle yet</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, something like tea, and it s a &#x27;foo-foo&#x27; thing I do for myself.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair and this shampoo really keeps my hair moist and prevents breakage.</li>
            <li> I was very surprises about it</li>
            <li> My friends have even commented on how my hair looks on the most rough and tumble days (hiking, biking, swimming, running, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair really well</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> You do not have to use much as it lathers up very well.</li>
            <li> have too much conditioner built in.</li>
            <li> Not drying and very creamy.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> least, the cardboard package smelled good in the mailbox...</li>
            <li> I have been pretty lucky to stay at some nice hotels such as Hilton, Intercontinental, Hyatt Regency, Resistance, Andaz, Indigo and a few others.</li>
            <li> I too first learned of this product while staying at a Hilton Resort in New Orleans.</li>
            <li> My husband first discovered this shampoo at a New York hotel where we stay whenever we are in the city.  </li>
            <li> Having been in the sun and water for 3 weeks it kept my colored hair from fading and becoming dry.  </li>
            <li> The online offering is not only convenient, but priced right as well!</li>
            <li> , so consumers should note that I have very long, fine hair, which is wavy because of graying, and I color</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t do near as much as what PTR does for me!</li>
            <li> I just shampoo, use a volumizing gel, and blow dry for a great, long lasting style that I can brush through!  </li>
            <li> Itâ€™s extremely nourishing as it really helps hair get shiny, strong and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Now at last I have found it online, will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them and the body lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little herby and fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> - I just wish it lathered a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to pay for a bit of indulgence but this is a bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, just expensive for the amount.</li>
            <li> I normally use salon shampoos.  </li>
            <li> hairdresser (who I had not seen in several months for a long overdue trim) even commented on how healthy my hair was</li>
            <li> It gives my normal wavy hair softness and volume.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra money considering the quality you are getting.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely oily and baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> have fine non chemically treated hair - tend to wash every other day (unless on the weekends) -</li>
            <li> This helped tame my frizz for sure, but I read PTR now tests on animals because they ship to China and it is required for import.</li>
            <li> A significant difference in the soft feel and the shininess of my hair which has always been dry.  </li>
            <li> My gray looked more alive and my hair was fluffy</li>
            <li> It lasted many months as only a pea-sized dot is needed on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and so soft and manageable when used with their mega rich conditioner (also very expensive) and as I said, this stuff really really is good.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but I was a bit surprised it took two different shipments, as I ordered the pair of 8 oz tubes at the same time.  </li>
            <li> glued aluminum soft lid was unglued (for both ordered bottles !)</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user ever since and refuse to go back to anything else!  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel so silky and soft!</li>
            <li> It is a light shampoo which doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, back to oily, flat hair.</li>
            <li> - it is a bit pricey compared to other products on the market but a little goes a very long way - not to mention the smell is amazing and clean</li>
            <li> With these hair products I can actually allow my hair to air dry, and it looks soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> If I miss a day, it&#x27;s usually fine for a few hours, then</li>
            <li> I started using it because it was the one shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my 25 year old daughter&#x27;s head itch.  </li>
            <li> It seems like I have tried nearly every volumizer, thickener, oil-free product on the market.</li>
            <li> I use this with the shampoo at the same time so that it rinses out very well.</li>
            <li> This is far from that experience.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft, and shinny with lots of volume.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I AM FAIRLY OLD</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old.</li>
            <li> but I was surprised).</li>
            <li> you are really sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I could NOT get a comb through my long locks after using this product just once for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The second day I shampooed and conditioned my hair, I noticed it felt very silky.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for business and usually carry my own trusted brand as usually the brands/types of shampoo/conditioner within hotels are not the best and leave my hair dry and difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> so much that I purchased it at $18 a pop for my home use, but because it&#x27;s 2-3 times as expensive as other shampoo that&#x27;s yet decent though not as good.  </li>
            <li> I had used tiny bottles obtained in hotels before, and finally broke down and ordered more.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life that actually visibly improved my hair from Day 1.</li>
            <li> I really am not a beauty product fan - I am super low maintenance due to impatience - but this shampoo is totally worth it to</li>
            <li> I normally only use high quality salon products, or luxury shampoos,  although I have never worked as hair stylist, I did do cosmetology 25 years ago, and I feel these products are tops.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just noticed my hair has a tendency to be straight and doesn&#x27;t hold curls as long after using the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I live in a rural area and had to order it.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets very sweaty from my workouts and this stuff gets out the bad and keeps in the good.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair way to dry (though admittedly very voluminous).</li>
            <li> Just received and used right away in excitement, and according to past reviews by other users, I thought my long blonde, color treated hair would be so soft and smooth after using it...</li>
            <li> and I find it necessary to use more than I usually do with other shampoos, which, given the cost, I find this to be something I will only use for certain occasions and not on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny, silky yet feeling extremely clean and a little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little pricey and wish it would give a little more sudsy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Really brings out the curl in my frizzy fine hair, but too expensive to get on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> In general, this is not the daily shampoo to use cuz&#x27;</li>
            <li> Way more than I&#x27;d normally pay for shampoo, but I&#x27;ve reduced the number of times I wash my hair to a couple times a week (unless my hair is particularly dirty for some reason), so it evens out.</li>
            <li> Unlike the conditioner, it just takes a little and lasts a long times, making the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> , it is gentle on my color treated hair without drying it out, a little goes a long way, and my hair stays cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes the hair glow and feels amazing, but it&#x27;s expensive for the little quantity on the tube, so if you wash daily and have long hair count on one tube a week which will make it 80</li>
            <li> I use as little as possible, and wash my hair twice, and so far, being conservative, it has lasted a while.</li>
            <li> I do only shampoo/condition my hair every other day to not dry it out.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I woke up the next morning shocked to see my hair with amazing body and richness.  </li>
            <li> If you want to invest in a non-professional shampoo, just go to your local grocery/drug store and buy the same size (8.5 oz) hair shampoo in another well-known brand for half the price of this, as you&#x27;ll get the same effect!</li>
            <li> I just personally found the shampoo did not put any life of fluff in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am going to use them in a long time.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was too heavy, it really weighed my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a problem getting a comb through my long, color treated hair, which is always on the slightly dry side, but I have always used &amp;#34;PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I switched back to my other shampoo to test out my theory that this shampoo might truly work.</li>
            <li> This gives my dry hair lots of shine and body.</li>
            <li> One of the changes is that a section of my hair feels ratty, dry, and tangly after I shampoo it.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo is such a personal thing that it is hard to give a proper opinion.</li>
            <li> This item leaked all over the rest of the loosely packed items.  </li>
            <li> I know it is expensive, but you really do not need very much of it because it lathers up well if you use enough liquid</li>
            <li> I found some of the product, but it is very limited in distribution.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo, I suspect, it not real Peter Thomas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not available locally.  </li>
            <li> I only recommend this product to those having seriously oily hairs if you want to use it daily.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of flat, limp hair I highly recommend trying this shampoo.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about shampoos because I have very thick, stiff hair that needs to be washed every single day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self- as earlier stated, I have been using this product for about a year - a few of the bottles would not close and one of the tips actually broke off in the tube itself - so I usually have to store the bottle upside down in my shower rack...</li>
            <li> So, I only recommend to squeeze a small pea size into your hand and then work it into your hair.  </li>
            <li> the extra money vs. store bought shampoos I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients label, which was not on the website, I returned it due to it containing SULFATES.</li>
            <li> That means that heavy shampoos just weighh my hair down and make it flat.  </li>
            <li> Only need a little less than half of what you would use for shampoo amount.</li>
            <li> Alas, I may have to age it in the garage for a while - which is kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> is bad for baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> only negative thing I can say about it, which has nothing to do with the product itself, is that he cap on the tubes</li>
            <li> This item was packaged loosely with several other items in an unpadded box that was approximately 18&amp;#34; by 18&amp;#34; by 12&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have wasted so much money on products which failed to deliver on their claims.</li>
            <li> My hair was noticeably thicker and fuller, less greasy that day.</li>
            <li> Almost half gone.</li>
            <li> Two of the items appeared to have been previously opened as the seals were missing and torn.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little drying at times though.</li>
            <li> so I bought this even though it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> However, it is a little too watery</li>
            <li> $ a month even if you follow instructions of mixing little bit with water</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair once every four days or so and combined with using a small amount it should last awhile but at $18 it is expensive.</li>
            <li> no blowdrying...which is typically a no no for me with my long crazy hair as it is.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, Asian, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> not that this a huge deal, but a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> I tried this out at a few Hilton hotels.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few shampoos that leave my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Searched for deals &amp; ordered a few.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also not soft and very hard to comb.  </li>
            <li> If it claims to have all these vitamins, not sure what they are doing.</li>
            <li> Usually I carry with me a shampoo and conditioner , but that time I forgot them home</li>
            <li> I still used it : it is no better than 1 dollar shampoo from Kmart.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because it&#x27;s so darn expensive.</li>
            <li> Use with the moisturizer (small dab).  </li>
            <li> It was a late night for me after a long day with the client, and I was so tired, all I could do was shower, brush my hair and get to bed...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually close well, and the liquid can drain out if you sit on its cap.  </li>
            <li> I no longer get that gross, uncomfortable \\&quot;does</li>
            <li> My hair is used to soft water and normally gets tangled and nasty in hard water.  </li>
            <li> I found it no better than any common product.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair, so brushing and hair drying alone can be a challenge without the added issues of the wrong shampoo/</li>
            <li> It lathers up in our hard water and rinses out thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I know stuff like this happens but at least send me another one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cost me anything, but it was confusing.</li>
            <li> I believe I stayed shocked all day and came back to the hotel and loaded up on the PTR sample sizes the hotel had.  </li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who does not like a lot of things in products that we do not need and are not good for us.</li>
            <li> No parabens or other bad ingredients you don&#x27;t want on your head.</li>
            <li> But is too expensive.</li>
            <li> , it is way toooooooooooooo expensive a price for this non-professional, drying hair product.  </li>
            <li> by lunchtime, something horrifying has happened: It&#x27;s stringy and even smells odd, no matter what shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I usually hate the samples hotels have because it dries out my thick, semi curly hair.</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> I find it impossible to figure out which shampoo to buy.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I do not feel bad about paying the asking price for Peter Thomas Roth hair products.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment this was!  </li>
            <li> So disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> One day, I stayed at a hotel that had this brand in its rooms and after I used it I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t feel horrible!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> 5/5 for the shampoo, 0/5 for the tube/bottle container.&lt;br /&gt;The glued aluminum soft lid was unglued (for both ordered bottles !)&lt;br /&gt;and about 1/4 of the content of each bottle had spilled.&lt;br /&gt;At least, the cardboard package smelled good in the mailbox...&lt;br /&gt;Seems to me a fancy product like that should come in a more resilient&lt;br /&gt;bottle, not in an oversized hotel sample.</li>
            <li> Great Product!! Excellent size!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this shampoo. It was in my brothers Hilton Universal City Hotel. I have been using this product about 10 years now.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is such a personal thing that it is hard to give a proper opinion. I just personally found the shampoo did not put any life of fluff in my hair. I wear my hair very short, Police regulation short, and have salt and pepper hair. If it claims to have all these vitamins, not sure what they are doing. Maybe a chemist would be able to tell you. I also got this at a Hilton Hotel as the in room supply.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and very bright.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product I will be buying more</li>
            <li> This shampoo is OK but it seems to dry out my hair and leaves it flying around.  It might work fine if you had oily hair.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo while staying at a Hilton hotel.  I like the cleansing power - I just wish it lathered a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that is lifeless. This shampoo is rich and lathers luxuriously. Seems to thicken up my hair and give it some life for styling. Unlike the conditioner, it just takes a little and lasts a long times, making the price very reasonable. The smell is a little herby and fresh and clean. This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Most shampoos either give me flyaway hair or overly flat hair.  This shampoo is perfect for my Northern European curly hair.</li>
            <li> Way more than I&#x27;d normally pay for shampoo, but I&#x27;ve reduced the number of times I wash my hair to a couple times a week (unless my hair is particularly dirty for some reason), so it evens out. It doesn&#x27;t create a bunch of lather, which is nice, because it actually feels like it&#x27;s cleaning my scalp and hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> great stuff !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever....I have oily hair and this stuff works wonders</li>
            <li> I started using it because it was the one shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my 25 year old daughter&#x27;s head itch.  It also doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients we should stay away from.  Healthy hair, healthy scalp.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Well, I loved the shampoo on my stay at Hilton Minneapolis so got this with my Amazon rewards.  Well, this a very large bottle which was reasonably priced.  This has a very good foaming and lather so a little goes a long way.  So, I only recommend to squeeze a small pea size into your hand and then work it into your hair.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t have a floral scent so great for guys.  Overall, I think both men and women will enjoy this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells nice and keeps my hair from drying out.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this too.  Leaves her hair very nice and manageable.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo when I stayed at the Hilton Hotel.  I couldn&#x27;t believe my hair after I used it.  It looked great.  I checked around the stores and couldn&#x27;t find it.  The Peter Thomas Roth website had the shampoo for more money than I paid on Amazon.  It was a great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, hair feels clean, healthy and smells nic.</li>
            <li> Had used product provided by Hilton hotel and loved it, so was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  It makes my hair much more manageable.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was in Hilton hotel and I used their shampoo, I was amazed about the good effect it had on my hair. Usually I carry with me a shampoo and conditioner , but that time I forgot them home so I used the hotel&#x27;s and it made my hair shiny and smooth, I just loved it very much.</li>
            <li> I recently stayed at the Hilton during a business trip and the hotel provided Peter Thomas Roth products.  They are absolutely awesome!  The lather and smell leave your hair smelling and feeling rejuvenated (In the Manly sense!)  After using their products, I had to go online and get some.  I found some of the product, but it is very limited in distribution.  I found the shampoo, but could not find the conditioner.  They also have a body lotion that has a very nice smell for a man and a peppermint mouth wash which I could not find online anywhere.  I wish there were more PTR products out there for the consumer!</li>
            <li> I tried these products at a hotel I was staying at in San Diego and just had to order them. They truly have a wonderful scent and give my hair tons of body and it just looks great after I use the shampoo and conditioner. Highly recommend them and the body lotion. I&#x27;ve never tried a cream like this that truly hydrates, is not greasy at all and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I first tried this shampoo while staying in a very nice hotel and really liked it.  It seems to make my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo my mother will use.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely oily and baby fine hair. Over the years I have wasted so much money on products which failed to deliver on their claims. It seems like I have tried nearly every volumizer, thickener, oil-free product on the market. I happened to try this product while staying at a hotel last year. My hair was noticeably thicker and fuller, less greasy that day. I switched back to my other shampoo to test out my theory that this shampoo might truly work. Sure enough, back to oily, flat hair. I now use PTR Mega Rich exclusively. My hair stylist even noticed the difference after using this shampoo. My hair is so much nicer and thicker and healthier. Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> I use this with the shampoo at the same time so that it rinses out very well. Only need a little less than half of what you would use for shampoo amount.Again very happy!</li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair feels awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  It cleans but leaves my hair shiny and full of body!</li>
            <li> I came across this because this was the shampoo that was given to us during a hotel stay. I really liked it. A+++</li>
            <li> I got to try the shampoo when I was on vacation at a Hilton hotel.  I really its fragrance while it&#x27;s not too strong for the nose.  I also really enjoy how it somehow makes my hair easier to manage and fall in place better naturally while my hair is getting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much that I purchased it at $18 a pop for my home use, but because it&#x27;s 2-3 times as expensive as other shampoo that&#x27;s yet decent though not as good.  I took one star off from a price-versus-value perspective.</li>
            <li> I discovered this item on vacation while staying at a Marriott Hotel.  It is, bar none, the best product for my hair.  That was two years ago, and I&#x27;ve continued to use the shampoo &amp; conditioner since.  The online offering is not only convenient, but priced right as well!</li>
            <li> dont use too often.  Think it drys out hair.</li>
            <li> It was delivered leaking in the box: there was a hole from which the shampoo was leaking. I still used it : it is no better than 1 dollar shampoo from Kmart. This shampoo, I suspect, it not real Peter Thomas. I first used it while staying at Hilton and loved it. This is far from that experience. Will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo in Hawaii while on vacation.  Having been in the sun and water for 3 weeks it kept my colored hair from fading and becoming dry.  Decided to use it at home.</li>
            <li> My gray looked more alive and my hair was fluffy</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo.  We discovered it while traveling and the hotel where we stayed provided it.  I just buy it on Amazon, the price is reasonable and much easier to hit &amp;#34;Buy&amp;#34;!  We have bought several and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I used these Peter Thomas Roth Mega-Rich Shampoo and Conditioner when I stayed in Hilton Hotel in Boston. They smell wonderful. The shampoo is foam-rich and the conditioner makes my hair smooth. I just love them right away.I tried to buy them at Macy&#x27;s, Sephora, DUANEreade but they are not sold in these places. Fortunately I found them at Amazon.com when I came back to China. After about two weeks I got the lovely shampoo and conditioner. I bought two pairs. I am going to use them in a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.  I buy it repeatedly</li>
            <li> I have fine, highlighted hair.  This shampoo is the best I have ever used.  I got a sample from a friend and loved it.  It makes your hair soft, and shinny with lots of volume.  I normally use salon shampoos.  This is better than anything I have purchased from my salon.  If you are tired of flat, limp hair I highly recommend trying this shampoo. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo for about a year now... just like many other commenting fans, I too first tried this while staying at a Hilton in NYC -&lt;br /&gt;I have fine non chemically treated hair - tend to wash every other day (unless on the weekends) - and I have had more people tell me in the past year that my hair looks great - and comment on how fast it has grown....&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser (who I had not seen in several months for a long overdue trim) even commented on how healthy my hair was&lt;br /&gt;I do not do anything special except treat myself to this shampoo - it is a bit pricey compared to other products on the market but a little goes a very long way - not to mention the smell is amazing and clean -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;disappointment&amp;#34; I have is with the package it&#x27;s self- as earlier stated, I have been using this product for about a year - a few of the bottles would not close and one of the tips actually broke off in the tube itself - so I usually have to store the bottle upside down in my shower rack... not that this a huge deal, but a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, always use it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. It gives my normal wavy hair softness and volume. It can be a little drying at times though. Good scent for men,</li>
            <li> AMAZON YOU DID IT AGAIN GREAT SHAMPOO STAYED AT A HOTEL IN M B SC THEY HAD A SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT WORKED GREAT SO WERE CAN I BUY THIS PRODUCT I SAID MAYBE AMAZON MIGHT HAVE THIS AND BAM THEY DID  THE PRODUCT GETS FIVE STARS FROM ME AND FRIENDS</li>
            <li> This shampoo was too heavy, it really weighed my hair down.  My husband thought that it caused a thinning of his hair up front that affected his hair line.  I guess if it works for you then go for it but it didn&#x27;t work quite well for me.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend Loved it and will want more later on, some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wants to say thank you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kurt</li>
            <li> I love Peter Thomas Roth products and especially his shampoo, Would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about it.</li>
            <li> My husband like this shampoo at a hotel and I ordered.  Both of us like it very much.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while now.  A little pricey and wish it would give a little more sudsy feeling.  But smells good and works well!</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo. I have fine hair -- but a lot of it. This is the perfect shampoo -- does not dry out my hair or weigh it down. I get quite a lot of volume from it too! Great find!</li>
            <li> .I have found that Peter Thomas Roth Mega Rich Shampoo to be a very effective treatment for my hair in addiiton to having a wonderful fragrence</li>
            <li> This is a great product but this particular item is sold at 8.5 fl oz, but when the product arrived, it is only 8.0 fl oz., not 8.5.  I am sure this must be a misprint on the website!!</li>
            <li> Cleans well without drying my hair. Nice aroma without being overpowering. No parabens or other bad ingredients you don&#x27;t want on your head.</li>
            <li> I found out about this shampoo and conditioner when staying at a Hilton Hotel. I usually hate the samples hotels have because it dries out my thick, semi curly hair. This stuff is awesome. My hair gets very sweaty from my workouts and this stuff gets out the bad and keeps in the good. I do only shampoo/condition my hair every other day to not dry it out. I rinse it water the days in-between. The only thing about it I don&#x27;t like is that I can go through one bottle in under 2 months and the price is kind of high. Can&#x27;t imagine if I had to use more than I do.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and full of body...I too first learned of this product while staying at a Hilton Resort in New Orleans.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Did&#x27;nt see any change in my hair when I used it. Great lather and nice smell.  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> A significant difference in the soft feel and the shininess of my hair which has always been dry.  Love this shampoo more thatn any other I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! The best shampoo I have ever used. My wife and I both find it to be a very rich shampoo. I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and it smells great and if I drop it in the shower I don&#x27;t scream.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect product.</li>
            <li> WOW. I love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULT: It leaves my hair feeling so fresh, silky and shiny. It definitely makes my hair looking healthier, just after one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: paraben free, yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE: I love the Amazon price. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I like it myself it has pleasant fragrance cleans my hair good  I am going to buy its conditioner too  right now I am using the conditioner kiss my face which is great but I like the fragrance of  this shampoo</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Smells great and leaves my hair soft, shiny, and with great body!</li>
            <li> Just love love this shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lemony smell, cleans hair well. Very pricey though. I wish it were more easily available - got turned on to it in a Hilton in Quebec.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before.  Was introduced to it in a Hilton hotel while traveling.  It worked great in the hard water of the hotel.  My hair is used to soft water and normally gets tangled and nasty in hard water.  This shampoo helped solve that problem.  Have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> This gives my dry hair lots of shine and body. Humidity in Fl. is bad for baby fine hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels very bubbly and fresh, a bit of a lemon zinging through that great clear shampoo does wonders. Itâ€™s extremely nourishing as it really helps hair get shiny, strong and moisturized.  I actually lost this one to my boyfriend who snatched it up and kept it in his bathroom, so yeah, itâ€™s really spectacular, gentle yet it works. Itâ€™s fortifying and makes my hair feel strong and tangle free. I canâ€™t wait to get it with the conditioner next but it really helped my hair stay static free and really shiny all winter long when I usually have the most issues with it.  - Kasia S.</li>
            <li> a friend of mine asked me to buy it for him so I have no idea  how good it is  but he says its as good as he expected..</li>
            <li> I find it impossible to figure out which shampoo to buy.  This shampoo and it&#x27;s companion conditioner were in my hotel and I took a chance and tried it.  My hair can be very dry and in a hotel, it&#x27;s downright brittle after a day or two at a conference, but this shampoo was great!  I still need to do extra moisturizing every couple of days, but this shampoo is easy on my hair.  Only 4 stars because it&#x27;s so darn expensive.</li>
            <li> I alternate with this and my WEN shampooing.  We received this as a hotel guest sample at the Hilton and WOW - fell in love with the shampoo, conditioner and the body lotion - gives great shine, volume and LOVE the smell.... Thanks Peter Thomas Roth - do you have any products with a lemon scent?</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, best scent ever...but the lid will not close at all. Not conveinent at all. Hoping the next bottle will be functional.</li>
            <li> This item was packaged loosely with several other items in an unpadded box that was approximately 18&amp;#34; by 18&amp;#34; by 12&amp;#34;.  This was too large for the items and they were damaged upon arrival.  Two of the items appeared to have been previously opened as the seals were missing and torn.  This item leaked all over the rest of the loosely packed items.  I like these products but would purchase them somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth mega rich shampoo leaves your hair soft and luxurious and delightfully fragrant.  My husband and I had tried this at a hotel where we stayed and liked it so much we ordered it when we returned home.</li>
            <li> Great product ...hair looks healthy ... hair feels soft and more manageable ... highly recommended ... a little pricey but good product</li>
            <li> We were first introduced to this shampoo and conditioner when we stayed at a Hilton hotel.  We liked it there, then saw if for sale on Amazon.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> We were introduced to this shampoo at the El Conquistador Resort in Tucson. We brought home the samples and then ordered the full size from Amazon.  We have well water.  It is extremely harsh on hair, especially fine hair.  This shampoo leaves all the family&#x27;s hair in wonderful condition (very manageable and it gently removes built up residue from minerals in the well water, etc).  Use with the moisturizer (small dab).  We purchased at a very good price and the shampoo lasts.  Good size.  Smells fabulous-not over powering.</li>
            <li> My husband first discovered this shampoo at a New York hotel where we stay whenever we are in the city.  He liked it so much that we decided to purchase the shampoo for home.</li>
            <li> Greatest smell ever! Leaves my hair soft and shiny. Well worth the extra money considering the quality you are getting.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo around  leaves hair shiny and with lots of body.</li>
            <li> I only recommend this product to those having seriously oily hairs if you want to use it daily. In general, this is not the daily shampoo to use cuz&#x27; it makes my hair way to dry (though admittedly very voluminous). However, if using this one alternatively with a gentler shampoo, it will make the perfect combo.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Rich lather. Smells good. Hair feels really clean. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. But is too expensive. Went back to Aveda. I&#x27;m happy to pay for a bit of indulgence but this is a bit too expensive. Maybe a bigger bottle with more of a quantity discount?</li>
            <li> Shampoo was leaking when I got it. Almost half gone. Can&#x27;t get refund for some reason. I know stuff like this happens but at least send me another one.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this after trying it at the Portland Hilton. This is a great shampoo for fine hair. No buildup, clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> I had a sample at a hotel and I loved the way my hair looked and felt. Great fragrance. Leaves my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> was as described and delivery was great</li>
            <li> Good stuff. The hotel I stayed at used these products and liked them there and like them more now that I know where to get them.</li>
            <li> This helped tame my frizz for sure, but I read PTR now tests on animals because they ship to China and it is required for import. I wish they didn&#x27;t, this may have been in my regimen for years to come. It isn&#x27;t worth the pain and suffering done to animals for cosmetic research. There are plenty of cruelty free options to try.</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample of the conditioner and loved it.  I live in a rural area and had to order it.  It&#x27;s not available locally.  I decided to try the shampoo as well.  I found it no better than any common product.  I will not buy it again</li>
            <li> I used this first as one of the toiletries offered at a Hilton Hotel.  I really like the smell, something like tea, and it s a &#x27;foo-foo&#x27; thing I do for myself. It is pricey, but a treat to myself.  I use as little as possible, and wash my hair twice, and so far, being conservative, it has lasted a while.</li>
            <li> Bought this after trying a trial size. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Really great shampoo. Leaves hair shiny , full buddy with great smell&lt;br /&gt;One of the best I used. Will be glad to try now more products</li>
            <li> tHEY GIVE MY CURLY HAIR BODY..I AM FAIRLY OLD AND MY HAIR SEEMS TO LAY BETTER,  i DO USE THEM TOGETHER.</li>
            <li> I tried this out at a few Hilton hotels. I have never found a shampoo I like better so I bought this even though it is a little pricey. I feel it is worth the money however and that is saying a lot for me as I am generally pretty frugal.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does leave my hair nice and soft but it takes a lot of product to lather and it contains Sulfates which I am avoiding.  Will not buy again because of that reason.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for my hair.  It is a light shampoo which doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  However, it is a little too watery and I find it necessary to use more than I usually do with other shampoos, which, given the cost, I find this to be something I will only use for certain occasions and not on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Leaves hair shiny, nourished, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Enriches, moisturizes. Smells great:fresh, but not flowery.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo...it only takes a small amount to make your hair feel so clean and smells great!!</li>
            <li> First tried this product at Hilton and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Hooked on product after using at hotel</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it with the Peter Thomas Roth Mega Rich Conditioner.  My hair looks and feels great and my hairdresser has remarked on how healthy it is.</li>
            <li> I love this Peter Thomas Roth Shampoo.  I have bleached hair and this shampoo really keeps my hair moist and prevents breakage. I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was good at first (during the time i used at the hotel).  The hair was soft and smooth so i decided to buy the product.  However, after 2-3 time used, my scalp turn red with rash.  My hair is also not soft and very hard to comb.  I don&#x27;t like the product and regret buying them.  Trying to contact manufacturing but no reply.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo.  Really brings out the curl in my frizzy fine hair, but too expensive to get on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on vacation when I use this shampoo! The fragrance is vibrant for a good morning wake up,  but not feminine, and the way it leaves my hair is amazing. It feels super clean. I love this stuff and have been using it for years after getting a sample in my hotel in Prague.</li>
            <li> I stayed ad Hilton hotel and they use all Peter Thomas products in a rooms. I was very surprises about it and now you do not need to bring your stuff to Hilton. Very good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample from Peter Thomas Roth and loved it.  I tried to buy it on their website but the product was sold out.  I found it and purchased it from Amazon.  The price was the same but the shipping was free.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone wants an amazing shampoo,  this is it.</li>
            <li> Got a large sample of this and used it about three times.  Every time I looked in the mirror I noticed my hair looked fuller and shinier.  Just bought the large tube, so I&#x27;m sold on this.</li>
            <li> Like most of the reviews here, I too encountered this shampoo while staying at a Hilton.  I travel a lot for business and usually carry my own trusted brand as usually the brands/types of shampoo/conditioner within hotels are not the best and leave my hair dry and difficult to manage.  I have very long and thick hair, so brushing and hair drying alone can be a challenge without the added issues of the wrong shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe I ran out of my own shampoo/conditioner while staying at the hotel and had resolved to trying Hiltons PTR brand.  It was a late night for me after a long day with the client, and I was so tired, all I could do was shower, brush my hair and get to bed...no blowdrying...which is typically a no no for me with my long crazy hair as it is.  Regardless, I woke up the next morning shocked to see my hair with amazing body and richness.  I believe I stayed shocked all day and came back to the hotel and loaded up on the PTR sample sizes the hotel had.  I have been an avid user ever since and refuse to go back to anything else!  My friends have even commented on how my hair looks on the most rough and tumble days (hiking, biking, swimming, running, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the PTR shampoo and conditioner, and while the price is steep, it is still cheaper than what most salons have/charge for those brands and they don&#x27;t do near as much as what PTR does for me!</li>
            <li> I have been pretty lucky to stay at some nice hotels such as Hilton, Intercontinental, Hyatt Regency, Resistance, Andaz, Indigo and a few others. All of them give you mini bottles of shampoo and conditioner. The best shampoo and conditioner that I have used have come from the Hilton and were from the Peter Thomas Roth collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you combine the shampoo and conditioner from PTR, it really does an amazing job at treating your hair and scalp to an exhilarating experience. With extended use, your hair becomes stronger, thicker, and softer. The scent is also lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the price is higher than your mass market hair products but in all reality, this is a mid-range price. Many higher end shampoos can easily go for $30 a bottle. Thus, I do not feel bad about paying the asking price for Peter Thomas Roth hair products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo. Just give it a try and you are sure to love it. It IS Mega-rich and smells wonderful. It is my all-time favorite shampoo. Don&#x27;t skip the Peter Thomas Roth Mega-Rich conditioner - these two products go hand in hand to give you a full head of clean and fresh hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner. It made my hair feel so silky and soft! After the samples ran out I continued to use up the rest of my regular products and then ordered a full size bottle of mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner. The switch has been great- my hair, which is medium length &amp; color treated to cover grays, feels soft and has a nice shine. I would recommend these products &amp; will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It cleans my hair really well, it is gentle on my color treated hair without drying it out, a little goes a long way, and my hair stays cleaner longer. This has a nice clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and my hair looks and feels healthy.  I use the PTR Mega Rich Conditioner as well. A winning combination for gorgeous hair!</li>
            <li> I found this by accident at a hotel in Tampa.  It has a light scent, and left my hair incredibly shiny and silky.  Worth every penny, and I only wish I had discoverednitnyears ago.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old. This is the first shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life that actually visibly improved my hair from Day 1. I had used tiny bottles obtained in hotels before, and finally broke down and ordered more. I have fine, straight hair and this stuff gives body and shine, and my blow dry-round brush style holds all day. Smells good too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> found out about it from a hotel stay &amp; liked it so much, decided to order it!&lt;br /&gt;luv the way it makes hair feel so clean &amp; soft!</li>
            <li> If you get lucky when you stay at an upscale Hilton they will supply samples of this shampoo and conditioner. That&#x27;s how I was introduced to it.  I ended up going to Ulta and stocking up on both products. This shampoo has a nice scent without being antiseptic smelling. It leaves my hair shiny, silky yet feeling extremely clean and a little dab goes a long way. It provides a glorious lather and leaves me and my hair feeling good. Definitely great on colored or permed hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes the hair glow and feels amazing, but it&#x27;s expensive for the little quantity on the tube, so if you wash daily and have long hair count on one tube a week which will make it 80$ a month even if you follow instructions of mixing little bit with water but I guess beauty has a price.</li>
            <li> I originally used this shampoo during a stay at a Hilton hotel and really liked the way it made my hair feel and the gender-neutral smell. I haven&#x27;t been able to take the bottle I ordered into the house yet because the odor (very heavy perfume smell) is so overwhelming. Alas, I may have to age it in the garage for a while - which is kind of disappointing. I doubt this is the vendor&#x27;s fault, however.  Perhaps just having a much larger quantity than what you get in a hotel has concentrated the odor.</li>
            <li> Like many of the others that have reviewed this shampoo, I too stayed at a Hilton and used it. This shampoo is without a doubt the best I have ever tried on my hair. You do not have to use much as it lathers up very well. I only wash my hair once every four days or so and combined with using a small amount it should last awhile but at $18 it is expensive. Seems to me that if they lowered the price they would probably sell more but I don&#x27;t know what their overhead is. I really think this stuff would catch on if they did! It leaves my hair shiny and so soft and manageable when used with their mega rich conditioner (also very expensive) and as I said, this stuff really really is good. Just wish it was a bit cheaper.... I would have rated it an enthusiastic 5 stars if it was around $10 or $11 a bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is made in China and I believe anything going on my scalp is going into my body. There is no quality control as to what is in this product. If Chinese Manufacturers put lead in the toys they make for our children and also have children making products, I want nothing to do with any Chinese  liquid cosmetics that go into my body.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I&#x27;m 39 but have started going through menopause.  One of the changes is that a section of my hair feels ratty, dry, and tangly after I shampoo it.  Just one section.  One day, I stayed at a hotel that had this brand in its rooms and after I used it I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t feel horrible!  It&#x27;s the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that makes my hair feel like it did before I started menopause.  I have no idea why; I probably wouldn&#x27;t understand even if someone explained it.  I just know that I&#x27;m very happy that I stayed at that hotel and found this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I loved the conditioner...love, love, love it but found the shampoo to dry my hair out and causes it to be limp.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and smells GREAT. Leaves hair well conditioned</li>
            <li> Husband likes that his hair is never greasy feeling after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Some have too much conditioner built in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, just expensive for the amount.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo out there!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you want to treat your scalp right, get this product, gentlemen.  Start your grooming routine right!!!</li>
            <li> I do love this shampoo and conditioner.  It is one of the few shampoos that leave my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I have used Peter Thomas Roth skin care, and a leave in conditioner, but this is the first time I am using the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I have fine hair, which is now wavy, and usualy frizzy, so I spend a lot of time blow drying with a large brush to straighten and smooth it out.  With these hair products I can actually allow my hair to air dry, and it looks soft and smooth.  I also have dry hair because I color, and these hair products have been a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can say about it, which has nothing to do with the product itself, is that he cap on the tubes don&#x27;t usually close well, and the liquid can drain out if you sit on its cap.  I bought these products for my mom as well, and she experienced the same issue. For the price, I do feel the packaging should be better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these products now for about a month and feel they are still one of the best hair products I have ever used.  I normally only use high quality salon products, or luxury shampoos,  although I have never worked as hair stylist, I did do cosmetology 25 years ago, and I feel these products are tops.  But not all products work for everyone, so consumers should note that I have very long, fine hair, which is wavy because of graying, and I color so it gets quiet dry.&lt;br /&gt;These products also have an awesome scent.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but I was a bit surprised it took two different shipments, as I ordered the pair of 8 oz tubes at the same time.  Didn&#x27;t cost me anything, but it was confusing.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and love the smell.  My hair is shiny but I don&#x27;t see a lot of thickness or volume from it but still better then many others out there.</li>
            <li> As with the conditioner and hair treatment, I have received numerous compliments on my hair since I started using the product range on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Tried this product while staying at the Hilton.  Searched for deals &amp; ordered a few.  Excellent product, price &amp; shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> I have never been as happy with a shampoo purchase as I have been with this stuff. Hair looked amazing after just one use (with the conditioner!).  I love Peter Thomas Roth products, I know they are going to do what they say they will do which is uncommon these days!</li>
            <li> I discovered this shampoo while staying at a Hilton. I am really picky about shampoos because I have very thick, stiff hair that needs to be washed every single day. If I miss a day, it&#x27;s usually fine for a few hours, then by lunchtime, something horrifying has happened: It&#x27;s stringy and even smells odd, no matter what shampoo I&#x27;ve used. NOT SO WITH THIS ONE. I know it is expensive, but you really do not need very much of it because it lathers up well if you use enough liquid (results may vary but I was surprised). I can even go a day without washing now because my hair still smells good. All you have to do is brush it out and it looks great for the whole day! I no longer get that gross, uncomfortable \\&quot;does everyone think this looks like a greasy nest\\&quot; feeling. I love this shampoo. I really am not a beauty product fan - I am super low maintenance due to impatience - but this shampoo is totally worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you are really sensitive to smells you won&#x27;t like this, even though it really smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this gentile, yet clean, pure shampoo  Recommend to anyone who does not like a lot of things in products that we do not need and are not good for us.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Shampoos I have ever tried. Not drying and very creamy. Along with the conditioner, my hair has a lot of volume!</li>
            <li> 5 stars, quick turnaround by seller</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars for the nice scent. I don&#x27;t like it because the shampoo won&#x27;t spread to lather.</li>
            <li> Best hair product hands down! Totally worth the price! Tried it while on vacation and will never use another hair product brand</li>
            <li> Good stuff for colored hair or natural hair color.</li>
            <li> Prompt handling of order with quick delivery.  Great shampoo and well worth the extra money vs. store bought shampoos I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner combination I  have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo it leaves your hair extremely clean and fresh</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels great and leaves my hair feeling soft, but manageable.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I enjoy a lot of PTR products but this is definitely top of the line.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my hair type but I find I have to use a fairly large amount to thoroughly clean my har. I have very thick, wavy, Asian, color treated hair.  Other than that, my hair feels great and doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> Not as rich and moisturizing as I would like.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - bought after samples in hotel</li>
            <li> Great product but a little over priced.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment this was!  Just received and used right away in excitement, and according to past reviews by other users, I thought my long blonde, color treated hair would be so soft and smooth after using it...WRONG!  I could NOT get a comb through my long locks after using this product just once for the first time.  I have never had a problem getting a comb through my long, color treated hair, which is always on the slightly dry side, but I have always used &amp;#34;PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34; salon products, so what a mistake I made buying this stuff.  I should have known not to buy something that is primarily given complimentary at hotels...shame on me.  Crappy hotel shampoo and conditioner is not professional, and I should have known better.  The only good thing about this is that it has a pleasing fragrance.  Other than that, it is way toooooooooooooo expensive a price for this non-professional, drying hair product.  If you want to invest in a non-professional shampoo, just go to your local grocery/drug store and buy the same size (8.5 oz) hair shampoo in another well-known brand for half the price of this, as you&#x27;ll get the same effect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, I like it! However, after using it for a while, my scalp got itchy so I had to switch it to another product for a while.</li>
            <li> I have loved this shampoo for years and ask for extras every time we stay in a Hilton Hotel.  Now at last I have found it online, will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Love this line! Makes my hair super soft and silky!</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this product it leaves my hair smelling good and soft.......I definitely recommend this product to anyone, thank you</li>
            <li> Very good for thin hair. I will not buy this because it&#x27;s made in China.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, have fine hair and it gives it body. Smells great also.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband as a gift, as he loved a hotel sample size he tried.  It lasted many months as only a pea-sized dot is needed on wet hair.  He (and I) love it.  It lathers up in our hard water and rinses out thoroughly.  We both have fine hair, mine much thicker and styling is easy.  Hair is shiny!!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Hair and a scalp can wash their hair without any regret. The smell is good, too</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for thick hair! And smells great too!</li>
            <li> The majority of reviews for this shampoo are positive and I agree! Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> high cost for shampoo but great product.</li>
            <li> This was in our condo at the resort. The second day I shampooed and conditioned my hair, I noticed it felt very silky. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to order it. I&#x27;ve just noticed my hair has a tendency to be straight and doesn&#x27;t hold curls as long after using the curling iron.</li>
            <li> Let me see, how many lines will they let me write.  My hair is fine and I have an oily scalp.  That means that heavy shampoos just weighh my hair down and make it flat.  This product give me amazing fullness and shampoos even seem to last longer.  I can often go two or three days without a shampoo.  I just shampoo, use a volumizing gel, and blow dry for a great, long lasting style that I can brush through!  Because my hair is so fine, I don&#x27;t use a conditioner either.  My PTU shampoo is about as good as it gets.  All this serves to make me feel more put together and confident.  Love this shampoo.  Please don&#x27;t change a thing!</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this product.  I got the same results with the conditioner too.  I will just go back to using Purology..</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients label, which was not on the website, I returned it due to it containing SULFATES. These strip color from hatr.</li>
