            <li> I live in Minnesota and have long winters and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Especially in the winter when my hands get very dry and crack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Glysolid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream but penetrates very well which dissipates after.</li>
            <li> Being a nurse I wash my hands constantly,  cannot recommend this enough, unscented, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> if you have moderate to extremely dry skin, you will not want to use any other lotion but this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is miracle salve for dry, sore, cracked and irritated skin.</li>

            <li> The cover on this jar fits very loosely.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, with a bit of water added after the application.</li>
            <li> If you pick it up by the cover, it may separate from the bottom of the jar and make a mess.  </li>
            <li> little by little</li>
            <li> I prefer it as a nighttime hand cream because it tends to be a bit sticky for a little while.  </li>
            <li> Using in the morning and at night before I go to bed takes care of the problem in just a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick for other body parts.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy the expensive skin creams, people.</li>

            <li> The best dry skin cream ever.</li>
            <li> Being a nurse I wash my hands constantly,  cannot recommend this enough, unscented, a little goes a long way. Do not leave it in a warm car!</li>
            <li> Great item. Fast shipping^^</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream but penetrates very well which dissipates after. It&#x27;s best to use before bed to get the full effect and also to only use on hands and feet. It&#x27;s too thick for other body parts.</li>
            <li> I used to buy and use Glysolid all the time but hadn&#x27;t been able to buy it for years. I found it on Amazon at a higher price but I&#x27;m happy to have it at any price. This stuff is miracle salve for dry, sore, cracked and irritated skin. As a hair stylish I used it to sooth my chapped hands and cracked knuckles. I haven&#x27;t done hair in many years but I do a lot of home improvement projects and cleaning so I was glad to find it again. You will love it too. It absorbs readily and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling. A little goes a long way. I very highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works great a little dry when you first put it on then little by little it moisturizers works great</li>
            <li> Has about a million uses !  Great for nails and hands; any rough place anywhere; chapped lips......I haven&#x27;t found any chapped, peeling place that didn&#x27;t benefit from this cream.</li>
            <li> BEST HAND CREAM EVER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Glysolid.  Whenever I&#x27;ve tried something else, I inevitably return to this.  I prefer it as a nighttime hand cream because it tends to be a bit sticky for a little while.  But used that way on a daily basis, I haven&#x27;t found anything to beat it.</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there. Do NOT buy the expensive skin creams, people. This is all you&#x27;ll ever need. Add a dab of water after applying to skin. A little goes a long way, with a bit of water added after the application. I use it on my face and body, great in winter or summer.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that cures my dried cracked hands in the winter months.  I&#x27;ve tried many products but this one works the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great product, will definitely heal your cracked skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be a bit greasy, but if that&#x27;s the price I have to pay to heal my hands, i don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;- The cover on this jar fits very loosely.  If you pick it up by the cover, it may separate from the bottom of the jar and make a mess.  Should redesign the cover to fit a bit more snugly.</li>
            <li> Love it- nothing works better</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this product. He uses it twice a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for rough dry feet.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at a grocery store in Greece. I live in Minnesota and have long winters and dry skin. I&#x27;ve used lots of moisturizers and this is simply the best.</li>
            <li> Local hairdressers use this because their hands are in water so much. It is the best. In addition to being fragrance free as I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances. I wish it was sold more in stores locally.</li>
            <li> Great product will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> if you have moderate to extremely dry skin, you will not want to use any other lotion but this. It is clean of all perfumes and dyes. The packaging is not fancy, which is great. They do not waste money on marketing. The company has been around for years and goes on word of mouth.</li>
            <li> Really like this cream for cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I use it with unrefined ivory Shea Butter, Vernal Skincare,  and 2-3 drops of Lemon Oil....  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Great Moisutrizer in the combination above</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  Especially in the winter when my hands get very dry and crack. Using in the morning and at night before I go to bed takes care of the problem in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Super stuff.  I wish it was easier to get but Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> Good quality as before but I think the price is creeping up.</li>
            <li> This helps my husband&#x27;s cracked fingers and hands after working with PVC pipe dope.  He uses it every night.  Nothing else work for him.  Excellent produce.</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry skin and lips, it is a cure not just temporary fix.</li>
