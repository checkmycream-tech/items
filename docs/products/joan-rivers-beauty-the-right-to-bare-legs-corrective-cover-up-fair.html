            <li>Color matches perfectly but does not give the coverage advertised.</li>
            <li>I passed on this product to a friend because the medium shade worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li>The best part about it is that it is not noticeable at all on camera.  </li>

            <li>I bought it to cover varicose veins in the summer and after seeing the product on TV and reading the reviews on Amazon, I thought this was the best product to try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it did a very good job with brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very fair</li>
            <li>The fair covers up the brusies and varicose veins well, but it does make me look very, very fair.</li>
            <li>Great cover up for psoriasis.</li>
            <li>and it works great, without streaks.</li>
            <li>This concealer works great.</li>

            <li>The fair is ghostly fair!</li>
            <li>Loved the product.</li>
            <li>Also use a good sponge or make up brush to apply.</li>
            <li>Loved how it made my legs look.</li>
            <li>I consider myself fair skinned, but the Fair color did not match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I agree with another commenter to try a shade darker than your complexion, or maybe even the tan if you have fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I had used this product before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I figured fair would be</li>
            <li>It did a good job at covering up, which explains the one star I gave it.</li>
            <li>I thought it did a good job of minimizing the spider veins and some bruises I had.</li>
            <li>The color doesnt match 100% but this is a good temporary.</li>
            <li>The product itself is good.</li>
            <li>Good to get two shades to mix.</li>
            <li>I feel that the coverage from this product is good but still leaves some of my scars visible.</li>
            <li>Loved the way my legs looked-used this product to go to a wedding this summer-</li>
            <li>I was delighted with the even skin tone this product provided.</li>
            <li>, I am fair skinned, but the fair did not cover like advertised on TV.</li>
            <li>Also, I mix the medium with the fair shade to match my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.</li>
            <li>This product is a very light coverage so it does not do a great job of hiding flaws.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it was easy to apply and made my legs look great.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, it covered all the imperfections you needed to cover.</li>
            <li>It is just what varicose veins needed to have nice looking legs again</li>
            <li>I was honest with my review</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned with large freckles and discoloration on my legs.</li>
            <li>COLOR IS PERFECT FOR LIGHT SKIN, MATCHING JUST RIGHT AND NOT CAKEY LOOKING.  </li>
            <li>The fair was too light for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go with the better price, of course, because I liked them both</li>
            <li>The price was cheap and I m going to order medium color to blend with the fair.</li>
            <li>I purchased the lightest color and it is VERY light.</li>
            <li>But i love the product.</li>
            <li>But it covered up my stretch marks really well and looks great on camera.</li>
            <li>I would buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>The product was ok.</li>
            <li>I was glad that I found a place to order it.</li>
            <li>There is a sponge built into the top of the tube which you then use to spread and blend the product.</li>
            <li>This product really does a great job covering both bruises and tattoos without looking caked on or too streaky.  </li>
            <li>WHICH IS BETTER ANYWAY</li>
            <li>MORE SO</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to learn to blend it better,  </li>
            <li>worked my way around it to use it better.</li>
            <li>Not the sellers fault, theyre great and are Fast Shipping :)</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I ordered Tan and love it...</li>
            <li>so if you apply  hands-on you get better results.</li>
            <li>This product does not cover as well as dermablend which is a product I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>There was no packageing, and when I took the top off, it had been used already!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Its okay,</li>
            <li>Theres a type of Sponge that comes on top of the tube, and it starts to come off after awile...</li>
            <li>I even used this product on bruises, which it did an ok job at.</li>
            <li>so it blends in better.  </li>
            <li>I also dab the product which gives more coverage.</li>
            <li>I had to apply more than once</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay buy, I&#x27;m keeping the product.</li>
            <li>Looks better with than without.</li>
            <li>I mix with the medium for a better color.</li>
            <li>I use several products trying to find the perfect one.</li>
            <li>Until something better comes along, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous!</li>
            <li>The sponge on the tip of the tube helps apply the product, but I&#x27;ve found my fingers blend it just as well, or better.</li>
            <li>However make sure that you goop</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Right to bare legs is a good product, however, while I can use products labeled fair in most cases, this product is too fair.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I  bought the light shade, but will also buy the medium shade to blend together to match my skin tone, BUT I will purchase it from a REPUTABLE seller.</li>
            <li>I got the fair which was my mistake since I am very tan in the summer</li>
            <li>I bough one lighter tone of this product to mix with another my friend had given me, it is easy to mix in the palm of your hand and the results were better than others that cost about double the price, It does a pretty good job, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water proof but washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Seems to stay on and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It does not come off easily.</li>
            <li>My legs bruise easy and wanted something to cover the bruises.</li>
            <li>I sprays on easily, covers well and is waterproof.</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly from Oranges To Dollars and would order from them</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and it was perfect since I have dark patches on my lower legs when I am out in the sun.</li>
            <li>It worked fine</li>
            <li>I bought the fair and it blends right in, no weird foundation look.  </li>
            <li>There are not that many shades to choose from and the back of my knees where the spider veins live, are fair, so fair should have done it.</li>
            <li>Everything Joan Rivers stands behind is great quality, so I should have known I would be getting something great when I purchased it -</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too light and looks powdery on my legs.  </li>
            <li>great cover up for those red marks on hands and arms</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a great plus for me since I needed it to cover some imperfections for a big event.</li>
            <li>so do not purchase &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; unless you have extremely light skin.</li>
            <li>The color is to light, my fault.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know it could be that I got to light of a color</li>
            <li>Overall the product was great.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and does not have a perfume smell, it does not come off on your clothes.</li>
            <li>It does look natural and looks good on hands and arms.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the right shade powder to set it in.</li>
            <li>It does stay on good, and seems to be pretty much waterproof.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like with make up, either you get full coverage or just light one.</li>
            <li>Nothing but vein removal would make veins disappear completely, but this cover is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>I use it on special occasions under my panty hose.</li>
            <li>did find that it was important to moisturize first!</li>
            <li>My legs actually look good.    </li>
            <li>It goes on well and stays on, and the color I ordered was true to that advertised.  </li>
            <li>quick fix on the face, for a Wedding&lt;</li>
            <li>But most people&#x27;s skin is more yellow than mine, so it might work for them.</li>
            <li>too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should apply some lotion first then rapidly smooth on the leg makeup as it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products to mask my spider veins on my legs, this is by far  the best.  </li>
            <li>when they did finally call at an hour that was decent, they insisted that I change my review and say how great the company is.</li>
            <li>I have parts of it left on the top of the tube!  </li>
            <li>Sponge broke on first use!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t cover completely the vines.</li>
            <li>Kind of like sheer hosiery</li>
            <li>The one good thing is it showed up with in the time it was expected to.</li>
            <li>The coverage was not as good as I had expected.  </li>
            <li>normally apply the product by hand because the sponge applicator does not glide easily on my skin.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this in tan and luckily it matched my skin tone pretty well.</li>
            <li>However you have to choose the right shade for your skin</li>
            <li>otherwise it will not have the right results.</li>
            <li>I the right color</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much though, and apply a little, then more if you need more coverage.</li>
            <li>so I mixed body lotion with it and got better results.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate skin first and use moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The sponge applicator split in two the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Well I told them flat out, I would have gladly done so if it wasn&#x27;t for their intrusive innapropriate phone calls.</li>
            <li>it appeared much darker than when first applying it &amp; it cracked.</li>
            <li>First it doesn&#x27;t really cover up anything.</li>
            <li>Even that shade was a teeny bit too dark, but it ended up blending nicely.  </li>
            <li>the benefits of this product certainly outway any negatives...</li>
            <li>It does not rub off on your clothes, but it really does not cover too well either.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to buy much, in case it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>how much 3 oz of theirs cost verses your 3 oz tube.</li>
            <li>after a while the colour changes and turns very pasty... dont think I would buy it again</li>
            <li>The colors were not as expected..and the thickness of the make up was a bit much.  </li>
            <li>it didnt really cover much.</li>
            <li>It does the job of cover-up very well</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to really cover anything as well as I&#x27;d like..</li>
            <li>and it goes on and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Once on it stays well and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; so I liked that about</li>
            <li>I liked the way this cream smoothed onto my skin, which is very dry, but after the first application the sponge fell apart and I discovered that it couldn&#x27;t just simply be removed so now</li>
            <li>It covers the small marks on my legs nicely, you can&#x27;t see them at all, but when i went out in the sun I could see the spots of makeup I put on my legs.</li>
            <li>The Right to Bare</li>
            <li>I figured the less stuff on the sponge, the better --</li>
            <li>My main concern is coverage.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with it, the only complaint I read seen was that it gets on your clothes, but I found that if you put it on AFTER your get into your shorts or bathing suit, there&#x27;s no issue with that.  </li>
            <li>Color didn&#x27;t really match and it didn&#x27;t cover completely.</li>
            <li>This product is expensive, but had it done its job as advertised, I would have been happy to shell out for it.</li>
            <li>I use the Fair (Scandinavian ethnicity), but expect the other shades work just as well for other skin tones.</li>
            <li>I have mixed feelings about Right To Bear Legs Cover Up.</li>
            <li>It only covered my spider veins partially, although they did look somewhat better than if I did not apply the product .</li>
            <li>I really like the product as long as you put lotion on first</li>
            <li>The fair color is fairer than fair, way to light and made my legs look artificial and the fact that it is a very dull look, not sheer and natural.  </li>
            <li>It is hard though to get the exact match with skin color, i found one to be too light and the other to dark but still a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I can use it without covering everything, which will involve using most of the tube, just for one wearing.</li>
            <li>It took about 15 minutes to dry and it washed right off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Decided recently to try another called Smart cover.</li>
            <li>However to look at the areas directly you can tell you have concealer on.</li>
            <li>You need to order one darker shade to make this transition complete...</li>
            <li>It is also very water resistant and comes off only if you use soap.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>otherwise it won&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wait at least 10 minutes after you exfoliate before applying.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to us older ladies who have spent too much time in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect but it helps to look better and pretty natural.  </li>
            <li>It worked on the small Spider veins I&#x27;m beginning to develop but didn&#x27;t work on my larger more noticeable bruises.</li>
            <li>However, it did rub off on my clothes even after waiting much longer than recommended to dry, before dressing.</li>
            <li>The sponge top makes application difficult and it doesn&#x27;t cover flaws very well.</li>
            <li>Dried quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Just remember the colors are much lighter than expected.</li>
            <li>For me, the sponge broke away from the tube easily, so it&#x27;s not all that useful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this for people trying to cover tattoos or any large dark spots like my bruises.</li>
            <li>For me, it was not worth using because for the time it took to do the coverage application process, it was too much bother.  </li>
            <li>The Joan RIvers Bare Legs lasts in my local pool.</li>
            <li>so you may want to use a ordinary concealer on top just to blend it into your skin a little.</li>
            <li>As I said, the cream goes on very smoothly and perhaps I chose the wrong colour for my skin tone,  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> it was easy to apply and made my legs look great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it covered all the imperfections you needed to cover.</li>
            <li> It is just what varicose veins needed to have nice looking legs again</li>
            <li> I was honest with my review</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned with large freckles and discoloration on my legs.</li>
            <li> COLOR IS PERFECT FOR LIGHT SKIN, MATCHING JUST RIGHT AND NOT CAKEY LOOKING.  </li>
            <li> The fair was too light for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go with the better price, of course, because I liked them both</li>
            <li> The price was cheap and I m going to order medium color to blend with the fair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the lightest color and it is VERY light.</li>
            <li> But i love the product.</li>
            <li> But it covered up my stretch marks really well and looks great on camera.</li>
            <li> I would buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> The product was ok.</li>
            <li> I was glad that I found a place to order it.</li>
            <li> There is a sponge built into the top of the tube which you then use to spread and blend the product.</li>
            <li> This product really does a great job covering both bruises and tattoos without looking caked on or too streaky.  </li>
            <li> WHICH IS BETTER ANYWAY</li>
            <li> MORE SO</li>
            <li> Maybe I have to learn to blend it better,  </li>
            <li> worked my way around it to use it better.</li>
            <li> Not the sellers fault, theyre great and are Fast Shipping :)</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I ordered Tan and love it...</li>
            <li> so if you apply  hands-on you get better results.</li>
            <li> This product does not cover as well as dermablend which is a product I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> There was no packageing, and when I took the top off, it had been used already!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Its okay,</li>
            <li> Theres a type of Sponge that comes on top of the tube, and it starts to come off after awile...</li>
            <li> I even used this product on bruises, which it did an ok job at.</li>
            <li> so it blends in better.  </li>
            <li> I also dab the product which gives more coverage.</li>
            <li> I had to apply more than once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay buy, I&#x27;m keeping the product.</li>
            <li> Looks better with than without.</li>
            <li> I mix with the medium for a better color.</li>
            <li> I use several products trying to find the perfect one.</li>
            <li> Until something better comes along, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!</li>
            <li> The sponge on the tip of the tube helps apply the product, but I&#x27;ve found my fingers blend it just as well, or better.</li>
            <li> However make sure that you goop</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Right to bare legs is a good product, however, while I can use products labeled fair in most cases, this product is too fair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I  bought the light shade, but will also buy the medium shade to blend together to match my skin tone, BUT I will purchase it from a REPUTABLE seller.</li>
            <li> I got the fair which was my mistake since I am very tan in the summer</li>
            <li> I bough one lighter tone of this product to mix with another my friend had given me, it is easy to mix in the palm of your hand and the results were better than others that cost about double the price, It does a pretty good job, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water proof but washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Seems to stay on and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> It does not come off easily.</li>
            <li> My legs bruise easy and wanted something to cover the bruises.</li>
            <li> I sprays on easily, covers well and is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly from Oranges To Dollars and would order from them</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it was perfect since I have dark patches on my lower legs when I am out in the sun.</li>
            <li> It worked fine</li>
            <li> I bought the fair and it blends right in, no weird foundation look.  </li>
            <li> There are not that many shades to choose from and the back of my knees where the spider veins live, are fair, so fair should have done it.</li>
            <li> Everything Joan Rivers stands behind is great quality, so I should have known I would be getting something great when I purchased it -</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too light and looks powdery on my legs.  </li>
            <li> great cover up for those red marks on hands and arms</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a great plus for me since I needed it to cover some imperfections for a big event.</li>
            <li> so do not purchase &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; unless you have extremely light skin.</li>
            <li> The color is to light, my fault.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it could be that I got to light of a color</li>
            <li> Overall the product was great.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and does not have a perfume smell, it does not come off on your clothes.</li>
            <li> It does look natural and looks good on hands and arms.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the right shade powder to set it in.</li>
            <li> It does stay on good, and seems to be pretty much waterproof.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like with make up, either you get full coverage or just light one.</li>
            <li> Nothing but vein removal would make veins disappear completely, but this cover is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> I use it on special occasions under my panty hose.</li>
            <li> did find that it was important to moisturize first!</li>
            <li> My legs actually look good.    </li>
            <li> It goes on well and stays on, and the color I ordered was true to that advertised.  </li>
            <li> quick fix on the face, for a Wedding&lt;</li>
            <li> But most people&#x27;s skin is more yellow than mine, so it might work for them.</li>
            <li> too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should apply some lotion first then rapidly smooth on the leg makeup as it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products to mask my spider veins on my legs, this is by far  the best.  </li>
            <li> when they did finally call at an hour that was decent, they insisted that I change my review and say how great the company is.</li>
            <li> I have parts of it left on the top of the tube!  </li>
            <li> Sponge broke on first use!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t cover completely the vines.</li>
            <li> Kind of like sheer hosiery</li>
            <li> The one good thing is it showed up with in the time it was expected to.</li>
            <li> The coverage was not as good as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> normally apply the product by hand because the sponge applicator does not glide easily on my skin.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this in tan and luckily it matched my skin tone pretty well.</li>
            <li> However you have to choose the right shade for your skin</li>
            <li> otherwise it will not have the right results.</li>
            <li> I the right color</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much though, and apply a little, then more if you need more coverage.</li>
            <li> so I mixed body lotion with it and got better results.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate skin first and use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The sponge applicator split in two the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Well I told them flat out, I would have gladly done so if it wasn&#x27;t for their intrusive innapropriate phone calls.</li>
            <li> it appeared much darker than when first applying it &amp; it cracked.</li>
            <li> First it doesn&#x27;t really cover up anything.</li>
            <li> Even that shade was a teeny bit too dark, but it ended up blending nicely.  </li>
            <li> the benefits of this product certainly outway any negatives...</li>
            <li> It does not rub off on your clothes, but it really does not cover too well either.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to buy much, in case it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> how much 3 oz of theirs cost verses your 3 oz tube.</li>
            <li> after a while the colour changes and turns very pasty... dont think I would buy it again</li>
            <li> The colors were not as expected..and the thickness of the make up was a bit much.  </li>
            <li> it didnt really cover much.</li>
            <li> It does the job of cover-up very well</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to really cover anything as well as I&#x27;d like..</li>
            <li> and it goes on and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Once on it stays well and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; so I liked that about</li>
            <li> I liked the way this cream smoothed onto my skin, which is very dry, but after the first application the sponge fell apart and I discovered that it couldn&#x27;t just simply be removed so now</li>
            <li> It covers the small marks on my legs nicely, you can&#x27;t see them at all, but when i went out in the sun I could see the spots of makeup I put on my legs.</li>
            <li> The Right to Bare</li>
            <li> I figured the less stuff on the sponge, the better --</li>
            <li> My main concern is coverage.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with it, the only complaint I read seen was that it gets on your clothes, but I found that if you put it on AFTER your get into your shorts or bathing suit, there&#x27;s no issue with that.  </li>
            <li> Color didn&#x27;t really match and it didn&#x27;t cover completely.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but had it done its job as advertised, I would have been happy to shell out for it.</li>
            <li> I use the Fair (Scandinavian ethnicity), but expect the other shades work just as well for other skin tones.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about Right To Bear Legs Cover Up.</li>
            <li> It only covered my spider veins partially, although they did look somewhat better than if I did not apply the product .</li>
            <li> I really like the product as long as you put lotion on first</li>
            <li> The fair color is fairer than fair, way to light and made my legs look artificial and the fact that it is a very dull look, not sheer and natural.  </li>
            <li> It is hard though to get the exact match with skin color, i found one to be too light and the other to dark but still a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can use it without covering everything, which will involve using most of the tube, just for one wearing.</li>
            <li> It took about 15 minutes to dry and it washed right off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Decided recently to try another called Smart cover.</li>
            <li> However to look at the areas directly you can tell you have concealer on.</li>
            <li> You need to order one darker shade to make this transition complete...</li>
            <li> It is also very water resistant and comes off only if you use soap.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> otherwise it won&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wait at least 10 minutes after you exfoliate before applying.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to us older ladies who have spent too much time in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but it helps to look better and pretty natural.  </li>
            <li> It worked on the small Spider veins I&#x27;m beginning to develop but didn&#x27;t work on my larger more noticeable bruises.</li>
            <li> However, it did rub off on my clothes even after waiting much longer than recommended to dry, before dressing.</li>
            <li> The sponge top makes application difficult and it doesn&#x27;t cover flaws very well.</li>
            <li> Dried quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Just remember the colors are much lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> For me, the sponge broke away from the tube easily, so it&#x27;s not all that useful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for people trying to cover tattoos or any large dark spots like my bruises.</li>
            <li> For me, it was not worth using because for the time it took to do the coverage application process, it was too much bother.  </li>
            <li> The Joan RIvers Bare Legs lasts in my local pool.</li>
            <li> so you may want to use a ordinary concealer on top just to blend it into your skin a little.</li>
            <li> As I said, the cream goes on very smoothly and perhaps I chose the wrong colour for my skin tone,  </li>
            <li> LONG LASTING.</li>
            <li> It washes off too easily and looks fake up close.  </li>
            <li> Does not make them completely disappear, but much less visible.</li>
            <li> Overall, I did not like the way my leg looked after application, but I do believe it was due to the color I chose.</li>
            <li> I actually did reorder the lightest shade and have used it on just a tiny little area.  </li>
            <li> Even though I let the concealer dry for about 10 minutes, it was tacky to the touch, and came off on everything, clothes, hands, phone, furniture.</li>
            <li> Let dry for 15 min</li>
            <li> I apply it after a shower (even after moisturizing); then do my hair and makeup, and it&#x27;s plenty dry.</li>
            <li> Also you need the moisturizer before you apply the makeup otherwise it would look dry.</li>
            <li> Until your skin is perfectly dry you could have streaks and longer drying time.</li>
            <li> You can use baby powder for the lighter shade and loose medium powder for your face.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get this product because I have purchased similar products with less than desirable results.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, you must let it dry before putting your clothes on.  </li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Use a rough washrag and plenty of soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i saw this at the dollar store and its only 1 dollar but this is waste of money</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen spray leg make-up that I bought at Target after ordering this one, to have on hand just in case, was completely the wrong color, was runny and never dried.  </li>
            <li> There might be folks out there who need a really thick and complete coverup, but it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy this or suggest it to other friends or family</li>
            <li> blemishes and any other marks on the skin .</li>
            <li> Extremely dissatisfied .</li>
            <li> I use it to cover dark spots on the backs of my hands as well as veins on my legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to a thick foundation.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in product, does not work and actually made the scar more visible.</li>
            <li> so use to my legs looking so odd.</li>
            <li> They would call at odd hours, like 5-6 in the morning when I am still sleeping.</li>
            <li> I previously used Dermablend from the department store and it is visible on my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe I rubbed it on too hard, causing it to come loose.</li>
            <li> Really looked fake, very uneven when applying.</li>
            <li> so I added a little hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> After that it will still feel a little tacky, but doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothing.</li>
            <li> I had already put 3 layers on and it still didn&#x27;t cover the bruise not even a little.</li>
            <li> and it is a little streaky going on with the sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> Watch the color, because even the medium is very dark.  </li>
            <li> They either don&#x27;t work or are too messy.</li>
            <li> I either use Neutrogena Sesame Oil or St Ives Lotion, wait a few minutes and spread this over.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I have always hesitated to purchase medium because it&#x27;s usually too dark.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> And didnt change once it dried.  </li>
            <li> I have bruises on my legs that i wanted to cover up and this product, although not magic in a bottle, makes them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to use but dried and didn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> Very messy and color is uneven.</li>
            <li> I had to use a large caked on amount for coverage and then it looks bad.  </li>
            <li> The product is a little thick</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money too!</li>
            <li> The product did not cover up scars and marks on legs and was a total FAIL.</li>
            <li> Such false advertising !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the product goes on (sticky) and hard to apply with very little coverage.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s in good shape, but have terrible spider veins, and the beginning of varicose veins due to my genetics (mom had them terribly) and my job (on my feet at hospital).      </li>
            <li> The sponge on tube is useless (a waste of time and it absorbs half a tube of product before it can be used)</li>
            <li> It was hard to squeeze the product from the tube.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find something to cover those things.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to squeeze out of the tube and it didn&#x27;t cover my spider veins at all.  </li>
            <li> Also ,you must wait at least 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li> Since it actually looks like I have dirty patches</li>
            <li> Its really thick</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again a real waste of money.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick</li>
            <li> No more tight/binding pantyhoses, no more messy spray stuff, and no more ugly veins showing through my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is very thick and makes you feel that  you have clay caked on your skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have really bad legs it will help at least little bit.</li>
            <li> So I am not happy with this product and will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I stand behind it.</li>
            <li> horrible product, do not buy this if u really need to cover up anything on ur body</li>
            <li> Thick, sticky and stinks.</li>
            <li> This is not waterproof; this is a rip-off!</li>
            <li> But the worse was that my legs felt dirty.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, not for me.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment !!!</li>
            <li> COLOR&#x27;S NOT PERFECT</li>
            <li> While I like the product, the way I received it was just wrong.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> A disappointment.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is crap!</li>
            <li> I ordered the product advertised and I received a used, caked, unpackaged and absolutely disgusting representation of the product I ordered.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked the way this cream smoothed onto my skin, which is very dry, but after the first application the sponge fell apart and I discovered that it couldn&#x27;t just simply be removed so now I have parts of it left on the top of the tube!  As I said, the cream goes on very smoothly and perhaps I chose the wrong colour for my skin tone,  I&#x27;m very fair skinned so I chose the lighter shade but it&#x27;s too light and looks powdery on my legs.  Once on it stays well and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; so I liked that about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use it again I&#x27;ll try a darker colour, probably the medium.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 tubes, but for some reason only got one. But i love the product. Great cover up for psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of moderately priced skin correctors and cover ups. They either don&#x27;t work or are too messy. I am very fair skinned with large freckles and discoloration on my legs. Just follow the directions and it works great, without streaks. The appearance as soon as you apply it is the same when it sets. Definately recommend if you are looking in the midprice range.</li>
            <li> This concealer works great. Its really thick so you may want to use a ordinary concealer on top just to blend it into your skin a little. But it covered up my stretch marks really well and looks great on camera. However to look at the areas directly you can tell you have concealer on.</li>
            <li> It does not rub off on your clothes, but it really does not cover too well either.  The fair was too light for me.</li>
            <li> great cover up for those red marks on hands and arms</li>
            <li> Loved the product. Decided recently to try another called Smart cover. Didn&#x27;t want to buy much, in case it didn&#x27;t work. It worked fine but, the size I bought was only 78 of an oz. I will compare, next time I have to order, how much 3 oz of theirs cost verses your 3 oz tube. I&#x27;ll go with the better price, of course, because I liked them both</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s in good shape, but have terrible spider veins, and the beginning of varicose veins due to my genetics (mom had them terribly) and my job (on my feet at hospital).      This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  I bought the fair and it blends right in, no weird foundation look.  I usually moisturize first in order for this stuff to spread on evenly.  I either use Neutrogena Sesame Oil or St Ives Lotion, wait a few minutes and spread this over.  My legs actually look good.    There is no comparison with the inferior spray on junk.  It washes off too easily and looks fake up close.  The Joan RIvers Bare Legs lasts in my local pool.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the looks or feel of it.  It comes off some when it rubs against furniture or things</li>
            <li> Makes my verygross veins disappear!  Lasts quite awhile on &amp; is waterproof. I use it on special occasions under my panty hose.</li>
            <li> No it won&#x27;t cover spider veins enough to forgo nylons, but it does help camouflage.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected and that&#x27;s a great plus for me since I needed it to cover some imperfections for a big event. It did the job and I was happy with it. However you have to choose the right shade for your skin otherwise it will not have the right results. I chose the lighter shade on my legs since I have lighter skin in that area and I also bought the medium shade to cover up some spots on my face. Make sure you use the right shade powder to set it in. You can use baby powder for the lighter shade and loose medium powder for your face. Also use a good sponge or make up brush to apply. It&#x27;s water proof but washes off easily with soap and water. Worked great for the price. I would buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> I am happy that there is a product like this to cover spots on the legs.  The product is a little thick so I added a little hand lotion.  I had no irritation from using it.</li>
            <li> Loved how it made my legs look. However, it did rub off on my clothes even after waiting much longer than recommended to dry, before dressing. Will still use with darker colors.</li>
            <li> after a while the colour changes and turns very pasty... dont think I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Used on arm scars two plus months after surgery.  Allows you to wear short sleeves without scars being obvious.  Seems to stay on and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I had to use a large caked on amount for coverage and then it looks bad.  Color matches perfectly but does not give the coverage advertised. I would not buy this or suggest it to other friends or family</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a week ago. I consider myself fair skinned, but the Fair color did not match my skin tone.  Therefore, I agree with another commenter to try a shade darker than your complexion, or maybe even the tan if you have fair skin.  It was hard to squeeze the product from the tube. It took about 15 minutes to dry and it washed right off with soap and water.  Overall, I did not like the way my leg looked after application, but I do believe it was due to the color I chose.</li>
            <li> The product was ok. Color didn&#x27;t really match and it didn&#x27;t cover completely.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before and loved it.  I was glad that I found a place to order it.</li>
            <li> I use it to cover dark spots on the backs of my hands as well as veins on my legs. It stays on my hands even after I have washed my hands a couple of times. I had to order a lighter shade, because the medium shade was darker than I thought it would be. There is a sponge built into the top of the tube which you then use to spread and blend the product.</li>
            <li> The colors were not as expected..and the thickness of the make up was a bit much.  I threw it put.</li>
            <li> Shipment was immediate.  I passed on this product to a friend because the medium shade worked for me the best.  I figured fair would be too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should apply some lotion first then rapidly smooth on the leg makeup as it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get this product because I have purchased similar products with less than desirable results.  My main concern is coverage.  With body make-up you&#x27;re usually trying to cover up something pretty noticeable like a tattoo or bruise and it&#x27;s hard to find something to cover those things.  This product really does a great job covering both bruises and tattoos without looking caked on or too streaky.  The best part about it is that it is not noticeable at all on camera.  Everything Joan Rivers stands behind is great quality, so I should have known I would be getting something great when I purchased it - I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It covers all my flaws! Great camouflage!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the product goes on (sticky) and hard to apply with very little coverage. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t cover completely the vines. It&#x27;s like with make up, either you get full coverage or just light one. If you have really bad legs it will help at least little bit.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but had it done its job as advertised, I would have been happy to shell out for it. It did a good job at covering up, which explains the one star I gave it. Even though I let the concealer dry for about 10 minutes, it was tacky to the touch, and came off on everything, clothes, hands, phone, furniture. I had to wash everything it touched. This is not waterproof; this is a rip-off! Shame on you, Joan!</li>
            <li> Was told in the description that it would cover tattoos and it does not.</li>
            <li> I used this as a cover-up for moles on my legs for my daughter&#x27;s summer wedding since I didn&#x27;t wear hosiery. It was a little hard to use but dried and didn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> The fair color is fairer than fair, way to light and made my legs look artificial and the fact that it is a very dull look, not sheer and natural.  But the worse was that my legs felt dirty.  Sorry, not for me.</li>
            <li> It is hard to squeeze out of the tube and it didn&#x27;t cover my spider veins at all.  There are not that many shades to choose from and the back of my knees where the spider veins live, are fair, so fair should have done it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the lightest color and it is VERY light. I&#x27;m whiter than white and the cosmetic is lighter than me so do not purchase &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; unless you have extremely light skin. I thought it did a good job of minimizing the spider veins and some bruises I had. Does not make them completely disappear, but much less visible. I didn&#x27;t think it did a very good job with brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that it was important to moisturize first! Then I covered the blemishes. Then I would put a dollop in my hand rather than using the sponge, and spread it on all over. It takes 10-20 minutes to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;. After that it will still feel a little tacky, but doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothing. It does not come off easily. Use a rough washrag and plenty of soap.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even cover anything&lt;br /&gt;i saw this at the dollar store and its only 1 dollar but this is waste of money</li>
            <li> ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SPONGE CAME OFF AFTER USING IT THREE TIMES. BUT YOU CAN BUY SPONGES AND APPLY. WHICH IS BETTER ANYWAY SO YOUR NOT PUTTING BACTERIA ON AFTER USING THE ONE THAT IT ON THE TUBE OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  COLOR IS PERFECT FOR LIGHT SKIN, MATCHING JUST RIGHT AND NOT CAKEY LOOKING.  I BOUGHT MORE SO NOW I HAVE 4 TUBES, GREAT PRICE TOO</li>
            <li> It covers the small marks on my legs nicely, you can&#x27;t see them at all, but when i went out in the sun I could see the spots of makeup I put on my legs. Maybe I have to learn to blend it better,  I don&#x27;t know,  I thought I did, but I saw the spots of makeup!</li>
            <li> Big disappointment !!! It only covered my spider veins partially, although they did look somewhat better than if I did not apply the product . Also ,you must wait at least 10-15 minutes or it will rub off on your clothing.but after about 30 minutes it appeared much darker than when first applying it &amp; it cracked. I looked like a freak! Total waste of money!!!!!! I Do not recommend. Joan would never approve of this product.</li>
            <li> The color doesnt match 100% but this is a good temporary. I have veins I&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to cover and it didnt really cover much. But I give it a 4 star since&lt;br /&gt;I worked my way around it to use it better. it helps keep nylons on Though!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to hide scars or use as a foundation for your makeup it works&lt;br /&gt;no chipping all day, but otherwise if u have varicose veins I dont think&lt;br /&gt;this is for you. Not the sellers fault, theyre great and are Fast Shipping :)</li>
            <li> works great to cover scars . blemishes and any other marks on the skin . even worked on my tattoos</li>
            <li> A joke. Does not cover anything. Very messy and color is uneven. Would not purchase again a real waste of money.</li>
            <li> GREAT COVER. LONG LASTING. COLOR&#x27;S NOT PERFECT BUT IT BEATS SPIDER VEINS!</li>
            <li> I love this product...it does not streak if applied properly...I have had numerous \\&quot;spider veins\\&quot; on my legs for years...have had them injected three times for them only to return...this product is wonderful! I can now wear skirts and capri&#x27;s without hesitation...People compliment me on \\&quot;my tan\\&quot;...A word of advice..I am a caucasion woman with medium skin tone...You need to order one darker shade to make this transition complete...I ordered Tan and love it...If it comes off on your white sheets...switch to darker sheets...I have to admit..when I wear white capri&#x27;s or slacks, even after drying, there is some residue on the garment...so you just throw it in the washer and be done...the benefits of this product certainly outway any negatives...</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about Right To Bear Legs Cover Up. First it doesn&#x27;t really cover up anything. It gives a even tone to skin. Kind of like sheer hosiery would. The fair is ghostly fair! The price was cheap and I m going to order medium color to blend with the fair. The sponge on tube is useless (a waste of time and it absorbs half a tube of product before it can be used) so if you apply  hands-on you get better results. The consistency is thick so I mixed body lotion with it and got better results. Let dry for 15 min and it stays on until you scrub it off. It does look natural and looks good on hands and arms. Exfoliate skin first and use moisturizer. Just remember the colors are much lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> Love it! It is just what varicose veins needed to have nice looking legs again</li>
            <li> just like a regular makeup  ...not too mucho cover</li>
            <li> Well I have been seeing the commercials for this product and decided &amp;#34;hmmm you know what i&#x27;ll try it&amp;#34;. I Should of listened to myself every time I said no don&#x27;t get it. My legs bruise easy and wanted something to cover the bruises. I had already put 3 layers on and it still didn&#x27;t cover the bruise not even a little. It worked on the small Spider veins I&#x27;m beginning to develop but didn&#x27;t work on my larger more noticeable bruises. So I am not happy with this product and will never buy it again. I don&#x27;t recommend this for people trying to cover tattoos or any large dark spots like my bruises. The one good thing is it showed up with in the time it was expected to.</li>
            <li> The color is to light, my fault.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product. The sponge top makes application difficult and it doesn&#x27;t cover flaws very well. I suggest using Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs instead. I sprays on easily, covers well and is waterproof.</li>
            <li> This product does not cover as well as dermablend which is a product I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It goes on well and stays on, and the color I ordered was true to that advertised.  It is also very water resistant and comes off only if you use soap.  I received it very quickly from Oranges To Dollars and would order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sally Hansen spray leg make-up that I bought at Target after ordering this one, to have on hand just in case, was completely the wrong color, was runny and never dried.  I&#x27;ll be returning that to Target and keeping the Joan Rivers leg make-up and have already and will continue to recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Right to bare legs is a good product, however, while I can use products labeled fair in most cases, this product is too fair. It makes my legs even whiter than they already are. It does the job of cover-up very well but I have always hesitated to purchase medium because it&#x27;s usually too dark. In this case I suggest if you want color as well as cover-up order medium.</li>
            <li> While I like the product, the way I received it was just wrong. There was no packageing, and when I took the top off, it had been used already!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This seller should not be allowed to sell anything, ever.&lt;br /&gt; I  bought the light shade, but will also buy the medium shade to blend together to match my skin tone, BUT I will purchase it from a REPUTABLE seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product advertised on TV.  Looks great.  There might be folks out there who need a really thick and complete coverup, but it&#x27;s not for me.  It is very thick and makes you feel that  you have clay caked on your skin.  Watch the color, because even the medium is very dark.  I actually did reorder the lightest shade and have used it on just a tiny little area.  That is the only way I would use this product.</li>
            <li> Its okay, but it kinda made my legs LOOK like they had makeup on them.. then again it IS makeup.. lol and im so use to my legs looking so odd. Theres a type of Sponge that comes on top of the tube, and it starts to come off after awile...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother. This doesn&#x27;t work at all the way described.</li>
            <li> I thought this product did what it was intended to do. I covered up the scars on my legs like I wanted. I do believe if my scars were newer, that this product may not have covered them as well. I even used this product on bruises, which it did an ok job at. The burises were still visible.&lt;br /&gt;My problem is with the company. After writing my review of the product, I started recieving multiple inconvient phone calls from them. They would call at odd hours, like 5-6 in the morning when I am still sleeping. I understand that they may not have realized there is a time difference, but I still dont think it is exceptable from any company. I work in customer service and I dont call my customers at inconvient hours.&lt;br /&gt;Then when they did finally call at an hour that was decent, they insisted that I change my review and say how great the company is. Well I told them flat out, I would have gladly done so if it wasn&#x27;t for their intrusive innapropriate phone calls. I dont appreciate a company calling and insisting I change my opinion. I was honest with my review and I stand behind it. The product itself is good. But BUY FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY!!</li>
            <li> The coverage was not as good as I had expected.  For me, it was not worth using because for the time it took to do the coverage application process, it was too much bother.  It never really covered completely.</li>
            <li> I really like the product as long as you put lotion on first so it blends in better.  Would recommend it to us older ladies who have spent too much time in the sun.  It&#x27;s not perfect but it helps to look better and pretty natural.  Good to get two shades to mix.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crap! It does not work! Do not buy! You will be disappointed! Waste of my money! Don&#x27;t waste your money too!</li>
            <li> I bough one lighter tone of this product to mix with another my friend had given me, it is easy to mix in the palm of your hand and the results were better than others that cost about double the price, It does a pretty good job, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I feel that the coverage from this product is good but still leaves some of my scars visible. It stays on well but  you do have to wait a bit before putting on clothes. I also dab the product which gives more coverage.</li>
            <li> This product is a very light coverage so it does not do a great job of hiding flaws. I had to apply more than once and it is a little streaky going on with the sponge applicator. This product did not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> Thick, sticky and stinks. No where meets my expectations. I am not impressed. Don&#x27;t waste your money. That&#x27;s what I get for watching infomercials!</li>
            <li> So I bought this in tan and luckily it matched my skin tone pretty well. I have bruises on my legs that i wanted to cover up and this product, although not magic in a bottle, makes them less noticeable. It&#x27;s an okay buy, I&#x27;m keeping the product. Looks better with than without.</li>
            <li> So far I like it. I am very fair but I did take the advice of the others and got a darker shade. It goes on very smooth and dries quickly. Have not tried it in the swimming pool yet. My veins require a couple of coats.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it could be that I got to light of a color but it doesn&#x27;t seem to really cover anything as well as I&#x27;d like..</li>
            <li> Really looked fake, very uneven when applying. And didnt change once it dried.  However, it was waterproof thou.  After using once, the sponge tore off.  I would NOT recommended to any to purchase, nor would I buy again !!</li>
            <li> I like this Product. Actually I used this for&lt;br /&gt;a quick fix on the face, for a Wedding&lt;br /&gt;my Photo turned out Great...due to the&lt;br /&gt;fact I looked younger and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge on clothing and can be sheer or applied to desired thickness and coverage</li>
            <li> The fair covers up the brusies and varicose veins well, but it does make me look very, very fair. I mix with the medium for a better color.</li>
            <li> I use several products trying to find the perfect one. It does stay on good, and seems to be pretty much waterproof.  Until something better comes along, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Product does what it says, it helps fade unflattering veins depending on how severe the condition is.  It is hard though to get the exact match with skin color, i found one to be too light and the other to dark but still a good product.</li>
            <li> The Right to Bare Legs Cover Up does cover well. But the color -- I purchased \\&quot;light\\&quot; -- is too yellow for my skin. I&#x27;m not sure I can use it without covering everything, which will involve using most of the tube, just for one wearing. Which makes it a not-so-good solution. A disappointment. But most people&#x27;s skin is more yellow than mine, so it might work for them.</li>
            <li> If you are getting this to cover a tattoo, don&#x27;t. It will not cover a tattoo but, it does make your legs look flawless. I could see it being used to minimize the look of scars but not to cover anything of color.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product! I bought it for&lt;br /&gt;My Mom so she could cover up the veins on her legs and it  didnt cover them up . Such false advertising ! This should be pulled off the market !  I had to give it one star or my review would go through. It&#x27;s a zero !</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in product, does not work and actually made the scar more visible. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Loved the way my legs looked-used this product to go to a wedding this summer-it was easy to apply and made my legs look great. I would definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous! I have blue veins and sun damage spots here and there on the backs, and fronts, of my legs, which this product almost makes disappear. Nothing but vein removal would make veins disappear completely, but this cover is the next best thing.  I use the Fair (Scandinavian ethnicity), but expect the other shades work just as well for other skin tones. Like other reviewers have said, you must let it dry before putting your clothes on.  I apply it after a shower (even after moisturizing); then do my hair and makeup, and it&#x27;s plenty dry. It does not rub off on the sheets overnight either - another plus for those who shower in the morning.  I previously used Dermablend from the department store and it is visible on my skin. Joan&#x27;s product actually blends in without streaking and looks like skin, not makeup on skin.  Don&#x27;t use too much though, and apply a little, then more if you need more coverage. The sponge on the tip of the tube helps apply the product, but I&#x27;ve found my fingers blend it just as well, or better. For me, the sponge broke away from the tube easily, so it&#x27;s not all that useful. Maybe I rubbed it on too hard, causing it to come loose. You do have to wash the product off with soap and water though as it is designed to stay put - which is what we want!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it covered all the imperfections you needed to cover. However make sure that you goop I the right color otherwise it won&#x27;t look natural. Also you need the moisturizer before you apply the makeup otherwise it would look dry. Overall the product was great.</li>
            <li> This product did NOT do as advertised.  VERY disappointed.  The product did not cover up scars and marks on legs and was a total FAIL.</li>
            <li> I got the fair which was my mistake since I am very tan in the summer but it did work to cover up some spider veins and discoloration. Dried quickly as well. Since then I bought the tan and I love it. Don&#x27;t even have to wear hose now and it goes on and dries fast. I have had no problems with it rubbing off on my dresses or even sheets. I forgot I had it one when I napped. I followed the directions and it was perfect since I have dark patches on my lower legs when I am out in the sun. Since it actually looks like I have dirty patches I was delighted with the even skin tone this product provided. Be sure to wait at least 10 minutes after you exfoliate before applying. Until your skin is perfectly dry you could have streaks and longer drying time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products to mask my spider veins on my legs, this is by far  the best.  It covers &amp; blends perfectly with my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific!</li>
            <li> I ordered the product advertised and I received a used, caked, unpackaged and absolutely disgusting representation of the product I ordered.  I rened as instructed, after my initial complain and to date I have not received a replacement or refund. Extremely dissatisfied .</li>
            <li> Sponge broke on first use!  Junk.</li>
            <li> does not cover anything. horrible product, do not buy this if u really need to cover up anything on ur body</li>
            <li> perfect...i even use it on the back of my hands! just the thing for spring and sandals...great product for me</li>
            <li> The sponge applicator split in two the first time I used it, I am fair skinned, but the fair did not cover like advertised on TV. I will purchase the medium then I will review it. It is smooth and does not have a perfume smell, it does not come off on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Joan Rivers, for the infomercial on this product!  I used pantyhose for years before trying the spray stuff, but since trying this product, I am hooked.  No more tight/binding pantyhoses, no more messy spray stuff, and no more ugly veins showing through my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally apply the product by hand because the sponge applicator does not glide easily on my skin.  Also, I mix the medium with the fair shade to match my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I bought it to cover varicose veins in the summer and after seeing the product on TV and reading the reviews on Amazon, I thought this was the best product to try.  I was happy with it, the only complaint I read seen was that it gets on your clothes, but I found that if you put it on AFTER your get into your shorts or bathing suit, there&#x27;s no issue with that.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the sponge disintegrating as I put some on my fingers and applied it that way, rather than use the sponge to do it.  I figured the less stuff on the sponge, the better -- so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the sponge falling apart.  It stays on after swimming and I bought the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade as I&#x27;m a light-skinned redhead.  Even that shade was a teeny bit too dark, but it ended up blending nicely.  Someone recommended applying it after putting lotion on and that worked well, too.  It&#x27;s similar to a thick foundation.</li>
