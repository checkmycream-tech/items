            <li>I used to buy ones like this at the drug store but can no longer find them, so I&#x27;m glad to have found something comparable.  </li>
            <li>but it does a better job.</li>
            <li>This thing seems a bit pricey but the results are better than anything else.  </li>

            <li>Love this product, Amazing soft feet and no calluses for me!</li>
            <li>I was quite familiar with this product, as the resort &amp; spa in Arizona</li>
            <li>It did do a great job on my dry feet.</li>
            <li>Shipping was rocket fast!!</li>
            <li>Entirely worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>My feet are somewhat smooth but it would have been even better if I just went outside and scraped my foot against a cement block.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to wear down making it an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li>Now I am able to purchase this product and obtain the same results for my feet in the comfort of my home.</li>
            <li>One of the local salons uses these and they work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to deal with a return, but will think twice before reordering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter - like a petrified sponge.</li>
            <li>really like this item.</li>
            <li>Be careful though if you rub too hard you will remove more than the callous!!!  </li>
            <li>It is long lasting (months) and effective.</li>
            <li>This gets rid of calluses in no time, much less time with a lot less effort than anything else I have tried, and the results are nice smooth pink soles, also better than with anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to my friends, family and clients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this -</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>If you use it every other day ur feet will he callous free in about a week.</li>
            <li>I first tried it when getting a pedicure and purchase one at the same place....</li>
            <li>It is what I was looking for...just that it looks pretty big on the picture.</li>
            <li>I personally will not recommend this product because it looks very susceptible to wear and tear.</li>
            <li>They do get smaller with use, but they are cheap enough to buy several.</li>
            <li>Although this stone wears down a bit faster than others, it gets the job done better than any other stone on the market.  </li>
            <li>has just the right amount of strength / resistance - not so much that it scrapes without any give at all (which can be harsh), but just enough give</li>
            <li>No other pumice stone works as well.</li>
            <li>I would like to state that you shouldnt make this stone wet too much, as it will melt because its not a solid stone.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommended to anyone with rough, callus feet.</li>
            <li>This is serious pumice, not just slightly rough, and I use it for six or more months before it needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li>All inconsequential, I say;  the small amount of pumice rinses right off and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you throw away all those other pedicure stones and use this one.  </li>
            <li>So it probably won&#x27;t last as long as that old pumice stone</li>
            <li>This stuff is cheap and slowly crumbles away when handled, having to wash your hands after each use!</li>
            <li>The stone is decomposing a little but not too much at all.</li>
            <li>You might think you don&#x27;t like this stone at first because it is black, weighs nearly nothing, and some of the black pumice will come off on your foot.  </li>

            <li> Plus, I personally feel that you wouldn&#x27;t want to keep a pumice stone too long anyway because of the germs (just like a loofah).  </li>
            <li> and I only need to use it every two to three weeks as long as i keep my feet moisturized.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to find a product like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a licensed cosmetologist for thirty years, and have been using this product for almost as long.</li>
            <li> Every year as soon as the heat goes on, the dry, embarrassing feet are here.</li>
            <li> After I use my stone, I put it away in a dry area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It removes rough dry skin from my feet</li>
            <li> I tried this out of the package just by getting my feet and the pumice stone a bit wet in the shower and rubbing off the calluses on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Just wet the stone, wet the feet, and scrub.  </li>
            <li> Used regularly at the end of the bath (once skin has been thoroughly softened), dry, cracked or splitting soles and heels are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Yes, they do wear down over time, but they&#x27;ll last you about 6 months with heavy use, longer if you don&#x27;t use it that often.  </li>
            <li> You can get rid of the razor blades, creams, scrapers, other types of pumice stone, egg-shaped devices, all that stuff.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those not happy with typical drug store callus removing products.</li>
            <li> I also notice I have to do this less often now after using this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it was a little pricey for four stones.</li>
            <li> No it is not a genuine stone and will dissolve over time.</li>
            <li> It scrubs away all the dead skin from my feet and leaves a lotion residue on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of them and one turned out to be just plain pumice stone without foaming.</li>
            <li> Also has a very odd smell.</li>
            <li> There is no better product out there.</li>
            <li> This pumice stone eases the pain from calluses on the ball &amp; rough skin on the heel of my poor feet.</li>
            <li> over time it will dissolve, but it lasts at least 6 months...</li>
            <li> just like the evil witch of the west!</li>

            <li> Although this stone wears down a bit faster than others, it gets the job done better than any other stone on the market.  I&#x27;ve given them as gifts, and the recipients have also been amazed with their results!  Highly recommended for those not happy with typical drug store callus removing products.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this one (NuSole Pedi Stone Pumice), it dissolved immediately in the water.....just like the evil witch of the west!</li>
            <li> It took a long time to find a product like this.  This stone is excellent for keeping your feet smooth and silky.  It takes a long time to wear down making it an excellent purchase. I highly recommend you throw away all those other pedicure stones and use this one.  Shipping was rocket fast!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a licensed cosmetologist for thirty years, and have been using this product for almost as long. Nothing else compares, superior to pumice. No it is not a genuine stone and will dissolve over time. It is long lasting (months) and effective. Used regularly at the end of the bath (once skin has been thoroughly softened), dry, cracked or splitting soles and heels are a thing of the past. There is no better product out there. I highly recommend this product to my friends, family and clients. 5 Stars all the way!</li>
            <li> I was quite familiar with this product, as the resort &amp; spa in Arizona I visit for my manicure &amp; pedicures uses this stone on their customers. Now I am able to purchase this product and obtain the same results for my feet in the comfort of my home. This pumice stone eases the pain from calluses on the ball &amp; rough skin on the heel of my poor feet. The results after using this stone are simply GREAT! I use it while in the bath and my feet feel so happy after. I Highly recommended to anyone with rough, callus feet.</li>
            <li> I personally will not recommend this product because it looks very susceptible to wear and tear. I had to return the product the next day of its arrival.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of them and one turned out to be just plain pumice stone without foaming. Too much hassle to deal with a return, but will think twice before reordering.</li>
            <li> One of the local salons uses these and they work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.  They do get smaller with use, but they are cheap enough to buy several.</li>
            <li> I am a nail Tech and love this product, and so do my clients! local store went out of business so I was very happy to see that I was able to find it on Amazon! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product actually works!!  I&#x27;m going to stock up before they disappear. Love love love it and so do my friends and co- workers</li>
            <li> Love these stones! I first tried it when getting a pedicure and purchase one at the same place....they went out of business and I have been looking for them ever since! I was so happy to find them here!</li>
            <li> LOVE this pumice stone.  I used to buy ones like this at the drug store but can no longer find them, so I&#x27;m glad to have found something comparable.  Yes, they do wear down over time, but they&#x27;ll last you about 6 months with heavy use, longer if you don&#x27;t use it that often.  Plus, I personally feel that you wouldn&#x27;t want to keep a pumice stone too long anyway because of the germs (just like a loofah).  I&#x27;d highly recommend this - it does a really great job without feeling like a cheese grater!</li>
            <li> Similar to a product i was using. It removes rough dry skin from my feet and I only need to use it every two to three weeks as long as i keep my feet moisturized. I gave it 4 stars because it was a little pricey for four stones. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is what I was looking for...just that it looks pretty big on the picture. ......but I do get the product that I was looking for...</li>
            <li> This pumice stone didn&#x27;t lather for me, not a big deal. It did do a great job on my dry feet. Every year as soon as the heat goes on, the dry, embarrassing feet are here. At the end of a shower I scrubbed with this, after a couple days doing this there was a noticeable difference! It doesn&#x27;t feel like a traditional pumice stone. It&#x27;s much lighter - like a petrified sponge. So it probably won&#x27;t last as long as that old pumice stone but it does a better job. I recommend this to anyone with \\&quot;winter feet\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  Works perfect and travels well.....</li>
            <li> Love this product, Amazing soft feet and no calluses for me!</li>
            <li> This is the best pedi stone out there and believe me I have tried them all.  If you use it every other day ur feet will he callous free in about a week. Be careful though if you rub too hard you will remove more than the callous!!!  Ouch!!!</li>
            <li> Entirely worth every penny.  This thing seems a bit pricey but the results are better than anything else.  You can get rid of the razor blades, creams, scrapers, other types of pumice stone, egg-shaped devices, all that stuff.  You don&#x27;t even have to actually soak your feet.  I tried this out of the package just by getting my feet and the pumice stone a bit wet in the shower and rubbing off the calluses on my feet.  You might think you don&#x27;t like this stone at first because it is black, weighs nearly nothing, and some of the black pumice will come off on your foot.  All inconsequential, I say;  the small amount of pumice rinses right off and although lightweight, this thing is durable.  Just wet the stone, wet the feet, and scrub.  This gets rid of calluses in no time, much less time with a lot less effort than anything else I have tried, and the results are nice smooth pink soles, also better than with anything else I have tried.  I also notice I have to do this less often now after using this product.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not \\&quot;lather\\&quot; it&#x27;s not even a stone!! What the heck? The picture makes it seem that it is, rather it&#x27;s nothing but some dense styrofoam!!!! This stuff is cheap and slowly crumbles away when handled, having to wash your hands after each use! My feet are somewhat smooth but it would have been even better if I just went outside and scraped my foot against a cement block. Don&#x27;t buy! Check out something else. (Especially if you don&#x27;t wanna pay 3.99 for shipping either).</li>
            <li> has just the right amount of strength / resistance - not so much that it scrapes without any give at all (which can be harsh), but just enough give so that it scrubs / buffs correctly.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week. Keeps my feet soft and smooth. The stone is decomposing a little but not too much at all. I bought it nine months ago and it is 90% there. I just keep it out of the shower and in the medicine cabinet when I&#x27;m not using it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is great. A lot easier on the skin than pumice stone. Will be using only these on my feet from now-on...</li>
            <li> These pumice stones are the Best!!!</li>
            <li> Best pedi-stone....use it at the end of your shower for soft feet.  over time it will dissolve, but it lasts at least 6 months...</li>
            <li> This stone works awesome for me. I use it after I shower, pull out a stool to sit on, and just scrub my feet with this stone while occasionally dabbing my foot in water. It scrubs away all the dead skin from my feet and leaves a lotion residue on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to note that I saw someone&#x27;s feedback on this item that it melted away after she put it in her tub after she used it once. I would like to state that you shouldnt make this stone wet too much, as it will melt because its not a solid stone. There is a reason why it leaves a lotion residue! After I use my stone, I put it away in a dry area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this item.</li>
            <li> I would have liked this product, but this product stains your skin when you use it.  For that reason, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> No other pumice stone works as well. This is serious pumice, not just slightly rough, and I use it for six or more months before it needs to be replaced. Have used it for decades and love it.</li>
            <li> This is the most un-durable pumice stone I have ever used.  Also has a very odd smell. I will not purchase product again.</li>
