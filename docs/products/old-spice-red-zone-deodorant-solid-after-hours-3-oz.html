            <li>I LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a privilege to be able to wear this scent.</li>
            <li>Better than &amp;#34;Swagger.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Deodorant isn&#x27;t a sexy purchase, but I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderfully handsome scent, too.</li>
            <li>a great old spice product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak for anyone else, but I think it can make anyone smell good.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this as a last-minute, desperation purchase right before a date, and it turned out to be a stroke of good luck (in more ways than one).</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean and goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more cost efficient to order on amazon than pay a much higher price at the stores!</li>

            <li>Works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of all the Old Spice deodorants, there&#x27;s just something about the scent that I love.</li>
            <li>Smells really good-not sure what else there is to say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for years, because I really like the scent, and it seems many women do too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a clean fresh smelling deodorant.</li>
            <li>Love this scent, it seems somehow more sophisticated than many other Old Spice scents.</li>
            <li>(not sure if that means I need to buy better cologne or that the smell is just that good)</li>
            <li>This was a great idea for the fact that I do not have to worry about buying these items in the near future.</li>
            <li>I become full Alpha when I combine this deodorant with Old Spice</li>
            <li>Smells good, but does not block odor as well as some of the other old spice products.</li>
            <li>On really hot days, and most of my last pregnancy I actually used it as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice since I first started using deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to think the shortage of this scent is because it is meant for true Alphas, like myself, to wear.</li>
            <li>Has an okay scent that lasts a little while.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming increasingly hard to find in the store, so subscribe and save</li>
            <li>this is my favorite scent, ever since I left the United States, I cant find old spice hardly anywhere let alone</li>

    <ol>
            <li> a great old spice product. i have had many compliments on this. it&#x27;s a clean fresh smelling deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I hope they don&#x27;t ever discontinue it. This deodorant works fairy well. No better or worse than most. I can&#x27;t use antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice since I first started using deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using After Hours specifically for the past couple years. It has a really nice smell that every person I date enjoys and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite scent, ever since I left the United States, I cant find old spice hardly anywhere let alone this scent, and boy it doesnt dissapoint</li>
            <li> literally the best scent ever</li>
            <li> I bought this along with some other personal items. This was a great idea for the fact that I do not have to worry about buying these items in the near future.</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts a long time. The scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell. I can&#x27;t really speak for anyone else, but I think it can make anyone smell good.  Great product 5/5!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good and it works really good</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that my boyfriend will use. It smells AMAZING. On really hot days, and most of my last pregnancy I actually used it as well. I love the smell of it. It smells fresh and clean and goes on nice and smooth. It&#x27;s much more cost efficient to order on amazon than pay a much higher price at the stores! Great product we will keep on buying.</li>
            <li> Smells really good-not sure what else there is to say. Put it on and my girlfriend thought I was wearing cologne (not sure if that means I need to buy better cologne or that the smell is just that good) but she really liked it regardless!</li>
            <li> I first bought this as a last-minute, desperation purchase right before a date, and it turned out to be a stroke of good luck (in more ways than one). I&#x27;ve been using it now for years, because I really like the scent, and it seems many women do too. It&#x27;s hard to go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s go-to brand and scent, and I have no complaints.  Has a manly scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent. Probably the hardest scent to find, but thee best smelling. I wear this at times without cologne and I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how awesome I smell. The ladies can&#x27;t keep their hands off me when I wear this. It&#x27;s like I have an extra pheromone advantage against Betas. I become full Alpha when I combine this deodorant with Old Spice After Hours Body Wash (which is also VERY hard to find). I&#x27;m starting to think the shortage of this scent is because it is meant for true Alphas, like myself, to wear. It&#x27;s a privilege to be able to wear this scent.</li>
            <li> mmmmmm, Smells so good! Works So well!</li>
            <li> yup, its the same stuff i have been buying in stores for years, but now it comes to my door in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, it seems somehow more sophisticated than many other Old Spice scents. They now also make an antiperspirant version with this scent for when you need stronger protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a good idea to use deodorant.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell... looooove it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use it at night and feel it is too strong for summer! In the morning I use Fiji Sent and it is awesome as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky. After Hours scent is by far the best scent. I dig it. Chicks dig it. Last a really long time</li>
            <li> It works.  Has an okay scent that lasts a little while.  Good protection all day.  Better than &amp;#34;Swagger.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great smelling product, and I&#x27;ve never had it fail. Deodorant isn&#x27;t a sexy purchase, but I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Cheap. Word.</li>
            <li> Best scent they have. It&#x27;s a shame you can no longer find it in stores. Got this on subscribe n save for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Great to get it at a cheaper price</li>
            <li> I put on a few licks of this under each arm and my wife took notice immediately. Come to think of it, I believe it was this product that helped sire my last child. Irresistible to the lady folk (maybe the men folk too? I liked it!).</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all the Old Spice deodorants, there&#x27;s just something about the scent that I love. It&#x27;s becoming increasingly hard to find in the store, so subscribe and save is the way to go, I guess.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but does not block odor as well as some of the other old spice products.</li>
            <li> Before this product I was a mortal</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY deodorant my husband will use because it works so well, all day long. This is a wonderfully handsome scent, too.</li>
