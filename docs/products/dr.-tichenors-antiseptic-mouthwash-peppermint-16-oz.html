            <li>It is incredibly strong and you will regret it if you don&#x27;t dilute it</li>

            <li>If this is your first time, for the love of all that is not painful, dilute it!</li>
            <li>Besides being the least sweet and most effective mouthwash available, it is great as a treatment on the skin for itchy rashes and bug bites.  </li>
            <li>I do kind of wish it still came in the classic glass bottles.</li>
            <li>This is really strong antiseptic mouthwash, worth every penny, you could probably use it for a stubborn sore that won&#x27;t heal, of course check with your dr.</li>

            <li>This is a tried and true product.  </li>

            <li>(this worked for me, may not work for you, but it sure cleared me up entirely!!</li>
            <li>Dr Tichenor was a real person who invented the first antiseptic to save lives during the battlefield surgeries of the Civil War.</li>
            <li>Very basic ingredients and strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great for other things such as bug bites like other people</li>
            <li>My mom was born in New Orleans and met and married my dad there in 1948.</li>
            <li>This is better than any other mouthwash because you can feel it working.</li>
            <li>It is handy to carry a small bottle when traveling for antiseptic also.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it as my main mouthwash...</li>
            <li>I mix it a little stronger than the label recommends and it is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>I use it directly on a sore gum and it really help the healing.  </li>
            <li>He was a legend in New Orleans, where this company is based.  </li>
            <li>and they couldn&#x27;t quite believe how Tichenors completely relieved the sunburn pain.</li>
            <li>(I said forget it, I started using the solution as is directly on my skin)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite certain this is due to the high concentration of alcohol in it.  </li>
            <li>&amp; YES, you can actually see it happen in action!!</li>
            <li>and also as a facial toner for breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Better than other mouthwashes and SUPER minty.</li>
            <li>I diluted this w/a little water at first &amp; then</li>
            <li>Also I like to add it to certain mouthwash formulas, because sometimes they can be really weak tasting (not doing much for breath)...</li>

            <li> I did a half a swish and had to RUN as fast as I could to the bathroom praying I didn&#x27;t lose control and dribble it all the way down the hall.</li>

            <li> I have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> might as well try this, b/c I knew alcohol would dry ringworm out.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time due to the 5-1 water-mouthwash ratio mixture.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hey - Altoids claim to be \\&quot;curiously strong\\&quot; and I can pop 5 of those in my mouth with NO</li>
            <li> Be careful though</li>
            <li> (I started on my chest first to see if it would work or not &amp; Amazingly, it did!!</li>
            <li> You just have to be extremely careful and use only a VERY LITTLE at a time.</li>
            <li> After using one tube, every other toothpaste will taste like cotton candy to you.</li>
            <li> Had trouble finding it close by.</li>
            <li> &amp; he said, \\&quot;the alcohol &amp; peppermint is what killed off the viral infection\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The mouth wash is not easy to find</li>
            <li> and I intended to take a small swig and swish it around as I strolled to the bathroom to spew it out.</li>
            <li> but no more.  </li>
            <li> I found out about this product by purchasing a small bottle in an Arkansas store while visiting my Grandmother.</li>
            <li> it is so hard to find it in the stores these days.</li>
            <li> Alcohol dries the mouth, which in turn reduces saliva thus reduces your mouths natural ability to remove bacteria causing bad breath.</li>
            <li> I developed a HORRIBLE toothache involving 2 teeth (which is very strange because I had never had a toothache before in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For example if I&#x27;m rushing out of the house and really need to get my bad breath under control (onions for lunch!)</li>
            <li> But in the theory of combating bad breath this product only receives 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I desperately tried other methods to rid them.</li>
            <li> It was not a pleasant experience for her.</li>
            <li> And when they say to dilute it at a ratio of 5:1, they MEAN IT!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard how alcohol can make bad breath worse because it dries your mouth out and causes bacteria to build up.  </li>
            <li> is waking up with bad breath worse than the night before.  </li>
            <li> just afraid to use it as mouthwash because it might have sugar in it.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to find in stores, even here in south Louisiana.</li>
            <li> Flossing removes plague, which in turn your mouth produces saliva which removes the bacteria that causes bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this doesn&#x27;t help with bad breathe, then you need to go to the dentist every day.  </li>
            <li> When I use it before going to bed, I wake up in the morning with my mouth all nasty tasting.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I been using this mouthwash for years and I love it. I use it twice a day; once in the morning and once before bed. I love the pepperminty taste and clean feeling it leaves. If this is your first time, for the love of all that is not painful, dilute it! My wife has never expressed interest in using it, so I never explained that to her and she made the mistake of not diluting. It was not a pleasant experience for her.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years as a mouthwash and antiseptic for cuts and scrapes... works great and leaves a nice taste.</li>
            <li> This is an INCREDIBLE product! I had never heard of it until last night. I developed a HORRIBLE toothache involving 2 teeth (which is very strange because I had never had a toothache before in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put Orajel® maximum strength on it and it didn&#x27;t even touch the pain. I called my dentist and he called in a prescription mouthwash that he said would help the tooth aches, no effect. Then my friend said \\&quot;try this\\&quot;, and gave me [[ASIN:B002L6NZJE Dr. Tichenor&#x27;s Antiseptic Mouthwash]]. The pain was gone within SECONDS - and it hasn&#x27;t returned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: It is very strong. The directions say to dilute 1 part Dr. T&#x27;s to 5 parts water. (Ok, to be honest ... I didn&#x27;t follow the directions on the diluting. It says it&#x27;s \\&quot;strong\\&quot; - but I thought to myself, \\&quot;Hey - Altoids claim to be \\&quot;curiously strong\\&quot; and I can pop 5 of those in my mouth with NO PROBLEM.\\&quot; So, instead of diluting it 1:5 [as directed] I diluted 50:50.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the diluting in the kitchen ... and I intended to take a small swig and swish it around as I strolled to the bathroom to spew it out. Well, the first part went according to plan; I took a small swig. BUT then the plan fell apart, LOL. I did a half a swish and had to RUN as fast as I could to the bathroom praying I didn&#x27;t lose control and dribble it all the way down the hall. I did manage a good swish or two on my hallway-journey and by the time I arrived (like 5 seconds later) the toothache was GONE!</li>
            <li> Dr. Tichenor&#x27;s mouthwash has for many years been my best friend.  Our household finds this mouthwash to be the very best and we will go to great lengths to get it (like Florida) when local sources \\&quot;dry up\\&quot;.  It is handy to carry a small bottle when traveling for antiseptic also.</li>
            <li> Used this for years.  Had trouble finding it close by.</li>
            <li> this is the very best to put on insect bites.  we try to always keep some around to splash on when insect bites are itching.</li>
            <li> This is a tried and true product.  It does the job it says it will and MORE!  Have used it for years and was so very happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash i have ever used.  it is so hard to find it in the stores these days.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  It is great as a mouth wash and also for healing any problems in your mouth.  It is strong and needs to be diluted with water.  I believe that it does contain alcohol. I use it directly on a sore gum and it really help the healing.  I guess you could use it on most any skin problems.  I remember using a product called Dr Tichenor&#x27;s antiseptic when I was a child.  The mouth wash is not easy to find so I order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... it has no flouride so I don&#x27;t use it as my main mouthwash... also the alcohol is probably (not sure) a bit drying so again, not my first mouthwash choice... so, what am I doing with it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use dashes of this stuff for various things, because it&#x27;s antiseptic and has a ton of peppermint flavor. For example if I&#x27;m rushing out of the house and really need to get my bad breath under control (onions for lunch!) then I pop some gum in my mouth and put a dash of this on top. Also I like to add it to certain mouthwash formulas, because sometimes they can be really weak tasting (not doing much for breath)... so I add a dash of this to freshen my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the category it lies in. But in the theory of combating bad breath this product only receives 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad breath is caused by bacteria in the mouth. Bacteria lives in plague which is in between the cracks and crevices in your teeth. The best solution is brush after breakfast (not before) and floss daily. Flossing removes plague, which in turn your mouth produces saliva which removes the bacteria that causes bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is 70% or 140 proof drinking alcohol with the flavor of peppermint. Alcohol dries the mouth, which in turn reduces saliva thus reduces your mouths natural ability to remove bacteria causing bad breath. Solution? Buy an alcohol free mouthwash or buy sugar free gum as chewing increases salivary flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up putting this in the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is STRONG! makes me feel my breath is fresh and clean. This has to be mixed with water because of the strength. My  second time ordering. Sure hope it&#x27;s working :).</li>
            <li> The best fragrance ever.</li>
            <li> Been using Dr. Tichenor&#x27;s for 20 yrs or more.  Used to be able to obtain a local CVS in the Chicago area but no more.  It&#x27;s all over the Southern part of the U.S. when we lived there.  It&#x27;s great for bug bites, cools itching from mosquito bites and it a wonderful all-purpose antiseptic.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found a source for this mouthwash.  We used it in our home when I was a child.  After using this mouthwash, my mouth is so fresh,  I feel that all the germs are gone.  Also, my gums are less sensitive.</li>
            <li> If this doesn&#x27;t help with bad breathe, then you need to go to the dentist every day.  Be careful though, don&#x27;t forget to dilute with water to gargle.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Besides being the least sweet and most effective mouthwash available, it is great as a treatment on the skin for itchy rashes and bug bites.  It is a true antiseptic. And when they say to dilute it at a ratio of 5:1, they MEAN IT!  It is incredibly strong and you will regret it if you don&#x27;t dilute it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip for you: Dr. Tichenors toothpaste is the most refreshing, cool, minty toothpaste you can imagine. It is nearly impossible to find in stores, even here in south Louisiana. But it is so worth your time to go to Dr. Tichenors website and order it. We order it by the case so that we never run out.  After using one tube, every other toothpaste will taste like cotton candy to you. It&#x27;s simply the best. It&#x27;s worth a visit to the Dr Tichenors website to read about the unique history of these products.  Dr Tichenor was a real person who invented the first antiseptic to save lives during the battlefield surgeries of the Civil War. He was a legend in New Orleans, where this company is based.  Try it!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash in the world! I found out about this product by purchasing a small bottle in an Arkansas store while visiting my Grandmother. I didn&#x27;t realize it was concentrated and almost melted away my tonsils in the store parking lot. My mouth was minty fresh for 2-weeks.Had to find it when I got home. It is almost addicting.</li>
            <li> This Mouthwash is excellent. It can be used for Tooth infection, sore gums, scrapes, bruises and as an ointment. Just follow the directions and be sure to dulute with water.</li>
            <li> We used this on our recent trip to Europe.  Just take a couple ounce and dilute it once you get to your destination.</li>
            <li> Dr. Tichenor&#x27;s works great and cuts down on packaging.  I can take a 3oz bottle with a dropper and it will last three weeks on vacation.  Why pay for the water and extra packaging when you can add it yourself?</li>
            <li> I found this in a tiny drug store 20 years ago and never again until now!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.  I use it for oral care (dilute it!!!) and also as a facial toner for breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Better than other mouthwashes and SUPER minty.</li>
            <li> Tichenors is an incredible product that everyone had in the bathroom in New Orleans when I was a kid ( I&#x27;m 67 )....it can be used from top of your head to bottom of your feet. Tichenors Pete, a cajun spokesman, said a foot user had the &amp;#34; happiest feet in town &amp;#34;. We were big hits in Panama City in the summer of 1964...there were some sunburned Georgia girls there and they couldn&#x27;t quite believe how Tichenors completely relieved the sunburn pain. What a product.....I do kind of wish it still came in the classic glass bottles. 5 stars because I can&#x27;t give it ten.</li>
            <li> I chose it for its antiseptic value to avoid periodontal issues. I have used it for a long time.  You just have to be extremely careful and use only a VERY LITTLE at a time.</li>
            <li> This is very effective. Whatever you do, make sure you dilute it because if you don&#x27;t, you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a strong mouthwash that I could use with my oral water pick and this was a great find.  Once diluted it provides a nice minty taste and more cost effective method than using pre-mixed solutions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever actually used Dr. T&#x27;s as a mouthwash, but my Grandma used this on us for mosquito bites when we were kids, and it&#x27;s still the best thing I&#x27;ve found to this day (25+yrs later).  Just soak a cotton ball or tissue &amp; dab/soak the bites...the peppermint cools them &amp; stops the itching, and by morning, they&#x27;re almost always gone! :)</li>
            <li> Great stuff to gargle with. I use it also in my water pik. You Must dilute it with water before using it. It is helping to reduce my wisdom teeth pockets from 6 to 4.</li>
            <li> I bought this mouthwash after reading all the great reviews on how many people like it.  However, I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and it does not work.  When I use it before going to bed, I wake up in the morning with my mouth all nasty tasting.  I&#x27;ve tried using it several times a day to see if that would help and I still woke up with the same problem.  I&#x27;m quite certain this is due to the high concentration of alcohol in it.  I&#x27;ve heard how alcohol can make bad breath worse because it dries your mouth out and causes bacteria to build up.  That&#x27;s exactly the result I&#x27;ve been getting is waking up with bad breath worse than the night before.  I&#x27;ve used other mouthwashes and my mouth stayed nice and clean tasting with them.  I&#x27;m sure it works great for other things such as bug bites like other people have mentioned, but not as a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Excellent as i expected</li>
            <li> This is really strong antiseptic mouthwash, worth every penny, you could probably use it for a stubborn sore that won&#x27;t heal, of course check with your dr.</li>
            <li> I like it but  It is very very strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on sore muscles!</li>
            <li> My family and I use this mouth wash and it keeps our teeth and breath clean and fresh. This is better than any other mouthwash because you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouthwash I buy the truly kills and bacteria in my mouth and takes away tooth aches.</li>
            <li> saccharum carbonate is listed as an ingredient, and yet the only thing I found online was that saccharum was a species of sugar cane.  If it is sugar, then what is it doing in something that could be used as mouthwash?&lt;br /&gt;If it isn&#x27;t sugar, then what is it?&lt;br /&gt;I do have a bottle btw.. just afraid to use it as mouthwash because it might have sugar in it.</li>
            <li> Great product, been using for 25 years</li>
            <li> Very basic ingredients and strong. Lasts a long time due to the 5-1 water-mouthwash ratio mixture. One of the safer products on ewg&#x27;s skin deep database.</li>
            <li> I mix it a little stronger than the label recommends and it is quite refreshing. This stuff is great if you like the tingle.</li>
            <li> Have used this since I was a child. My mom was born in New Orleans and met and married my dad there in 1948. We grew up on this and used it for almost everything! We consider it a miracle cure - bug bites, gum boils, canker sores, cuts, on and on goes the list. A must have in every household!</li>
            <li> **RINGWORMS: This product works great for ringworms. I broke out w/ringworms in 2013 all on my face, back &amp; chest area, (frm my dog) I desperately tried other methods to rid them. I stumbled upon this in my mother&#x27;s bathroom closet &amp; said, \\&quot;Well, might as well try this, b/c I knew alcohol would dry ringworm out. So I searched for any product w/alcohol in it to see if it would work so I grabbed the bottle of Dr. Tichenors I decided to use it as a last resort. (I started on my chest first to see if it would work or not &amp; Amazingly, it did!! LITERALLY, the ringworms started to clear up right before my eyes!! I diluted this w/a little water at first &amp; then (I said forget it, I started using the solution as is directly on my skin) **(Pls be warned that, this stuff is powerful so you may want to dilute it w/water) ((I&#x27;m not telling you to do what I did, I&#x27;m just telling you that this actually worked for me personally so PLEASE, talk to your doctor before you try this!! Research the pros &amp; cons &amp; then use prayer, wisdom &amp; discretion!!)) ...... Nevertheless, I applied it using baby wipes &amp; cotton balls &amp; in 4 days, all the ringworms disappeared &amp; they never came back!! (If I can find the pics I took in my iPad, then I&#x27;ll post them) .....I told my family doctor what I used to get rid of it &amp; he said, \\&quot;the alcohol &amp; peppermint is what killed off the viral infection\\&quot;. ....so if I ever get ringworm again, I&#x27;ll be using this product, b/c it got me cleared up literally in 4 days!!! No joke!! The Alcohol &amp; peppermint powerfully caused them to shrink and disappear!! &amp; YES, you can actually see it happen in action!! (Warning: Do not rub the solution because it will cause irritation &amp; burning!! --just dab &amp; allow the cotton ball to sit on the ringworm periodically until you notice it starting to disappear. (this worked for me, may not work for you, but it sure cleared me up entirely!!</li>
