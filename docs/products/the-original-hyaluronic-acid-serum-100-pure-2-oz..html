            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I also apply it to my toes which were kind of wrinkled</li>
            <li>it looks so nice</li>
            <li>I gave it an honest try.</li>
            <li>This was definitely a great purchase and I will buy some more when I finish my bottle.  :)</li>
            <li>I was delighted to receive this after many days without it.  </li>
            <li>It may have been a combination of my makeup on top of this product(I use Physician&#x27;s Formula talc-free mineral foundation)because when I used it at night, my skin looked good in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest, I NEVER write reviews on things I buy.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of &#x27;eh&#x27;  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly had no idea</li>
            <li>% pure\\&quot; it would be in powder form and you&#x27;d have to mix up your own 1% solution.</li>
            <li>This serum is absolutely the BEST!!!!  </li>
            <li>You use this with your own moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so it could be I&#x27;m not using it effectively.</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely on my face.</li>
            <li>This one is kind of watery.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to mention my application method because I wondered if it will be effective used in this manner.</li>
            <li>It has indeed evened out my complexion and hopefully will keep my skin looking good or even better by keeping it well hydrated.</li>
            <li>I gave it a good 5 months and my skin was getting accumulatively redder, drier, &amp; more</li>
            <li>It made me feel good to see that it wasn&#x27;t just an impression :-)</li>
            <li>As another customer suggested, I paired this with rose water.</li>
            <li>When wearing this under moisturizer and a bb cream, it gives me a nice, dewy glow for the summer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also-- extremely fast shipping and great packaging!!</li>
            <li>Nice package ...</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll readily OWN that.  </li>
            <li>GOOD TO ADD TO YOUR FAVORITE MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li>but hey people, there&#x27;s the internet and your own intuition.</li>
            <li>thank you is good product, but I need more for eraser my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Is nice for help your skin in winter</li>
            <li>It is an effective addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>but when items get popular companies cut corners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it hydrates</li>
            <li>and I think I should be seeing some kind of change....</li>
            <li>any kind of allergic reaction or hives or any rash.  </li>
            <li>To those who doubt this, I say give it a try on its own for a while.</li>
            <li>I bought it about a year ago because of my acne scars and I can absolutely say that this product is the best.  </li>
            <li>but after one year I can honestly say I will be a customer forever.  </li>
            <li>and she is loving</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Because this item work so good, with a item Benzylalcohol might better?</li>
            <li>I asked her how she liked it</li>
            <li>I cant believe I read so many good reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect - fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Making own night face cream</li>
            <li>but after a while, it kind of became one of those products where you don&#x27;t see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives nice glowing and moist.</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely and well-wrapped.</li>
            <li>I honestly like others, am dumbfounded by this product.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>I also feel like it has kind of a plumping/firming effect.</li>
            <li>Nice to use under makeup because it is not at all greasy like a lotion moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am more then pleased with this product and have shared it with many others!!</li>
            <li>It was really worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>Very good product and a very reasonable price for a generous bottle.  </li>
            <li>It feels good to put on like putting cool water on, but that&#x27;s about all its good for.</li>
            <li>I can tell a difference in my skin if I run out and continue to highly recommend this product for great skin!</li>
            <li>Gave it 3 stars for being fairly priced, quick delivery and good consistency</li>
            <li>This, however, is perfect every time and leaves my face feeling amazing soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and feels good.</li>
            <li>is one of the greatest humectants available today, and is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a thinner serum, but very easy to control&lt;br /&gt;Zero</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use</li>
            <li>It helped my wrinkles and very easy to put on</li>
            <li>but I am very impressed so far!</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s mostly genes, but this stuff moisturizes my acne prone skin and gives it an even more youthful glow!</li>
            <li>Just another satisfied customer! :)</li>
            <li>I also apply a good moisturizer to my face to soften those fine lines.</li>
            <li>I would say it is also excellent for sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly a year now, and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>so far it is great, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li>My complexion just glows and it is so soft and looks and feels great!</li>
            <li>As for the face, again - no permanent changes, but I would have that glow that I thought was really nice :)  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been impressed.</li>
            <li>but I would have liked it better if it had NOT leaked.  </li>
            <li>I liked this serum, but I feel like it was mostly glycerin, despite what the label says.</li>
            <li>So far, my skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li>I awake to beautiful, clear, bright skin.</li>
            <li>Great product at very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>At first i didn&#x27;t like it because I experienced some irritation.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first bottle and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>great product, does exactly what it describes to do.</li>
            <li>I have not yet experienced any noticeable improvements with wrinkle reduction, but then again, I have not used the serum as consistently as I should have.</li>
            <li>I had no idea what I was expecting, but I am pretty happy about  this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve researched in order to find the ingredients most important in producing a very effective difference in skin texture, appearance, radiance, suppleness; also minimizing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is not sticky at all - absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month now, and my fine lines have almost all gone away!  </li>
            <li>The product is odorless, very smooth solution and non greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This serum glides on like silk and you do not need a lot, very cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;One very important step is using the softener.</li>
            <li>and my skin is very smooth and even now.</li>
            <li>48 &amp; my complexion is very smooth and even.</li>
            <li>The best product I have used in a long time, helps keep my skin young and flawless and I am a skin junkie.</li>
            <li>so that is a huge plus for me!  </li>
            <li>I also bought some rosewater most based on another reviews recommendation, so</li>
            <li>My skin looks better already.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>i will order more.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I thought that this product would be a serum, but it is more of a water texture.  </li>
            <li>My point of the review is that, whatever goes inside this serum is not doing anything to better my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this serum....</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>The skin even looks more hydrated when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have been buying hyaluronic acid serum by cellux-c hydra-B for years, but to try ,and save some money (hydra-b is quite a bit more expensive)I thought I would try this one instead.</li>
            <li>Great Product, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and love it.  </li>
            <li>After that I can apply any day cream, make-up, or nigth cream directly on top.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used 1/2 of my bottle and am ordering more.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I spray Na-Pca on top of this serum; it seems to seal it in, or activate it, if you will.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think my skin is more moist...</li>
            <li>At one time II was able to afford</li>
            <li>I just wanted more oomph.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic stuff!  </li>
            <li>My husband noticed it immediately after a month of use and he now calls me Benjamin Button  :-)  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better and more plumped up.</li>
            <li>This product did seem to help with clearing up the blackheads on my nose and minimizing my pores, but I stopped using it because it also seemed like I was breaking out more on my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li>But overall, great purchase!</li>
            <li>Going to make sure</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>My skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>The results have been fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely mix with a moisturizer for best results.</li>
            <li>but I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clearer and yes, smoother, as in, it is holding more moisture...</li>
            <li>There are many many better brands.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m thinking it is better</li>
            <li>it was ok didn&#x27;t get any results from it</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Need I say more.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in my skin and am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on top, depending on how my skin feels</li>
            <li>My skin is feeling and looking better</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied that I have recommended it to family and friends,</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT, LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>The product is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have introduce to many of my friends to use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this product, however, its not as potent as the product Episilk hyalogic.</li>
            <li>is just comical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I know about it now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that you can really benefit from HA by humidity, because it draws moisture from the air into your skin and that keeping a humidifier in your room at night when you apply this has great results, but I have not tried that yet.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
            <li>I love beauty products.</li>
            <li>It says free shipping, but it took forever to get it!</li>
            <li>Mostly a bottle of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I stumbled on this and would recommend it to anyone who struggles with skin care!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will know more after using for a month.</li>
            <li>Have a gel product that works quite well but more costly.</li>
            <li>And it seemed like more of a barrier in between my moisturizer and skin than anything else.</li>
            <li>Works best for me when mixed in my hands with moisturizer, as opposed to applied before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I threw it out after thinking about it more.</li>
            <li>To top it all off my face felt and looked like leather.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a year or so and love it.</li>
            <li>I love thefactthet</li>

            <li>Ok, so I decided to do a  glycolic peel</li>
            <li>and I have enjoyed using it.  </li>

            <li>Love love love it...</li>
            <li>There are better formulas on amazon without alcohol.</li>
            <li>If you do order make sure you check delivery time</li>

            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I will have to order another bottle before my next peel,  but it seemed to work great!</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I always top off my skin with tons of moisturizer even after using this.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and have been a faithful user for over 4 yrs now.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>so I put this on top of my morning moisturizer</li>
            <li>I add a dropper or two to my favorite skin care products that don&#x27;t contain hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use a sunscreen over the top during the day and apply this serum again at night before bed.</li>
            <li>and it does seem to seep into my skin much better when I use it with the product.</li>
            <li>I am however going to buy a couple of extra bottles, one for myself and another for my best friend.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Love the neutral scent.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I also feel safe.</li>

            <li>My skin feels and looks better after using this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>At night, I top it with a retinol cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>con to this product for me is that it seems to be making me a bit more oily during the day</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and big bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked for life now :)</li>
            <li>but I want to look better.  </li>
            <li>and I am very happy with the results (especially with skin around my eyes).  </li>
            <li>I should have been using twice a day for even better results.</li>
            <li>I should have been using twice a day for even better results.</li>
            <li>So I make sure to keep it hydrated with a day cream.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on your skin.</li>
            <li>But as far as making your skin feel smooth and temporary plump, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>r much better serums on the market</li>
            <li>there is nothing better</li>
            <li>I have been using hyaluronic acid for more than thirty years.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>-  it  could be  helping :-)</li>
            <li>and I could not be more over the moon.</li>
            <li>it works and will order more</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li>I liked the smooth, almost gelatinous feel of the serum.  </li>
            <li>I think I would like something a bit more organic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, and especially when used with Squalane (not Squaline).</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>will be purchasing more</li>
            <li>I love how it gives a glow to the skin.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>But hyaluronic acid is a costly ingredient, which is why it&#x27;s important to choose a product with an effective concentration.</li>
            <li>In love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product, it takes a while to notice the results</li>
            <li>can either mix it in with your favorite moisturizer or you can use it</li>
            <li>I bought this product on the basis of many articles out there marketing the benefits of hyaluronic acid as an anti-aging must-have.  </li>
            <li>The name &#x27;serum&#x27; gives me the impression that the product is a bit thicker, but it is actually more watery than what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>It really does reduce lines, feels great, and combines with makeup or sunscreen etc.</li>
            <li>I love this Timeless Hyaluronic Acid Serum for my aching knees.  </li>
            <li>JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite weapons.</li>
            <li>My makeup is going on more evenly too.  </li>
            <li>I think it helps those work better by holding in the moisture.</li>
            <li>so I thought this product would be good for that, since so many reviews seem to have success with using it to help the skin retain moisture.  </li>
            <li>So, I applied the moisturizer on top of that.  </li>
            <li>I would love to have instructions on how to use this?</li>
            <li>My skin has looked so much better since I began using it.</li>
            <li>Ok so I have done years of research.</li>
            <li>but this company just seems way better.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more before this stuff gets</li>
            <li>I knew better</li>
            <li>After reading all of these reviews, you have to work ways that are best for you because every skin is different.  </li>
            <li>I love looking at my skin in the mirrow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t too expencive</li>
            <li>She has really enjoyed using it and has told me that she has seen quite an improvement in her skin</li>
            <li>It might work better for others</li>
            <li>It helps your skin absorb the creams better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Favorite serum of all time.</li>
            <li>It is pretty lightweight and feels amazing on my skin!</li>

            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to give it some more time.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so darn cheap!</li>
            <li>As its used in many cosmetic products but never in its entirety.</li>
            <li>This is a very generous size and a great value.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t swing it more than twice a year.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>

            <li>It has helped my skin look better along with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is one of the better products I have ever used.</li>

            <li>My skin likes this product and feels more hydrated for sure.</li>
            <li>I found alpha hydrox has better result.</li>
            <li>but wasn&#x27;t sure just how or when to apply it . . .</li>
            <li>Have seen better but not for the money</li>

            <li>I guess I was expecting my skin to feel more moisturized and plump.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find this product cause any Hyaluronic acid added to the others</li>
            <li>I hope I can always buy from this retailer at a great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tacky like some products do.</li>
            <li>BUT I feel better using this than not using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten do many complements on my skin.</li>
            <li>One more thing, I don&#x27;t have that excess of oil anymore</li>
            <li>I am actually in LOVE with this product.  </li>
            <li>on my neck, and my decolletage looks and feels more youthful.  </li>
            <li>After two days of doing this, my skin looks better than it has in twenty years.  </li>
            <li>maybe it will do more after more time.</li>
            <li>I use this with microneedling and its okay.</li>
            <li>Love this product will continue to always order.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better</li>
            <li>It looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>Think of this as your favorite product&#x27;s magnet, or a moister &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay for the price...does not come with instructions.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>i based it on all the many many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that, i use the dropper with the hyaluronic acid serum, and focas most around my eyes and the side of my face that had some scaring from pimples.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a week of using this 2x/day, my skin started to produce more oil</li>
            <li>just wish there was more information on how to use this product to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure heredity plays a part.</li>
            <li>This in combination with the Triple C serum is nothing short of amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Used for 2 more months, no change.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference with better moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers are too oily (even the oil-free ones, somehow) and cause breakouts, but my skin craves some sort of hydration.</li>
            <li>My horrendous breakouts are for the most part gone, (that time of the month will always be unforgiving)</li>
            <li>love the fact that I was able to buy the 2 oz .</li>
            <li>I ordered this serum based mostly on the glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more plump and dewy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Even if this stuff is 99% water, I have to admit that I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for the skin and really helps with moisture retention.</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li>The fewer ingredients, the better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the hyaluronic acid now for more than a year.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely product.</li>
            <li>I Love it</li>
            <li>I find my under eye concealer goes on much better with it, and my mineral make up goes on smoother after letting this soak</li>
            <li>in the end it cost a lot more then buying the authentic hyaluronic acid by skinceuticals and having to wears makeup to cover the redness</li>
            <li>and i will order more &amp; more.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I apply this right after I apply my Retin-A, followed by a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>That aside, my skin does look so good right now.</li>
            <li>the first lasted forever !!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>

            <li>It is inexpensive and arrived quickly so I will reorder for sure!</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and obsorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is really good to use in the morning, I use it first then</li>
            <li>The product was beautifully packaged with instructions clearly printed on the box.  </li>
            <li>My skin was always pretty good</li>
            <li>First of all, good luck getting any products from timeless skin care</li>
            <li>I am 46 and suddenly having breakouts, but in one week my breakouts have stopped and everything is almost healed, my fine lines are improving and yesterday at work 5 people commented on how flawless my skin looks YAY!!  </li>
            <li>worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid (originally extracted from rooster&#x27;s combs!  </li>
            <li>But this is so easy and it works even better.  </li>
            <li>well, I barely have any sun damage, my skin is silky smooth with awesome clarity, fine lines are on their way out</li>
            <li>She said it is the best for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to absorb and make my face look healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have been fighting my hormones as well as fine lines on my face for many years and</li>
            <li>but I am winning the battle with fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I tried to find a cheaper alternative to Rodan and Fields but kept noticing more fine lines.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff and will be a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across this on Amazon when I was looking to add to my skin care routine during Chicago&#x27;s wonderful polar vortex.</li>
            <li>Apply to clean damp skin and you&#x27;ll soon feel more hydrated and look more dewy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very good mixed</li>
            <li>This bottle should last quite a while and is a very good value.</li>
            <li>This is a very good alternative of a daily cream for people with dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>amazing product , really helped improve my skin, be smoother, fine lines deminished, no smell, wears nice under make up, but you may need a bit of a moisturizer over it , at night I use argan oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, my skin feels fresh</li>
            <li>His skin should be more accurate since he has never applied product to it &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Available in most health food places, or vitamin shops.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great &amp; apparently looks better to one of my coworkers</li>
            <li>My skin is hydrated, smooth and glowing; skin tone is a lot more even, and make up stays put all day.</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased with how smooth my face was when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>It has been great so far.</li>
            <li>It works great so far ..</li>
            <li>We noticed our skin became more smooth and supple when we added this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great serum to stock at home  for many reasons, but if you have a lot of skin allergies or if you&#x27;re acne prone - this is about the safest way to possibly go to avoid irritation, clogged pores, breakouts &amp; even more rapid healing of popped blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is silky smooth and makes my face feel fabulous!</li>
            <li>I  love this product it makes my skin  feel fantastic.  </li>
            <li>After this my skin feels very tight(may be good for wrinkles), but not realy moisturized.</li>
            <li>However - the price is good and the shipping fast.</li>
            <li>It feels really nice and is absorbed almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I use it after dermarolling, and it leaves my laugh lines and under eyes looking so nice</li>
            <li>I do hope this may encourage some of you to use these products as they are priced reasonable and they have been really good for me.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>serum itself goes on smoothly, absorbs into my skin quickly and plays nicely with the apple stem cell serum I use.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand my face looks great and flawless and like when I get compliments as to how young I look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products that claim to smooth out the skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines.  </li>
            <li>any other wonderful adjective you can think of*.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply face appears hydrated.</li>
            <li>The product is VERY mild.</li>
            <li>Pay more and find something more worth your money.</li>
            <li>Best to put on clean dry skin, then put on moisturizer after it dries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply (it&#x27;s almost like water,</li>
            <li>I received this very quickly from the supplier and it was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>My fiancee only used it twice on his face, he wouldn&#x27;t allow me to apply any more LOL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy, unscented and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Applies easily with water consistence...</li>
            <li>Mixed with Retinol for better results, but great product even if used alone.</li>
            <li>This blends easily and is non greasy and easily absorbs.</li>
            <li>It soaks in easily and can be worn under makeup.  </li>
            <li>I can easily see and feel if I skip it for a couple of days, and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>will strongly recommend to all my fris..</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a good product affordable and available.</li>
            <li>I will post a follow-up review later on, but right now this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more right now !  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the L&#x27;Oreal serum with hyaluronic acid that I was using (but has been discontinued), but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s much more pure, and has more hyaluronic acid in it.</li>
            <li>I most definately know that to be true.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working fairly well, but I&#x27;m using more than one product at the same time, so I can&#x27;t be sure which one is doing the job.</li>
            <li>I imagine that is due to taking good care of my skin and good genetics, but I must say that I think the hyaluronic acid helps to keep me moisturized and to keep the fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li>HANDS DOWN THE BEST THING</li>
            <li>This ingredient found in lots of high end moisturizers and this product is more effective and affordable.</li>
            <li>My dermatogist was even impressed by how much less clogged my pores are now that I&#x27;ve been using this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smooths out fine lines and minimizes pores.  </li>
            <li>Okay, that aside, I can&#x27;t exactly say &amp;#34;what&amp;#34; this product does, but my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I was already impressed at a month--my acne was less</li>
            <li>Also fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS&amp;#62;  Use on skin first and then over the top with Vitamin C cream.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines around my eyes are almost gone</li>
            <li>The fine lines in my face have poofed up.  </li>
            <li>I look fine for my age</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t expect my fine lines to vanish</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t expect my fine lines to vanish</li>
            <li>Plumped my skin and got rid of all those fine lines.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid helps the skin retain this moisture, and has a temporary plumping effect on fine lines and wrinkles as the molecules swell.</li>
            <li>My skin has a glow to it and the fine lines on my forehead seem to have diminished.  </li>
            <li>fine lines all still there, skin tone unchanged.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m acne-prone and have fine lines -- I use the serum as soon as I get out of the shower while my skin is still moist.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li>I purchased this from amazon, it arrived fine.  </li>
            <li>I have seen no difference in its affects for fine lines or wrinkles.</li>

            <li>Super fast delivery, very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>had originally purchased this for intensive post-peel moisturizing - which it works great for - but have also now started using it daily.</li>
            <li>Very deceptive!!!    </li>
            <li>An absolute must!!!  </li>

            <li>Totally worth it for me!</li>
            <li>powerful stuff!</li>
            <li>everything worth having (improved skin!) takes time.  </li>
            <li>ORIGINAL review:  </li>
            <li>I use this as the first layer after cleaning my face in the evening with moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>Hydrates my skin, worth it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will work better if I let the serum sink in first before using my night cream</li>
            <li>I am so excited about purchasing this product from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Will try to be more consistent with its use and see how it works.</li>
            <li>I put this serum on my face and neck first then top with face cream to seal it in.</li>
            <li>and it was totally worth it!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it and my skin look a lot better now.  </li>
            <li>At this price its definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Friendly as can be</li>
            <li>After using this stuff, the cystic breakouts have significantly subsided and if I do get a pimple, it goes away faster.  </li>
            <li>My face had actually absorbed it!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and hesitated to purchase this product, but I did purchase because many reviews said it worked fine on oily skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look and feel amazing, speeds up healing of burns and/or acne scars and its very sensitive skin friendly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like &#x27;clean&#x27; saliva.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and supple.  </li>
            <li>, the serum is light, odorless and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>skin feels smooth and drys quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was great in days 3-4  for moisturizing  my skin  which was insanely dry after the peel.  </li>
            <li>Old lady gets many compliments on her skin:)</li>
            <li>I also will drop some of this into a dollop of leave-in conditioner, then smooth it into my hair for a nice, soft, shiny appearance after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, but so far it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>this product i use twice a day on clean skin before makeup.</li>
            <li>I clean my face with a salicylic acid astringent every morning.  </li>
            <li>So far my skin is looking better and better every day.</li>
            <li>I have put it on my clean face every morning, then my moisturizer and make-up.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day on clean face.</li>
            <li>so make up goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li>I love it, my skin is more soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I mix one drop of serum to two drops of oil, and apply it to clean skin before bed.  </li>
            <li>I put it on a clean face before bed and after my shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>I just need to find a product to take away the discoloration caused by my acne scars now that my skin is clean and</li>
            <li>Since its 100% pure Hyaluronic acid, it&#x27;s un-necessary to go with a higher priced luxury brand since it should be the same, and this brand is inexpensive and excellent.</li>
            <li>I just received this product in the mail, already have a positive love the smoothness it leaves when it drys.</li>
            <li>As a general rule of thumb, the higher up on the ingredient list the hyaluronic acid (or sodium hyaluronate) is, the more potent the product, which means better results for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is pure hyaluronic acid serum, nothing more.  </li>
            <li>They should not be able to say 100% pure.</li>
            <li>Of course, you should proceed with caution to determine whether you have any special sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After I wash face with a special soap.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find a hyaluronic product that was pure serum . . .</li>
            <li>i love the large bottle this comes in.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special here and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>was right!  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li>great product as expected.</li>
            <li>seems pretty good so far</li>
            <li>For combination skin such as mine, its best added to an actual light moisturizer rather than for use alone.</li>
            <li>With my skin being at an optimum level for the serum, I definitely see that my skin is well hydrated vs.</li>
            <li>That is true.</li>
            <li>On the Timeless Skincare website, I found the true ingredient list:    </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this like everyone else</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like spending too much money on lotions as I think they are mostly overpriced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put it on and then brush my teeth and see results in front of my eyes and my skin has even more intense results by morning.  </li>
            <li>Your skin needs to be hydrated and it will naturally repair, look refreshed, and flush away bacteria on its own.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so light and fresh</li>
            <li>I ordered more to give to my family as gifts and I received the order incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel good after I put it on, however overall I didn&#x27;t see any difference to my skin.  </li>
            <li>So, although this product seems to be awesome for the majority of users, just be warned that not all that it may cause icky breakouts if your skin is finicky.</li>
            <li>If you lightly dab this under your eyes, it will make the skin look fresh again.</li>
            <li>i love this product so much</li>
            <li>I have done a trial using it on the top of one hand only and can see the hand with the serum is has more smooth skin than the one without.</li>
            <li>So many skin products carry this ingredient but at a very inflated price.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things.</li>
            <li>and I am using nothing but natural stuff on my skin now with everything being 0 hazardous BTW.</li>
            <li>Its very hydrating but can&#x27;t tell anything outstanding about it.</li>
            <li>Love this so much.</li>
            <li>I loved using it not only on my face but arms and hands</li>
            <li>My face and neck are fresh glowing and so smooth.</li>
            <li>wonderful serum to smooth over the face after washing and before moisturizing - it really works and with daily use, you&#x27;ll most definitely see results in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>and i had no bad reaction.</li>
            <li>The retin A has worked well with somewhat erasing the fine lines and the Hyaluronic Acid tightens the skin around the eyes causing the fine lines to be largely diminished..</li>
            <li>So far it feels nice on the skin and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only experienced positive results.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 yrs, I spend a good deal of time outside, and my skin is dry, this product really makes my skin look good!</li>
            <li>I have been reading great things online about this type of acid for moisturizing, but I bought this because I was fooled into thinking that it was actually 100% pure (</li>
            <li>if there was such a thing--feels like pure moisture...feels great</li>
            <li>Using this product in the AM and before bed have significantly reduced both - to the point that others have commented on how fresh my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>At first I was cross because I had wanted the oral version but after adding to my skin cream I am impressed with the added flexibility and texture of my 90 year old skin.</li>
            <li>Great product and can be added with moisturizers or other serums.  </li>
            <li>Great mositurizer for people with acne prone skin and cant use other mositerizers becasue</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this new product!</li>
            <li>and I have seen a tremendous change with my skin.</li>
            <li>My theory is that it super hydrates ...</li>
            <li>Until now, it hasn&#x27;t done any magic on my skin, but i do feel my skin more moist, well maybe because it&#x27;s only been two weeks.   </li>
            <li>quick ship</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of the product and it absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>DRYS QUICKLY</li>
            <li>also noticed a difference in how quickly this product seemed to disappear on the skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I love love this stuff, especially after having either a pixel laser peel or a chemical peel (glycolic acid 35% or salicylic acid 20%).</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs quickly into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was sceptical about the hyaluronic acid but this bottle is magic, the non sticky texture and easily absorbed into the skin really helps.</li>
            <li>, it absorbs quickly, I think it even doesn&#x27;t smell (</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I ordered the product myself and it arrived within 5 days.....very quickly!</li>
            <li>quick delivery</li>
            <li>I guess I did it backwards, but since getting it, I&#x27;ve done some more research and found that it is used more for medical reasons than cosmetic.</li>
            <li>COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY THIS COMPANY RESPONDED.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I wish they don&#x27;t raise the price in the future,  because I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main reason I love this.</li>
            <li>This product itself is worthy of 5 stars</li>
            <li>More info would equal 2 more stars.</li>
            <li>Never bothered since I &#x27; almost 40 thinking it would go away along with mild rosacea..</li>
            <li>This company sends quality items and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>3rd purchase - love this, use it on my hair too :)</li>
            <li>, I was looking for a super hydrator.</li>
            <li>If you are spending more than $50.00 (high end price)</li>
            <li>I love the high quality glass bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>suitable for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>great for pimples and dark spots.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d normally give in and pick at it thinking it would look better, which is never the case.  </li>
            <li>Just as other reviewers said - most effective when used on damp skin and under moisturizer.   </li>
            <li>I bought hyaluronic acid because it is listed as being a very safe product to put on your skin, but I had no idea it is such a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I first got introduced to HA serum years ago when my retin-a prescription came with some samples of an HA serum that&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li>I use this with other natural products for a face serum and have wonderful results.</li>
            <li>THE MERCHANT WAS SO KIND ENOUGH TO REPLACE IT RIGHT AWAY!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is my new favorite when I get out of the shower I put under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>First this is how I appled the product: Apply to freshly cleansed skin, add a drop or two to palm of hand smooth over face.</li>
            <li>I have also found it&#x27;s good for patches of dry</li>
            <li>I always wash my face with a good moisturizing cream then pat dry and wait a couple of minutes before applying.</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle of hyaluronic acid serum and it really make me satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is a good serum for dry, aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I used the serum on damp skin and followed with a good moisturizer and water spritzer but still ended up with dry skin</li>
            <li>I first got this I was excited to have something to improve the appearance of the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>Definitely I feel soooooooo much better!</li>
            <li>im ready to go....will continue to purchase!!</li>
            <li>I use daily and many times twice a day (if there will be no Sun exposure).Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I found it had been exactly one year since I had ordered the original bottles.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and hydrates very well.</li>
            <li>It is good quality and a drop goes a long way!!</li>
            <li>The first week I used the serum I was happy as my skin was so soft and smooth, however by the end of the second week</li>
            <li>Well this is full of alcohol, it&#x27;s hardly PURE as the name would suggest!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll first apply this serum over my clean face, then the softener (to seal the moist), then my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>i like it because i feel my skin really nourished and fine lines almost disappear</li>
            <li>Lately, though, I have begun using it on its own after cleansing and toning, and now I love it!</li>
            <li>I have a love/hate relationship with the bottle because it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s glass, which gives it a little apothecary-type quality, but I don&#x27;t like traveling with it for fear that it&#x27;ll crack.</li>
            <li>so my skin has been very dry and for someone that used to have flawless skin, recently being diagnosed with eczema</li>
            <li>I use this after my peels.. and it really helps smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>it is no permanant miracle serum , but if used everyday the lines on my forehead are reduced and what is also great is that my skin is a lot smoother.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works so great as after these treatments and as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It glides smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I put drops on my face and neck and gentle smooth over my skin before eye cream and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>this cheap but promising serum</li>
            <li>and it goes on so light and absorbs so fast.  </li>
            <li>I am also using a lot of products that are very drying, so I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement in hydration.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff especially when mixed with rose water as another reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li>It is affordable and it really helps smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL SEE AMAZING RESULTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH OILY SKIN!</li>
            <li>So far... I am a pleased buyer.</li>
            <li>actually makes my skin nice.</li>
            <li>, be absorbed; in my frustration I tended to overuse and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Experiment, and find what compliments your success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly a \\&quot;miracle in a bottle\\&quot; for many others, so it may just be my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>My vitamin E lotion stings way more than this, and it&#x27;s made for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But I acutlly looked fresh faced and capapble of facing the world after that one.</li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>and I felt it was worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I am going to give some to my mom to try out, she&#x27;s got more aging issues than I do so far....</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid is quickly absorbed into my skin and unlike what it&#x27;s name might predict, there is no burning.</li>
            <li>and I actually started noticing that somehow the skin on my face started to &amp;#34;fill out&amp;#34; and be more smooth.</li>
            <li>something I rarely do.  </li>
            <li>I use this serum daily followed by a rose water spray toner</li>
            <li>Which ingredient wins?</li>
            <li>if  any  improvement  with  my  laugh  lines.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>So, it helps and for the price I feel its worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product, makes skin soft and smooth, and it absorb into skin fast.</li>
            <li>Finally and importantly, make sure you stay hydrated, so you&#x27;re hydrating your skin from the inside AND out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth the money</li>
            <li>Two stars for not causing any damage but not doing anything useful, either.  </li>
            <li>Works great, recommended by my facial pro for my aging 70 yr old rocesea challenged skin.</li>
            <li>such a great anti-aging booster as far as wrinkles are concerned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a misconception that it does not get absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li>But a good way to help  your skin and save money (I have spent a lot on creams and skin doctors) is to combine with the derma roller.</li>
            <li>This far the love the texture</li>
            <li>So far I have not seen wonders but my skin (already quite clear and smooth) seems to be a bit more clear, a bit more smooth.</li>
            <li>so I became curious and chose this product based on good reviews and affordable price.  </li>
            <li>My skin is better than it was when I was young</li>
            <li>Applying twice daily more at night and lightly during the day.</li>
            <li>It also greatly reduces facial lines and keeps my face young looking.</li>
            <li>and I use it before bed with a moisturizer applied after it is absorbed .  </li>
            <li>Still useful, but misleading, I think.</li>
            <li>Left  my skin so smooth and healthy looking 😬</li>
            <li>After i tried this, bought the full version (8oz bottle) which is much cheaper compared with the amount of product you get!</li>
            <li>but I know it&#x27;s because I have to incorporate a better moisterizer than the oil free tinted cream I&#x27;m currently using in the now subzero temperatures of winter.</li>
            <li>but so  far it has done what you say, i will  be ordering it agian for sure</li>
            <li>I can formulate personal products for my own use.</li>
            <li>I rarely need it to sooth a retin-a crisis...</li>
            <li>W/my 0 hazardous facial cream</li>
            <li>Far better than hydroquinone cream.</li>
            <li>Far better than hydroquinone cream.</li>
            <li>Last night, I used this product along with rose water and...</li>
            <li>and on mornings i use face wash and rose water as a toner followed by this serum and  at times a regular moisterizer.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews of this are old and out dated.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Serum - the cheapest, best kept skin secret...</li>
            <li>It takes about a month to see the results, but the wait is worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s helping her out with the laugh lines she has around her eyes and mouth</li>
            <li>I get many compliments about my lack of wrinkles (71 years young).  </li>
            <li>I love the dropper vial as opposed to the pump system my old brand used</li>
            <li>high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
            <li>once a week apply olive oil on my eyes instead of a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Although there have been no improvements with acne (as I saw in some reviews), but overall - I am very happy with this product, going to purchase it again and highly recommend to anyone who wants to look young.</li>
            <li>once a week apply olive oil on my eyes instead of a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Although there have been no improvements with acne (as I saw in some reviews), but overall - I am very happy with this product, going to purchase it again and highly recommend to anyone who wants to look young.</li>
            <li>I have seen better results from many other products.  </li>
            <li>It drys pretty quick</li>
            <li>As originally suspected and others have claimed, the solution I received was as gentle as tears (literally, I accidentally got some in my eye, and no irritation at all).</li>
            <li>I have other serums, this was a good value.</li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle but did not see the significant result as others.</li>
            <li>Due to the mostly good reviews on here about this product, I bought it.</li>
            <li>I buy this all the time from this company, love it, high quality ingredient plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This product filled up my atrophic scars from cortisone injections into keloids (in combo with derma roller), super soft baby skin, and thicker lips!</li>
            <li>every time someone uses it they order it right away.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the right product for me.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I use right after washing and follow with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face right before using my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it should be no issues right .</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It soaks right in&lt;</li>
            <li>he said it was unnatural and there was something that didn&#x27;t feel right....</li>
            <li>he said it was unnatural and there was something that didn&#x27;t feel right....</li>
            <li>I purchased this serum with a derma roller and used both right away.</li>
            <li>id sign right up.</li>
            <li>but it can&#x27;t hurt right.</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s an endorsement right there.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s right to boycott a company for any reason at all, of course.</li>
            <li>went out with not foundation on (only sunscreen cream...) and people telling me I had such a beautiful skin recently.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE this brand much better than previous one with vit c.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s with fair skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this stuff works great, and isnt too oily which is a big deal since I have VERY oily acne-prone skin (battling it since early 20s).</li>
            <li>It takes a few weeks to notice a change but my skin looks AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Still not sure about how great this is, does no harm</li>
            <li>Good if you use as first layer before you put on other lotions, if you can find something that works with your skin.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve used this product alone and found that as long as I put it onto my damp face it absorbs nicely; however, I still have to put on a moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li>It felt nice going on but that means nothing in the long run.</li>
            <li>It was very pricey, but I loved what it did for my skin, especially after an at home peel or microdermabrasion treatment as it really soothes my skin and speeds up recovery time.  </li>
            <li>At 3 months, I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle (yes, it lasted 3 months with twice a day use--that&#x27;s a pretty amazing value at the price) and can say my skin looks better than it has in ten years.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does!  </li>
            <li>Pure brilliance!</li>
            <li>since I have been using the pure hyaluronic  acid with skin actives restoration cream &amp; sea buckthorn oil, never even once saw an acne invading my face!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft, the like fine lines just smoothed right out. .</li>
            <li>I really like the product, it absorbs quickly and does not leave a reside on my face.</li>
            <li>This is a great value and definitely something I now buy regularly.</li>
            <li>It just dries out your skin much like super glue or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not struggling with wrinkles just yet, but if I get a cut or scrape anywhere I will first apply a drop of this underneath some neosporin &amp; band aid and it mitigates any scrabbling or scarring and generally seems to heal more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many serums before but sommehow they were too heavy and made me break out more.</li>
            <li>I made a good choice, I&#x27;m half way thru the bottle now</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 days my skin was soft just like with the other cream, fine lines are still smoothing out, (with this one my acne breakouts are going away!), and impressive of all puffiness under my eyes is less noticeable.</li>
            <li>and it really helps with wrinkles used with this Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure.  </li>
            <li>which I put this on first and then moisturizer on top (or mixed them together), it lasted all day and skin looked dewy and fresh, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Make sure if you make your own  hyaluronic + glyco-lactic serum that glyco-lactic part of this serum is NOT MORE 15% from 100% ready to use volume.</li>
            <li>Silky serum that skin just absorbs great and leaves no residue behind, just soft looking, great feeling, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>This one is very straight forward, Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid  is an ingredient that the very high priced anti-aging products brag about for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.  </li>
            <li>btw it shipped very fast too with secured box</li>
            <li>This Serum dries almost instantly and makes your skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and it is very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old and have some fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>My pores look tiny, my skin is looking very clear, and my acne scars look more filled in.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it when I bought a new product that was being advertised in [of all places Star].  </li>
            <li>This has been an excellent moisturizer, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Okay, so I started using the small jar before I bought the large one (which is more worth it)</li>
            <li>-- wow what a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It helps so much!</li>
            <li>Looking at the first ingredients in the content are the highest content in the product.  </li>
            <li>First time I  using this product...</li>
            <li>Product arrived sooner than expected and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I do use my regular moisturizer on top of this serum and still saw no improvement.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using the product, I wasn&#x27;t sold on it immediately.</li>
            <li>The first day after I started this serum</li>
            <li>I buy this regularly, and love the added moisture it gives my skin.</li>
            <li>however, I do aspire a whole dropper&#x27;s worth and use all of it</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>when it soaks into my skin I put some cream on top because I&#x27;m not totally used to not feeling cream on my face.</li>
            <li>and I want to try it some more before I totally decide whether it works or not.</li>
            <li>The first time I thought maybe it was something else making me break out, but every time I use it since then the same thing happens, so I know it&#x27;s this serum for sure.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps my sensitive/combo skin hydrated and has never broken me out!</li>
            <li>I use this twice daily after I cleanse my face and love its hydrating effect.  </li>
            <li>haha!  </li>
            <li>Will give the product more time to see results then review at a later date.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so inexpensive and really does plump up lines!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem like it was working for the first week, but now I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>was using Source Naturals Skin Eternal Hyaluronic Acid Serum before I switched to this, which I do not recommend), but I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, especially since it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE August 2012: I am still using this on my face and body -- more than a year later.  </li>
            <li>So to anyone who is skeptical that this product can help you have great skin--all I can say is TRY it!    </li>
            <li>use it day and night, will order more later</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed results the first day I used it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks God I&#x27;ve found these two!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not my first review.</li>
            <li>after cleansing my face this is the first product i layer on, then i follow with moisturizer and sun block, and</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I apply my usual moisturizer on top and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>first  couple  weeks.  </li>
            <li>It helped me so much!  </li>
            <li>I think for most people, it will make a solid difference if they aren&#x27;t using any hyaluronic acid at all, but you definitley need moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it, very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I should also mention that I tested it on the back of my hand 24 hours before putting it on my face, since so many reviews had allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>I find that my retin-A cream and regular moisturizer absorb much better when I apply this product before hand.</li>
            <li>and it really works!  </li>
            <li>Like I first said - it takes time, consistent application, and lots of patience.  </li>
            <li>I see results instantly, however, in a couple hours I apply more because my skin takes it</li>
            <li>a.k.a googled it, and Amazon was the first search result..</li>
            <li>Pleased, would recommend to others  Darlene Hastings Southern Calif.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and the seller shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I think my face looks healthy with continued use of this product twice daily.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>I think this stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I see a definite change for the better.  </li>
            <li>Put Vitamin E on first allow to absorb in and then apply Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>You just have to be consistent.</li>
            <li>consistently buy the product by Timeless.</li>
            <li>I use it first, let is sit and then layer my cream on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(If you are just starting with acids than you better to start from lower amount glyco-lactic in your serum)  </li>
            <li>I do not know what it is, but I really got used to this product, and I like it a lot!</li>
            <li>I just finished my 2oz bottle, and I think I am going to reorder, but bigger version :)  </li>
            <li>oz.]]This is the first time I have used this product.  </li>
            <li>Can you be more specific !</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Actually that is a lie my skin broke out more</li>
            <li>I WILL LET YOU KNOW MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li>have some fading, my family noticed it first and there is no burning or itching.  </li>
            <li>, yes it will feel a bit drying at first</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a change at first.  </li>
            <li>An absolute must have!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way it is going to plump up your aged skin unless you inject it or are young enough to believe the hype and have a great fantasy life!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Researched medical studies and decided to use this product in conjunction with derma micro needle skin roller for better penetration.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I got my first bottle of Timeless HA serum.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I go was one ounce and that lasted 5 or 6 months.</li>
            <li>It definitely has a better effect when used in conjunction with something else....</li>
            <li>So, just be aware.</li>
            <li>I applied this for the first time today and it was a diff feel, not quite water and not quite gel...</li>
            <li>It is economical and goes a long way, so I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I should have read the entire description in more detail on the website, as the ingredients are listed.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much! :-0</li>
            <li>I first used HA at night and in the morning</li>
            <li>and this was the first thing to arrive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I only paid $15.</li>
            <li>i love looking at my face in the mirror and for the first time I can walk outside without makeup and it just looks dewy and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is plumper, my acne scars (which are pretty severe) are not as visible because of the plumpness.</li>
            <li>Its pretty watery</li>
            <li>this is my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time using this product.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It helps my skin to retain moisture and somehow helps the olive oil sink in for better overall absorption of both products.</li>
            <li>So I just combine the two, the combination seems to work better than using the products individually.</li>
            <li>I note that the label says, &amp;#34;pure,&amp;#34; but the first ingredient is water.</li>
            <li>At first my skin feels a bit tacky to the touch, but that dissipates in about five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this, experimented with how to use it, and finally have hit on a magic solution.</li>
            <li>is absorbed on skin fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks Timeless Skin Care!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ordered this.  </li>
            <li>FIRST.</li>
            <li>The first time you ever use this product, you will feel like your face is so soft and smooth and plump.</li>
            <li>A quality hyaluronic serum should only require you use two drops I have to use more with this one.</li>
            <li>I got this product mostly because I didn&#x27;t like my how my neck was starting to look.</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>and now I am able to cover them with foundation (have been using this product only three weeks)</li>
            <li>For the first time in quite a while</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay going out in public without makeup.</li>
            <li>then why is the first ingredient on the label water?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li>First I use the Vitamin C with E Ferulic Acid Serum followed by the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>I feel tingling and to me that is a good sign, my skin is heavily damage.</li>
            <li>Really good at controlling the oil and keeping my skiing firm.</li>
            <li>I have fair dry skin, and am in my early 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This goes on very well goes right into your skin</li>
            <li>- this helps me ensure I&#x27;m getting just the right amount of product vs. too much</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is in a good practical plain container, not wasting $$$ on frills.</li>
            <li>It really does absorb quickly and makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to experiment with Hyaluronic Acid and this has a very clean, simple ingredients list.</li>
            <li>Instantly firms and plumps the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to find 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid over the counter anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this stuff by putting a dropper full on my plan and then adding two droppers of my facial oil (combo of kukui nut, jojoba oil, apricot kernel oil, rose hip seed, borage seed and essential oils</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it with some of their other products and I am loving the results.</li>
            <li>Good quality product!Worth the money and at least worth a try for your skin.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell funny, it looked pure, and I could feel it working.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, my skin seems much smoother</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the positive side first:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very reasonably priced and seems to help reduce the wrinkles and fine lines enough that I keep buying it.</li>
            <li>Pretty much did nothing.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt so confident in the quality of my skin in a long time.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs so much more moisture this way than it used to with minor additional cost.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
            <li>I also use it under my makeup and it does glide on smoother and that is the true test since I&#x27;m 59 years old.</li>
            <li>This is simple, easy, works great, goes a long way and I will be using this for long time!</li>
            <li>The Timeless HLA evaporated much more quickly than my previous HLA.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, easily absorbed and has made a dramatic difference with the fine (and not so fine) lines.</li>
            <li>This is the same stuff you pay 10x more for at the doctor&#x27;s office or at a high end spa where they have an RN on hand for the Botox</li>
            <li>Not so sure if I&#x27;ll be exploring other companies that sell Hyaluronic acid serums, but I know definitely it has helped with keeping my complexion healthy.</li>
            <li>I saw an instant lifting around my eyes and forehead but keep using it to get the full benefit!</li>
            <li>I also used very mild products (Cetaphil) for my face back then and nothing helped, until I added this.</li>
            <li>My Arizona dry skin is revived after just 6 weeks and looks more youthful also.  </li>
            <li>This is okay, maybe I am not using it correctly, seems to dry my face.  </li>
            <li>Great product without prescription, but be careful not to leave it too long on your face.</li>
            <li>I will gladly spend the $50 on the dermalogica because it works wonders for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the third time I purchase this brand of HA, I have used it with my micro-current device around my neck, eyes, cheeks and face, it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, it absorbs very quickly and give me the hydration I need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that feels like a touch of cool water but is absorbed immediately as my skin drinks it in.</li>
            <li>that is 100% pure</li>
            <li>100% Pure 2 oz.  </li>
            <li>100% Pure 2 oz.]]</li>
            <li>The ad seems to sell 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>Ingredients    Water, Sodium Hyaluronate (1%; 100% pure), Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.    </li>
            <li>The 1% of hyaluronic acid is pure.</li>
            <li>pure serum is thicker.</li>
            <li>and I used a drop at night after washing my face (still using cetaphil) to my night moisturizer which is just a dab of pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>If you are prone to break outs from certain products, look at the ingredient lists and you will find one of the alcohols as an irritant (ethyl alcohol -- also known as denatured, or SD, alcohol and ethanol -- benzyl alcohol, methyl and isopropyl alcohol).&lt;br</li>

            <li>This isn&#x27;t even pure water.(99%)</li>
            <li>so I decided to try it in its pure form.</li>

            <li>Says pure hyaluronic acid...but its disguised as a trade</li>
            <li>I had three large pimples on my forehead that wouldn&#x27;t go away</li>
            <li>If this is 100% Pure Hyaluronic Serum</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine  why a large number of people have made the effort to state</li>
            <li>According  to the reviews I&#x27;ve read, this particular product doesn&#x27;t contain very much.</li>
            <li>First about me - I am a 32 year old white female blessed with oily skin plus break outs (hormonal acne) and fine lines (between my eye brows and under my eyes) in addition  :-)  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a month, and I can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference, except that my skin seems to absorb this quickly and it makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product, the skin remains not only hydrated, but also slightly tightened, special attention</li>
            <li>which is what the bottle totally leads you to believe until you read the fine print).</li>
            <li>I did a proper patch test and it was fine.</li>
            <li>At age 50 I was just starting to get the beginnings of fine lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>This product dries fast on your face, much to fast and doesn&#x27;t do anything but dry my skin even more.</li>
            <li>after several weeks my skin tone started evening out, fine lines around my eyes grew softer.</li>
            <li>Does make skin peel as if light sunburn but had beautiful glowing skin that was commented on by random strangers after!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anymore what works and what doesn&#x27;t, or if i&#x27;m just blessed with some pretty decent genes, but i use this stuff every night under my night cream and get compliments on my skin all the time.  </li>
            <li>hope that this will help someone like me, who wants to take care of their skin.[[ASIN:B0047AKVW6 Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure Refill 8 oz]]</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these products but caution to read the reviews, especially on peel products such as the Glycolic Acid, so you do not damage skin and get exceptional results.</li>
            <li>My regime, now, is to use the Spray smooth on with fingertips, next the Eye Cream under the eyes and on the eyelids, then Timeless Pure over face and neck.</li>
            <li>I make all my own skin care and realized I was missing a certain level of moisturization.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m quite familiar with the benefits of hyaluronic acid -- but using it in it&#x27;s pure form is usually not an option in professional products...for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>Oh, I have very sensitive skin and have not had any issues whatsoever with this!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days, so it is a little early to tell how effective hyaluronic acid is at revitalizing skin, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>you use skin care products containing hyaluronic acid, it works by absorbing available moisture from the environment and water already present in the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Something else important to note, much of what I&#x27;ve read about HA serum as a daily moisturizer all over has recommended not using it alone with any regularity.</li>
            <li>For the price its a great deal and should last a few months.</li>
            <li>But I started this product and within a week of using it I noticed a huge different.  </li>
            <li>My mom has started to use it and she is noticing a HUGE different in her skin.  </li>
            <li>I think too many of us are tricked by all of the amazing fake reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone over age 50! AAA+++</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>The price of $15.95 seemed reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It really works and is cost efficient.</li>
            <li>and I really rather use the moisturizer by itself.</li>
            <li>purchased this item at Amazon and it could have come with some directions but thank goodness for the reviews because they were very helpful as to how to use this product.</li>
            <li>Now I use this serum on whole body except my face.</li>
            <li>: I noticed this morning that my skin looked so much clearer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly it really did noting for my skin</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>so this a much cheaper answer.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it on my face, it felt softer, much softer to where my husband wanted to touch my face.  </li>
            <li>appear much, much smoother.  </li>
            <li>but I do know that this feels great in the morning and that it helps with my tired bags when I get up.  </li>
            <li>With threat of not having it, I found out that I am very pro this serum.  </li>
            <li>I have acne scars, redness and my skin is very oily.  </li>
            <li>I got this item fast which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what this was supposed to do for my skin...</li>
            <li>Bought the product for my mom really.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.com for having this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone concerned about the health and vitality of their skin!</li>
            <li>I ordered this for a year straight.</li>
            <li>It does help a bit with preventing wrinkles but doesn&#x27;t do much for existing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but I really try to massage this in into wrinkle prone areas around eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it prevents breakouts and has improved my face as a whole.</li>
            <li>And the delivery was verry fast even to the Netherlands.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference yet.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I doubt that this product is the real thing for the cost and texture.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then</li>
            <li>and it really \\&quot;seals in\\</li>
            <li>After my success, I sent a bottle to my 28 year old son.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have any wrinkling (I&#x27;m 47)but</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE SEEN SOME REAL TIGHTENING OF MY NECK.</li>
            <li>So thanks to everyone who posted their reviews.  </li>
            <li>is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a real difference in the feel of my face.  </li>
            <li>This \\&quot;serum\\&quot; is very watery.</li>
            <li>I add it to the cream I use every day, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I think this product really works because it is really thin (slightly more viscous than water), and soaks into the skin better than a cream.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen any improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and have not seen much if any results</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin, but this moisturizes without making me break out at all.</li>
            <li>us do so much writing before it will accept</li>
            <li>I think this really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Nothing really improved after using this and didn&#x27;t make anything worsen after stopped using it,&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems like This product doesn&#x27;t do much except for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>My make up goes on so much smoother now than it used to</li>
            <li>been using it twice a day for a month, zero difference, maybe I am just aging to fast this month?</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell this product did much there</li>
            <li>It really does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>really does work.</li>
            <li>My skin really broke out after using this.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing after a peel.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother, looks very shiny.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and soothing.</li>
            <li>The price for the amount is also very generous.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this and feel it works for me...</li>
            <li>fast shipping.....item as described...</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic acid plays a key role in the skin&#x27;s extracellular matrix and has been shown to maintain hydration, improve elasticity and protect against free radical damage.</li>
            <li>In the skin, hyaluronic acid is responsible for capturing water, in turn maintaining the smoothness and plumpness of the skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if this works or not</li>
            <li>It gives skin a fresh young plump look.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>This product dries fast and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>It comes in fast and the product is perfection.</li>
            <li>I also do chemical peels on my legs and this helps so so much.</li>
            <li>It is softer and much smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to order it again.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid really works at giving you a bright-eyed appearance since it absorbs moisture.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all skin types!</li>
            <li>I opened this product, tried it on and really like it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if this product is doing anything to my skin.  </li>
            <li>This serum is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>It is very moist on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much smoother and firmer and just appears healthier.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t say it helped with that.</li>
            <li>HA is a primary component in the synovial fluid in joints to keep joints lubricated and gliding well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a gentle product.  </li>
            <li>This is great for all skin types and will benefit acne-prone skin as well as tired and aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I had applied too much</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell much difference after using this product for a month.</li>
            <li>Very prompt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really has made a difference in tone and texture of my face.</li>
            <li>leaves the skin smooth and can be used with daily cream.</li>
            <li>For my acne the serum didn&#x27;t have much much of an effect when used alone.</li>
            <li>Next, I smooth the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li>I really works and I plan on reordering it soon.  </li>
            <li>And it really does lessen the deepness of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a real help for the woman of my age...</li>
            <li>So, I just bypassed the expense and the fragrance and went straight for results.  </li>
            <li>really cant review this...</li>
            <li>and i dont think this does much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I didnt see any change in my skin after applying for a whole week.</li>
            <li>hyaluronic is very soothing and cooling</li>
            <li>I really like to get what I pay for.</li>
            <li>Very firming without being greasy</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid really does help improve the skin - plumping effect, etc.</li>
            <li>I think it has really helped my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Using it has made my skin so soft, and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>and my face looks much smother and softer.</li>
            <li>but my friends can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them my real age.</li>
            <li>it really did.  </li>
            <li>I really like the serum....</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been really gentle on my skin &amp; even around my eye area, when almost nothing else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been really gentle on my skin &amp; even around my eye area, when almost nothing else</li>
            <li>This does work really well.  </li>
            <li>I just really dont know what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>But I did not see much effect</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>so I know not to expect much.</li>
            <li>really do like this serum.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, its the pores on my face</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Only been using it for 5 days now and my skin looks more clear and even.</li>
            <li>Apply facial moisturizer directly over top.</li>
            <li>have regular facials (I love professional</li>
            <li>have regular facials (I love professional</li>
            <li>OMG, it immediately took away the pain, the next morning no blistering, no freckles, no red, it was a nice even tan.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I expected a miracle product but what I did notice was good enough to keep me using the rest of the product</li>
            <li>Fresh out of the shower in the morning, put on a dropper of this along with my daily moisturizer and let that be absorbed into my face, neck and breast area.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft, plumped, and white head free!  </li>
            <li>OMG, I ordered this because of the high positive reviews but this stuff broke me out that made my face looks like a pizza face.</li>
            <li>This product glides right on and completely immerses into my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly to help even out my complexion and for general improvement as I don&#x27;t do much special for my skin.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles are not erased, or anything like that so far...but the smooth and natural glow tones down fine lines for me.</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>I have been using Retin-A for my acne prone skin and hyaluronic acid has allowed for my skin to better absorb my moisturizer and replenish itself, thus preventing it from flaking due to the dryness the medication causes.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad that I did and for amazon having the feature at the end of the page showing what other customers purchased.</li>
            <li>It works better than my other serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from my clarisonic, this has given me the most improvement over all other skin products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great value and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It locks in the moisture and has a significant smoothing effect, though a tiny dab of moisturizer is still needed!</li>
            <li>I then would apply my other face creams on top.  </li>
            <li>I have tried some of the other brands but feel this one gives me the most bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>it goes on feeling a little slimy but it dries quick and fills in all your fine lines</li>
            <li>I see no change using this serum, other than giving my face a bit more color.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my chest, and it seems to have helped keeping it hydrated, but I don&#x27;t see a significant difference using this product overall.</li>
            <li>Great price for 8 bottles, I use very little in making homemade facial and body serums.  </li>
            <li>I have one very rough scaly patch that I am using more on</li>
            <li>Now my dark spots are very light color</li>
            <li>I apply it to clean skin and then apply a moisturizer immediately following.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed because I know many people have great results with it.</li>
            <li>Use it twice a day with a clean skin for about 2 months to notice the big difference.</li>
            <li>This latest purchase was a gift to a friend who&#x27;s getting ready for her wedding and is undergoing intense skin care prior to the big day.</li>
            <li>The price point cannot be beat and there is almost always a special if you purchase multiple items.  </li>
            <li>really only 1% hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Other high end products cost a lot more, and tend to leave a film on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really make a Huge difference  in Mt dry skin.</li>
            <li>I used to have dry &amp; sensitive skin and most moisturizers made me break out, but this thing makes your skin moisturized without causing break out.</li>
            <li>Remember, FOR SURE, LET IT COME TO A COMPLETE DRY.  </li>
            <li>When my skin is feeling dry, especially in the winter, I would get out of the shower, apply my own mix of 50% jojoba oil and 50% apricot kernel oil.</li>
            <li>It works great for my oily skin to balance out my skin tone and keep me freshly hydrated without any film left behind</li>
            <li>will continue to use this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer and want to let everyone know that I am definitely a PRO!  </li>
            <li>I have no qualms with it being 1%, after all, I bought it because I was too lazy to mix my own.</li>
            <li>However, the name really sounds more harsh then it really is; it didnt burn nor did it tingle when I used it.</li>
            <li>It okay, but not easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li>I used to feel naked without a full face of makeup, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it leaves kind a kind-of sticky film on my face, which seems like it takes forever to dry!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it takes a little while to really notice any difference.</li>
            <li>Cant live without it!  </li>
            <li>But I shall now spend the same amount for pure powder, mix my own (without the alcohol and fungicide), and make enough to last a whole lot longer than these 2 ounces.</li>
            <li>the lady who looked at my skin couldn&#x27;t believe how much my skin had improved (I had not told her I had been using a new product).</li>
            <li>apply 50% glycolic peel...rinse with baking soda water and apply hyaluronic serum immed after PATTING face dry to retain the moisture...then apply a light application of Bio Oil...</li>
            <li>More or less meh....</li>
            <li>My previous one had more gel consistency.</li>
            <li>Works great.ing &amp; my hair is silky, shiny &amp; has less static.</li>
            <li>Question i have is, after the bottle is about half way empty I noticed the clear acid turning more and more yellow?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I want to be less prominent.</li>
            <li>This serum, used daily, will give you soft, smooth, even-toned skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used this particular brand of this product for a couple of years</li>
            <li>I should mention that my skin is pretty much normal to oily, clear with zero breakouts</li>
            <li>have two older Brothers and they do look the age.  </li>
            <li>After I was my face with Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel (removes skin buildup and clears up acne), I place a warm wet washcloth on my face to hydrate my face, then apply the Hyaluronic Acid Serum mixed together with my moisturizing lotion (CereVa Renewing Lotion).  </li>
            <li>It seems to work better than some more expensive products.</li>
            <li>Ladies, do yourself a favor more expensive isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li>Most of the research I&#x27;ve done on HA has suggested applying it all over your face underneath your regular moisturizer to fight wrinkles and such.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommends HA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this particular product from Timeless Skin Care for over a year and recommend it to my daughter and friends.  </li>
            <li>Super hydrating and at a low price...</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and you can put regular moisturizer/make up over.  </li>
            <li>My package arrived quickly and I tried it the same evening on my hands.</li>
            <li>I will say that it makes your skin very soft though!</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and supple and looks plumper by the day!</li>
            <li>High quality</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high-quality hyaluronic acid serum would highly recommend Timeless Skin Care.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend Timeless Skin Care.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to see highly moisturized, dewy skin after using it, but it isn&#x27;t doing that.</li>
            <li>I am 48 and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use this with a high grade olive oil and add a couple of drops to the oil, mix it in the palm of my hand, and apply to my damp face.</li>
            <li>(I asked him)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>

            <li>after all the reviews I had high hopes, so I will continue to use this until it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product and will continue to use it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>Not sure why there are so many really positive reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to post any results,  but I like the product and would recommend it since it is 100% pure.</li>
            <li>I did know that when there was a little bit in the bottle that I was going to order more.  </li>
            <li>Add a little of this serum to your favorite moisturizer and watch the transformation.</li>
            <li>but Im going to keep looking for something that suits my skin a little better.</li>
            <li>There is no other product out there that I&#x27;m aware of that</li>
            <li>Have since found that this serum doesn&#x27;t reduce wrinkles, just provides a little more moisture.</li>
            <li>Now I just need a miracle cure for all those little lines and wrinkles :)</li>
            <li>and this is definitely helping my face look clean, young</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for anyone who needs moisture in their skin care regimen, but wants one that keeps their face clear.</li>
            <li>your spending far too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t imagine this will completely disappear the pockmarks, but I think it has given my skin the hydration it was really looking for, which helps my skin</li>
            <li>my skins real sensitive</li>
            <li>It dries clear, matte, and very lightweight, it does not have a smell, it doesn&#x27;t burn, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hands look young.  </li>
            <li>So, here&#x27;s how I recommend using it (since there are no instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with clean, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell much difference so far but will give it a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>stuff is gentle directly on my skin &amp; has not caused dryness or burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think that this products would work on someone who has normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>and so it was probably just sitting on top of a dead skin layer.</li>
            <li>It is  much more affordable, which makes it very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually mix both products together so that it lasts longer and is effective.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Where I would normally have to put on moisturizer in the morning and again at noon,</li>
            <li>But after a few days the irritation went away and I immediately noticed a more toned appearance.</li>
            <li>I wish I had listened to the negative reviews of this product, however in my own hast</li>
            <li>Will update more after few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>My skin was &#x27;normal&#x27; with no problems before this serum.</li>
            <li>So to say normally I use:  </li>
            <li>so I need to use a moisturizer and sunscreen over that normally.</li>
            <li>Not too sure what the recommended application procedure is - I just put on my normal face cream and then blend in a few drops of hyaluronic acid morning and night.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it got such good reviews from others.</li>
            <li>I thought what is point of it then, I can just use my normal routine for that.</li>
            <li>Applied my oils like normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my face just felt all blocked up, my skin felt heavy, and it seems my wrinkles are more defined than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>so I cannot review it&#x27;s efficacy, but I will be sure to update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I also made a homemade facial scrub using natural honey from fair trade and sugar and put a few drops of the product in that as well.</li>
            <li>I live in the high desert of Albuquerque, NM.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this process has worked better than any other products on the market!  </li>
            <li>I also realize that by not being injected , the likelihood of this product actually working is minimal, but it&#x27;s a nice clear serum , free of other ingredients.</li>
            <li>This only worked OK because I would let it dry on my face before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mad that I didn&#x27;t figure this out sooner because I could have saved so much money on everything I&#x27;ve tried and also had happier more confident days without breakouts.</li>
            <li>I read one of the reviews that said the product came without instructions, and several other negative remarks, but it did seem to be the best value, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This takes less than a full dropper, but be sure and LET IT COME TO A COMPLETE DRY before putting on your foundation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve acutally stopped using moisturizer altogether and simply put the hyaluronic acid on RIGHT after I get out of the shower in the morning, to retain the moisture from the steamy shower.</li>
            <li>I will order more to get the full effect of using it everyday after clearing away dead skin by using my mask first.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but effective facial moisturizer keeps my skin soft and firm would recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li>/&gt;**update**&lt;br /&gt;Since my initial review I have been using this serum twice daily under moisturizer for puffiness under my eyes &amp; some fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid is pure moisture and the major moisturizing ingredient in all moisturizers.</li>
            <li>The other plus to this product is the price 14.95 for two ounces and free shipping.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine a Dermatologist recommend Na-Pca years ago, and I live by it.</li>
            <li>(I live in SoCal,</li>
            <li>if you are new to acid products, start with a 35% glycolic peel.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m assuming there was a new batch of this stuff that had to be made.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks after a couple months of using my new serum.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>If this marketeer thinks she can change the definition of the word \\&quot;pure\\&quot;, why doesn&#x27;t she supply her new definition?</li>
            <li>new acne cure is Aloe vera juice, derma roller and this serum twice a day.</li>
            <li>and I have a new doctor.</li>
            <li>In 3 days I had a new face.</li>
            <li>But my complexion is clearer and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Cosmedica&#x27;s HA serum is much more thick and timeless is more watered down</li>
            <li>Cosmedica&#x27;s HA serum is much more thick and timeless is more watered down</li>
            <li>I live in the South and drove convertibles year round most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>I apply it on a clean , wet face, let it absorb, &amp;then put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Made ZERO difference on my skin, which is neither more or less vibrant, neither more or less wrinkled, and neither better nor worse skin than when I started it out with.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and I&#x27;ve really noticed improvement in tiny lines and overall smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear, my makeup goes on and stays on better, I haven&#x27;t struggled with dry skin this winter,  and I will definitely continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to heal any acne scars &amp; put close enough to the under-eye area, really helps keep the moisture there and stops my eyes from being saggy and tired-looking.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is not greasy or thick like a lot of lotions for dry skin, it is so light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this bottle here with a simple facial cream instead of the one I had previously been using to see if it works as good &amp; to my surprise</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive and reactive to new product</li>
            <li>and this product has accomplished what no other product has ever done</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was experiencing dryness and redness before using this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>and my skin has responded well to it.i have very sensitive skin prone to acne and marks....</li>
            <li>responded well to email inquiries and was very professional.</li>
            <li>I had no reaction even with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I started to worry to use it since I have very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have not yet been able to figure out the long term effects as I have not been using it for very long</li>
            <li>I repeated this once daily in the morning for one week, after day two my skin started becoming EXTREMELY dry.</li>
            <li>I do not consider any product that list 4 ingredients to be 100%  pure, particularly when it only contains 1% of the product advertised,  Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Timeless.</li>
            <li>makes my skin very soft and it makes my fine lines a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27; getting compliments for the clear skin!</li>
            <li>love the feel of it, but not sure if it did anything..</li>
            <li>That very same day, I received 3 compliments on how well-rested I looked and what pretty skin I had.....</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>the first time i didnt use a moisturizer and the second time i did...</li>
            <li>--you can see this buyer reviews: initially starting out great, and then all of the sudden you get a bunch of negative ones.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll post more later if I notice any issues or extreme improvement.    </li>
            <li>so with that, this product does what it says it&#x27;s does (for me, so far, anyway!)</li>
            <li>You barely use a drop and it really works.  </li>
            <li>Between this and daily exfoliating and moisturizing, I do pretty well.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve recently had Santa Ana winds and this product has really been put to the test!  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles go away ( not completely), face look  fresh.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time that a product makes an actual difference.  </li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;M SURPRISED at how these two could combine!  </li>
            <li>, I have normal, olive toned skin with sun damage and early signs of aging...</li>
            <li>and wow my skin glows like the skin of my youth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a medical student, which leads to two things: bags under your eyes from lack of sleep and too much caffeine, and a bit of insight into stuff like hyaluronic acid!  </li>
            <li>Even the fine wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>So far I like it!  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have ordered a larger bottle the first time.  </li>
            <li>, that is saying something for a 47 year old!</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles are a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li>usually don&#x27;t give five stars on many beauty products, but this one is an exception.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was my skin looks smoother and pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>Talk about soft skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product under my moisturizer and my skin seems exactly the same when I don&#x27;t apply the serum.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s early 20&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>This makes my skin look so plump and soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok, not sure if I will be a retun buyer, I didn&#x27;t feel a difference between using it and not using it.</li>
            <li>you will notice a change from first week, but big change after a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You might be surprised!</li>
            <li>The first place I put it was on my eyelids, as they&#x27;re starting to droop.</li>
            <li>I gave what was left of my bottle to a friend at work who was interested in using a HA product (I warned her about my breakout).</li>
            <li>Had adult acne prone skin with bumps!</li>
            <li>Bonus, my skin has become soft, supple &amp; the bumps disappeared!</li>
            <li>Water is the First Ingredient, then only  1%  Sodium Hyaluronate , plus 2 addtional additives.  </li>
            <li>Even without prepping my skin with the microneedling (as suggested on other skin care sites), it works with clean skin, still moist from shower or washing...</li>
            <li>getting compliments on my skin, and the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently is start using Hyaluronic Acid (initially the cream made of this &amp; now the serum with my own facial</li>
            <li>I have tried others and with all due respect, not only is this product more clearly helping your skin and wrinkles...  </li>
            <li>Until I came across this serum I had tried many other product that were supposed to make me look like an 18 year old girl when I wake up next morning</li>
            <li>my skin is rrrrrreally sensitive, so I am always leery of new products.</li>
            <li>(I have a new empathy for people with sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidence?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for about two weeks now and my skin seems to be brighter and soft as a new borns.</li>
            <li>Maybe when I&#x27;m older I will go through it more quickly but for now it&#x27;s the least expensive (and most valuable) item in my skin toolbox.</li>
            <li>I love this pure serum and have used it faithfully for the past 3 years underneath my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been mixing it with other lotions and creams, and I didn&#x27;t notice anything special.</li>
            <li>However, I have very sensitive, adult acne prone skin</li>
            <li>im on my second bottle and have seen positive changes in my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hence, I started reading extensive reviews, watching Utube for suggestions( i.e. this is where I learned that the Monistat Chafting gel has the same ingredients as Sephora&#x27;s primer (is actually better with less additives), etc., and started purchasing Amazon products that are extremely cost effective and in some cases the same product used when I had professional treatment, i.e. 35% Glycolic Acid, Emu oil, Argan Oil, Squalane, Hyaluronic Acid. etc.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so sensitive, this usually never burns or anything when using).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think my lines look less obvious (more \\&quot;shallow\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>I bought the hyaluronic acid serum to see if it could be absorbed through the skin to improve the appearance of my thin and easily bruised skin.</li>
            <li>I found it to give me mild breakouts if I use it without following it up with my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it necessarily aided in hydration, but it really helped clear up my skin!</li>
            <li>your money and invest in Image Skin care Ageless Total Pure Hyaluronic Filler</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of you pure hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li>I put this on and 15 min later I put on pure organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Turns out that the 100% PURE hyaluronic acid is only 1 % of this product.  </li>
            <li>This goes on silky smooth and so far has provided added moisture to my skin, my face doesn&#x27;t feel quite as tight this winter.</li>
            <li>&amp; I believe this product certainly helps me keep my younger appearance.</li>
            <li>If you plan on putting foundation on, put more moisturizer on prior to your foundation, otherwise the hyaluronic acid may make the foundation pil slightly (but only if you use too much hyaluronic acid).  </li>
            <li>I always thought acid was harsh, but this is actually very nice and soothing, a tiny tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My skin is usually pretty quick to react to new products (at least it seems to).  </li>
            <li>Early days yet, as only used for one week, but certainly shows promise as lines appear softened and makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li>While it slightly improved moisture on my hand, it did not compare to the moisture level from my original HLA.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I put a little dab along the top edge of my upper lip</li>
            <li>Since i&#x27;ve used this, i&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is softer and more supple looking and hardly ever any blackheads.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and moisturized and not oily at all (which is hard to find when you have combo/oily skin), and the lines around my eyes are much softer.</li>
            <li>I bought this initially in the winter because, where I live, it is SUPER dry and freezing and windy.</li>
            <li>This hyaluronic acid is the secret treasure to amazing skin.</li>
            <li>Let me clear things up because the seller challenged my review.  </li>
            <li>it also helps my sking look clear.</li>
            <li>Plus the bottle came in a clear plastic box with no label.</li>
            <li>This product is clear, and I mix it with my night time routine creams.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear thickish liquid.  </li>
            <li>I started to see the clear skin come out.  </li>
            <li>It was like I had 3 layers of congestion and it took 2 months to clear up.  </li>
            <li>and I have 50 year old men asking me out.</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old and people stop and ask me what I have done to my skin</li>
            <li>I am looking for a serum that will sink the ingredients into the skin and keep the skin soft.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a week now and can not see much difference from my regular moisturizer (I use a non greasy moisturizer).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have been using it for over 6 months nightly.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with eczema</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin, which I&#x27;ve had since my teens and still had well into my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair and body  so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I was astonished to see that my old acne blemishes had faded considerably and my newer ones had diminished.  </li>
            <li>It felt moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>My old acne scars had lightened dramatically.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this is what all those really pricing under eye serums are actually made of...</li>
            <li>as well as professional facials.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been sensitive so that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li>Nothing else has helped my sensitive and upset, unruly skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>so def dont use if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin too</li>
            <li>Soft, lines have improved...</li>
            <li>and I have to say my skin is so soft after.</li>
            <li>So much so, that even on an open wound (shaving cut)</li>
            <li>so far I have not notice any difference</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, and my breakouts have stopped completely.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s used as a preservative in cosmetics but is one of the alcohols you should avoid if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They would help minimize the appearance but could take days to go away completely</li>
            <li>you can feel in moments the soft moist skin as soon as you rub it on.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face really soft, but I have not noticed anything else.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to mention that because many people do not use moisturizers with Hyaluronic Acid and thus fail to get the proper results.</li>
            <li>serious\\&quot; about my skin care and completely switched up my regime...</li>
            <li>Did not notice any difference in my skin, it did hydrate my skin very well but for some reason it caused me to have tiny bumps along the sides of my mouth and jawline.</li>
            <li>Let me say I do not have sensitive skin at all, however by day 4</li>
            <li>I had hundreds of tiny zits covering my whole face.</li>
            <li>makes no noticeable difference on my acne (which i was really hoping for), but the overall texture of skin has dramatically improved.</li>
            <li>I am another person with sensitive skin who found the Benzylalcohol ingredient to be an issue.</li>
            <li>( I am a 47yr old with acne...</li>
            <li>wow, I also have oily skin so no wrinkles or lines)</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>I was sitting in a connective tissue lecture, and heard that hyaluronic acid (which is naturally produced by connective tissue) can bind to tons of water.  </li>
            <li>Natural oils keep skin hydrated</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really notice any extra &amp;#34;plumpness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I did read several reviews about it where it has no instructions but the side panel does have the instructions and really this is a no brainer.</li>
            <li>You really need only a drop on each area you are going to apply it to.</li>
            <li>So far, I rate this a 4-star.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li>And it now has a moisture, natural look to it.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it just under a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and have not suffered any adverse effects.</li>
            <li>I thought I was just getting old</li>
            <li>Some women are blessed with young looking skin but not me, so I started fighting the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>and it seems so far to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>, I am 55 years old....</li>
            <li>So far I m waiting to see a difference</li>
            <li>This process keeps my face glowing and soft.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my face, including near the eye.  </li>
            <li>I believe that this product works really well from the outside.</li>
            <li>Its MUCH MUCH cheaper than buy a premixed product from different manufacturers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it straight and mixed with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>my skin did a complete turn around in 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>I wrote to Timeless and their response was a bit sarcastic.</li>
            <li>In the time it took to finish the bottle they were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>people comment how I look like I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s all of the time.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tried this instead of the dermalogica to save money but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>IT WAS SOFT,</li>
            <li>Not for even remotely sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It could just be water inside as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I am ready to repurchase, but will likely look for another brand.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft now I use with the Argon oil</li>
            <li>and I nearly fainted.</li>
            <li>have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is naturally occurring in our skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed so far and will update again soon........</li>
            <li>but my skin feels soft w/this HA stuff.</li>
            <li>but by far I am not changing the rating as timeless</li>
            <li>but by far I am not changing the rating as timeless</li>
            <li>To early to tell if it give my smoother skin or not we will see.  </li>
            <li>It does appear to make my skin smoother but again to early to tell</li>
            <li>After applying it my skin feels a bit tightened but after a while it is really soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps it soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the Vitamin C Serum and have noticed a big change in the texture of my skin-it is much smoother than before.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>It has completely changed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the version with vitamin C, in my experience so far.</li>
            <li>Beware buyers, if you have sensitive skin, think twice before even trying this on your face.</li>
            <li>I have been battling adult acne for four years</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne prone skin and am in my early thirties.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and does not cause problems with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have adult onset acne, so this helps.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking this company.  </li>
            <li>Always on the look-out for products that are natural based that work.  </li>
            <li>Plumps up the skin and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li>As far as adding moisture...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say and lines look the same.</li>
            <li>I am 77 years old.</li>
            <li>So I decided not to put it directly on my skin (the hyaluronic acid) and instead drop it onto the cotton that had the witch hazel toner, and decided to spread over my skin that way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is not greasy on my sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Will recommend this product to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so it is not like the product is getting old and turns</li>
            <li>My 30 year old niece thinks it does.</li>
            <li>Another bonus is that I don&#x27;t seem to be wearing as much makeup lately - it just doesn&#x27;t seem necessary as my complexion is so much better.</li>
            <li>So far (2 weeks)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t knock my socks off like my old serum did, which approached mythical &amp;#34;miracle in a bottle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, but it does the job very well, at a fraction of the cost, so I&#x27;ll definitely reorder it when I run out.</li>
            <li>w/a few drops of your favorite facial oil like jojoba, argan, rosehip, etc.</li>
            <li>I definitely love using this serum with my everyday facial lotion.  </li>
            <li>I use mineral makeup and most moisturizers make it go on too thick and cakey.</li>
            <li>It gets raves Zollverein the Internet but its just something good to put on your skin when your bored with everything else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight, even though you would think it would since there has been a significant decrease in pore size.</li>
            <li>I applied it to the back of my left hand and none to my right hand to see what effect it had....</li>
            <li>I always put a dropper-full of this with my regular facial moisturizer and apply right after washing my face.</li>
            <li>No more dry skin and the peel is hydrated and peeled nicely.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a little while now, and I have to say I do see significant improvements in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Its a great price to and a little goes a long long way!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I did have a very minor break out from this the first week I used it.  </li>
            <li>The seller has pointed out that \\&quot;A concentration higher than 1% will tend to dry out the skin unless additional moisture is added.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Good used every other day under all other face products be careful in sun</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it especially if you use natural products.</li>
            <li>I saw at least one review on here saying that the product is as gentle to the skin as water and that&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it pretty regularly since Nov., and have definitely noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the second purchase of this particular product.</li>
            <li>, if you are lucky and you get it, they have a reputation of charging your credit and not sending the products, it is not authentic hyaluronic acid serum, I have used skinceuticals from the dermatologist hyaluronic acid for years, thought I would save some money and buy this, my skin got so irritated had to go to the dermatologist and get some hydrocortisone cream to calm down the redness, the doctor said the timeless skin care hyaluronic acid was a cheap imitation and causing my skin to breakout,</li>
            <li>Too early to see any major differences.</li>
            <li>This is as good if not better than more expensive products!</li>
            <li>This is the first time in four years I did not suffer a single break out!</li>
            <li>With my conditioner, I have gotten the same results I get from my high priced leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, oh, and I also use it on the back of my hands at bedtime.</li>
            <li>skin has been peeling because I have been using a sulfur mask daily (for acne, highly recommended).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So, I highly recommend all of the above.  </li>
            <li>bottle easily will last me a few months.</li>
            <li>I would love someone to prove me different, but I haven&#x27;t seen any results for my dry skin even when I pair it with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>first couple days I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work for me as it was drying my skin out pretty badly.</li>
            <li>not even sure if the product is what it is - not good at all</li>
            <li>my skin already better now, only a few acne marks that left,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that my face will go back to normal.</li>
            <li>My doctor told me that he couldn&#x27;t do anything for me because he would normally prescribe a topical steroid for eczema.  </li>
            <li>Expected much higher concentration of HA.</li>
            <li>A true waste of money.</li>
            <li>I usually never use facial cream moisturizers as pretty much all of them are too heavy for my skin and irritate/make it greasy</li>
            <li>(I have normal to dry skin &amp; live in an arrid climate.)</li>
            <li>A few drops mixed in with my moisturizer plumps up fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this, but I&#x27;m 50+, had a crease between my eyebrows that&#x27;s literally almost gone now, my fine wrinkles are barely perceptable, and my neck area looks to be tighter.  </li>
            <li>Jan 20--I live in the same city this was shipped from.</li>
            <li>So my new plan - is the hyaluronic serum in the morning and Retinol Anti-Wrinkle Facial Serum in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>So my new plan - is the hyaluronic serum in the morning and Retinol Anti-Wrinkle Facial Serum in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>After only 3 days of trying this new regimen for my skin.  </li>
            <li>With my last order of December 18, 2012, I added a new product from Timeless.  </li>
            <li>product isn&#x27;t bad necessarily and the price point makes it incredibly affordable.</li>
            <li>i dont notice much a difference in a bad way or good.</li>
            <li>Of course then my whole skin is dry</li>
            <li>My skin gets extremely dry, but this has made winter so much easier.</li>
            <li>The itchiness lasted the whole day and was only helped by extra moisturizing during the day w/ coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I really feel my face is getting back alot of the youthful glow that I had lost over the last couple of years.</li>
            <li>this works very well, my skin is visibly looking younger and prettier over the last couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>I did get one minor red bump for the first couple of days but nothing since then.</li>
            <li>and it is absorbed quickly into my skin, but I don&#x27;t see any dramatic results.</li>
            <li>that I know what I am using (natural facial creams from Aubrey) than chemicals that burn my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and so far have seen a marked improvement in my skin tone and firmness.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t seem to get the hydration that I expected from it and thought maybe I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way - 4 drops EASILY</li>
            <li>This product is like dropping water on my face, every drop runs right down my cheek.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely not for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing but very dry feeling skin, just as if you were to apply nothing but pure water to your face.  </li>
            <li>Either that, or there is some major placebo effect going on here...  </li>
            <li>you can barely feel it on your face!</li>
            <li>I used only a drop as first on each hand (back only) and then my forehead.  </li>
            <li>and I have some major acne scaring that seems to look &amp;#34;not as bad&amp;#34; since using this serum.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any major changes to my skin since I started using this about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>, what else...haven&#x27;t had any allergic reactions (but I am not an allergic to anything), no irritation, no rush, no other side effects either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although, I have not noticed any major changes in wrinkles, my skin looks healthier and I do not break out as often.</li>
            <li>but it works better than some more expensive moisturizers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>major improvments anywhere else,</li>
            <li>Please be aware that hyaluronic acid is to be used with other items, namely moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Also, not sure if it is making skin more dry or not as it is winter-time her in the the mid-west which is drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>It really hydrated my dry peeling skin well!</li>
            <li>only.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned putting this in conditioner &amp; it leaving her hair soft, so I added a few drops to a spray bottle with some leave in conditioning treatment &amp; spray that on before blow drying &amp; my hair is silky, shiny &amp; has less static.</li>
            <li>I tried a few other brands and for some reason this one is better.</li>
            <li>Need to use this product a little longer to see if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Have been using for a long time, came highly recommended by my doctor of 13  years.</li>
            <li>Keep the serum clean by not touching the eyedropper directly - drop the fluid on your fingers to use.</li>
            <li>I feel better about myself already because I&#x27;m not ashamed to look at my face in the mirror, because it looks smooth now, and I don&#x27;t just see lots of pores and little pockmarks from years of troubled skin and picking at my face.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased over an over due to positive results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so very concentrated and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It has made my acne prone skin amazingly clear except for the occasional hormonal breakout.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problem skin: sensitive and T-zone oily at the same time with breakouts at that time of the month....</li>
            <li>For the record, I&#x27;m a 46 year old male.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO bottom line, use only if you do NOT have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i had to go to a dermatologist so the price i a paid was the most expensive customers do something with this  money factory cause they only wants to sell ando</li>
            <li>Now I can barely see them.</li>
            <li>I use it with a couple of drops of essential oil and it helps my mature skin not to sag or wrinkle.</li>
            <li>and I see considerable improvement in skin texture, skin tone and overall appearance.  </li>
            <li>Tried a more expensive one after first buying this thinking it would do a better job, but I was certainly wrong.  </li>
            <li>I have used this twice daily for two months and can tell a marked difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I just turned 69 and people guess my age at early to middle 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the morning mixed with my moisturizer and apply it directly to my problem areas in the evening.</li>
            <li>Wow is my initial reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a cream with Hyaluronic acid in it and</li>
            <li>During the day I wear natural sunscreen from Aubrey over this &amp; at night I mix a couple drops in with my facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I rub a drop on my shoulders after drying off when getting out of the shower and it has completely cleared up my back acne.</li>
            <li>, I am young but I feel like my skin looks even younger now</li>
            <li>so you might not feel it&#x27;s soft enough or plumps.</li>
            <li>I gave two stars only because it does contain natural ingredients and does not make me breakout.</li>
            <li>Sorry, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate it properly but my face feels great after using it, will continue use of it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin as well as numerous allergies.</li>
            <li>what this product actually is, is surely feels worse than alcohol.</li>
            <li>My face and neck looks to be clearing now and the few laugh lines I had are softening as well while my forehead furrows are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of no propylen glycol or other annoying preservatives that most products have in them , so I use this, realizing there is nothing miraculous going to happen, but also realizing it cant hurt!</li>
            <li>It moistens the skin like water, and then quickly dries up like pure water, leaving behind...</li>
            <li>so I brang the access down to my neck area and after a few hours gone by, I forgot about it and started touching my neck (which I do alot at the computer area)</li>
            <li>If you are needing mega moisture for dry skin I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Pat on a small amount (I use it all over my face, including my eye area, neck and decollete), give it about ten seconds to dry, then top with moisturizer of your choice.</li>
            <li>the older you get, you loose elasticity, your skin get dehydrated</li>
            <li>Sometimes some products you put on seems too sticky or leaves a heavy feeling on your face, well when combining with this acid, your face will instant starts to absorb your other cream faster and most time leaving your face feel unsticky.</li>
            <li>I do consume 100 ounces of water a day ( a necessity for an active adult in the Mile high city)</li>
            <li>after it dries it&#x27;s not oily and it doesn&#x27;t dry your face, but you have to use it with your normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Usually you have to use a reallllly good moisturizer after such treatments because the skin is extremely dry, tight, and temporarily injured.</li>
            <li>And comparing to other brands I really don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then other brands by far&lt;br</li>
            <li>it took a little over a month to see results, but i can see my skin getting better everyday.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and have dry skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps my skin retain moisture, and I am an active outdoor person age 58.  </li>
            <li>I use it on all my normal to dry skin clients and they feel the difference too!</li>
            <li>results - if used properly - provide me the same results as professional treatment.</li>
            <li>I have spent sooo much money on facial products i cant believe it.  </li>
            <li>is likely to run out in 4-6 months, with frequent use; you do not need allot of it for each daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a 41 year old male, workout daily and is attempting to keep off the visible years of aging.</li>
            <li>even on open scraps or burns it helps soothe it without irritating it,i love it.</li>
            <li>either jojoba oil or argon and my face does not dry out at all.</li>
            <li>skin is not dry or oily when i use it.</li>
            <li>I had heard that it was a large molecule that was not easily absorbed....</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>That was a major red flag</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m assuming he had a little too much sun?!</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for something that would repair my dry skin</li>
            <li>I like the feel of it and have high hopes it will help keep my skin from looking aged  Price</li>
            <li>Generally - I woud receommend it, and I will definitely reorder it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, using this in conjunction with my sunscreen and other products IS the key, and my skin has NOT broken out...which IS a miracle...</li>
            <li>For those for whom it worked, or said they received drying or irritation, obviously got a different batch/solution which actually had a much much higher concentration of Hyaluronic Acid, or some other ingredients (alcohol, etc?)...  </li>
            <li>When was attemping to open the product from their box it was a apparent</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference in my skin after the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>i am now very skeptical good reviews given</li>
            <li>plus,  when I looked at my previous orders of the Spray and Pure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watered down</li>
            <li>No more pimples, and even better, dark spots gradually go away!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have noticed that the price fluctuates and has gone up a little since I first purchased it last year.</li>
            <li>By morning my face does feel soft, but by afternoon it just feels dry &amp; almost itchy sometimes.</li>
            <li>I have had dry patches on my face,  once I started using this my skin is soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>You will see a reduction in dry skin and young wrinkles.</li>
            <li>TWICE AS MUCH FOR LESS MONEY.</li>
            <li>My neck and face look much healthier, less &#x27;droop.&#x27;</li>
            <li>At least there are no bad side effects and I&#x27;ll try it on my next cut or burn to see if it does help healing.</li>
            <li>For the past week, I have been using a few drops of it mixed with my moisturizer and it made a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>the other brand I normally use.</li>
            <li>Just give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used it on my rough dry elbows and knees and they have much improved.</li>
            <li>so total 4-5 months depending how much you use (I use about a half of the dropper).</li>
            <li>so total 4-5 months depending how much you use (I use about a half of the dropper).</li>
            <li>My skin has been much clearer than it typically was prior to using this product.</li>
            <li>Made my skin a bit tight and really noticed no difference at all with its use.</li>
            <li>This is 100% pure hyaluronic acid, but I have not seen any difference after using this product for about a few months now.  </li>
            <li>The Quick Red Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Brown Dog!</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend it to anyone with dry skin and for mature skin to rehydrate skin back to its luscious younger self.</li>
            <li>so you have to learn a little bit of a conservative technique for those of us used to slatering on as much moisturizer as we can get.</li>
            <li>So this proves a little goes a long way!!!  </li>
            <li>The serum really sucked all of the moisture out of my skin and left me looking a little dessicated.  </li>
            <li>BTW - I am in my 40s, have dry skin, and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>next two nights, same routing b/c of long days and general tiredness...</li>

            <li> but the biggest surprise is how amazing it is to use around the eyes.</li>
            <li> it istruly amazing the way the skin around his eyes looks now.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know about hyaluronic acid, it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product it is amazing .</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>

            <li> and I look amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about a week now and my skin looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> She had even sent me her before and after picture --amazing.  </li>
            <li> An amazing deal on an amazing product.</li>
            <li> makes a great serum to make my skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I also apply it to my toes which were kind of wrinkled</li>
            <li> it looks so nice</li>
            <li> I gave it an honest try.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a great purchase and I will buy some more when I finish my bottle.  :)</li>
            <li> I was delighted to receive this after many days without it.  </li>
            <li> It may have been a combination of my makeup on top of this product(I use Physician&#x27;s Formula talc-free mineral foundation)because when I used it at night, my skin looked good in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I NEVER write reviews on things I buy.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of &#x27;eh&#x27;  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly had no idea</li>
            <li> % pure\\&quot; it would be in powder form and you&#x27;d have to mix up your own 1% solution.</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely the BEST!!!!  </li>
            <li> You use this with your own moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so it could be I&#x27;m not using it effectively.</li>
            <li> It spreads nicely on my face.</li>
            <li> This one is kind of watery.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to mention my application method because I wondered if it will be effective used in this manner.</li>
            <li> It has indeed evened out my complexion and hopefully will keep my skin looking good or even better by keeping it well hydrated.</li>
            <li> I gave it a good 5 months and my skin was getting accumulatively redder, drier, &amp; more</li>
            <li> It made me feel good to see that it wasn&#x27;t just an impression :-)</li>
            <li> As another customer suggested, I paired this with rose water.</li>
            <li> When wearing this under moisturizer and a bb cream, it gives me a nice, dewy glow for the summer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also-- extremely fast shipping and great packaging!!</li>
            <li> Nice package ...</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll readily OWN that.  </li>
            <li> GOOD TO ADD TO YOUR FAVORITE MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li> but hey people, there&#x27;s the internet and your own intuition.</li>
            <li> thank you is good product, but I need more for eraser my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Is nice for help your skin in winter</li>
            <li> It is an effective addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> but when items get popular companies cut corners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it hydrates</li>
            <li> and I think I should be seeing some kind of change....</li>
            <li> any kind of allergic reaction or hives or any rash.  </li>
            <li> To those who doubt this, I say give it a try on its own for a while.</li>
            <li> I bought it about a year ago because of my acne scars and I can absolutely say that this product is the best.  </li>
            <li> but after one year I can honestly say I will be a customer forever.  </li>
            <li> and she is loving</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Because this item work so good, with a item Benzylalcohol might better?</li>
            <li> I asked her how she liked it</li>
            <li> I cant believe I read so many good reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect - fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Making own night face cream</li>
            <li> but after a while, it kind of became one of those products where you don&#x27;t see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives nice glowing and moist.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely and well-wrapped.</li>
            <li> I honestly like others, am dumbfounded by this product.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> I also feel like it has kind of a plumping/firming effect.</li>
            <li> Nice to use under makeup because it is not at all greasy like a lotion moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am more then pleased with this product and have shared it with many others!!</li>
            <li> It was really worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product and a very reasonable price for a generous bottle.  </li>
            <li> It feels good to put on like putting cool water on, but that&#x27;s about all its good for.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in my skin if I run out and continue to highly recommend this product for great skin!</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars for being fairly priced, quick delivery and good consistency</li>
            <li> This, however, is perfect every time and leaves my face feeling amazing soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and feels good.</li>
            <li> is one of the greatest humectants available today, and is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a thinner serum, but very easy to control&lt;br /&gt;Zero</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use</li>
            <li> It helped my wrinkles and very easy to put on</li>
            <li> but I am very impressed so far!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s mostly genes, but this stuff moisturizes my acne prone skin and gives it an even more youthful glow!</li>
            <li> Just another satisfied customer! :)</li>
            <li> I also apply a good moisturizer to my face to soften those fine lines.</li>
            <li> I would say it is also excellent for sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly a year now, and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> so far it is great, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> My complexion just glows and it is so soft and looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> As for the face, again - no permanent changes, but I would have that glow that I thought was really nice :)  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been impressed.</li>
            <li> but I would have liked it better if it had NOT leaked.  </li>
            <li> I liked this serum, but I feel like it was mostly glycerin, despite what the label says.</li>
            <li> So far, my skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> I awake to beautiful, clear, bright skin.</li>
            <li> Great product at very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> At first i didn&#x27;t like it because I experienced some irritation.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> great product, does exactly what it describes to do.</li>
            <li> I have not yet experienced any noticeable improvements with wrinkle reduction, but then again, I have not used the serum as consistently as I should have.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what I was expecting, but I am pretty happy about  this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched in order to find the ingredients most important in producing a very effective difference in skin texture, appearance, radiance, suppleness; also minimizing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and is not sticky at all - absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month now, and my fine lines have almost all gone away!  </li>
            <li> The product is odorless, very smooth solution and non greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This serum glides on like silk and you do not need a lot, very cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;One very important step is using the softener.</li>
            <li> and my skin is very smooth and even now.</li>
            <li> 48 &amp; my complexion is very smooth and even.</li>
            <li> The best product I have used in a long time, helps keep my skin young and flawless and I am a skin junkie.</li>
            <li> so that is a huge plus for me!  </li>
            <li> I also bought some rosewater most based on another reviews recommendation, so</li>
            <li> My skin looks better already.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> i will order more.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product would be a serum, but it is more of a water texture.  </li>
            <li> My point of the review is that, whatever goes inside this serum is not doing anything to better my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this serum....</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> The skin even looks more hydrated when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have been buying hyaluronic acid serum by cellux-c hydra-B for years, but to try ,and save some money (hydra-b is quite a bit more expensive)I thought I would try this one instead.</li>
            <li> Great Product, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and love it.  </li>
            <li> After that I can apply any day cream, make-up, or nigth cream directly on top.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I have used 1/2 of my bottle and am ordering more.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I spray Na-Pca on top of this serum; it seems to seal it in, or activate it, if you will.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I think my skin is more moist...</li>
            <li> At one time II was able to afford</li>
            <li> I just wanted more oomph.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic stuff!  </li>
            <li> My husband noticed it immediately after a month of use and he now calls me Benjamin Button  :-)  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and more plumped up.</li>
            <li> This product did seem to help with clearing up the blackheads on my nose and minimizing my pores, but I stopped using it because it also seemed like I was breaking out more on my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li> But overall, great purchase!</li>
            <li> Going to make sure</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> My skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> The results have been fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely mix with a moisturizer for best results.</li>
            <li> but I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clearer and yes, smoother, as in, it is holding more moisture...</li>
            <li> There are many many better brands.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m thinking it is better</li>
            <li> it was ok didn&#x27;t get any results from it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Need I say more.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my skin and am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on top, depending on how my skin feels</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling and looking better</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied that I have recommended it to family and friends,</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> The product is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have introduce to many of my friends to use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like this product, however, its not as potent as the product Episilk hyalogic.</li>
            <li> is just comical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I know about it now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that you can really benefit from HA by humidity, because it draws moisture from the air into your skin and that keeping a humidifier in your room at night when you apply this has great results, but I have not tried that yet.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
            <li> I love beauty products.</li>
            <li> It says free shipping, but it took forever to get it!</li>
            <li> Mostly a bottle of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I stumbled on this and would recommend it to anyone who struggles with skin care!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will know more after using for a month.</li>
            <li> Have a gel product that works quite well but more costly.</li>
            <li> And it seemed like more of a barrier in between my moisturizer and skin than anything else.</li>
            <li> Works best for me when mixed in my hands with moisturizer, as opposed to applied before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I threw it out after thinking about it more.</li>
            <li> To top it all off my face felt and looked like leather.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year or so and love it.</li>
            <li> I love thefactthet</li>
            <li> and i paid 50% more.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I decided to do a  glycolic peel</li>
            <li> and I have enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> AND JUST LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> THIS LOVE</li>
            <li> Thankyou :)</li>

            <li> I have to say my skin has been better and better.  </li>
            <li> sure if I would buy this product again.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love love love it...</li>
            <li> There are better formulas on amazon without alcohol.</li>
            <li> If you do order make sure you check delivery time</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without making your skin greasy…I really love it</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I will have to order another bottle before my next peel,  but it seemed to work great!</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I always top off my skin with tons of moisturizer even after using this.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and have been a faithful user for over 4 yrs now.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> so I put this on top of my morning moisturizer</li>
            <li> I add a dropper or two to my favorite skin care products that don&#x27;t contain hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use a sunscreen over the top during the day and apply this serum again at night before bed.</li>
            <li> and it does seem to seep into my skin much better when I use it with the product.</li>
            <li> I am however going to buy a couple of extra bottles, one for myself and another for my best friend.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Love the neutral scent.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I also feel safe.</li>
            <li> I use on top of my moisturizer in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks better after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> At night, I top it with a retinol cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> con to this product for me is that it seems to be making me a bit more oily during the day</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and big bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked for life now :)</li>
            <li> but I want to look better.  </li>
            <li> and I am very happy with the results (especially with skin around my eyes).  </li>
            <li> I should have been using twice a day for even better results.</li>
            <li> I should have been using twice a day for even better results.</li>
            <li> So I make sure to keep it hydrated with a day cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on your skin.</li>
            <li> But as far as making your skin feel smooth and temporary plump, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> r much better serums on the market</li>
            <li> there is nothing better</li>
            <li> I have been using hyaluronic acid for more than thirty years.  </li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> -  it  could be  helping :-)</li>
            <li> and I could not be more over the moon.</li>
            <li> it works and will order more</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li> I liked the smooth, almost gelatinous feel of the serum.  </li>
            <li> I think I would like something a bit more organic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, and especially when used with Squalane (not Squaline).</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> I love how it gives a glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> But hyaluronic acid is a costly ingredient, which is why it&#x27;s important to choose a product with an effective concentration.</li>
            <li> In love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product, it takes a while to notice the results</li>
            <li> can either mix it in with your favorite moisturizer or you can use it</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the basis of many articles out there marketing the benefits of hyaluronic acid as an anti-aging must-have.  </li>
            <li> The name &#x27;serum&#x27; gives me the impression that the product is a bit thicker, but it is actually more watery than what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> It really does reduce lines, feels great, and combines with makeup or sunscreen etc.</li>
            <li> I love this Timeless Hyaluronic Acid Serum for my aching knees.  </li>
            <li> JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite weapons.</li>
            <li> My makeup is going on more evenly too.  </li>
            <li> I think it helps those work better by holding in the moisture.</li>
            <li> so I thought this product would be good for that, since so many reviews seem to have success with using it to help the skin retain moisture.  </li>
            <li> So, I applied the moisturizer on top of that.  </li>
            <li> I would love to have instructions on how to use this?</li>
            <li> My skin has looked so much better since I began using it.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have done years of research.</li>
            <li> but this company just seems way better.</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It is mostly water with a smattering?</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going to order more before this stuff gets</li>
            <li> I knew better</li>
            <li> After reading all of these reviews, you have to work ways that are best for you because every skin is different.  </li>
            <li> I love looking at my skin in the mirrow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t too expencive</li>
            <li> She has really enjoyed using it and has told me that she has seen quite an improvement in her skin</li>
            <li> It might work better for others</li>
            <li> It helps your skin absorb the creams better.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Favorite serum of all time.</li>
            <li> It is pretty lightweight and feels amazing on my skin!</li>

            <li> Love this Serum.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to give it some more time.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so darn cheap!</li>
            <li> As its used in many cosmetic products but never in its entirety.</li>
            <li> This is a very generous size and a great value.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t swing it more than twice a year.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>

            <li> It has helped my skin look better along with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is one of the better products I have ever used.</li>

            <li> My skin likes this product and feels more hydrated for sure.</li>
            <li> I found alpha hydrox has better result.</li>
            <li> but wasn&#x27;t sure just how or when to apply it . . .</li>
            <li> Have seen better but not for the money</li>
            <li> I love this</li>

            <li> So while she would&#x27;ve done a much better job evaluating this product than I have, just remember that it works and that it does what it says it will do.</li>

            <li> My skin looks better since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find this product cause any Hyaluronic acid added to the others</li>
            <li> I hope I can always buy from this retailer at a great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tacky like some products do.</li>
            <li> BUT I feel better using this than not using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten do many complements on my skin.</li>
            <li> One more thing, I don&#x27;t have that excess of oil anymore</li>
            <li> I am actually in LOVE with this product.  </li>
            <li> on my neck, and my decolletage looks and feels more youthful.  </li>
            <li> After two days of doing this, my skin looks better than it has in twenty years.  </li>
            <li> maybe it will do more after more time.</li>
            <li> I use this with microneedling and its okay.</li>
            <li> Love this product will continue to always order.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better</li>
            <li> It looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> Think of this as your favorite product&#x27;s magnet, or a moister &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay for the price...does not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> i based it on all the many many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that, i use the dropper with the hyaluronic acid serum, and focas most around my eyes and the side of my face that had some scaring from pimples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a week of using this 2x/day, my skin started to produce more oil</li>
            <li> just wish there was more information on how to use this product to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure heredity plays a part.</li>
            <li> This in combination with the Triple C serum is nothing short of amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Used for 2 more months, no change.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference with better moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers are too oily (even the oil-free ones, somehow) and cause breakouts, but my skin craves some sort of hydration.</li>
            <li> My horrendous breakouts are for the most part gone, (that time of the month will always be unforgiving)</li>
            <li> love the fact that I was able to buy the 2 oz .</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum based mostly on the glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more plump and dewy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: Even if this stuff is 99% water, I have to admit that I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for the skin and really helps with moisture retention.</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li> The fewer ingredients, the better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the hyaluronic acid now for more than a year.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product.</li>
            <li> I Love it</li>
            <li> I find my under eye concealer goes on much better with it, and my mineral make up goes on smoother after letting this soak</li>
            <li> in the end it cost a lot more then buying the authentic hyaluronic acid by skinceuticals and having to wears makeup to cover the redness</li>
            <li> and i will order more &amp; more.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I apply this right after I apply my Retin-A, followed by a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> That aside, my skin does look so good right now.</li>
            <li> the first lasted forever !!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> Loved it- spa/dermatologist quality, amateur price- great for at home use!</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and arrived quickly so I will reorder for sure!</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and obsorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is really good to use in the morning, I use it first then</li>
            <li> The product was beautifully packaged with instructions clearly printed on the box.  </li>
            <li> My skin was always pretty good</li>
            <li> First of all, good luck getting any products from timeless skin care</li>
            <li> I am 46 and suddenly having breakouts, but in one week my breakouts have stopped and everything is almost healed, my fine lines are improving and yesterday at work 5 people commented on how flawless my skin looks YAY!!  </li>
            <li> worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid (originally extracted from rooster&#x27;s combs!  </li>
            <li> But this is so easy and it works even better.  </li>
            <li> well, I barely have any sun damage, my skin is silky smooth with awesome clarity, fine lines are on their way out</li>
            <li> She said it is the best for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to absorb and make my face look healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting my hormones as well as fine lines on my face for many years and</li>
            <li> but I am winning the battle with fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I tried to find a cheaper alternative to Rodan and Fields but kept noticing more fine lines.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff and will be a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this on Amazon when I was looking to add to my skin care routine during Chicago&#x27;s wonderful polar vortex.</li>
            <li> Apply to clean damp skin and you&#x27;ll soon feel more hydrated and look more dewy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very good mixed</li>
            <li> This bottle should last quite a while and is a very good value.</li>
            <li> This is a very good alternative of a daily cream for people with dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> amazing product , really helped improve my skin, be smoother, fine lines deminished, no smell, wears nice under make up, but you may need a bit of a moisturizer over it , at night I use argan oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, my skin feels fresh</li>
            <li> His skin should be more accurate since he has never applied product to it &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Available in most health food places, or vitamin shops.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great &amp; apparently looks better to one of my coworkers</li>
            <li> My skin is hydrated, smooth and glowing; skin tone is a lot more even, and make up stays put all day.</li>
            <li> and I was so pleased with how smooth my face was when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> It has been great so far.</li>
            <li> It works great so far ..</li>
            <li> We noticed our skin became more smooth and supple when we added this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great serum to stock at home  for many reasons, but if you have a lot of skin allergies or if you&#x27;re acne prone - this is about the safest way to possibly go to avoid irritation, clogged pores, breakouts &amp; even more rapid healing of popped blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is silky smooth and makes my face feel fabulous!</li>
            <li> I  love this product it makes my skin  feel fantastic.  </li>
            <li> After this my skin feels very tight(may be good for wrinkles), but not realy moisturized.</li>
            <li> However - the price is good and the shipping fast.</li>
            <li> It feels really nice and is absorbed almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I use it after dermarolling, and it leaves my laugh lines and under eyes looking so nice</li>
            <li> I do hope this may encourage some of you to use these products as they are priced reasonable and they have been really good for me.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> serum itself goes on smoothly, absorbs into my skin quickly and plays nicely with the apple stem cell serum I use.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand my face looks great and flawless and like when I get compliments as to how young I look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products that claim to smooth out the skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines.  </li>
            <li> any other wonderful adjective you can think of*.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply face appears hydrated.</li>
            <li> The product is VERY mild.</li>
            <li> Pay more and find something more worth your money.</li>
            <li> Best to put on clean dry skin, then put on moisturizer after it dries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply (it&#x27;s almost like water,</li>
            <li> I received this very quickly from the supplier and it was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> My fiancee only used it twice on his face, he wouldn&#x27;t allow me to apply any more LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy, unscented and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Applies easily with water consistence...</li>
            <li> Mixed with Retinol for better results, but great product even if used alone.</li>
            <li> This blends easily and is non greasy and easily absorbs.</li>
            <li> It soaks in easily and can be worn under makeup.  </li>
            <li> I can easily see and feel if I skip it for a couple of days, and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> will strongly recommend to all my fris..</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a good product affordable and available.</li>
            <li> I will post a follow-up review later on, but right now this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more right now !  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the L&#x27;Oreal serum with hyaluronic acid that I was using (but has been discontinued), but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s much more pure, and has more hyaluronic acid in it.</li>
            <li> I most definately know that to be true.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working fairly well, but I&#x27;m using more than one product at the same time, so I can&#x27;t be sure which one is doing the job.</li>
            <li> I imagine that is due to taking good care of my skin and good genetics, but I must say that I think the hyaluronic acid helps to keep me moisturized and to keep the fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN THE BEST THING</li>
            <li> This ingredient found in lots of high end moisturizers and this product is more effective and affordable.</li>
            <li> My dermatogist was even impressed by how much less clogged my pores are now that I&#x27;ve been using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smooths out fine lines and minimizes pores.  </li>
            <li> Okay, that aside, I can&#x27;t exactly say &amp;#34;what&amp;#34; this product does, but my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> I was already impressed at a month--my acne was less</li>
            <li> Also fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS&amp;#62;  Use on skin first and then over the top with Vitamin C cream.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines around my eyes are almost gone</li>
            <li> The fine lines in my face have poofed up.  </li>
            <li> I look fine for my age</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t expect my fine lines to vanish</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t expect my fine lines to vanish</li>
            <li> Plumped my skin and got rid of all those fine lines.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid helps the skin retain this moisture, and has a temporary plumping effect on fine lines and wrinkles as the molecules swell.</li>
            <li> My skin has a glow to it and the fine lines on my forehead seem to have diminished.  </li>
            <li> fine lines all still there, skin tone unchanged.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m acne-prone and have fine lines -- I use the serum as soon as I get out of the shower while my skin is still moist.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from amazon, it arrived fine.  </li>
            <li> I have seen no difference in its affects for fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Extremely quick shipping!</li>

            <li> had originally purchased this for intensive post-peel moisturizing - which it works great for - but have also now started using it daily.</li>
            <li> Very deceptive!!!    </li>
            <li> An absolute must!!!  </li>

            <li> powerful stuff!</li>
            <li> everything worth having (improved skin!) takes time.  </li>
            <li> ORIGINAL review:  </li>
            <li> I use this as the first layer after cleaning my face in the evening with moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> Hydrates my skin, worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will work better if I let the serum sink in first before using my night cream</li>
            <li> I am so excited about purchasing this product from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Will try to be more consistent with its use and see how it works.</li>
            <li> I put this serum on my face and neck first then top with face cream to seal it in.</li>
            <li> and it was totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it and my skin look a lot better now.  </li>
            <li> At this price its definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Friendly as can be</li>
            <li> After using this stuff, the cystic breakouts have significantly subsided and if I do get a pimple, it goes away faster.  </li>
            <li> My face had actually absorbed it!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and hesitated to purchase this product, but I did purchase because many reviews said it worked fine on oily skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel amazing, speeds up healing of burns and/or acne scars and its very sensitive skin friendly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like &#x27;clean&#x27; saliva.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and supple.  </li>
            <li> , the serum is light, odorless and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> skin feels smooth and drys quickly.  </li>
            <li> It was great in days 3-4  for moisturizing  my skin  which was insanely dry after the peel.  </li>
            <li> Old lady gets many compliments on her skin:)</li>
            <li> I also will drop some of this into a dollop of leave-in conditioner, then smooth it into my hair for a nice, soft, shiny appearance after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but so far it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> this product i use twice a day on clean skin before makeup.</li>
            <li> I clean my face with a salicylic acid astringent every morning.  </li>
            <li> So far my skin is looking better and better every day.</li>
            <li> I have put it on my clean face every morning, then my moisturizer and make-up.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day on clean face.</li>
            <li> so make up goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li> I love it, my skin is more soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I mix one drop of serum to two drops of oil, and apply it to clean skin before bed.  </li>
            <li> I put it on a clean face before bed and after my shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> I just need to find a product to take away the discoloration caused by my acne scars now that my skin is clean and</li>
            <li> Since its 100% pure Hyaluronic acid, it&#x27;s un-necessary to go with a higher priced luxury brand since it should be the same, and this brand is inexpensive and excellent.</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail, already have a positive love the smoothness it leaves when it drys.</li>
            <li> As a general rule of thumb, the higher up on the ingredient list the hyaluronic acid (or sodium hyaluronate) is, the more potent the product, which means better results for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is pure hyaluronic acid serum, nothing more.  </li>
            <li> They should not be able to say 100% pure.</li>
            <li> Of course, you should proceed with caution to determine whether you have any special sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After I wash face with a special soap.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a hyaluronic product that was pure serum . . .</li>
            <li> i love the large bottle this comes in.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special here and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> was right!  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li> great product as expected.</li>
            <li> seems pretty good so far</li>
            <li> For combination skin such as mine, its best added to an actual light moisturizer rather than for use alone.</li>
            <li> With my skin being at an optimum level for the serum, I definitely see that my skin is well hydrated vs.</li>
            <li> That is true.</li>
            <li> On the Timeless Skincare website, I found the true ingredient list:    </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this like everyone else</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending too much money on lotions as I think they are mostly overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put it on and then brush my teeth and see results in front of my eyes and my skin has even more intense results by morning.  </li>
            <li> Your skin needs to be hydrated and it will naturally repair, look refreshed, and flush away bacteria on its own.  </li>
            <li> It goes on so light and fresh</li>
            <li> I ordered more to give to my family as gifts and I received the order incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel good after I put it on, however overall I didn&#x27;t see any difference to my skin.  </li>
            <li> So, although this product seems to be awesome for the majority of users, just be warned that not all that it may cause icky breakouts if your skin is finicky.</li>
            <li> If you lightly dab this under your eyes, it will make the skin look fresh again.</li>
            <li> i love this product so much</li>
            <li> I have done a trial using it on the top of one hand only and can see the hand with the serum is has more smooth skin than the one without.</li>
            <li> So many skin products carry this ingredient but at a very inflated price.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things.</li>
            <li> and I am using nothing but natural stuff on my skin now with everything being 0 hazardous BTW.</li>
            <li> Its very hydrating but can&#x27;t tell anything outstanding about it.</li>
            <li> Love this so much.</li>
            <li> I loved using it not only on my face but arms and hands</li>
            <li> My face and neck are fresh glowing and so smooth.</li>
            <li> wonderful serum to smooth over the face after washing and before moisturizing - it really works and with daily use, you&#x27;ll most definitely see results in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> and i had no bad reaction.</li>
            <li> The retin A has worked well with somewhat erasing the fine lines and the Hyaluronic Acid tightens the skin around the eyes causing the fine lines to be largely diminished..</li>
            <li> So far it feels nice on the skin and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only experienced positive results.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 yrs, I spend a good deal of time outside, and my skin is dry, this product really makes my skin look good!</li>
            <li> I have been reading great things online about this type of acid for moisturizing, but I bought this because I was fooled into thinking that it was actually 100% pure (</li>
            <li> if there was such a thing--feels like pure moisture...feels great</li>
            <li> Using this product in the AM and before bed have significantly reduced both - to the point that others have commented on how fresh my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> At first I was cross because I had wanted the oral version but after adding to my skin cream I am impressed with the added flexibility and texture of my 90 year old skin.</li>
            <li> Great product and can be added with moisturizers or other serums.  </li>
            <li> Great mositurizer for people with acne prone skin and cant use other mositerizers becasue</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this new product!</li>
            <li> and I have seen a tremendous change with my skin.</li>
            <li> My theory is that it super hydrates ...</li>
            <li> Until now, it hasn&#x27;t done any magic on my skin, but i do feel my skin more moist, well maybe because it&#x27;s only been two weeks.   </li>
            <li> quick ship</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the product and it absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> DRYS QUICKLY</li>
            <li> also noticed a difference in how quickly this product seemed to disappear on the skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I love love this stuff, especially after having either a pixel laser peel or a chemical peel (glycolic acid 35% or salicylic acid 20%).</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about the hyaluronic acid but this bottle is magic, the non sticky texture and easily absorbed into the skin really helps.</li>
            <li> , it absorbs quickly, I think it even doesn&#x27;t smell (</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I ordered the product myself and it arrived within 5 days.....very quickly!</li>
            <li> quick delivery</li>
            <li> I guess I did it backwards, but since getting it, I&#x27;ve done some more research and found that it is used more for medical reasons than cosmetic.</li>
            <li> COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY THIS COMPANY RESPONDED.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I wish they don&#x27;t raise the price in the future,  because I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main reason I love this.</li>
            <li> This product itself is worthy of 5 stars</li>
            <li> More info would equal 2 more stars.</li>
            <li> Never bothered since I &#x27; almost 40 thinking it would go away along with mild rosacea..</li>
            <li> This company sends quality items and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> 3rd purchase - love this, use it on my hair too :)</li>
            <li> , I was looking for a super hydrator.</li>
            <li> If you are spending more than $50.00 (high end price)</li>
            <li> I love the high quality glass bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> suitable for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> great for pimples and dark spots.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d normally give in and pick at it thinking it would look better, which is never the case.  </li>
            <li> Just as other reviewers said - most effective when used on damp skin and under moisturizer.   </li>
            <li> I bought hyaluronic acid because it is listed as being a very safe product to put on your skin, but I had no idea it is such a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I first got introduced to HA serum years ago when my retin-a prescription came with some samples of an HA serum that&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li> I use this with other natural products for a face serum and have wonderful results.</li>
            <li> THE MERCHANT WAS SO KIND ENOUGH TO REPLACE IT RIGHT AWAY!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is my new favorite when I get out of the shower I put under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> First this is how I appled the product: Apply to freshly cleansed skin, add a drop or two to palm of hand smooth over face.</li>
            <li> I have also found it&#x27;s good for patches of dry</li>
            <li> I always wash my face with a good moisturizing cream then pat dry and wait a couple of minutes before applying.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of hyaluronic acid serum and it really make me satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is a good serum for dry, aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I used the serum on damp skin and followed with a good moisturizer and water spritzer but still ended up with dry skin</li>
            <li> I first got this I was excited to have something to improve the appearance of the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Definitely I feel soooooooo much better!</li>
            <li> im ready to go....will continue to purchase!!</li>
            <li> I use daily and many times twice a day (if there will be no Sun exposure).Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I found it had been exactly one year since I had ordered the original bottles.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and hydrates very well.</li>
            <li> It is good quality and a drop goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> The first week I used the serum I was happy as my skin was so soft and smooth, however by the end of the second week</li>
            <li> Well this is full of alcohol, it&#x27;s hardly PURE as the name would suggest!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll first apply this serum over my clean face, then the softener (to seal the moist), then my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i like it because i feel my skin really nourished and fine lines almost disappear</li>
            <li> Lately, though, I have begun using it on its own after cleansing and toning, and now I love it!</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with the bottle because it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s glass, which gives it a little apothecary-type quality, but I don&#x27;t like traveling with it for fear that it&#x27;ll crack.</li>
            <li> so my skin has been very dry and for someone that used to have flawless skin, recently being diagnosed with eczema</li>
            <li> I use this after my peels.. and it really helps smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> it is no permanant miracle serum , but if used everyday the lines on my forehead are reduced and what is also great is that my skin is a lot smoother.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works so great as after these treatments and as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It glides smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I put drops on my face and neck and gentle smooth over my skin before eye cream and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this cheap but promising serum</li>
            <li> and it goes on so light and absorbs so fast.  </li>
            <li> I am also using a lot of products that are very drying, so I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement in hydration.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff especially when mixed with rose water as another reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li> It is affordable and it really helps smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL SEE AMAZING RESULTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH OILY SKIN!</li>
            <li> So far... I am a pleased buyer.</li>
            <li> actually makes my skin nice.</li>
            <li> , be absorbed; in my frustration I tended to overuse and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Experiment, and find what compliments your success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly a \\&quot;miracle in a bottle\\&quot; for many others, so it may just be my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> My vitamin E lotion stings way more than this, and it&#x27;s made for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But I acutlly looked fresh faced and capapble of facing the world after that one.</li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> and I felt it was worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I am going to give some to my mom to try out, she&#x27;s got more aging issues than I do so far....</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid is quickly absorbed into my skin and unlike what it&#x27;s name might predict, there is no burning.</li>
            <li> and I actually started noticing that somehow the skin on my face started to &amp;#34;fill out&amp;#34; and be more smooth.</li>
            <li> something I rarely do.  </li>
            <li> I use this serum daily followed by a rose water spray toner</li>
            <li> Which ingredient wins?</li>
            <li> if  any  improvement  with  my  laugh  lines.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> So, it helps and for the price I feel its worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product, makes skin soft and smooth, and it absorb into skin fast.</li>
            <li> Finally and importantly, make sure you stay hydrated, so you&#x27;re hydrating your skin from the inside AND out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth the money</li>
            <li> Two stars for not causing any damage but not doing anything useful, either.  </li>
            <li> Works great, recommended by my facial pro for my aging 70 yr old rocesea challenged skin.</li>
            <li> such a great anti-aging booster as far as wrinkles are concerned.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a misconception that it does not get absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li> But a good way to help  your skin and save money (I have spent a lot on creams and skin doctors) is to combine with the derma roller.</li>
            <li> This far the love the texture</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen wonders but my skin (already quite clear and smooth) seems to be a bit more clear, a bit more smooth.</li>
            <li> so I became curious and chose this product based on good reviews and affordable price.  </li>
            <li> My skin is better than it was when I was young</li>
            <li> Applying twice daily more at night and lightly during the day.</li>
            <li> It also greatly reduces facial lines and keeps my face young looking.</li>
            <li> and I use it before bed with a moisturizer applied after it is absorbed .  </li>
            <li> Still useful, but misleading, I think.</li>
            <li> Left  my skin so smooth and healthy looking 😬</li>
            <li> After i tried this, bought the full version (8oz bottle) which is much cheaper compared with the amount of product you get!</li>
            <li> but I know it&#x27;s because I have to incorporate a better moisterizer than the oil free tinted cream I&#x27;m currently using in the now subzero temperatures of winter.</li>
            <li> but so  far it has done what you say, i will  be ordering it agian for sure</li>
            <li> I can formulate personal products for my own use.</li>
            <li> I rarely need it to sooth a retin-a crisis...</li>
            <li> W/my 0 hazardous facial cream</li>
            <li> Far better than hydroquinone cream.</li>
            <li> Far better than hydroquinone cream.</li>
            <li> Last night, I used this product along with rose water and...</li>
            <li> and on mornings i use face wash and rose water as a toner followed by this serum and  at times a regular moisterizer.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews of this are old and out dated.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum - the cheapest, best kept skin secret...</li>
            <li> It takes about a month to see the results, but the wait is worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s helping her out with the laugh lines she has around her eyes and mouth</li>
            <li> I get many compliments about my lack of wrinkles (71 years young).  </li>
            <li> I love the dropper vial as opposed to the pump system my old brand used</li>
            <li> high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
            <li> once a week apply olive oil on my eyes instead of a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Although there have been no improvements with acne (as I saw in some reviews), but overall - I am very happy with this product, going to purchase it again and highly recommend to anyone who wants to look young.</li>
            <li> once a week apply olive oil on my eyes instead of a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Although there have been no improvements with acne (as I saw in some reviews), but overall - I am very happy with this product, going to purchase it again and highly recommend to anyone who wants to look young.</li>
            <li> I have seen better results from many other products.  </li>
            <li> It drys pretty quick</li>
            <li> As originally suspected and others have claimed, the solution I received was as gentle as tears (literally, I accidentally got some in my eye, and no irritation at all).</li>
            <li> I have other serums, this was a good value.</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle but did not see the significant result as others.</li>
            <li> Due to the mostly good reviews on here about this product, I bought it.</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time from this company, love it, high quality ingredient plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product filled up my atrophic scars from cortisone injections into keloids (in combo with derma roller), super soft baby skin, and thicker lips!</li>
            <li> every time someone uses it they order it right away.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the right product for me.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> I use right after washing and follow with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face right before using my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it should be no issues right .</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It soaks right in&lt;</li>
            <li> he said it was unnatural and there was something that didn&#x27;t feel right....</li>
            <li> he said it was unnatural and there was something that didn&#x27;t feel right....</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum with a derma roller and used both right away.</li>
            <li> id sign right up.</li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t hurt right.</li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s an endorsement right there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s right to boycott a company for any reason at all, of course.</li>
            <li> went out with not foundation on (only sunscreen cream...) and people telling me I had such a beautiful skin recently.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE this brand much better than previous one with vit c.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s with fair skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, this stuff works great, and isnt too oily which is a big deal since I have VERY oily acne-prone skin (battling it since early 20s).</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to notice a change but my skin looks AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Still not sure about how great this is, does no harm</li>
            <li> Good if you use as first layer before you put on other lotions, if you can find something that works with your skin.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve used this product alone and found that as long as I put it onto my damp face it absorbs nicely; however, I still have to put on a moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> It felt nice going on but that means nothing in the long run.</li>
            <li> It was very pricey, but I loved what it did for my skin, especially after an at home peel or microdermabrasion treatment as it really soothes my skin and speeds up recovery time.  </li>
            <li> At 3 months, I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle (yes, it lasted 3 months with twice a day use--that&#x27;s a pretty amazing value at the price) and can say my skin looks better than it has in ten years.  </li>
            <li> It certainly does!  </li>
            <li> Pure brilliance!</li>
            <li> since I have been using the pure hyaluronic  acid with skin actives restoration cream &amp; sea buckthorn oil, never even once saw an acne invading my face!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft, the like fine lines just smoothed right out. .</li>
            <li> I really like the product, it absorbs quickly and does not leave a reside on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and definitely something I now buy regularly.</li>
            <li> It just dries out your skin much like super glue or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not struggling with wrinkles just yet, but if I get a cut or scrape anywhere I will first apply a drop of this underneath some neosporin &amp; band aid and it mitigates any scrabbling or scarring and generally seems to heal more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many serums before but sommehow they were too heavy and made me break out more.</li>
            <li> I made a good choice, I&#x27;m half way thru the bottle now</li>
            <li> Within the first 2 days my skin was soft just like with the other cream, fine lines are still smoothing out, (with this one my acne breakouts are going away!), and impressive of all puffiness under my eyes is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and it really helps with wrinkles used with this Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure.  </li>
            <li> which I put this on first and then moisturizer on top (or mixed them together), it lasted all day and skin looked dewy and fresh, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Make sure if you make your own  hyaluronic + glyco-lactic serum that glyco-lactic part of this serum is NOT MORE 15% from 100% ready to use volume.</li>
            <li> Silky serum that skin just absorbs great and leaves no residue behind, just soft looking, great feeling, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> This one is very straight forward, Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid  is an ingredient that the very high priced anti-aging products brag about for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.  </li>
            <li> btw it shipped very fast too with secured box</li>
            <li> This Serum dries almost instantly and makes your skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and it is very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old and have some fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> My pores look tiny, my skin is looking very clear, and my acne scars look more filled in.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it when I bought a new product that was being advertised in [of all places Star].  </li>
            <li> This has been an excellent moisturizer, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Okay, so I started using the small jar before I bought the large one (which is more worth it)</li>
            <li> -- wow what a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It helps so much!</li>
            <li> Looking at the first ingredients in the content are the highest content in the product.  </li>
            <li> First time I  using this product...</li>
            <li> Product arrived sooner than expected and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I do use my regular moisturizer on top of this serum and still saw no improvement.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using the product, I wasn&#x27;t sold on it immediately.</li>
            <li> The first day after I started this serum</li>
            <li> I buy this regularly, and love the added moisture it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> however, I do aspire a whole dropper&#x27;s worth and use all of it</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> when it soaks into my skin I put some cream on top because I&#x27;m not totally used to not feeling cream on my face.</li>
            <li> and I want to try it some more before I totally decide whether it works or not.</li>
            <li> The first time I thought maybe it was something else making me break out, but every time I use it since then the same thing happens, so I know it&#x27;s this serum for sure.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps my sensitive/combo skin hydrated and has never broken me out!</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily after I cleanse my face and love its hydrating effect.  </li>
            <li> haha!  </li>
            <li> Will give the product more time to see results then review at a later date.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so inexpensive and really does plump up lines!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem like it was working for the first week, but now I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> was using Source Naturals Skin Eternal Hyaluronic Acid Serum before I switched to this, which I do not recommend), but I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, especially since it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE August 2012: I am still using this on my face and body -- more than a year later.  </li>
            <li> So to anyone who is skeptical that this product can help you have great skin--all I can say is TRY it!    </li>
            <li> use it day and night, will order more later</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed results the first day I used it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks God I&#x27;ve found these two!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not my first review.</li>
            <li> after cleansing my face this is the first product i layer on, then i follow with moisturizer and sun block, and</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I apply my usual moisturizer on top and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> first  couple  weeks.  </li>
            <li> It helped me so much!  </li>
            <li> I think for most people, it will make a solid difference if they aren&#x27;t using any hyaluronic acid at all, but you definitley need moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> Well worth it, very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I should also mention that I tested it on the back of my hand 24 hours before putting it on my face, since so many reviews had allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> I find that my retin-A cream and regular moisturizer absorb much better when I apply this product before hand.</li>
            <li> and it really works!  </li>
            <li> Like I first said - it takes time, consistent application, and lots of patience.  </li>
            <li> I see results instantly, however, in a couple hours I apply more because my skin takes it</li>
            <li> a.k.a googled it, and Amazon was the first search result..</li>
            <li> Pleased, would recommend to others  Darlene Hastings Southern Calif.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and the seller shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I think my face looks healthy with continued use of this product twice daily.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and I see a definite change for the better.  </li>
            <li> Put Vitamin E on first allow to absorb in and then apply Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> You just have to be consistent.</li>
            <li> consistently buy the product by Timeless.</li>
            <li> I use it first, let is sit and then layer my cream on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (If you are just starting with acids than you better to start from lower amount glyco-lactic in your serum)  </li>
            <li> I do not know what it is, but I really got used to this product, and I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I just finished my 2oz bottle, and I think I am going to reorder, but bigger version :)  </li>
            <li> oz.]]This is the first time I have used this product.  </li>
            <li> Can you be more specific !</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Actually that is a lie my skin broke out more</li>
            <li> I WILL LET YOU KNOW MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> have some fading, my family noticed it first and there is no burning or itching.  </li>
            <li> , yes it will feel a bit drying at first</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a change at first.  </li>
            <li> An absolute must have!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way it is going to plump up your aged skin unless you inject it or are young enough to believe the hype and have a great fantasy life!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Researched medical studies and decided to use this product in conjunction with derma micro needle skin roller for better penetration.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I got my first bottle of Timeless HA serum.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I go was one ounce and that lasted 5 or 6 months.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a better effect when used in conjunction with something else....</li>
            <li> So, just be aware.</li>
            <li> I applied this for the first time today and it was a diff feel, not quite water and not quite gel...</li>
            <li> It is economical and goes a long way, so I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I should have read the entire description in more detail on the website, as the ingredients are listed.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much! :-0</li>
            <li> I first used HA at night and in the morning</li>
            <li> and this was the first thing to arrive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I only paid $15.</li>
            <li> i love looking at my face in the mirror and for the first time I can walk outside without makeup and it just looks dewy and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is plumper, my acne scars (which are pretty severe) are not as visible because of the plumpness.</li>
            <li> Its pretty watery</li>
            <li> this is my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time using this product.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It helps my skin to retain moisture and somehow helps the olive oil sink in for better overall absorption of both products.</li>
            <li> So I just combine the two, the combination seems to work better than using the products individually.</li>
            <li> I note that the label says, &amp;#34;pure,&amp;#34; but the first ingredient is water.</li>
            <li> At first my skin feels a bit tacky to the touch, but that dissipates in about five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this, experimented with how to use it, and finally have hit on a magic solution.</li>
            <li> is absorbed on skin fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks Timeless Skin Care!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered this.  </li>
            <li> FIRST.</li>
            <li> The first time you ever use this product, you will feel like your face is so soft and smooth and plump.</li>
            <li> A quality hyaluronic serum should only require you use two drops I have to use more with this one.</li>
            <li> I got this product mostly because I didn&#x27;t like my how my neck was starting to look.</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> and now I am able to cover them with foundation (have been using this product only three weeks)</li>
            <li> For the first time in quite a while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay going out in public without makeup.</li>
            <li> then why is the first ingredient on the label water?</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> First I use the Vitamin C with E Ferulic Acid Serum followed by the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> I feel tingling and to me that is a good sign, my skin is heavily damage.</li>
            <li> Really good at controlling the oil and keeping my skiing firm.</li>
            <li> I have fair dry skin, and am in my early 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This goes on very well goes right into your skin</li>
            <li> - this helps me ensure I&#x27;m getting just the right amount of product vs. too much</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is in a good practical plain container, not wasting $$$ on frills.</li>
            <li> It really does absorb quickly and makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to experiment with Hyaluronic Acid and this has a very clean, simple ingredients list.</li>
            <li> Instantly firms and plumps the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to find 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid over the counter anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this stuff by putting a dropper full on my plan and then adding two droppers of my facial oil (combo of kukui nut, jojoba oil, apricot kernel oil, rose hip seed, borage seed and essential oils</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with some of their other products and I am loving the results.</li>
            <li> Good quality product!Worth the money and at least worth a try for your skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell funny, it looked pure, and I could feel it working.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, my skin seems much smoother</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the positive side first:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very reasonably priced and seems to help reduce the wrinkles and fine lines enough that I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Pretty much did nothing.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt so confident in the quality of my skin in a long time.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs so much more moisture this way than it used to with minor additional cost.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
            <li> I also use it under my makeup and it does glide on smoother and that is the true test since I&#x27;m 59 years old.</li>
            <li> This is simple, easy, works great, goes a long way and I will be using this for long time!</li>
            <li> The Timeless HLA evaporated much more quickly than my previous HLA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, easily absorbed and has made a dramatic difference with the fine (and not so fine) lines.</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff you pay 10x more for at the doctor&#x27;s office or at a high end spa where they have an RN on hand for the Botox</li>
            <li> Not so sure if I&#x27;ll be exploring other companies that sell Hyaluronic acid serums, but I know definitely it has helped with keeping my complexion healthy.</li>
            <li> I saw an instant lifting around my eyes and forehead but keep using it to get the full benefit!</li>
            <li> I also used very mild products (Cetaphil) for my face back then and nothing helped, until I added this.</li>
            <li> My Arizona dry skin is revived after just 6 weeks and looks more youthful also.  </li>
            <li> This is okay, maybe I am not using it correctly, seems to dry my face.  </li>
            <li> Great product without prescription, but be careful not to leave it too long on your face.</li>
            <li> I will gladly spend the $50 on the dermalogica because it works wonders for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I purchase this brand of HA, I have used it with my micro-current device around my neck, eyes, cheeks and face, it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, it absorbs very quickly and give me the hydration I need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that feels like a touch of cool water but is absorbed immediately as my skin drinks it in.</li>
            <li> that is 100% pure</li>
            <li> 100% Pure 2 oz.  </li>
            <li> 100% Pure 2 oz.]]</li>
            <li> The ad seems to sell 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> Ingredients    Water, Sodium Hyaluronate (1%; 100% pure), Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.    </li>
            <li> The 1% of hyaluronic acid is pure.</li>
            <li> pure serum is thicker.</li>
            <li> and I used a drop at night after washing my face (still using cetaphil) to my night moisturizer which is just a dab of pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to break outs from certain products, look at the ingredient lists and you will find one of the alcohols as an irritant (ethyl alcohol -- also known as denatured, or SD, alcohol and ethanol -- benzyl alcohol, methyl and isopropyl alcohol).&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I decided to continue buying my pure vitamin c serum and then use this after for moisture</li>

            <li> I will certainly order it again when I need to.</li>
            <li> I have heard that it works well with pure vitamin C</li>

            <li> This isn&#x27;t even pure water.(99%)</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it in its pure form.</li>
            <li> but when used by itself, in certain climates/environments, it could start to draw the moister from your skin rather than from the air</li>
            <li> Water, Sodium Hyaluronate (1%; 100% pure), Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  </li>
            <li> PURE over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> a large percentage, in fact.  </li>
            <li> Says pure hyaluronic acid...but its disguised as a trade</li>
            <li> I had three large pimples on my forehead that wouldn&#x27;t go away</li>
            <li> If this is 100% Pure Hyaluronic Serum</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine  why a large number of people have made the effort to state</li>
            <li> According  to the reviews I&#x27;ve read, this particular product doesn&#x27;t contain very much.</li>
            <li> First about me - I am a 32 year old white female blessed with oily skin plus break outs (hormonal acne) and fine lines (between my eye brows and under my eyes) in addition  :-)  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month, and I can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference, except that my skin seems to absorb this quickly and it makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product, the skin remains not only hydrated, but also slightly tightened, special attention</li>
            <li> which is what the bottle totally leads you to believe until you read the fine print).</li>
            <li> I did a proper patch test and it was fine.</li>
            <li> At age 50 I was just starting to get the beginnings of fine lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> This product dries fast on your face, much to fast and doesn&#x27;t do anything but dry my skin even more.</li>
            <li> after several weeks my skin tone started evening out, fine lines around my eyes grew softer.</li>
            <li> Does make skin peel as if light sunburn but had beautiful glowing skin that was commented on by random strangers after!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anymore what works and what doesn&#x27;t, or if i&#x27;m just blessed with some pretty decent genes, but i use this stuff every night under my night cream and get compliments on my skin all the time.  </li>
            <li> hope that this will help someone like me, who wants to take care of their skin.[[ASIN:B0047AKVW6 Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure Refill 8 oz]]</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these products but caution to read the reviews, especially on peel products such as the Glycolic Acid, so you do not damage skin and get exceptional results.</li>
            <li> My regime, now, is to use the Spray smooth on with fingertips, next the Eye Cream under the eyes and on the eyelids, then Timeless Pure over face and neck.</li>
            <li> I make all my own skin care and realized I was missing a certain level of moisturization.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m quite familiar with the benefits of hyaluronic acid -- but using it in it&#x27;s pure form is usually not an option in professional products...for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> Oh, I have very sensitive skin and have not had any issues whatsoever with this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days, so it is a little early to tell how effective hyaluronic acid is at revitalizing skin, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> you use skin care products containing hyaluronic acid, it works by absorbing available moisture from the environment and water already present in the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something else important to note, much of what I&#x27;ve read about HA serum as a daily moisturizer all over has recommended not using it alone with any regularity.</li>
            <li> For the price its a great deal and should last a few months.</li>
            <li> But I started this product and within a week of using it I noticed a huge different.  </li>
            <li> My mom has started to use it and she is noticing a HUGE different in her skin.  </li>
            <li> I think too many of us are tricked by all of the amazing fake reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone over age 50! AAA+++</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> The price of $15.95 seemed reasonable.  </li>
            <li> It really works and is cost efficient.</li>
            <li> and I really rather use the moisturizer by itself.</li>
            <li> purchased this item at Amazon and it could have come with some directions but thank goodness for the reviews because they were very helpful as to how to use this product.</li>
            <li> Now I use this serum on whole body except my face.</li>
            <li> : I noticed this morning that my skin looked so much clearer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly it really did noting for my skin</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> so this a much cheaper answer.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on my face, it felt softer, much softer to where my husband wanted to touch my face.  </li>
            <li> appear much, much smoother.  </li>
            <li> but I do know that this feels great in the morning and that it helps with my tired bags when I get up.  </li>
            <li> With threat of not having it, I found out that I am very pro this serum.  </li>
            <li> I have acne scars, redness and my skin is very oily.  </li>
            <li> I got this item fast which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what this was supposed to do for my skin...</li>
            <li> Bought the product for my mom really.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.com for having this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to anyone concerned about the health and vitality of their skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a year straight.</li>
            <li> It does help a bit with preventing wrinkles but doesn&#x27;t do much for existing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> but I really try to massage this in into wrinkle prone areas around eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it prevents breakouts and has improved my face as a whole.</li>
            <li> And the delivery was verry fast even to the Netherlands.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference yet.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I doubt that this product is the real thing for the cost and texture.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then</li>
            <li> and it really \\&quot;seals in\\</li>
            <li> After my success, I sent a bottle to my 28 year old son.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have any wrinkling (I&#x27;m 47)but</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE SEEN SOME REAL TIGHTENING OF MY NECK.</li>
            <li> So thanks to everyone who posted their reviews.  </li>
            <li> is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a real difference in the feel of my face.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;serum\\&quot; is very watery.</li>
            <li> I add it to the cream I use every day, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I think this product really works because it is really thin (slightly more viscous than water), and soaks into the skin better than a cream.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and have not seen much if any results</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin, but this moisturizes without making me break out at all.</li>
            <li> us do so much writing before it will accept</li>
            <li> I think this really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Nothing really improved after using this and didn&#x27;t make anything worsen after stopped using it,&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like This product doesn&#x27;t do much except for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> My make up goes on so much smoother now than it used to</li>
            <li> been using it twice a day for a month, zero difference, maybe I am just aging to fast this month?</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell this product did much there</li>
            <li> It really does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> really does work.</li>
            <li> My skin really broke out after using this.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing after a peel.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother, looks very shiny.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and soothing.</li>
            <li> The price for the amount is also very generous.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this and feel it works for me...</li>
            <li> fast shipping.....item as described...</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic acid plays a key role in the skin&#x27;s extracellular matrix and has been shown to maintain hydration, improve elasticity and protect against free radical damage.</li>
            <li> In the skin, hyaluronic acid is responsible for capturing water, in turn maintaining the smoothness and plumpness of the skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this works or not</li>
            <li> It gives skin a fresh young plump look.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> This product dries fast and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> It comes in fast and the product is perfection.</li>
            <li> I also do chemical peels on my legs and this helps so so much.</li>
            <li> It is softer and much smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to order it again.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid really works at giving you a bright-eyed appearance since it absorbs moisture.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for all skin types!</li>
            <li> I opened this product, tried it on and really like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this product is doing anything to my skin.  </li>
            <li> This serum is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> It is very moist on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much smoother and firmer and just appears healthier.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t say it helped with that.</li>
            <li> HA is a primary component in the synovial fluid in joints to keep joints lubricated and gliding well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a gentle product.  </li>
            <li> This is great for all skin types and will benefit acne-prone skin as well as tired and aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I had applied too much</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell much difference after using this product for a month.</li>
            <li> Very prompt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really has made a difference in tone and texture of my face.</li>
            <li> leaves the skin smooth and can be used with daily cream.</li>
            <li> For my acne the serum didn&#x27;t have much much of an effect when used alone.</li>
            <li> Next, I smooth the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li> I really works and I plan on reordering it soon.  </li>
            <li> And it really does lessen the deepness of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a real help for the woman of my age...</li>
            <li> So, I just bypassed the expense and the fragrance and went straight for results.  </li>
            <li> really cant review this...</li>
            <li> and i dont think this does much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I didnt see any change in my skin after applying for a whole week.</li>
            <li> hyaluronic is very soothing and cooling</li>
            <li> I really like to get what I pay for.</li>
            <li> Very firming without being greasy</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid really does help improve the skin - plumping effect, etc.</li>
            <li> I think it has really helped my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Using it has made my skin so soft, and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> and my face looks much smother and softer.</li>
            <li> but my friends can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them my real age.</li>
            <li> it really did.  </li>
            <li> I really like the serum....</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really gentle on my skin &amp; even around my eye area, when almost nothing else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really gentle on my skin &amp; even around my eye area, when almost nothing else</li>
            <li> This does work really well.  </li>
            <li> I just really dont know what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> But I did not see much effect</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> so I know not to expect much.</li>
            <li> really do like this serum.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, its the pores on my face</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Only been using it for 5 days now and my skin looks more clear and even.</li>
            <li> Apply facial moisturizer directly over top.</li>
            <li> have regular facials (I love professional</li>
            <li> have regular facials (I love professional</li>
            <li> OMG, it immediately took away the pain, the next morning no blistering, no freckles, no red, it was a nice even tan.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I expected a miracle product but what I did notice was good enough to keep me using the rest of the product</li>
            <li> Fresh out of the shower in the morning, put on a dropper of this along with my daily moisturizer and let that be absorbed into my face, neck and breast area.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft, plumped, and white head free!  </li>
            <li> OMG, I ordered this because of the high positive reviews but this stuff broke me out that made my face looks like a pizza face.</li>
            <li> This product glides right on and completely immerses into my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly to help even out my complexion and for general improvement as I don&#x27;t do much special for my skin.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are not erased, or anything like that so far...but the smooth and natural glow tones down fine lines for me.</li>
            <li> Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using Retin-A for my acne prone skin and hyaluronic acid has allowed for my skin to better absorb my moisturizer and replenish itself, thus preventing it from flaking due to the dryness the medication causes.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad that I did and for amazon having the feature at the end of the page showing what other customers purchased.</li>
            <li> It works better than my other serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from my clarisonic, this has given me the most improvement over all other skin products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great value and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It locks in the moisture and has a significant smoothing effect, though a tiny dab of moisturizer is still needed!</li>
            <li> I then would apply my other face creams on top.  </li>
            <li> I have tried some of the other brands but feel this one gives me the most bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> it goes on feeling a little slimy but it dries quick and fills in all your fine lines</li>
            <li> I see no change using this serum, other than giving my face a bit more color.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my chest, and it seems to have helped keeping it hydrated, but I don&#x27;t see a significant difference using this product overall.</li>
            <li> Great price for 8 bottles, I use very little in making homemade facial and body serums.  </li>
            <li> I have one very rough scaly patch that I am using more on</li>
            <li> Now my dark spots are very light color</li>
            <li> I apply it to clean skin and then apply a moisturizer immediately following.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because I know many people have great results with it.</li>
            <li> Use it twice a day with a clean skin for about 2 months to notice the big difference.</li>
            <li> This latest purchase was a gift to a friend who&#x27;s getting ready for her wedding and is undergoing intense skin care prior to the big day.</li>
            <li> The price point cannot be beat and there is almost always a special if you purchase multiple items.  </li>
            <li> really only 1% hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Other high end products cost a lot more, and tend to leave a film on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really make a Huge difference  in Mt dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry &amp; sensitive skin and most moisturizers made me break out, but this thing makes your skin moisturized without causing break out.</li>
            <li> Remember, FOR SURE, LET IT COME TO A COMPLETE DRY.  </li>
            <li> When my skin is feeling dry, especially in the winter, I would get out of the shower, apply my own mix of 50% jojoba oil and 50% apricot kernel oil.</li>
            <li> It works great for my oily skin to balance out my skin tone and keep me freshly hydrated without any film left behind</li>
            <li> will continue to use this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer and want to let everyone know that I am definitely a PRO!  </li>
            <li> I have no qualms with it being 1%, after all, I bought it because I was too lazy to mix my own.</li>
            <li> However, the name really sounds more harsh then it really is; it didnt burn nor did it tingle when I used it.</li>
            <li> It okay, but not easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li> I used to feel naked without a full face of makeup, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it leaves kind a kind-of sticky film on my face, which seems like it takes forever to dry!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it takes a little while to really notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Cant live without it!  </li>
            <li> But I shall now spend the same amount for pure powder, mix my own (without the alcohol and fungicide), and make enough to last a whole lot longer than these 2 ounces.</li>
            <li> the lady who looked at my skin couldn&#x27;t believe how much my skin had improved (I had not told her I had been using a new product).</li>
            <li> apply 50% glycolic peel...rinse with baking soda water and apply hyaluronic serum immed after PATTING face dry to retain the moisture...then apply a light application of Bio Oil...</li>
            <li> More or less meh....</li>
            <li> My previous one had more gel consistency.</li>
            <li> Works great.ing &amp; my hair is silky, shiny &amp; has less static.</li>
            <li> Question i have is, after the bottle is about half way empty I noticed the clear acid turning more and more yellow?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I want to be less prominent.</li>
            <li> This serum, used daily, will give you soft, smooth, even-toned skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used this particular brand of this product for a couple of years</li>
            <li> I should mention that my skin is pretty much normal to oily, clear with zero breakouts</li>
            <li> have two older Brothers and they do look the age.  </li>
            <li> After I was my face with Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel (removes skin buildup and clears up acne), I place a warm wet washcloth on my face to hydrate my face, then apply the Hyaluronic Acid Serum mixed together with my moisturizing lotion (CereVa Renewing Lotion).  </li>
            <li> It seems to work better than some more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Ladies, do yourself a favor more expensive isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> Most of the research I&#x27;ve done on HA has suggested applying it all over your face underneath your regular moisturizer to fight wrinkles and such.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends HA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this particular product from Timeless Skin Care for over a year and recommend it to my daughter and friends.  </li>
            <li> Super hydrating and at a low price...</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and you can put regular moisturizer/make up over.  </li>
            <li> My package arrived quickly and I tried it the same evening on my hands.</li>
            <li> I will say that it makes your skin very soft though!</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and supple and looks plumper by the day!</li>
            <li> High quality</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high-quality hyaluronic acid serum would highly recommend Timeless Skin Care.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend as I&#x27;ve commented before.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Timeless Skin Care.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to see highly moisturized, dewy skin after using it, but it isn&#x27;t doing that.</li>
            <li> I am 48 and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this with a high grade olive oil and add a couple of drops to the oil, mix it in the palm of my hand, and apply to my damp face.</li>
            <li> (I asked him)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> after all the reviews I had high hopes, so I will continue to use this until it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this product and will continue to use it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are so many really positive reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to post any results,  but I like the product and would recommend it since it is 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I did know that when there was a little bit in the bottle that I was going to order more.  </li>
            <li> Add a little of this serum to your favorite moisturizer and watch the transformation.</li>
            <li> but Im going to keep looking for something that suits my skin a little better.</li>
            <li> There is no other product out there that I&#x27;m aware of that</li>
            <li> Have since found that this serum doesn&#x27;t reduce wrinkles, just provides a little more moisture.</li>
            <li> Now I just need a miracle cure for all those little lines and wrinkles :)</li>
            <li> and this is definitely helping my face look clean, young</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for anyone who needs moisture in their skin care regimen, but wants one that keeps their face clear.</li>
            <li> your spending far too much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine this will completely disappear the pockmarks, but I think it has given my skin the hydration it was really looking for, which helps my skin</li>
            <li> my skins real sensitive</li>
            <li> It dries clear, matte, and very lightweight, it does not have a smell, it doesn&#x27;t burn, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup.</li>
            <li> It really makes your hands look young.  </li>
            <li> So, here&#x27;s how I recommend using it (since there are no instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with clean, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell much difference so far but will give it a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> stuff is gentle directly on my skin &amp; has not caused dryness or burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think that this products would work on someone who has normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and so it was probably just sitting on top of a dead skin layer.</li>
            <li> It is  much more affordable, which makes it very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually mix both products together so that it lasts longer and is effective.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Where I would normally have to put on moisturizer in the morning and again at noon,</li>
            <li> But after a few days the irritation went away and I immediately noticed a more toned appearance.</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the negative reviews of this product, however in my own hast</li>
            <li> Will update more after few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My skin was &#x27;normal&#x27; with no problems before this serum.</li>
            <li> So to say normally I use:  </li>
            <li> so I need to use a moisturizer and sunscreen over that normally.</li>
            <li> Not too sure what the recommended application procedure is - I just put on my normal face cream and then blend in a few drops of hyaluronic acid morning and night.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it got such good reviews from others.</li>
            <li> I thought what is point of it then, I can just use my normal routine for that.</li>
            <li> Applied my oils like normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my face just felt all blocked up, my skin felt heavy, and it seems my wrinkles are more defined than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> so I cannot review it&#x27;s efficacy, but I will be sure to update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I also made a homemade facial scrub using natural honey from fair trade and sugar and put a few drops of the product in that as well.</li>
            <li> I live in the high desert of Albuquerque, NM.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this process has worked better than any other products on the market!  </li>
            <li> I also realize that by not being injected , the likelihood of this product actually working is minimal, but it&#x27;s a nice clear serum , free of other ingredients.</li>
            <li> This only worked OK because I would let it dry on my face before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad that I didn&#x27;t figure this out sooner because I could have saved so much money on everything I&#x27;ve tried and also had happier more confident days without breakouts.</li>
            <li> I read one of the reviews that said the product came without instructions, and several other negative remarks, but it did seem to be the best value, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This takes less than a full dropper, but be sure and LET IT COME TO A COMPLETE DRY before putting on your foundation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve acutally stopped using moisturizer altogether and simply put the hyaluronic acid on RIGHT after I get out of the shower in the morning, to retain the moisture from the steamy shower.</li>
            <li> I will order more to get the full effect of using it everyday after clearing away dead skin by using my mask first.  </li>
            <li> Gentle but effective facial moisturizer keeps my skin soft and firm would recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> /&gt;**update**&lt;br /&gt;Since my initial review I have been using this serum twice daily under moisturizer for puffiness under my eyes &amp; some fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid is pure moisture and the major moisturizing ingredient in all moisturizers.</li>
            <li> The other plus to this product is the price 14.95 for two ounces and free shipping.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine a Dermatologist recommend Na-Pca years ago, and I live by it.</li>
            <li> (I live in SoCal,</li>
            <li> if you are new to acid products, start with a 35% glycolic peel.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m assuming there was a new batch of this stuff that had to be made.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks after a couple months of using my new serum.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> If this marketeer thinks she can change the definition of the word \\&quot;pure\\&quot;, why doesn&#x27;t she supply her new definition?</li>
            <li> new acne cure is Aloe vera juice, derma roller and this serum twice a day.</li>
            <li> and I have a new doctor.</li>
            <li> In 3 days I had a new face.</li>
            <li> But my complexion is clearer and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> Cosmedica&#x27;s HA serum is much more thick and timeless is more watered down</li>
            <li> Cosmedica&#x27;s HA serum is much more thick and timeless is more watered down</li>
            <li> I live in the South and drove convertibles year round most of my adult life.</li>
            <li> I apply it on a clean , wet face, let it absorb, &amp;then put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Made ZERO difference on my skin, which is neither more or less vibrant, neither more or less wrinkled, and neither better nor worse skin than when I started it out with.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and I&#x27;ve really noticed improvement in tiny lines and overall smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear, my makeup goes on and stays on better, I haven&#x27;t struggled with dry skin this winter,  and I will definitely continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li> It really helps to heal any acne scars &amp; put close enough to the under-eye area, really helps keep the moisture there and stops my eyes from being saggy and tired-looking.</li>
            <li> I love it because it is not greasy or thick like a lot of lotions for dry skin, it is so light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this bottle here with a simple facial cream instead of the one I had previously been using to see if it works as good &amp; to my surprise</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive and reactive to new product</li>
            <li> and this product has accomplished what no other product has ever done</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was experiencing dryness and redness before using this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> and my skin has responded well to it.i have very sensitive skin prone to acne and marks....</li>
            <li> responded well to email inquiries and was very professional.</li>
            <li> I had no reaction even with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I started to worry to use it since I have very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have not yet been able to figure out the long term effects as I have not been using it for very long</li>
            <li> I repeated this once daily in the morning for one week, after day two my skin started becoming EXTREMELY dry.</li>
            <li> I do not consider any product that list 4 ingredients to be 100%  pure, particularly when it only contains 1% of the product advertised,  Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Timeless.</li>
            <li> makes my skin very soft and it makes my fine lines a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; getting compliments for the clear skin!</li>
            <li> love the feel of it, but not sure if it did anything..</li>
            <li> That very same day, I received 3 compliments on how well-rested I looked and what pretty skin I had.....</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> the first time i didnt use a moisturizer and the second time i did...</li>
            <li> --you can see this buyer reviews: initially starting out great, and then all of the sudden you get a bunch of negative ones.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll post more later if I notice any issues or extreme improvement.    </li>
            <li> so with that, this product does what it says it&#x27;s does (for me, so far, anyway!)</li>
            <li> You barely use a drop and it really works.  </li>
            <li> Between this and daily exfoliating and moisturizing, I do pretty well.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve recently had Santa Ana winds and this product has really been put to the test!  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles go away ( not completely), face look  fresh.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time that a product makes an actual difference.  </li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;M SURPRISED at how these two could combine!  </li>
            <li> , I have normal, olive toned skin with sun damage and early signs of aging...</li>
            <li> and wow my skin glows like the skin of my youth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medical student, which leads to two things: bags under your eyes from lack of sleep and too much caffeine, and a bit of insight into stuff like hyaluronic acid!  </li>
            <li> Even the fine wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> So far I like it!  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have ordered a larger bottle the first time.  </li>
            <li> , that is saying something for a 47 year old!</li>
            <li> Fine lines and wrinkles are a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> usually don&#x27;t give five stars on many beauty products, but this one is an exception.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was my skin looks smoother and pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> Talk about soft skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product under my moisturizer and my skin seems exactly the same when I don&#x27;t apply the serum.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s early 20&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look so plump and soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok, not sure if I will be a retun buyer, I didn&#x27;t feel a difference between using it and not using it.</li>
            <li> you will notice a change from first week, but big change after a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You might be surprised!</li>
            <li> The first place I put it was on my eyelids, as they&#x27;re starting to droop.</li>
            <li> I gave what was left of my bottle to a friend at work who was interested in using a HA product (I warned her about my breakout).</li>
            <li> Had adult acne prone skin with bumps!</li>
            <li> Bonus, my skin has become soft, supple &amp; the bumps disappeared!</li>
            <li> Water is the First Ingredient, then only  1%  Sodium Hyaluronate , plus 2 addtional additives.  </li>
            <li> Even without prepping my skin with the microneedling (as suggested on other skin care sites), it works with clean skin, still moist from shower or washing...</li>
            <li> getting compliments on my skin, and the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently is start using Hyaluronic Acid (initially the cream made of this &amp; now the serum with my own facial</li>
            <li> I have tried others and with all due respect, not only is this product more clearly helping your skin and wrinkles...  </li>
            <li> Until I came across this serum I had tried many other product that were supposed to make me look like an 18 year old girl when I wake up next morning</li>
            <li> my skin is rrrrrreally sensitive, so I am always leery of new products.</li>
            <li> (I have a new empathy for people with sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidence?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about two weeks now and my skin seems to be brighter and soft as a new borns.</li>
            <li> Maybe when I&#x27;m older I will go through it more quickly but for now it&#x27;s the least expensive (and most valuable) item in my skin toolbox.</li>
            <li> I love this pure serum and have used it faithfully for the past 3 years underneath my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been mixing it with other lotions and creams, and I didn&#x27;t notice anything special.</li>
            <li> However, I have very sensitive, adult acne prone skin</li>
            <li> im on my second bottle and have seen positive changes in my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hence, I started reading extensive reviews, watching Utube for suggestions( i.e. this is where I learned that the Monistat Chafting gel has the same ingredients as Sephora&#x27;s primer (is actually better with less additives), etc., and started purchasing Amazon products that are extremely cost effective and in some cases the same product used when I had professional treatment, i.e. 35% Glycolic Acid, Emu oil, Argan Oil, Squalane, Hyaluronic Acid. etc.</li>
            <li> and my skin is so sensitive, this usually never burns or anything when using).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think my lines look less obvious (more \\&quot;shallow\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I bought the hyaluronic acid serum to see if it could be absorbed through the skin to improve the appearance of my thin and easily bruised skin.</li>
            <li> I found it to give me mild breakouts if I use it without following it up with my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it necessarily aided in hydration, but it really helped clear up my skin!</li>
            <li> your money and invest in Image Skin care Ageless Total Pure Hyaluronic Filler</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of you pure hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li> I put this on and 15 min later I put on pure organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Turns out that the 100% PURE hyaluronic acid is only 1 % of this product.  </li>
            <li> This goes on silky smooth and so far has provided added moisture to my skin, my face doesn&#x27;t feel quite as tight this winter.</li>
            <li> &amp; I believe this product certainly helps me keep my younger appearance.</li>
            <li> If you plan on putting foundation on, put more moisturizer on prior to your foundation, otherwise the hyaluronic acid may make the foundation pil slightly (but only if you use too much hyaluronic acid).  </li>
            <li> I always thought acid was harsh, but this is actually very nice and soothing, a tiny tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually pretty quick to react to new products (at least it seems to).  </li>
            <li> Early days yet, as only used for one week, but certainly shows promise as lines appear softened and makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> While it slightly improved moisture on my hand, it did not compare to the moisture level from my original HLA.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I put a little dab along the top edge of my upper lip</li>
            <li> Since i&#x27;ve used this, i&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is softer and more supple looking and hardly ever any blackheads.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and moisturized and not oily at all (which is hard to find when you have combo/oily skin), and the lines around my eyes are much softer.</li>
            <li> I bought this initially in the winter because, where I live, it is SUPER dry and freezing and windy.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid is the secret treasure to amazing skin.</li>
            <li> Let me clear things up because the seller challenged my review.  </li>
            <li> it also helps my sking look clear.</li>
            <li> Plus the bottle came in a clear plastic box with no label.</li>
            <li> This product is clear, and I mix it with my night time routine creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear thickish liquid.  </li>
            <li> I started to see the clear skin come out.  </li>
            <li> It was like I had 3 layers of congestion and it took 2 months to clear up.  </li>
            <li> and I have 50 year old men asking me out.</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old and people stop and ask me what I have done to my skin</li>
            <li> I am looking for a serum that will sink the ingredients into the skin and keep the skin soft.  </li>
            <li> So far, I like the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a week now and can not see much difference from my regular moisturizer (I use a non greasy moisturizer).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have been using it for over 6 months nightly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with eczema</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin, which I&#x27;ve had since my teens and still had well into my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair and body  so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I was astonished to see that my old acne blemishes had faded considerably and my newer ones had diminished.  </li>
            <li> It felt moist and soft.  </li>
            <li> My old acne scars had lightened dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this is what all those really pricing under eye serums are actually made of...</li>
            <li> as well as professional facials.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been sensitive so that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li> Nothing else has helped my sensitive and upset, unruly skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> so def dont use if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin too</li>
            <li> Soft, lines have improved...</li>
            <li> and I have to say my skin is so soft after.</li>
            <li> So much so, that even on an open wound (shaving cut)</li>
            <li> so far I have not notice any difference</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, and my breakouts have stopped completely.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s used as a preservative in cosmetics but is one of the alcohols you should avoid if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They would help minimize the appearance but could take days to go away completely</li>
            <li> you can feel in moments the soft moist skin as soon as you rub it on.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face really soft, but I have not noticed anything else.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to mention that because many people do not use moisturizers with Hyaluronic Acid and thus fail to get the proper results.</li>
            <li> serious\\&quot; about my skin care and completely switched up my regime...</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference in my skin, it did hydrate my skin very well but for some reason it caused me to have tiny bumps along the sides of my mouth and jawline.</li>
            <li> Let me say I do not have sensitive skin at all, however by day 4</li>
            <li> I had hundreds of tiny zits covering my whole face.</li>
            <li> makes no noticeable difference on my acne (which i was really hoping for), but the overall texture of skin has dramatically improved.</li>
            <li> I am another person with sensitive skin who found the Benzylalcohol ingredient to be an issue.</li>
            <li> ( I am a 47yr old with acne...</li>
            <li> wow, I also have oily skin so no wrinkles or lines)</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> I was sitting in a connective tissue lecture, and heard that hyaluronic acid (which is naturally produced by connective tissue) can bind to tons of water.  </li>
            <li> Natural oils keep skin hydrated</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really notice any extra &amp;#34;plumpness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I did read several reviews about it where it has no instructions but the side panel does have the instructions and really this is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> You really need only a drop on each area you are going to apply it to.</li>
            <li> So far, I rate this a 4-star.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li> And it now has a moisture, natural look to it.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it just under a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and have not suffered any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> I thought I was just getting old</li>
            <li> Some women are blessed with young looking skin but not me, so I started fighting the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> and it seems so far to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> , I am 55 years old....</li>
            <li> So far I m waiting to see a difference</li>
            <li> This process keeps my face glowing and soft.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my face, including near the eye.  </li>
            <li> I believe that this product works really well from the outside.</li>
            <li> Its MUCH MUCH cheaper than buy a premixed product from different manufacturers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it straight and mixed with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my skin did a complete turn around in 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> I wrote to Timeless and their response was a bit sarcastic.</li>
            <li> In the time it took to finish the bottle they were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> people comment how I look like I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s all of the time.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this instead of the dermalogica to save money but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> IT WAS SOFT,</li>
            <li> Not for even remotely sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could just be water inside as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I am ready to repurchase, but will likely look for another brand.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft now I use with the Argon oil</li>
            <li> and I nearly fainted.</li>
            <li> have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is naturally occurring in our skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed so far and will update again soon........</li>
            <li> but my skin feels soft w/this HA stuff.</li>
            <li> but by far I am not changing the rating as timeless</li>
            <li> but by far I am not changing the rating as timeless</li>
            <li> To early to tell if it give my smoother skin or not we will see.  </li>
            <li> It does appear to make my skin smoother but again to early to tell</li>
            <li> After applying it my skin feels a bit tightened but after a while it is really soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps it soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li> I use this with the Vitamin C Serum and have noticed a big change in the texture of my skin-it is much smoother than before.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> It has completely changed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the version with vitamin C, in my experience so far.</li>
            <li> Beware buyers, if you have sensitive skin, think twice before even trying this on your face.</li>
            <li> I have been battling adult acne for four years</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin and am in my early thirties.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and does not cause problems with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have adult onset acne, so this helps.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this company.  </li>
            <li> Always on the look-out for products that are natural based that work.  </li>
            <li> Plumps up the skin and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li> As far as adding moisture...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say and lines look the same.</li>
            <li> I am 77 years old.</li>
            <li> So I decided not to put it directly on my skin (the hyaluronic acid) and instead drop it onto the cotton that had the witch hazel toner, and decided to spread over my skin that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is not greasy on my sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Will recommend this product to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so it is not like the product is getting old and turns</li>
            <li> My 30 year old niece thinks it does.</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that I don&#x27;t seem to be wearing as much makeup lately - it just doesn&#x27;t seem necessary as my complexion is so much better.</li>
            <li> So far (2 weeks)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t knock my socks off like my old serum did, which approached mythical &amp;#34;miracle in a bottle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , but it does the job very well, at a fraction of the cost, so I&#x27;ll definitely reorder it when I run out.</li>
            <li> w/a few drops of your favorite facial oil like jojoba, argan, rosehip, etc.</li>
            <li> I definitely love using this serum with my everyday facial lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use mineral makeup and most moisturizers make it go on too thick and cakey.</li>
            <li> It gets raves Zollverein the Internet but its just something good to put on your skin when your bored with everything else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight, even though you would think it would since there has been a significant decrease in pore size.</li>
            <li> I applied it to the back of my left hand and none to my right hand to see what effect it had....</li>
            <li> I always put a dropper-full of this with my regular facial moisturizer and apply right after washing my face.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin and the peel is hydrated and peeled nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little while now, and I have to say I do see significant improvements in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Its a great price to and a little goes a long long way!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I did have a very minor break out from this the first week I used it.  </li>
            <li> The seller has pointed out that \\&quot;A concentration higher than 1% will tend to dry out the skin unless additional moisture is added.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Good used every other day under all other face products be careful in sun</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it especially if you use natural products.</li>
            <li> I saw at least one review on here saying that the product is as gentle to the skin as water and that&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it pretty regularly since Nov., and have definitely noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the second purchase of this particular product.</li>
            <li> , if you are lucky and you get it, they have a reputation of charging your credit and not sending the products, it is not authentic hyaluronic acid serum, I have used skinceuticals from the dermatologist hyaluronic acid for years, thought I would save some money and buy this, my skin got so irritated had to go to the dermatologist and get some hydrocortisone cream to calm down the redness, the doctor said the timeless skin care hyaluronic acid was a cheap imitation and causing my skin to breakout,</li>
            <li> Too early to see any major differences.</li>
            <li> This is as good if not better than more expensive products!</li>
            <li> This is the first time in four years I did not suffer a single break out!</li>
            <li> With my conditioner, I have gotten the same results I get from my high priced leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, oh, and I also use it on the back of my hands at bedtime.</li>
            <li> skin has been peeling because I have been using a sulfur mask daily (for acne, highly recommended).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So, I highly recommend all of the above.  </li>
            <li> bottle easily will last me a few months.</li>
            <li> I would love someone to prove me different, but I haven&#x27;t seen any results for my dry skin even when I pair it with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> first couple days I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work for me as it was drying my skin out pretty badly.</li>
            <li> not even sure if the product is what it is - not good at all</li>
            <li> my skin already better now, only a few acne marks that left,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that my face will go back to normal.</li>
            <li> My doctor told me that he couldn&#x27;t do anything for me because he would normally prescribe a topical steroid for eczema.  </li>
            <li> Expected much higher concentration of HA.</li>
            <li> A true waste of money.</li>
            <li> I usually never use facial cream moisturizers as pretty much all of them are too heavy for my skin and irritate/make it greasy</li>
            <li> (I have normal to dry skin &amp; live in an arrid climate.)</li>
            <li> A few drops mixed in with my moisturizer plumps up fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this, but I&#x27;m 50+, had a crease between my eyebrows that&#x27;s literally almost gone now, my fine wrinkles are barely perceptable, and my neck area looks to be tighter.  </li>
            <li> Jan 20--I live in the same city this was shipped from.</li>
            <li> So my new plan - is the hyaluronic serum in the morning and Retinol Anti-Wrinkle Facial Serum in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> So my new plan - is the hyaluronic serum in the morning and Retinol Anti-Wrinkle Facial Serum in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> After only 3 days of trying this new regimen for my skin.  </li>
            <li> With my last order of December 18, 2012, I added a new product from Timeless.  </li>
            <li> product isn&#x27;t bad necessarily and the price point makes it incredibly affordable.</li>
            <li> i dont notice much a difference in a bad way or good.</li>
            <li> Of course then my whole skin is dry</li>
            <li> My skin gets extremely dry, but this has made winter so much easier.</li>
            <li> The itchiness lasted the whole day and was only helped by extra moisturizing during the day w/ coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I really feel my face is getting back alot of the youthful glow that I had lost over the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> this works very well, my skin is visibly looking younger and prettier over the last couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I did get one minor red bump for the first couple of days but nothing since then.</li>
            <li> and it is absorbed quickly into my skin, but I don&#x27;t see any dramatic results.</li>
            <li> that I know what I am using (natural facial creams from Aubrey) than chemicals that burn my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and so far have seen a marked improvement in my skin tone and firmness.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t seem to get the hydration that I expected from it and thought maybe I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way - 4 drops EASILY</li>
            <li> This product is like dropping water on my face, every drop runs right down my cheek.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely not for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing but very dry feeling skin, just as if you were to apply nothing but pure water to your face.  </li>
            <li> Either that, or there is some major placebo effect going on here...  </li>
            <li> you can barely feel it on your face!</li>
            <li> I used only a drop as first on each hand (back only) and then my forehead.  </li>
            <li> and I have some major acne scaring that seems to look &amp;#34;not as bad&amp;#34; since using this serum.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any major changes to my skin since I started using this about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> , what else...haven&#x27;t had any allergic reactions (but I am not an allergic to anything), no irritation, no rush, no other side effects either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although, I have not noticed any major changes in wrinkles, my skin looks healthier and I do not break out as often.</li>
            <li> but it works better than some more expensive moisturizers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> major improvments anywhere else,</li>
            <li> Please be aware that hyaluronic acid is to be used with other items, namely moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Also, not sure if it is making skin more dry or not as it is winter-time her in the the mid-west which is drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> It really hydrated my dry peeling skin well!</li>
            <li> only.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned putting this in conditioner &amp; it leaving her hair soft, so I added a few drops to a spray bottle with some leave in conditioning treatment &amp; spray that on before blow drying &amp; my hair is silky, shiny &amp; has less static.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other brands and for some reason this one is better.</li>
            <li> Need to use this product a little longer to see if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a long time, came highly recommended by my doctor of 13  years.</li>
            <li> Keep the serum clean by not touching the eyedropper directly - drop the fluid on your fingers to use.</li>
            <li> I feel better about myself already because I&#x27;m not ashamed to look at my face in the mirror, because it looks smooth now, and I don&#x27;t just see lots of pores and little pockmarks from years of troubled skin and picking at my face.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased over an over due to positive results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so very concentrated and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It has made my acne prone skin amazingly clear except for the occasional hormonal breakout.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problem skin: sensitive and T-zone oily at the same time with breakouts at that time of the month....</li>
            <li> For the record, I&#x27;m a 46 year old male.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO bottom line, use only if you do NOT have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i had to go to a dermatologist so the price i a paid was the most expensive customers do something with this  money factory cause they only wants to sell ando</li>
            <li> Now I can barely see them.</li>
            <li> I use it with a couple of drops of essential oil and it helps my mature skin not to sag or wrinkle.</li>
            <li> and I see considerable improvement in skin texture, skin tone and overall appearance.  </li>
            <li> Tried a more expensive one after first buying this thinking it would do a better job, but I was certainly wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have used this twice daily for two months and can tell a marked difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I just turned 69 and people guess my age at early to middle 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the morning mixed with my moisturizer and apply it directly to my problem areas in the evening.</li>
            <li> Wow is my initial reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a cream with Hyaluronic acid in it and</li>
            <li> During the day I wear natural sunscreen from Aubrey over this &amp; at night I mix a couple drops in with my facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I rub a drop on my shoulders after drying off when getting out of the shower and it has completely cleared up my back acne.</li>
            <li> , I am young but I feel like my skin looks even younger now</li>
            <li> so you might not feel it&#x27;s soft enough or plumps.</li>
            <li> I gave two stars only because it does contain natural ingredients and does not make me breakout.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate it properly but my face feels great after using it, will continue use of it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin as well as numerous allergies.</li>
            <li> what this product actually is, is surely feels worse than alcohol.</li>
            <li> My face and neck looks to be clearing now and the few laugh lines I had are softening as well while my forehead furrows are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of no propylen glycol or other annoying preservatives that most products have in them , so I use this, realizing there is nothing miraculous going to happen, but also realizing it cant hurt!</li>
            <li> It moistens the skin like water, and then quickly dries up like pure water, leaving behind...</li>
            <li> so I brang the access down to my neck area and after a few hours gone by, I forgot about it and started touching my neck (which I do alot at the computer area)</li>
            <li> If you are needing mega moisture for dry skin I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Pat on a small amount (I use it all over my face, including my eye area, neck and decollete), give it about ten seconds to dry, then top with moisturizer of your choice.</li>
            <li> the older you get, you loose elasticity, your skin get dehydrated</li>
            <li> Sometimes some products you put on seems too sticky or leaves a heavy feeling on your face, well when combining with this acid, your face will instant starts to absorb your other cream faster and most time leaving your face feel unsticky.</li>
            <li> I do consume 100 ounces of water a day ( a necessity for an active adult in the Mile high city)</li>
            <li> after it dries it&#x27;s not oily and it doesn&#x27;t dry your face, but you have to use it with your normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Usually you have to use a reallllly good moisturizer after such treatments because the skin is extremely dry, tight, and temporarily injured.</li>
            <li> And comparing to other brands I really don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then other brands by far&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took a little over a month to see results, but i can see my skin getting better everyday.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps my skin retain moisture, and I am an active outdoor person age 58.  </li>
            <li> I use it on all my normal to dry skin clients and they feel the difference too!</li>
            <li> results - if used properly - provide me the same results as professional treatment.</li>
            <li> I have spent sooo much money on facial products i cant believe it.  </li>
            <li> is likely to run out in 4-6 months, with frequent use; you do not need allot of it for each daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old male, workout daily and is attempting to keep off the visible years of aging.</li>
            <li> even on open scraps or burns it helps soothe it without irritating it,i love it.</li>
            <li> either jojoba oil or argon and my face does not dry out at all.</li>
            <li> skin is not dry or oily when i use it.</li>
            <li> I had heard that it was a large molecule that was not easily absorbed....</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> That was a major red flag</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m assuming he had a little too much sun?!</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for something that would repair my dry skin</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it and have high hopes it will help keep my skin from looking aged  Price</li>
            <li> Generally - I woud receommend it, and I will definitely reorder it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, using this in conjunction with my sunscreen and other products IS the key, and my skin has NOT broken out...which IS a miracle...</li>
            <li> For those for whom it worked, or said they received drying or irritation, obviously got a different batch/solution which actually had a much much higher concentration of Hyaluronic Acid, or some other ingredients (alcohol, etc?)...  </li>
            <li> When was attemping to open the product from their box it was a apparent</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in my skin after the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> i am now very skeptical good reviews given</li>
            <li> plus,  when I looked at my previous orders of the Spray and Pure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very watered down</li>
            <li> No more pimples, and even better, dark spots gradually go away!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have noticed that the price fluctuates and has gone up a little since I first purchased it last year.</li>
            <li> By morning my face does feel soft, but by afternoon it just feels dry &amp; almost itchy sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have had dry patches on my face,  once I started using this my skin is soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> You will see a reduction in dry skin and young wrinkles.</li>
            <li> TWICE AS MUCH FOR LESS MONEY.</li>
            <li> My neck and face look much healthier, less &#x27;droop.&#x27;</li>
            <li> At least there are no bad side effects and I&#x27;ll try it on my next cut or burn to see if it does help healing.</li>
            <li> For the past week, I have been using a few drops of it mixed with my moisturizer and it made a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> the other brand I normally use.</li>
            <li> Just give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used it on my rough dry elbows and knees and they have much improved.</li>
            <li> so total 4-5 months depending how much you use (I use about a half of the dropper).</li>
            <li> so total 4-5 months depending how much you use (I use about a half of the dropper).</li>
            <li> My skin has been much clearer than it typically was prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> Made my skin a bit tight and really noticed no difference at all with its use.</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure hyaluronic acid, but I have not seen any difference after using this product for about a few months now.  </li>
            <li> The Quick Red Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Brown Dog!</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend it to anyone with dry skin and for mature skin to rehydrate skin back to its luscious younger self.</li>
            <li> so you have to learn a little bit of a conservative technique for those of us used to slatering on as much moisturizer as we can get.</li>
            <li> So this proves a little goes a long way!!!  </li>
            <li> The serum really sucked all of the moisture out of my skin and left me looking a little dessicated.  </li>
            <li> BTW - I am in my 40s, have dry skin, and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> next two nights, same routing b/c of long days and general tiredness...</li>
            <li> A few drops (4 to be exact) goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, unfortunately I&#x27;ve had a red bumpy rash all over my face for the last 3 days.....</li>
            <li> I smooth half a dropper of it in damp hair and then style as usual.</li>
            <li> rub it in gently and let it dry down....</li>
            <li> my skin looks dewy and fresh, and the slight lines I was starting to see around my almost thirty eyes are much less noticible.</li>
            <li> I was told just the other day I looked like I was in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I used it on a nearly everyday/every other day basis, it lasted well over 6 months.</li>
            <li> I purged my skin for over a year using nothing but natural products due to all the harmful stuff I was used to using.</li>
            <li> very concentrated, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple product and lasts a long time since you only need 2-3 drops to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> It may contain 100% pure HA but contains very little of it.  </li>
            <li> i rubbed the serum in a thin layer over my face, when it dried I applied a regular anti-aging serum (which is light and sprays on, usually I never break out with this</li>
            <li> Approaching the big 50 in a few years and live in a desert.  </li>
            <li> Didnt do the much and I usually use it after a deep skin peel.</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with my Benzoyl Peroxide Gel to keep me from drying out too much and from getting a chalky white face look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A cosmetic surgeon reccomended HA, especially for my upper chest which has long years of sun (and wind) exposure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for another bottle of 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid I usually buy from a spa in California.</li>
            <li> Mix this stuff with your favorite moisterizer if your skin is dry or you live in a cold dry climate.</li>
            <li> i had milia bumps on my cheeks for about 5 months straight that i had finally gotten down after using other stuff on amazon</li>
            <li> The most dramatic difference for me was finally seeing my eye cream diminish my dark circles and seeing my Palmer&#x27;s Bust Cream go to town on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe the feeling, but I feel like it makes my skin absolutely glow!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare that I post a bad review, but I feel this is worthy information to consider before making a purchase.</li>
            <li> The alcohol in it makes it dry so fast that within a few seconds it feels like nothing is on your skin.</li>
            <li> but I use it straight on my face and sometimes on my hands, usually at night then</li>
            <li> I was coming to the end of the two ounce bottle of this and really did not know if I should write a review or not because I was not sure if I was pro or con.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much since it does not list the percentage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and still have oily skin and breakouts when the weather turns hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it another try in late summer when the humidity is higher, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll continue to buy this, especially before the long winter months.</li>
            <li> the moist doesn&#x27;t last long too.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a determination</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and still occasionally get a few pimples on my back.</li>
            <li> I pat a few drops onto my face after serum and then spray a face mist before locking in all of the water with my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It seems like the bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this, my pore size has shrunk and you see a lot less noticeable wrinkles on my 55+ year old face.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in colder weather and need extra moisture.</li>
            <li> and I put it on immediately, my hands were dry and scaly but totally changed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using this, along with argan oil, either on my skin (dry hands, especially) or hair, dramatically moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> All Natural Black Chia Seeds]]</li>
            <li> They made wrinkles less noticeable and my skin was soft.  </li>
            <li> I am a black 36 year old women with oily skin.  </li>
            <li> but it can be used anywhere externally to reduce dry skin.</li>
            <li> Then I would wipe all the extra oil off my face with a dry washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> next attempt will to take the witch hazel completely out, though it has helped my skin feel less dry, i am just over the oily skin I am getting on hr to 2 hrs</li>
            <li> recommend this especially in the winter when the air is so dry.</li>
            <li> I noticed that paper dry feeling was no longer there the next day.</li>
            <li> So far my skin quality has improved, it no longer has the winter dullness and a dark spot on my face has faded (not completely).</li>
            <li> However, after starting to use this product I have not had a single blemish.  </li>
            <li> I know that the only advantage of oily skin is that it is supposed to look young longer and it might be the case, but in my case due to mimics and my genetic I started noticing tiny wrinkles under my eyes (especially in the morning when I wake up) and between my eye brows few years ago.</li>
            <li> In the very cold weather, I use a good moisturizer after the hyaluronic acid  serum absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> About 4 drops (this bottle will last a very long time!)</li>
            <li> It has made a big difference in my skin texture , dry areas gone, didn&#x27;t make me break out , didn&#x27;t make my oily areas oily!  </li>
            <li> I am african american which combination skin and occasional black heads.</li>
            <li> I used it daily on my face, and also on my very dry knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> The brand I used was very pricey, and I found I used it less and less because it felt prohibitive to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It was a little harsh the first night but no complaints since then.</li>
            <li> My usual hyaluronic serum by asdm beverly hills is much better very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I had a facialist use a different (MUCH more expensive) product of hyaluronic acid on me a little over a year ago, I was amazed at how my skin felt and looked after.</li>
            <li> Just what does pure mean?</li>
            <li> but the only thing this stuff did is give me really bad EXTRA milia bumps i was trying to get rid of on top of the dryness...</li>
            <li> Next morning, I felt my face soft and not taught as usual</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would fluff up my skin juuuust enough to minimize pores but it didn&#x27;t work for that, oh well!</li>
            <li> It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely sold yet but it has a somewhat plumping affect around my eye area.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this serum mixed with my moisturizer twice daily and after a few weeks I definitely see a difference in my skin; it is brighter and feels softer.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I was waiting a long time for it</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft after a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long term effects, but I can tell you that I saw results after just two days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave on too long or else</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it has any long term effects, but within 15 minutes of application, you do see a difference.</li>
            <li> The bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It goes a long ways...</li>
            <li> Came a few days early.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this serum dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what long term benefits this formulation</li>
            <li> There was really no clear explanation of what the product is supposed to do...</li>
            <li> Then I use a couple drops of the undiluted serum directly on my little line areas and it really plumps up your skin making lines LOTS less noticeable.</li>
            <li> wish I&#x27;d started using it few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Few tips from me - I like how I look now, but only because I:&lt;br /&gt;- apply this serum (on my face, eyes, neck) after using a gentle everyday scrub in the evening every day, let it dry out and then apply a moisturizer for my skin.  </li>
            <li> wish I&#x27;d started using it few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Few tips from me - I like how I look now, but only because I:&lt;br /&gt;- apply this serum (on my face, eyes, neck) after using a gentle everyday scrub in the evening every day, let it dry out and then apply a moisturizer for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I noticed My black circle improved a lot and only in a short period of 1 week!  </li>
            <li> I let it absorb--which only takes less than a  minute--then I apply my eye cream &amp; facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is suspiciously indistinguishable from plain old aloe vera in every way.</li>
            <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because it caused an initial sensitivity rash (little bumps-- not really noticeable to the naked eye</li>
            <li> I kept saying to myself that that OTHER hyaluronic I use in the past really did something.</li>
            <li> I also use dr denese facial pads every other day.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the benefits others have, even after trying the various suggestions found in other reviews.</li>
            <li> She told me the other day she could see a big difference in her skin.</li>
            <li> have also bought same product without Benzylalcohol in other seller.</li>
            <li> Like many of the others commenting that it didn&#x27;t work for them, I was using it wrong!</li>
            <li> It offers slight moisture but can also dry out the skin after prolonged use due to the benzyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have even used it alone several nights and it does feel like the skin tightens although not so much you feel it will crack as some other skin tightening creams do, nor is there any film left behind.</li>
            <li> and after putting this stuff on my skin and jojoba oil on top like someone on here said i just broke out in really bad tiny bumps...</li>
            <li> It tightens the pores but can cause drying on already dry</li>

            <li> The next morning, I found a few red itchy spots on my face and my skin felt dryer.</li>
            <li> I prefer a serum that only contains the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> After three days of using this serum I can barely notice those little unwelcome signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Please save your hard earn dollars and pay a little more for a product that at least somewhat does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> My normal to dry skin is not effective with this product.  </li>
            <li> It made my face grew some huge big zits that are painful and infected with white stuff.</li>
            <li> It has clear the dark spots in my face and other parts if my body due to burns cooking ect.</li>
            <li> I also use directly by patting a small amount on face after applying moisturizer at night.  </li>
            <li> I pair it with my teatree soap and natural coconut moisturizer, and voila no more horrendous breakouts.  </li>
            <li> If your young you don&#x27;t need this just moisturise but past 35 well you might want to look at it,  </li>
            <li> Have dark spots on my face and this stuff is actually working,, was using Clinique products that didn&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t 5-5, is the bottle is glass, it&#x27;s an nice touch &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> i use this daily but especially when i have a reaction to something harsh or unknown...</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, am used to humidity and am living in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> i also prefer the pump bottle easier to use with the dropper it drips and i loose some</li>
            <li> I use this after derma rolling for deep down results.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I believe this bottle will last me for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the smaller quantity as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> The next night I forgot to use it and felt my skin was tight and dry.</li>
            <li> There is no rash or anything visible, it just feels dry!</li>
            <li> My skin has become so dry!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product typically in the larger refill size</li>
            <li> Pores are diminished and lines appear less deep.  </li>
            <li> The pores on my face are visibly smaller and my lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Slightly thicker than water, but it is definitely not the consistency of what one might imagine a serum to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In less than a month, I can see a big difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only slightly thicker than water.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles above and below my lips are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> am giving this product 4 stars because I use it in my very dry hair</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot of moisturizer after you put in on or your skin will feel very dry.  </li>
            <li> I was under impression that HA was the key ingredient to improve your skin, which is not necessarily true according to the seller.  </li>
            <li> No more irritation, no more blotchyness/redness...almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> For example, as soon as the dry heat kicked on this winter I was blowing my nose and trying to keep it hydrated, but after a few days, the skin around my left nostril cracked and it just kept re-cracking.</li>
            <li> Also, it can make your skin feel a bit tight because it isn&#x27;t an oil or lubricant in the traditional sense.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems making my face firm by making the skin tight.</li>
            <li> I use it faithfully twice a day (a little actually does go along way).</li>
            <li> I only have little slits to see out of.</li>
            <li> Quack Quack said the little yellow duck!</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with a very simple non-allergenic moisturizing lotion, day and night, but it can be mixed with sunscreen and other creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> I have read other posts that say this dries their skin, and I do have to agree, it does seem to dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> then all of the sudden we see negative ones saying what I&#x27;m noting: that it&#x27;s just water, or possibly ineffective.</li>
            <li> A small amount last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am sad it only has 4stars when it really deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This serum wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my derma roller and it just didn&#x27;t do what I expected of this product.</li>
            <li> But just a few months go, i suddenly had a breakout all over my face...</li>
            <li> Will post later after using it for a few weeks......</li>
            <li> I have just stated using, in my hair, under eye before I apply my creams, on my skin after shower when skin is still dewey wet, then put lotion over.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no sort of \\&quot;acid\\&quot; in this--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks; once in the morning before applying my moisturizer with SPF 30 and again before applying my night cream at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face then apply it mixed with a few drop of argan oil.</li>
            <li> If you were only going to use it on your face (a few drops is plenty)</li>
            <li> I had acne and pimples, not much, but they appear a lot on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> Wash face carefully and apply this liquid to my face.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days</li>
            <li> I have only used this serum a few day</li>
            <li> A few days after my peel I started to mix this with my alpha hydroxy face lotion and my skin is simply radiant--</li>
            <li> This was my opinion of a few products I tried over the last year or so.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday morning and evening and can definitely notice a difference in my pore size.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say except if you want people to fill these out yopu should not make  </li>
            <li> It sinks in within seconds and does not leave the face glistening like some serums do.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and product as described</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only been a few months</li>
            <li> not much to say here if you know how</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times with the same results.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops in with my argan oil and massage it into my face, neck &amp; chest every day, and a year later I&#x27;m not wearing foundation!</li>
            <li> And it made absolutely no discernible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to any and all facial lotions I use</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in only a few weeks ..</li>
            <li> So, a few days ago I decided to use the following strategy:  1).</li>
            <li> I have to be really careful.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no greasiness.  </li>
            <li> so I started mixing it with my vitamin c serum and applying to my face while my face was soaking wet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that heavy, greasy feel that I get with almost every regular lotion or cream.</li>
            <li> In fact I think maybe this is not real Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li> I purchased this item twice not realizing the second time round</li>
            <li> Anything else muddies the waters and makes it difficult for people to get useful information.</li>
            <li> And yes, it really dried my face, actually made it feel rough  </li>
            <li> I use serum for the summer because moisturizer is too thick, so I only wear it if I&#x27;m outside for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Quality of  hyaluronic base for my serum from this seller is outstanding(!) 2.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my acne, I am in my early 20s and have worse acne now than I did when I was a teenager, this product not only helped bring my acne under control but it has smoothed out wrinkles and lines</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other skin care products ranging in price from $5 to $90,this little bottle surpasses them all.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly not Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>
            <li> NOT DRY LIKE USUAL.</li>
            <li> it will dry out your face , not for mixing in with a moisturizer everyday , it made my skin dry like the desert .....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the eye cream for the past few weeks, but can definitely see results.  </li>
            <li> use the dropper and only drop a few drops in the palm of my hand, not touching my hand, yet this is my second bottle</li>
            <li> And 2 stars, because it the solutions didn&#x27;t cause any harm, even though there was no positive affect either...  </li>
            <li> but a week and a half later my skin is tight and even ....</li>
            <li> Well, let me tell you, after a couple of nights of coming home late and being tired of going thru my diligent night routine, I just washed my face, patted dry and dolloped about a dropper&#x27;s worth of serum on my hand and proceeded to massage all over and on my neck, nape and shoulder/chest area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a month and my skin does feel less dry.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 different serums, this one was less expensive and twice as much product.</li>
            <li> Never experienced a hyaluronic serum containing benzyl alcohol, but gave this product a try and found it caused acne breakouts if used alone or with particular creams.</li>
            <li> Also, I have not experienced any issue with this particular product not working well with my skin cream, lotion, make-up or spf</li>
            <li> and I turned the bottle upside down on the counter to get the last few drops out.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is light-weight and little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little drop goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had a love hate relationship with moisturizer for as long as I can remember due to the fact that I have sever acne.</li>
            <li> I ordered the serum for slight acne and a few wrinkles in my forehead, since using this product I have noticed a big difference in the wrinkles they are almost gone!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel moisturizing at all, if anything my face felt tight and dry after.</li>
            <li> I believe that if this product is combined with other products it would make a difference.  </li>
            <li> My face has shown such an improvement from the usual acne and greasy look.</li>
            <li> the last few days i decided to discontinue the product and VOILA!</li>
            <li> Not sure I would recommend for antiaging facial skin product.</li>
            <li> As stated by other reviewers, this isn&#x27;t 100% Hyalutronic acid.</li>
            <li> The serum made me break out in small whiteheads literally all over my entire face.  </li>
            <li> However, after a lot of research and looking over other reviews I bought this product......</li>
            <li> Granted, I do use other products....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll trust in other reviewers.</li>
            <li> (first three days), which was weird since I thought it was meant to help moisturize...?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try using it on other parts of my body with vitamin c to see how it works.</li>
            <li> No scent, not greasy, rubs in well, blends well with other moisturizers...</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night before any other moisturizers...  </li>
            <li> then charge a lot, use it as initial serum over face before your usual face cream.</li>
            <li> The other 99% is water, alcohol, and a fungicide (because bacteria thrive in water...</li>
            <li> However, I guess due to the size I got this time, it requires me to do a posting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a few drops of the serum...imo, this bottle should last at least 4-5 monrhs...</li>
            <li> i have no hesitation in advising other people to use it  thankyou</li>
            <li> Helps with skin hydration &amp; mixes with other products.  </li>
            <li> on one hand you have HA and on the other Benzyl alcohol?  </li>
            <li> learned via google that hyaluronic acid retains water extremely well.</li>
            <li> There are other HA serums on the market without this alcohol.</li>
            <li> I use this with other moisturizers and skin care products that do not have hyaluronic acid in them.  </li>
            <li> However, I do not know if it is this product, or the other product of choice that I use to mix it with.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other day.</li>
            <li> I am noticing that with continued use, my skin is no longer looking crepe-y from over-drying with other products.</li>
            <li> other MoisturizRes</li>
            <li> Other serums haven&#x27;t done this.</li>
            <li> no tricks i.e., one other product advertised was $39, at the end, it was $204</li>
            <li> It can also be applied separately like any other serum</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give burning sensation or irritation as any other creams and moisturizes after peel do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for almost 6 months now, and it is one of the few beauty products I have stuck with for so long.  </li>
            <li> Mix with your other creams or use alone.  </li>
            <li> I use it under foundation and with other creams at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> : Dont use it alone ( like other serums), you need to mix it with your day cream/ night cream to see the effect.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this because of other reviews.</li>
            <li> use this after I use my derma roller for extreme moisture</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a substitute for other creams or moisturizers, of course.</li>
            <li> I JUST RECEIVED THE PACKAGE THE OTHER DAY,  </li>
            <li> Benzyl Alcohol is in it, and some other stuff.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I helps with absorption of your other moisturizer....</li>
            <li> i do however, use it in conjunction with vitamin e, elastin, and other creams.</li>
            <li> it was almost what other reviewers had stated about aloe vera</li>
            <li> it contained hyaluronic acid and b) it did not contain other filler ingredients.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> no softening effect, like other serums, no effect from &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I like that it does seem to work with other products and hasn&#x27;t caused any acne or rashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also put this into other moisturizers (Oil of Olay, Lancome, Estee Lauder, I&#x27;ve got a bunch.)</li>
            <li> Usually when I use a lotion or cream, my face is left shiny and greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I also told two other ladies I work with about it today</li>
            <li> By the way.... a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I thought I would continue using it, because I thought maybe the breakouts were due to the change in weather or something else other than this product.</li>
            <li> but she also said she&#x27;s been using other products as well.</li>
            <li> but it has other filler ingredients.</li>
            <li> Then I used with other trusted moisturizers and broke out.</li>
            <li> and I mix it in with other night cream I use.  </li>
            <li> My trust is given due to the word Serum added here which to me denotes a mixture.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> My cheeks tend to be a little dry, even after the moisturizing</li>
            <li> It has been a dry winter and usually my skin is flaky and chalky when the weather is so dry.  </li>
            <li> Living in the tropics, I must be very careful with my moisturizers.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is hyaluronic acid,  </li>
            <li> Well I ended up buying a face lotion with this ingredient as well so instead of letting this product go to waste, I figured I&#x27;d try it on my really dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops on my hairbrush after the shower and comb it through my hair because the drying winter weather and Accutane make my scalp dry and my hair brittle.   </li>
            <li> I put on a few drops of this while my face is still moist from the shower of after I have spritzed mist on my face, then put on eye cream over it once it&#x27;s dry, along with my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there is absolutely no information, directions, etc.</li>
            <li> and I kept seeing hyaluronic acid listed as an active ingredient;</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;d expect my bottle to last at least a year.</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;ve rarely purchased something that didn&#x27;t do anything, doesn&#x27;t lift, doesn&#x27;t fix wrinkles, doesn&#x27;t moisturize, no great scent; it literally serves no purpose.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to last quite a long time--a big plus in the realm of expensive but tiny-portioned skin care products.</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers have stated you need very little of this stuff to see its effectiveness so a bottle lasts a long time, and since it&#x27;s about the consistncy of water</li>
            <li> I researched my condition up one side and down the other.  </li>
            <li> The weird dry patches, overall tightness, and red irritated bumps surfaced after about a week of use.</li>
            <li> This helps tame the oily parts, keep me from breaking out, and exfoliates the dry parts.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
            <li> I just spent some time reading the 1 star reviews and have to chuckle a little bit.</li>
            <li> From what I learned from my friend, the serum must have a hard time penetrating because I wasn&#x27;t keeping up with a regular exfoliation routine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 6-8 months now and it works just as well as the super expensive brands (yay!).</li>
            <li> It will peel dark spots over night and shrink pimples over night as well</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s making me skeptical about my order, is that there is absolutely 0 amount of sting or irritation when applying this product.</li>
            <li> I am now 38 and often get mistaken for someone who is at least 10 years younger than I am.  </li>
            <li> , the product should be in a dark bottle to preserve it, however I realize that would increase the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> Part of my daily routine, I have used Hyaluronic Acid Serum for  the past few years and will continue to order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last at LEAST 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Was not worth it.</li>
            <li> I had some dark spots and what appeared as mylasma going on at the temples of my face</li>
            <li> and so I combined it with a dark spot remover that contained kojic</li>
            <li> but I tried it for at least a week, multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes, with puffiness akin to a raccoon.  </li>
            <li> I only lost about 10 bucks, but it still sucks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you want to try something relatively inexpensive then try HA and give it at least a week...</li>
            <li> I have bags and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there were no instructions included.  </li>
            <li> but basically just feels rough to the touch for a few days).</li>
            <li> As you can see, this seller tries to trick you by saying &amp;#34;100% pure&amp;#34; although it contains alcohol which dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> and you can use it on your hair - after washing, while still wet, just massage a few drops into your tips.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face the truth - we can&#x27;t turn back time, but we can slow it down.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face the truth - we can&#x27;t turn back time, but we can slow it down.</li>
            <li> The formula is either being watered down or quality control is falling.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see a lot of improvement, you&#x27;re just letting it get down in your skin.  </li>
            <li> and so, I started rubbing them down and in three weeks they were gone.  </li>
            <li> It is my fault that I didn&#x27;t scroll all the way down to the bottom to read the list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I Like the product a lot, My skin has shown improvements, can help raise skin&#x27;s moisture level to fill-in furrows, plump up tissues, and tone down age lines.</li>
            <li> I had to sit down because the pain made me dizzy</li>
            <li> After only 5 days of using it - I notice a small difference on my face already!  </li>
            <li> The results and benefits over other things I have tried are beyond!  </li>
            <li> This product works and is much less expensive than other high priced products</li>
            <li> I have annoyingly awful combination skin; super dry in the winter; easily sensitive; oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li> and it makes my toes look less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything in retail stores that have even half of the effects.</li>
            <li> not to mention my forehead line are less and less each day...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed much less redness and quicker healing from the breakouts I do still get.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical prior to purchase, but now I use daily.  </li>
            <li> No more dry skin!  </li>
            <li> I bought less ounce of this acid in Florence, Italy</li>
            <li> I did  notice a  slight rash  when  using  kit  three  </li>
            <li> My doctor did not say which products to use, I went with the ratings, if I see anything less then 4 1/2 stars on Amazon, I will not buy</li>
            <li> Sadly, that effect does not last the entire day but may with time.</li>
            <li> when i mix it with my lotion as what i learned you should do with it because it helps keep moisture in your skin but doesnt supply it, i notice a slight difference</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and slightly less break outs.</li>
            <li> I think my wrinkles are getting less deeper.</li>
            <li> I have some slight acne and it helps keep it.  </li>
            <li> , maybe less.</li>
            <li> I have used half bottle of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li> After using Hyaluronic Acid for 30 days have noticed just a slight improvement with my skin.</li>
            <li> The product does work quite well as a moisturizer but has not helped with even slight wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My skin felt dramatically tighter and less saggy within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> When the humidity levels rise you will need less moisterizer.</li>
            <li> This leaves skin slightly sticky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bottle for months now and haven&#x27;t used half of it.</li>
            <li> and I started using this 4 days before my typical breakouts.</li>
            <li> Seems to me to be much less oily</li>
            <li> I also have slight wrinkles around my nose/mouth</li>
            <li> and I can see wrinkles are less noticible.</li>
            <li> All of these fascist of my skin are contradictions of themselves and have caused me to breakout for half of my life.</li>
            <li> A few drops goes on slick and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not shocked - I should have listened to the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> It was pretty depressing</li>
            <li> That is NOT true.</li>
            <li> Why buy expensive skincare products with diluted hyraluronic acid when you can just use this with your normal products?  </li>
            <li> It is so messy and often drips from the tube, it can also run down your face.  </li>
            <li> I use it with Olay moisterizer, because by itself it makes your skin too tight.  </li>
            <li> bcuz it dries sticky/ tight feeling.</li>
            <li> I feel that my face looks glowier, plump, and tight.</li>
            <li> , its waterlike texture makes it hard for it to dry</li>
            <li> This does seem to make  my skin look less dried out</li>
            <li> It feels like it tightens the skin just a little too.</li>
            <li> I put a little moisturizers over it</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s working because I am also using other product on my skin along with it</li>
            <li> for weeks  now,,,, I  have  noticed  little  </li>
            <li> broke out a little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with a little background as to why I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> The little wrinkles I had are now practically gone.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky and if I wear make up it balls up under the make up.</li>
            <li> but my face seems a little smoother after about 10 days.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes a little while longer.</li>
            <li> A little eye makeup &amp; lip gloss is all I want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure about this one yet, It might be due to my age and this being the reason why I do not feel any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little iffy about this product.</li>
            <li> That makes sense since it burned a little.  </li>
            <li> A little research will show you that Sodium Hyaluronate is not \\&quot;hyaluronic acid\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I think it has alcohol as I do itch a little after using it.</li>
            <li> Less expensive products cause far fewer problems.</li>
            <li> NOT VERY SURE</li>
            <li> The reason I questioned the &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; is it is my understanding that if the bottle contained 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid it would be dangerous to use as is.</li>
            <li> I am an AA female with sensitive skin, and I have had no break outs or bad reactions from using this product.</li>
            <li> He suffers from intense dryness around the eyesbut oily skin elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This time I&#x27;m mixing a few drops of argon oil with it to see if that help keeps in the moisture for the winter.</li>
            <li> serum is so lightweight and you won&#x27;t feel any residual or heavy film on your skin.</li>
            <li> My lids seem to perk up and firm up when I wear it.</li>
            <li> and i was a bit confused to why all of a sudden i have been&lt;br /&gt;getting enlarged pores and heads in my T zone area.</li>
            <li> Its results are not visible and overtime they do not maintain skin firm.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to use it on my arms, tho, so it won&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin and added wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like this hyaluronic acid,Iused it a few days</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the feel of my skin in a few days.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops with my am-lactin moisturizer at night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with a heavy duty peel and the use of retin-a.  </li>
            <li> am I missing something?  </li>
            <li> a waste of $...</li>
            <li> I topped this w/ a heavy night cream.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops on my hands with my hand cream at night to help keep my hands moisturized.</li>
            <li> Takes that early creepy skin appearance away</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after I blow dried it.  </li>
            <li> This product was a waste of my money and a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s produced naturally throughout your body, it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll suffer any adverse reactions from it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived within a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> I have added a few drops to my lotion and my conditioner.</li>
            <li> I noticed it dried up excess oil on my face, but that&#x27;s all.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW</li>
            <li> have been adding a few drops to my eyecream and night cream after exfoliating my skin...</li>
            <li> I mix mine with a few drops of jojoba and lavender oil - twice a day - morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I have used two bottles of this serum and noticed a difference in my skin after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I mix a few drops w/ my sunscreen for my chest and w/ my eye cream.  </li>
            <li> It also means that even if I&#x27;m tired and don&#x27;t feel like it I can squeeze in an extra minute to do this .</li>
            <li> tried several different moisturizers over this serum and my skin kept getting worse &amp; worse.</li>
            <li> all the money I wasted on fancy creams..</li>
            <li> it takes a few weeks to see the difference</li>
            <li> Nothing wasted.</li>
            <li> Takes a few weeks to see a difference but it works.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have totally wasted my money and my time buying snake oil.  </li>
            <li> I still cant get over how I wasted 15 bucks after reading those 1 star reviews</li>
            <li> I will continue to do this for my skin everyday.</li>
            <li> just cause I didnt want to waste my money.</li>
            <li> I use it year round</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, maybe twice a month.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> The texture is silky--not greasy and has not caused break outs--which I still get--even though I also have a few wrinkles........</li>
            <li> I have oily &amp; sensitive skin so finding moisturizing products is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Any topical steroid cannot be used on the eyelid because the skin is too thin.  </li>
            <li> In a few weeks I&#x27;ll write an update.</li>
            <li> This is not a &#x27;cheap&#x27; product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this a few weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Order a few to give to my girl friends and</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A must have to a everyday skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for a month and thought what am I missing here?</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday and have seen a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It comes in a heavy weight poly bottle with dropper and is sealed and bubble wrapped before being boxed for shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> You get netters results using organic coconut oil everyday on your skin and as a conditioner on your hair...</li>
            <li> Some of the other customers complained of the serum drying their skin out or making it tight.</li>
            <li> Usually you want nothing to do with a solvent alcohol in your skin care product as it breaks down the skin&#x27;s nature moisture barrier and can cause damage.</li>
            <li> I am 54 and a very skeptical consumer and was not certain this product would live up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> My friend will be seeing less of me at the spa!</li>
            <li> Not a good choice for somebody who appreciates a dry face.</li>
            <li> A previous review recommended this combination and she is spot on!</li>
            <li> Plus unlike my other moisterizers I&#x27;ve never had burning or other bad reactions from my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No burn, dryness, redness, oily effect, clogged pores, acne or other negative side effect.</li>
            <li> I guess the company assumes that consumers ordering plain Hyaluronic Acid knows what to do with it.</li>
            <li> I can tell it&#x27;s not just water (because of how it feels -- it has a very slight viscosity), but it might was well be.</li>
            <li> not sure if this product is working, it is suppose to slough dead skin and give one a glow</li>
            <li> It is sad to wake up to white heads all round my mouth, chin and nose.  </li>
            <li> bad ones used in conjunction with six day bandages] bad, bad puncture wounds on my leg from a dog fight, no infection, no scar [other than a very small white area], precancerous skin growths from my arm being exposed to the sun while driving every day, and, even I find this incredible, plaque psoriasis on my arm.  </li>
            <li> I wish i had known about this hyaluronic acid before i spent a lot of money on other expensive moisturizing</li>
            <li> and it takes very little product to work.  </li>
            <li> There is very little to comment on here...</li>
            <li> I am really upset about it……..delivering is so bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is in it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid Serum twice a day for the past month or so.</li>
            <li> I been using it for the past week with vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> and i usually don&#x27;t have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and for the past week, my skin seems to have healed and normalized</li>
            <li> still not sure</li>
            <li> I can no longer afford such expensive products/</li>
            <li> I use Argan oil or Emu oil - small amounts to moisturize afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually keep it in the box to preserve the potency.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a small sample size, but there is a lot there</li>
            <li> Sorry for any error on the gramatic, because english in not my language.</li>
            <li> Didnt do a thing, used it all and nothing, what a waste!</li>
            <li> Usually you buy a product and it may not do what it is advertised to do</li>
            <li> I usually keep a  spare</li>
            <li> I use a moisurizer that has a small amt of Hyaluronic Acid in it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my H.A. on ebay; however, this one contains alcohol and they usually contain 100% hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday at least twice per day for 1 1/2 months</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is working like I thought it would,</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s did anything for me yet,</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll wake up one morning and walk past the mirror and say &amp;</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is doing what it is touted to do, but still using.</li>
            <li> I have been using every day after I wash my face, put my Obagi toner, then get a small drip and spread all over my face in the morning and at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Actually not sure.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2 months now, not sure that I see any improvement of my skin.</li>
            <li> The small bottle lasted me 3 months with me using it two times a day.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about this.  </li>
            <li> Usually when my pores look like that, there&#x27;s something in the product</li>
            <li> Not sure yEt.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is working like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t increase the prices excessively.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount.with</li>
            <li> Within a couple of hours, my forehead looks like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> either, something I used a matt moisturizer for - no more.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is no research showing anti-aging benefits from hyaluronic acid used as a topical serum or cream.</li>
            <li> hope to see results, not really sure about that??</li>
            <li> AND IT ALL SPILLED TO WASTE!</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m not sure if its working just wait and see</li>
            <li> Not sure why anyone, including myself, would buy this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Hyaluronic Acid Serum by a brand that will remain nameless, for several years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it plumps wrinkles but makes my skin moist.</li>
            <li> Well, in my case this serum is one of very few remedies that work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I purchased 2 oz bottle</li>
            <li> Well, in my case this serum is one of very few remedies that work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I purchased 2 oz bottle</li>
            <li> I write VERY few reviews.  </li>
            <li> My fingers still cant even handle this stuff even after diluting the product to less than 10% with water!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time or maybe stick with lotion in the winter that has hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> This is not very good.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale combination skin.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for my face. :(</li>
            <li> At first, it helped peel the crap out of my skin</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona for the past 3 years has had a negative effect on my skin..  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using this product as it arrive in a clear plastic box with confetti.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading for years that you should look for Hyaluronic Acid in facial serums but so often the ingredient list is indecipherable.  </li>
            <li> During the use of this product my hairline receded (all of my little 2-3\\&quot; long hair disappeared), my finger tips were extremely sensitive to painful, and my finger nails were brittle and breaking off like crazy.</li>
            <li> This is a mess it came broken and frozen</li>
            <li> My skin is oily in T-shape, looks dull as well.  </li>
            <li> She told me about this product and because of the price you can hardly believe that it will work so well.</li>
            <li> No literature with it so hard to know if you are using it correctly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to know until you use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> , i used it a little while ago and it worked wonders!!</li>
            <li> If anything it made my skin a little worse.</li>
            <li> If I get something suspect near my eyes they swell up so bad</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and with any bad ingredients my skin burns and</li>
            <li> The least cost Hyaluronic Serum I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> but i figured i should at least finish the bottle</li>
            <li> The serum actually sucks out the moisture from your face if it cant take from anywhere else.</li>
            <li> but it at least serves some purpose.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product at least 5 times and will continue.</li>
            <li> and I read at least 10 to 12 reviews.</li>
            <li> I buy this at least once every three months</li>
            <li> I looked all over and this product was at least 1/2 the price of any I found anywhere else and works.</li>
            <li> I used Q-tips and leave it on for a minute and wash off immediately with cold water several times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month now.  </li>
            <li> i should have sent it back for a refund, I am that unhappy with it....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every product I have found in stores with Hyaluronic acid in it is at least three times the cost..</li>
            <li> i use it a least once a day sometimes twice.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.</li>
            <li> i use it with the squalane...goes on like thick</li>
            <li> It feels slightly thick but it goes on and feels just like water.  </li>
            <li> I have no amazing results of softer, smoother, clearer skin like all the reviews claim.</li>
            <li> (What I mean is that some products when used in conjunction with others results in a gel or rubber like substance that rolls off when rubbed - not this product).</li>
            <li> I have never tried this type of serum before, so I am unable to compare it to other treatments or brands.</li>
            <li> I place one drop each on my forehead, cheeks chin and even a very small amount on each eye</li>
            <li> Seriously you will never regret ordering this product.</li>
            <li> 1% Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m 26</li>
            <li> It helps hydrate my skin when the weather is cold or dry.  </li>
            <li> and it is too expensive to loose any!!!!</li>
            <li> I knew it was a stretch, but also didn&#x27;t feel like I had a lot to lose because my face was &#x27;acting up&#x27; so badly at 35.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to find facial products that don&#x27;t contain the \\&quot;bad stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month and it is not a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and the texture is not good...  </li>
            <li> because was not good like they said so they are stole my money</li>
            <li> face will be red and painful.</li>
            <li> and I have been using this serum (which leaves your skin soft, dewy and glowing) as a base along with Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Oil after my baths and showers</li>
            <li> I have also tried mixing it with my moisturizer with the same results. :(</li>
            <li> Common!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to realize that this product actually does not contain ANY hyaluronic acid and the ingredient list is as follows:</li>
            <li> I am not sure if maybe I am doing this all wrong or what.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I said, I am not sure if I am doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed but will try another brand next.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this product!!!</li>
            <li> it was too irritating.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t say that because my secret will be out.  </li>
            <li> This is too thin and watery.</li>
            <li> non irritating</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any lightening with this product.</li>
            <li> but I often find myself time constrained or tired at the end of the day</li>
            <li> TWO bottles of broken</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced it as being drying at all..</li>
            <li> And even though I hate telling my beauty secrets, I can&#x27;t stay quiet about the serum.</li>
            <li> It came in broken , all i saw was broken pieces of container.</li>
            <li> when it arrived, it was broken</li>
            <li> To make it much worse, I get eczema on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I was annoyed with his answer...and determined.  </li>
            <li> This is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have cracked the secret of youthful skin and thesis not breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li> Not attractive.</li>
            <li> Anything I put on my face to moisturize it and help soothe my poor skin just made it worse or caused stinging and burning so bad I was crying.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated with acne, blackheads, and always looking worn down.  </li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t think this is a dramatic product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that dramatic</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen dramatic changes yet</li>
            <li> If there is a tightening after using it, it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li> I was unable to try this product since the container was broken.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was almost impossible to tame!</li>
            <li> Unless ofcourse your skin is made out of tough steel copper metal or something!</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try this out!!!</li>
            <li> both times i got the bad bumps... which are hard as hell to get rid of..</li>
            <li> I abandoned that for a time because it got to be so tedious and time-consuming.  </li>
            <li> , i think this product is useless..</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken upon arrival!</li>
            <li> I am quitting on buying expensive face crams because of this product.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds weird.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any of the expensive hyaluronic acid products for comparison(I</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical about stuff like this</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim after seeing it mentioned randomly in a comment on a dermatologist&#x27;s facebook page--</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is in a lot of expensive face moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a substitute for the one touted by Dr. Oz however it was not as expensive as that one</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t control my mimics</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t control my mimics</li>
            <li> I coud get at the broken glass with out unwapping the bubble wrap!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> useless does not feel any change.</li>
            <li> that until now was difficult to care for.</li>
            <li> out the junk and buy this&lt;br /&gt;you wont be sorry</li>
            <li> Upon it&#x27;s arrival, I noticed the packaging was weird</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d be angry.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I used to buy expensive products</li>
            <li> and they offer you the expensive serums for your skin post microdermabrasion or chemical peel.</li>
            <li> There is nothing in this to clog your pore or make your face angry.</li>
            <li> I used to spend a lot of money on expensive anti-aging creams.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a fail product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy expensive branded serums again.</li>
            <li> Nothng wrong with that at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for a week and I am very confused with the result.</li>
            <li> Consistency is very thin and watery.</li>
            <li> that the cold winters can bring.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer during the cold months and it keeps my skin supple and protected against the weather conditions.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to purchase a moisturizing vitamin c serum</li>
            <li> you will see a lot of customers are unhappy with shipping time.</li>
            <li> After that my skin dried out terribly.</li>
            <li> Do not be afraid because of &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; in its name.  </li>
            <li> so my wrinkles aren&#x27;t crazy, but</li>
            <li> are just too darn expensive!</li>
            <li> a unpleasant that you paid for something that you don&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> I have very angry, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product.</li>
            <li> Could this be another case of bad batches?</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so bad.</li>
            <li> I have not had any bad reactions to the product.</li>
            <li> I even put an aloe burn gel on my face and that hurt so bad</li>
            <li> this serum and others have saved my badly sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to have really bad acne.  </li>
            <li> Like, really bad.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s just bad bad quality</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> This just arrived and I am really frustrated with the misleading labeling.  </li>
            <li> It was sooo miserably painful.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin sick  </li>
            <li> I will not be reordering this product as I&#x27;m sadley disappointed.</li>

            <li> :( don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> On day 5 I  dropped the bottle  and broke it :(  </li>

            <li> Very unhappy when I saw it contained alcohol but wanted to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I was a very afraid to use it after these procedures because it is an acid after all.</li>
            <li> and those days are behind me!!!</li>

            <li> but it dries my skin out horribly</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible look at reviews for vendor not just for this product</li>
            <li> I have seb derm - a TERRIBLE skin condition that makes your face hideous.</li>
            <li> Since he didn&#x27;t let me apply to his face, I used it on his legs instead since he has a case of bad psoriasis and overnight this worked wonders!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This serum wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It didn&#x27;t moisturize well and burned when I applied it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> So I have this BB Cream that does wonders for my face. Reduced redness and acne. The active ingredient is hyaluronic acid,  so I figured I&#x27;d try this product with my regular face lotion at night.  Well I ended up buying a face lotion with this ingredient as well so instead of letting this product go to waste, I figured I&#x27;d try it on my really dry hands and feet. It helps so much! I also bought some rosewater most based on another reviews recommendation, so what I do it spray it on my feet and hands to get them damp then rub in the hyaluronic acid,  then immediately rub in my lotion.  I put socks on my feet and leave it ovovernight. It is definitely a noticeable difference after one use.</li>
            <li> second  time I purchased this brand. High quality I can always tell the difference when I use it consistently.especially when I use it with the Michael current. This time I&#x27;m mixing a few drops of argon oil with it to see if that help keeps in the moisture for the winter.</li>
            <li> This serum helped my skin a lot. I had a lot of acne and spots and my acne is almost gone and the spots are fading and almost gone. I apply it to my face every night and it makes my face feel like a baby&#x27;s skin. I also apply it to my toes which were kind of wrinkled and it makes my toes look less wrinkled. I will continue buying this product. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better already. I&#x27;m 73 and I have 50 year old men asking me out.</li>
            <li> this item is really great I have been using it for several months. I am 68 years old and people stop and ask me what I have done to my skin it looks so nice I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Great product. Helps my skin to stay moisturized and firmer. I would highly recommend this product to anyone over age 50! AAA+++</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was experiencing dryness and redness before using this product. I have only been using it for a week morning and night and I have seen a tremendous change with my skin. Totally worth it for me!</li>
            <li> Very happy thank you!</li>
            <li> this is so moisturizing that i would like to soak into it.  no greasy feeling.  i will order more.  i feel nothing on my face but i look moisturized..</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;m not sure what is in it. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller. If you are looking for a high-quality hyaluronic acid serum would highly recommend Timeless Skin Care.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Your skin will feel tauter as it dries. It seems to add a glow. I am a believer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  Would order again.l</li>
            <li> Felt good when applied but it didn&#x27;t do want the product promises.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product would be a serum, but it is more of a water texture.  I am looking for a serum that will sink the ingredients into the skin and keep the skin soft.  I believe that if this product is combined with other products it would make a difference.  I&#x27;ve researched in order to find the ingredients most important in producing a very effective difference in skin texture, appearance, radiance, suppleness; also minimizing fine lines and wrinkles.  Antioxidence are extremely important ingredients.  Looking at the first ingredients in the content are the highest content in the product.  I am in the process of looking for the antioxidents, vitamins A, C, and E in the products.&lt;br /&gt;I think that this products would work on someone who has normal to oily skin.  My normal to dry skin is not effective with this product.  The price of $15.95 seemed reasonable.  We don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money on a product for it to be good.  I most definately know that to be true.  If you are spending more than $50.00 (high end price) your spending far too much.</li>
            <li> The least cost Hyaluronic Serum I&#x27;ve found. Highly recommend as I&#x27;ve commented before.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid Serum twice a day for the past month or so. I love it because it is absorbed so quickly and leaves no greasy residue. My face has shown such an improvement from the usual acne and greasy look. It is now smooth and evening out in tone. My husband said to me today, \\&quot;Your skin looks good.\\&quot; For him to notice, that&#x27;s a feat!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have ordered it over and over again.  It really works and is cost efficient.</li>
            <li> Never experienced a hyaluronic serum containing benzyl alcohol, but gave this product a try and found it caused acne breakouts if used alone or with particular creams. Therefore, I have restricted its use to my neck and chest only. Will purchase a different formula next time.</li>
            <li> I been using it for the past week with vitamin C serum.  My skin so nice,soft, glow but not greasy.   I noticed My black circle improved a lot and only in a short period of 1 week!  Defiantly will buy again.</li>
            <li> Meh...I used it in conjunction with an excellent moisturizer and I really rather use the moisturizer by itself. Made my skin a bit tight and really noticed no difference at all with its use. I&#x27;ve used up the entire bottle so, I didn&#x27;t jump the gun. I gave it an honest try.</li>
            <li> First time I  using this product... I mix it with my moisturizer daily and massage into my skin.  So far, I like the results. Product arrived sooner than expected and packaged nicely. I will definitely order again in the future.</li>
            <li> I think the name of this item is a misnomer -- 1% HA that is 100% pure is not enough!  I&#x27;ve used this for a week now and can not see much difference from my regular moisturizer (I use a non greasy moisturizer).  Not sure if I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 04/20/13&lt;br /&gt;I am changing my review from 3 stars to 1 star.  Let me clear things up because the seller challenged my review.  The seller has pointed out that \\&quot;A concentration higher than 1% will tend to dry out the skin unless additional moisture is added.\\&quot;  My point of the review is that, whatever goes inside this serum is not doing anything to better my skin.  I was under impression that HA was the key ingredient to improve your skin, which is not necessarily true according to the seller.  I do use my regular moisturizer on top of this serum and still saw no improvement.  The serum felt like drops of water/alcohol.  Therefore I see no value in this product.  I threw away $15.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be fine--no problems with my skin as of yet (no greasiness or blemishes, etc.) but still do not see any improvement either.  Probably just too soon to tell....  Thus only the three stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have been using it for over 6 months nightly. It tightens the pores but can cause drying on already dry skin.&lt;br /&gt; For combination skin such as mine, its best added to an actual light moisturizer rather than for use alone. I guess it has worked for intended use, because my oily t-zone has not been oily any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is so lightweight and you won&#x27;t feel any residual or heavy film on your skin. I recommend you try it out.</li>
            <li> Extremely quick shipping! And it&#x27;s free shipping? Can&#x27;t beat that. I ordered it earlier this week and received it this afternoon (Friday). It comes packaged nicely in a very nice glass bottle. It is a good quality dropper.  I applied it to the back of my hand and noticed an immediate difference in the moisture and appearance of my hand. Given the reviews, I have no doubt that I will like this product. I will update this in a couple of weeks and let you know what I think. So far... I am a pleased buyer. Thank you!</li>
            <li> When I first started using the product, I wasn&#x27;t sold on it immediately. I didn&#x27;t seem to get the hydration that I expected from it and thought maybe I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks. During that time of waiting to see what the serum would improve, I visited one of my esthetician friends to get a couple of treatments and by accident found the solution. From what I learned from my friend, the serum must have a hard time penetrating because I wasn&#x27;t keeping up with a regular exfoliation routine and so it was probably just sitting on top of a dead skin layer. Since then, I exfoliate my skin every night with my Nutra Sonic brush and then twice a week use Pevonia&#x27;s Enzymo Spherides to help with clearing my pores out. With my skin being at an optimum level for the serum, I definitely see that my skin is well hydrated vs. it just being moisturized. And my pores!! They almost disappear when the serum settles into my skin. Not so sure if I&#x27;ll be exploring other companies that sell Hyaluronic acid serums, but I know definitely it has helped with keeping my complexion healthy. My friend will be seeing less of me at the spa!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this serum....I am an African American woman and in my opinion it should be the foundation to every woman&#x27;s beauty regiment.  I have sensitive skin with eczema so my skin has been very dry and for someone that used to have flawless skin, recently being diagnosed with eczema has been devastating.  I have searched high and low for something that would repair my dry skin and I have been using this serum (which leaves your skin soft, dewy and glowing) as a base along with Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Oil after my baths and showers and I am pleased with the outcome.  Now if I can just find something to take the scars away that I have I accumulated because of eczema I would be a elated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item at Amazon and it could have come with some directions but thank goodness for the reviews because they were very helpful as to how to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  perfect price point.</li>
            <li> love the feel of it, but not sure if it did anything..</li>
            <li> Good quality. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum to wear under moisturizer.  It absorbs quickly and I&#x27;ve really noticed improvement in tiny lines and overall smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> the third time I buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with a low grade acid peel. I can tell you that this is amazing stuff. I have the hooded eyelid and can&#x27;t put the peel there, however the Hyaluronic Acid Serum is like putting on water. My lids seem to perk up and firm up when I wear it. The skin even looks more hydrated when I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been a smoker for about 20 years and have been seeing some of the effects on my skin. At 33 I&#x27;ve been looking closer to 40. I can&#x27;t tell you how debilitating that can be on the self esteem. I haven&#x27;t found anything in retail stores that have even half of the effects. It was really worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Saw zero results.  I will throw it away.</li>
            <li> I have been buying hyaluronic acid serum by cellux-c hydra-B for years, but to try ,and save some money (hydra-b is quite a bit more expensive)I thought I would try this one instead. It works amazing. I love it! I will continue to buy this one for sure!</li>
            <li> It did not make me look 20 years younger.  lol</li>
            <li> Great Product, very moisturizing. I use it as a primer before my creme moisturizer and it makes my skin feel like it is soaking up every bit of moisture. Feels really good in the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have sensitive acne prone skin, which I&#x27;ve had since my teens and still had well into my 40&#x27;s.  However, after starting to use this product I have not had a single blemish.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and love it.  I apply it to my face morning and night just after washing my face.  After that I can apply any day cream, make-up, or nigth cream directly on top.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for a week and I am very confused with the result. It reduced the wrinkles on my forehead and plumped the face and neck dramatically just like retinol without dryness and peeling, but I realize that  my skin tone is darker, pores are much bigger and makes my skin oilier. Now I use this serum on whole body except my face. It makes my hair and body  so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The first day after I started this serum I was astonished to see that my old acne blemishes had faded considerably and my newer ones had diminished.  And when I touched my face I noticed that it didn&#x27;t feel oily at all (as it has been feeling since the warmer weather started).  It felt moist and soft.  I love that!      My skin looks clearer and smoother.  I am so glad I tried this stuff.  Two drops under moisturizer and it does wonders.    Update 5/27/11: I noticed this morning that my skin looked so much clearer.  My old acne scars had lightened dramatically.  It might have been a cumulative effect of using the serum or also that I used my Clarisonic brush last night and that helped the serum to penetrate even deeper.  Either way, I am so happy. I was using a scar therapy treatment that didn&#x27;t have this effect.  I abandoned that for a time because it got to be so tedious and time-consuming.  But this is so easy and it works even better.  I am in love with the results!</li>
            <li> powerful stuff! great price.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for my face. :(</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but i wanted to warn others who may be prone to breakouts or enlarged pores.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over a month and i was a bit confused to why all of a sudden i have been&lt;br /&gt;getting enlarged pores and heads in my T zone area. I have dry skin and i usually don&#x27;t have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;I kept getting regular facials every week and i noticed they just kept coming back the following day.&lt;br /&gt;So the last few days i decided to discontinue the product and VOILA! problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly it really did noting for my skin but i figured i should at least finish the bottle, i think this product is useless..&lt;br /&gt;save your money and invest in Image Skin care Ageless Total Pure Hyaluronic Filler, i used it a little while ago and it worked wonders!!</li>
            <li> actually makes my skin nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my derma roller and it just didn&#x27;t do what I expected of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month now, and my fine lines have almost all gone away!  Plus, my skins feels smoother than ever!  This bottle was bigger than I thought, and you really just need a few drops for your face.      Similar serums containing hyaluronic acid selling at department stores or Sephora costs  $80+ for a 1-2 oz bottle.  This was definitely a great purchase and I will buy some more when I finish my bottle.  :)</li>
            <li> Love it.  The product is odorless, very smooth solution and non greasy at all. I really recommend it. Excellent Product.</li>
            <li> This product is good price-wise, yet I didn&#x27;t work for me. Reasons: its too runny, its waterlike texture makes it hard for it to dry, be absorbed; in my frustration I tended to overuse and it didn&#x27;t work. Its results are not visible and overtime they do not maintain skin firm. Not a good choice for somebody who appreciates a dry face.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would recommend for antiaging facial skin product.</li>
            <li> As stated by other reviewers, this isn&#x27;t 100% Hyalutronic acid. It contains 3 ingredients total. One of them is Benzylalcohol. There are two types of alcohols &amp;#34;fatty&amp;#34; alcohols which will hold moisture in the skin, and Solvent alcohols which will breakdown moisture. Usually you want nothing to do with a solvent alcohol in your skin care product as it breaks down the skin&#x27;s nature moisture barrier and can cause damage. Benzylalcohol is a solvent alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of that, this product actually was the opposite of moisturizing for me. I would have preferred something without an alcohol and instead a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product isn&#x27;t bad necessarily and the price point makes it incredibly affordable. Your experience may differ.</li>
            <li> I have used 1/2 of my bottle and am ordering more.  I love this serum.  I am using this serum with my lotions on my body and face.  It hydrates and smoothes the skin.  In addition, I put it on my hair after I get out of the shower, and it gives me increadible body and volume.  My friends keep asking me what I have done with my hair.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I never went into it thinking it was a moisturizer, but a booster.  No product works entirely alone.  I spray Na-Pca on top of this serum; it seems to seal it in, or activate it, if you will.  A friend of mine a Dermatologist recommend Na-Pca years ago, and I live by it. Its a spray moisturizer in a bottle.  Available in most health food places, or vitamin shops. I live in the high desert of Albuquerque, NM. So dry skin IS LIFE.  I see all the reviewers that have the best results with this serum, either spray rosewater on top, or mix it with a moisturizer, and have great results. Experiment, and find what compliments your success. If you are impatient, and expect immediate results, you will probably not be impressed...everything worth having (improved skin!) takes time.  Even the most expensive products in the world, don&#x27;t render immediate results.  Patience ladies, patience.</li>
            <li> I buy this regularly, and love the added moisture it gives my skin. Good consistency. Good value.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases i&#x27;ve ever made.....currently using it on my skin with a Vit.C serum after microderm. sessions.....fabulous results, even using it by itself the difference was noticeable, but after combining it with the microderm and vitamin c the results are astounding!!! def. worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I use this after my peels.. and it really helps smooth my skin. even on open scraps or burns it helps soothe it without irritating it,i love it. it also helps my sking look clear. &#x3D;) i will definetly continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> great for pimples and dark spots. I have had a 2oz bottle for years and it has done wonders for my skin. every time someone uses it they order it right away. It will peel dark spots over night and shrink pimples over night as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problem skin: sensitive and T-zone oily at the same time with breakouts at that time of the month....a gal&#x27;s nightmare. Well, let me tell you, after a couple of nights of coming home late and being tired of going thru my diligent night routine, I just washed my face, patted dry and dolloped about a dropper&#x27;s worth of serum on my hand and proceeded to massage all over and on my neck, nape and shoulder/chest area. Went to bed. Next morning, I felt my face soft and not taught as usual (I live in SoCal, drier air)....next two nights, same routing b/c of long days and general tiredness...by day three, I woke up and I just stared and stared at my face....I looked 10 years younger (I&#x27;m 42). That very same day, I received 3 compliments on how well-rested I looked and what pretty skin I had.....I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on, but this is all I put on now in the p.m. (different cream in the a.m.) and for the past week, my skin seems to have healed and normalized and I feel almost like a person with a different face!! I&#x27;ll update in a month or so, b/c after having tried dozens of creams, I can&#x27;t believe the way I look and how baby-soft my skin feels...even now, writing this review w/o make up, my skin has an elasticity to it that I thought was gone...however, I do aspire a whole dropper&#x27;s worth and use all of it and I do massage until my skin absorbs it all, like a mini-facial....that may be the trick, the quantity I use, but it looks, regardless, that the bottle might still last me quite a bit....I think I have found my Leprachaun&#x27;s Pot of Gold!!! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My theory is that it super hydrates ... They suggest to use it mixed in with collagen cream... but I use it straight on my face and sometimes on my hands, usually at night then when it soaks into my skin I put some cream on top because I&#x27;m not totally used to not feeling cream on my face. This is my second batch and I want to try it some more before I totally decide whether it works or not. I&#x27;m guessing this is what all those really pricing under eye serums are actually made of... so this a much cheaper answer. It feels like it tightens the skin just a little too.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. helps keep my acne under control</li>
            <li> It seems not enough time to review the product objectively. So far, it seems making my face firm by making the skin tight. It doesn&#x27;t seem to give moisturization of skin so may need a lot of moisturizer but still not sure b/c not enough time to try.</li>
            <li> I think my skin is more moist...i actually didn&#x27;t see a big different on my skin, because i have never had any problem before.  But just a few months go, i suddenly had a breakout all over my face...so i went to a dermatologist and had a treatment for a short time  my skin already better now, only a few acne marks that left, and then i use the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz.  Until now, it hasn&#x27;t done any magic on my skin, but i do feel my skin more moist, well maybe because it&#x27;s only been two weeks.   I&#x27;ll write another review to let you know my progress on using this Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> I bought the hyaluronic acid serum to see if it could be absorbed through the skin to improve the appearance of my thin and easily bruised skin. I had heard that it was a large molecule that was not easily absorbed.... That is true. I applied it to the back of my left hand and none to my right hand to see what effect it had.... There was no effect after two weeks of application several times a day....I suggest that if if is to work as I hoped, then it would need a carrier of some sort to get it into the skin.  [[ASIN:B003MJ7Z0O Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz.]]</li>
            <li> At one time II was able to afford high end beauty supply products- name brands Sephora, etc. as well as professional facials. I can no longer afford such expensive products/services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, I started reading extensive reviews, watching Utube for suggestions( i.e. this is where I learned that the Monistat Chafting gel has the same ingredients as Sephora&#x27;s primer (is actually better with less additives), etc., and started purchasing Amazon products that are extremely cost effective and in some cases the same product used when I had professional treatment, i.e. 35% Glycolic Acid, Emu oil, Argan Oil, Squalane, Hyaluronic Acid. etc. The Hyaluronic acid has a tendency to dry my face up while firming, cleansing pores. I use Argan oil or Emu oil - small amounts to moisturize afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results - if used properly - provide me the same results as professional treatment. Highly recommend these products but caution to read the reviews, especially on peel products such as the Glycolic Acid, so you do not damage skin and get exceptional results.</li>
            <li> I received this product 4 days ago &amp; have been using it morning &amp; night. I apply it on a clean , wet face, let it absorb, &amp;then put on moisturizer. By morning my face does feel soft, but by afternoon it just feels dry &amp; almost itchy sometimes. Am I doing something wrong? There is no rash or anything visible, it just feels dry! I will continue to use it...perhaps it takes longer? If anyone has any ideas please let me know!!  My skin has never been sensitive so that&#x27;s not the problem. Hoping this works out! Will post later after using it for a few weeks......I have also tried mixing it with my moisturizer with the same results. :(</li>
            <li> I just wanted to experiment with Hyaluronic Acid and this has a very clean, simple ingredients list. I like it . . . just not enough. I know now I like hyaluronic acid as part of a formulation but I don&#x27;t want it to be the only thing. I don&#x27;t regret buying it I just wanted more oomph. I was hoping this would fluff up my skin juuuust enough to minimize pores but it didn&#x27;t work for that, oh well!</li>
            <li> great product and great price! makes my skin look flawless!</li>
            <li> Loved it- spa/dermatologist quality, amateur price- great for at home use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week, and wanted to share how thankful I am for finding it.  As soon as I put it on my face, it felt softer, much softer to where my husband wanted to touch my face.  Nothing else has helped my sensitive and upset, unruly skin.  I feel better about myself already because I&#x27;m not ashamed to look at my face in the mirror, because it looks smooth now, and I don&#x27;t just see lots of pores and little pockmarks from years of troubled skin and picking at my face.  I don&#x27;t imagine this will completely disappear the pockmarks, but I think it has given my skin the hydration it was really looking for, which helps my skin appear much, much smoother.  I&#x27;m hooked.  My hubbie is using it too, he likes it, although he makes jokes they probably pull this stuff out of cadavers.  Even if they did, who cares, I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic stuff!  I have a plastic surgeon in my family, but I don&#x27;t need to have injections or anything because this stuff works great!  My husband noticed it immediately after a month of use and he now calls me Benjamin Button  :-)  I look younger than when we met, no discolorations.  I use it with Olay moisterizer, because by itself it makes your skin too tight.  However nobody believes I am almost 50 after using this!  Great stuff and simple bottle...I&#x27;ll no longer buy 50.00 and up serums!  This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Ce produit est vraiment fantastique. Ma peau est plus belle et lisse que jamais. J&#x27;achèterai à nouveau sans aucune doute.   Excellent product for skin.</li>
            <li> I was coming to the end of the two ounce bottle of this and really did not know if I should write a review or not because I was not sure if I was pro or con.  I did know that when there was a little bit in the bottle that I was going to order more.  So I proceeded to order the bigger bottle.  I may not look younger but I do know that this feels great in the morning and that it helps with my tired bags when I get up.  This morning I realized that I had to write a review when my order had not been received and I turned the bottle upside down on the counter to get the last few drops out.  I did not want to start my day without it!  With threat of not having it, I found out that I am very pro this serum.  I hope my jug size gets here soon!  Update 12/17/2011  It took awhile to receive the 8 ounce bottle which I chalk up to both the holiday season and USPS vs FedX shipping.  I was delighted to receive this after many days without it.  One use and I am a true believer and want to let everyone know that I am definitely a PRO!  Lol</li>
            <li> So far so good and you can&#x27;t beat the price. My skin looks better and more plumped up. I wish it was a bit thicker though, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the positive side first:&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 4 stars because I use it in my very dry hair and it&#x27;s wonderful.  I smooth half a dropper of it in damp hair and then style as usual. It has actually improved the texture of my hair. I have also found it&#x27;s good for patches of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the negative:&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this I was excited to have something to improve the appearance of the skin on my face. I have acne scars, redness and my skin is very oily.  The serum made me break out in small whiteheads literally all over my entire face.  The first time I thought maybe it was something else making me break out, but every time I use it since then the same thing happens, so I know it&#x27;s this serum for sure. I would not recommend this for people with oily, acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizer though. If you bought this and you have oily skin and find that you can&#x27;t use it, try it in your hair instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 and have struggled with acne since puberty. This product did seem to help with clearing up the blackheads on my nose and minimizing my pores, but I stopped using it because it also seemed like I was breaking out more on my chin and cheeks. It may have been a combination of my makeup on top of this product(I use Physician&#x27;s Formula talc-free mineral foundation)because when I used it at night, my skin looked good in the morning. It&#x27;s clearly a \\&quot;miracle in a bottle\\&quot; for many others, so it may just be my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> the 2nd day i used it i started turning red and breaking out in red whelps. it&#x27;s not the right product for me.  i&#x27;m going to use it on my arms, tho, so it won&#x27;t go to waste. if you are new to acid products, start with a 35% glycolic peel. i had the best results with that.  i&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product. it&#x27;s just not right for me. it was too irritating.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I am a long-time acne sufferer and currently an Accutane patient. I add a drop of this stuff to my moisturizer in the morning and it keeps my extremely dry skin hydrated all day. It also looks great under makeup and isn&#x27;t greasy. I also put a few drops on my hairbrush after the shower and comb it through my hair because the drying winter weather and Accutane make my scalp dry and my hair brittle.   The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because it caused an initial sensitivity rash (little bumps-- not really noticeable to the naked eye but basically just feels rough to the touch for a few days). Also, it can make your skin feel a bit tight because it isn&#x27;t an oil or lubricant in the traditional sense. But overall, great purchase!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! I shouldn&#x27;t say that because my secret will be out.  I go in a get a facial ever so often. Prior to using this serum,&lt;br /&gt;ethsteticians  (sp) would always say my skin was dry. This makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the price!!!! tried it for a month. My skin is soooo soft. I&#x27;m 40 and still prone to pimples.. not one zit to date. not to mention my forehead line are less and less each day...also my husband noticed and said my skin is glowing,and to buy stock. so I will purchase again...Maybe not for all skin types.. but if you have dry oily!!!try it....</li>
            <li> I got this item fast which I appreciate. I&#x27;ve been using it 2x a day now for a week (this is Paul&#x27;s wife talking) in place of moisturizer except for around my eyes. My skin feels great &amp; apparently looks better to one of my coworkers said oh how did you get your scars to start to disappear?! That made me happy. I don&#x27;t find it oily at all &amp; thinking about trying a fab on my hair that can sometimes get frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I NEVER write reviews on things I buy.  However, after a lot of research and looking over other reviews I bought this product......and I am soo satisfied!  It makes my skin feel awesome.  After I apply it, my skin feels tighter and moisturized.  Granted, I do use other products.... But I think this is going to be a great addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I like to use simple basic products, not stuff that has 50 ingredients I can;t pronounce.  This is pure hyaluronic acid serum, nothing more.  It really helps my skin retain moisture, and I am an active outdoor person age 58.  My skin loves this serum and I use it on my neck too.  Very good product and a very reasonable price for a generous bottle.  It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> WOW! I love this stuff!  I purchased this to use after my skin peels and it worked wonders! It really hydrated my dry peeling skin well! I now have recovered from my home peels lol and I mix it with my moisturizer. It has made a big difference in my skin texture , dry areas gone, didn&#x27;t make me break out , didn&#x27;t make my oily areas oily!  I love this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what this was supposed to do for my skin... i thought it might get rid of the dryness and cracks i got around my nose from years of using the neti pot... but the only thing this stuff did is give me really bad EXTRA milia bumps i was trying to get rid of on top of the dryness... i had milia bumps on my cheeks for about 5 months straight that i had finally gotten down after using other stuff on amazon i bought... and after putting this stuff on my skin and jojoba oil on top like someone on here said i just broke out in really bad tiny bumps... both times i used it... the first time i didnt use a moisturizer and the second time i did... both times i got the bad bumps... which are hard as hell to get rid of.. my skins real sensitive so def dont use if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin too</li>
            <li> Bought the product for my mom really. She used on feet for about 2 weeks and it helped her.  No drying or cracking etc. that the cold winters can bring.  Reason this isn&#x27;t 5-5, is the bottle is glass, it&#x27;s an nice touch &#x3D;( but it fell and broke from my dresser.  But, i am reordering as we speak.  I feel it&#x27;s that good.  Going to make sure i keep it in a safer place.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s really make a Huge difference  in Mt dry skin. Luv, kuv, luv this product!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Have added this to moisturizer. Too soon to tell. Takes a while. I&#x27;ll trust in other reviewers. Don&#x27;t purchase any products without reviews.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the amount for the price. I have just stated using, in my hair, under eye before I apply my creams, on my skin after shower when skin is still dewey wet, then put lotion over. This makes your legs look great :-)</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for the purest Hyaluronic Acid in a glass bottle....this one is the very best! Please continue to keep the quality and the glass bottle!! I am more then pleased with this product and have shared it with many others!! My skin looks fantastic! Soft, lines have improved...face became plump like in my younger days and I can&#x27;t be happier! I have received many compliments on my youthful face for my age! I do put it on my hands as well neck...you name it I do it lol. Seriously you will never regret ordering this product. I will continue too!! Thanks amazon.com for having this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality product and the price is amazing! I have been using this moisturizer during the cold months and it keeps my skin supple and protected against the weather conditions. I would say it is also excellent for sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I use it every morning and night, especially for my face and neck, but sometimes I use it on my entire body and I have to say my skin is so soft after. Would highly recommend this product to anyone concerned about the health and vitality of their skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a year straight. It does help a bit with preventing wrinkles but doesn&#x27;t do much for existing wrinkles. Didn&#x27;t help me with my acne, actually caused pimples.</li>
            <li> After reading about Hyaluronic acid - this was definetly the cheapest one I found at 100%.  I mix it with my face moisturizer and it makes my skin feel like velvet!  After only 5 days of using it - I notice a small difference on my face already!  A little goes a long way.  Make sure you use with any type of moisturizer - as the combo together is amazing!  Oh, I have very sensitive skin and have not had any issues whatsoever with this!!</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken upon arrival!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before.  Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I am quitting on buying expensive face crams because of this product. I have acne prone skin and this works well. I wash my face and put this on in the morning and at night. I put a little moisturizers over it but I really try to massage this in into wrinkle prone areas around eyes and mouth. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results. It just feels like putting water on my face.</li>
            <li> UPDATE Review after a bit under 1 month&#x27;s use:  As originally suspected and others have claimed, the solution I received was as gentle as tears (literally, I accidentally got some in my eye, and no irritation at all). There is absolutely no sort of \\&quot;acid\\&quot; in this--if so it&#x27;s so tramendously diluted that you shouldn&#x27;t even call this \\&quot;hyaluronic Acide Serum 100% Pure\\&quot;... What&#x27;s 100%? it&#x27;s certainly not Hyaluronic Acid.  Anyhow...  For those for whom it worked, or said they received drying or irritation, obviously got a different batch/solution which actually had a much much higher concentration of Hyaluronic Acid, or some other ingredients (alcohol, etc?)...  Either that, or there is some major placebo effect going on here...  And 2 stars, because it the solutions didn&#x27;t cause any harm, even though there was no positive affect either...  *************************  ORIGINAL review:  I ordered this product on Jan 7, and received it in the mail Jan 20--I live in the same city this was shipped from. So I&#x27;m assuming there was a new batch of this stuff that had to be made.  Speaking of batches, there seems to be a recurring theme on Amazon: not all are alike. (without going into detail) E.g. Pur water filter cartridges ordered through Amazon had a life span of about 10% of those purchased through Target--you can see this buyer reviews: initially starting out great, and then all of the sudden you get a bunch of negative ones.  I think this may be the case here--either that or the product is BS; just water mixed with a minute amount of gelatin.  What&#x27;s making me skeptical about my order, is that there is absolutely 0 amount of sting or irritation when applying this product. So much so, that even on an open wound (shaving cut) I felt nothing--it felt like applying water. My vitamin E lotion stings way more than this, and it&#x27;s made for sensitive skin.  So...  What is going on here? So many great reviews, and then all of the sudden we see negative ones saying what I&#x27;m noting: that it&#x27;s just water, or possibly ineffective. Could this be another case of bad batches? I don&#x27;t know... I&#x27;ll report back in about a month.</li>
            <li> I had a facialist use a different (MUCH more expensive) product of hyaluronic acid on me a little over a year ago, I was amazed at how my skin felt and looked after. I was used to looking somewhat abused after a facial, with red mark where once where was acne. But I acutlly looked fresh faced and capapble of facing the world after that one. I&#x27;ve acutally stopped using moisturizer altogether and simply put the hyaluronic acid on RIGHT after I get out of the shower in the morning, to retain the moisture from the steamy shower. My dermatogist was even impressed by how much less clogged my pores are now that I&#x27;ve been using this stuff. If you&#x27;re acne prone and tend to break out if anything oily is even in the same room with you skin this stuff is amazing!!!Plus I&#x27;ve noticed much less redness and quicker healing from the breakouts I do still get. Plus unlike my other moisterizers I&#x27;ve never had burning or other bad reactions from my overly sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 6-8 months now and it works just as well as the super expensive brands (yay!). As the other reviewers have stated you need very little of this stuff to see its effectiveness so a bottle lasts a long time, and since it&#x27;s about the consistncy of water so you have to learn a little bit of a conservative technique for those of us used to slatering on as much moisturizer as we can get.Totally worth it- if you&#x27;re thinking of getting this stuff you won&#x27;t be disappoitned!</li>
            <li> I kinda think this helps but then again no one has ran up to me to tell me how much younger I am looking.  I like to imagine they are thinking it though.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I mix it with my moisturiser</li>
            <li> so far I have not notice any difference but I have only used it for two weeks, but item arrived on time</li>
            <li> The product works great! I could see a difference when I put it on versus if I didnt! Love the size of the bottle too, and for the price you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Product does what it claims to do. Lasts a long time with good results! Have purchased over an over due to positive results.</li>
            <li> Recently I have been using rx topical medication to combat my acne but it dries my skin out horribly and I have even experienced peeling ans burning. So, for some extra hydration, I decided to try this product--combining it with my oil-free moisturizer. The results have been fantastic! Makes my skin look and feel amazing, speeds up healing of burns and/or acne scars and its very sensitive skin friendly. It really does absorb quickly and makes skin super soft. Mix a bit in with your foundation or primer too!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for me. It keeps my sensitive/combo skin hydrated and has never broken me out! It&#x27;s also very good mixed w/a few drops of your favorite facial oil like jojoba, argan, rosehip, etc. I use the serum at night w/the oils and by itself during the day when I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily after I cleanse my face and love its hydrating effect.  Can&#x27;t put on my moisturizer and makeup without it!  It is undoubtedly the BEST skin care product I&#x27;ve ever found, and can&#x27;t believe it took so many years to learn about it.  Try it--you&#x27;ve love it!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good hyaluronic acid serum at a fair price....this product fills both needs. I like the fact that it is in a good practical plain container, not wasting $$$ on frills. I  have used it for two week now, and see improvement in my skin.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This serum, used daily, will give you soft, smooth, even-toned skin.  Smooths out fine lines and minimizes pores.  I think my skin even looks tighter. Will definitely continue buying/using this serum!</li>
            <li> It feels almost like, just water. I&#x27;m not completely sold yet but it has a somewhat plumping affect around my eye area.  Consistancy of baby oil but no oil at all   Sits on your skin until you push it in, its fun to play around with for sure. I&#x27;d definitely mix with a moisturizer for best results. It was a good bargain. I&#x27;m fascinated with this movement so I&#x27;ll post more later if I notice any issues or extreme improvement.    Add:  I put it on my cuticles, my face, a recent burn, it&#x27;s kind of &#x27;eh&#x27;  - I don&#x27;t think this is a dramatic product but I love how it feels on my skin. It&#x27;s like &#x27;clean&#x27; saliva. haha!  I know that sounds weird. It&#x27;s not that dramatic and I felt it was worth the price.  I am going to give some to my mom to try out, she&#x27;s got more aging issues than I do so far....</li>
            <li> Alright, so we all know there are NO miracles out there, right? Okay, that aside, I can&#x27;t exactly say &amp;#34;what&amp;#34; this product does, but my skin looks better. At first, it helped peel the crap out of my skin (first three days), which was weird since I thought it was meant to help moisturize...? Anyway, using this in conjunction with my sunscreen and other products IS the key, and my skin has NOT broken out...which IS a miracle...my skin is rrrrrreally sensitive, so I am always leery of new products. My skin looks clearer and yes, smoother, as in, it is holding more moisture...(I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s)...so with that, this product does what it says it&#x27;s does (for me, so far, anyway!) Give it a whirl, why not?</li>
            <li> It dried my skin and added wrinkles. I will not ever use it again. I gave it away to a friend with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product about 5 times, and I use it after dermawanding my face. It leaves my skin feeling very soft. I like to mix it with coconut oil. A little goes a long way, and I believe this bottle will last me for quite some time. It is too soon to say how it is effecting my &amp;#34;fine lines&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> There are many many better brands.  This is too thin and watery.</li>
            <li> excellent product! makes my skin very soft and it makes my fine lines a lot less noticeable. Use with any lotion over the top for best results.</li>
            <li> I had been using babyface hyaluronic acid serum and i&#x27;m thinking it is better my face is dry in the mornings i also prefer the pump bottle easier to use with the dropper it drips and i loose some and it is too expensive to loose any!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the way this works and I like that after it dries it&#x27;s not oily and it doesn&#x27;t dry your face, but you have to use it with your normal moisturizer. I use it night and day and I feel like it prevents breakouts and has improved my face as a whole. I&#x27;m going to try using it on other parts of my body with vitamin c to see how it works. I recommend this product and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> For ladies and gents, I do not believe in products that helps skin look younger but I do believe in this one.  I am not a walking talking commericial but now I am.  Give it a try.  You barely use a drop and it really works.  Arrival time and package great as well</li>
            <li> it was ok didn&#x27;t get any results from it</li>
            <li> quick ship A plus ebayer  great product  great price, the best for your skin without a script!  will buy again</li>
            <li> I like this hyaluronic acid,Iused it a few days but my skin is feeling smooth.  And the delivery was verry fast even to the Netherlands.</li>
            <li> The ad seems to sell 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid. On the Timeless Skincare website, I found the true ingredient list:    Ingredients    Water, Sodium Hyaluronate (1%; 100% pure), Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.    1% Seriously. I paid $13.95 for 98% water! Oh, I get it. The 1% of hyaluronic acid is pure. They should not be able to say 100% pure. Very deceptive!!!    [...]</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever. Diligently used it for several months.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical prior to purchase, but now I use daily.  It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cure, but it takes the edge of off my forehead wrinkles.  Between this and daily exfoliating and moisturizing, I do pretty well.  For the record, I&#x27;m a 46 year old male.</li>
            <li> Good transaction.  Will recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Silky serum that skin just absorbs great and leaves no residue behind, just soft looking, great feeling, younger looking skin. Need I say more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks; once in the morning before applying my moisturizer with SPF 30 and again before applying my night cream at bedtime.  Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference yet.  I like the consistency of the product and it absorbs into the skin quickly.  I&#x27;m hoping it will generate underlying collagen.  Will give the product more time to see results then review at a later date.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Only thing i would improve apon with it, would be to add a C consintration to it!</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price!</li>
            <li> I cannot go without this.  Approaching the big 50 in a few years and live in a desert.  This is a must.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to go with my daily skin care regime, recommended by my dermatologist. I really like the product, it absorbs quickly and does not leave a reside on my face. I could tell a difference in the feel of my skin in a few days. I was really impressed with the price! Other high end products cost a lot more, and tend to leave a film on my skin. Will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Received it on Monday. Been using it every night before I go to sleep. I wash my face then apply it mixed with a few drop of argan oil. Use it in the morning too. It makes my face feel so smooth and stays hydrated all day. Also makes my makeup look flawless. Only been using it for 5 days now and my skin looks more clear and even.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and evening.  A little goes a long way.  We&#x27;ve recently had Santa Ana winds and this product has really been put to the test!  I have noticed a difference in my skin and am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot of moisturizer after you put in on or your skin will feel very dry.  But it is a good price for the size bottle.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this!! It&#x27;s so inexpensive and really does plump up lines!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I have been using Retin-A for my acne prone skin and hyaluronic acid has allowed for my skin to better absorb my moisturizer and replenish itself, thus preventing it from flaking due to the dryness the medication causes. I apply this right after I apply my Retin-A, followed by a good moisturizer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This serum works. Period.  I mix a few drops with my am-lactin moisturizer at night and i wake up with moisturized smooth skin.  I also use it in my hand lotion in the winter.  No scent, not greasy, rubs in well, blends well with other moisturizers...It&#x27;s GREAT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with a heavy duty peel and the use of retin-a.  This has been an excellent moisturizer, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a great price, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this stuff. It dries clear, matte, and very lightweight, it does not have a smell, it doesn&#x27;t burn, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup. It didn&#x27;t seem like it was working for the first week, but now I can see a difference in my skin. I have not tried any of the expensive hyaluronic acid products for comparison(I was using Source Naturals Skin Eternal Hyaluronic Acid Serum before I switched to this, which I do not recommend), but I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, especially since it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> am I missing something?  this is just like water? I didnt notice it hydrating my skin at all?  I really wanted to love this like everyone else but I dont see anything happening with this stuff for me?  a waste of $...</li>
            <li> I use this as the first layer after cleaning my face in the evening with moisturizer on top. The hyaluronic acid is quickly absorbed into my skin and unlike what it&#x27;s name might predict, there is no burning. Sometimes I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on top, depending on how my skin feels (e.g., is it dry tonight?). I have used it during the daytime under moisturizer with sunscreen. Since I started using this, my pore size has shrunk and you see a lot less noticeable wrinkles on my 55+ year old face.</li>
            <li> Used it for years now, needed more...ordered big bottle this time</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum since Christmas, and I absolutely love it! I don&#x27;t like spending too much money on lotions as I think they are mostly overpriced. This product is amazing, my skin feels fresh and I actually started noticing that somehow the skin on my face started to &amp;#34;fill out&amp;#34; and be more smooth. I even bought another bottle, even though the bottle will probably last you awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is like dropping water on my face, every drop runs right down my cheek.  I can&#x27;t believe it has so many great reviews.  I would give it a zero.</li>
            <li> I got this a couple of weeks ago to try to combat dry skin on my face.  I am 36 with combination skin that occasionally breaks out, so I was looking for something that moisturizes without adding a bunch of extra oil.  This really works!  My skin is feeling and looking better and I have started using it on my legs before I put on Eucerin moisturizer -- wow what a huge difference.  No more dry skin!  I went ahead yesterday and purchased the 8 oz size of this since I am using it on my legs.  If you were only going to use it on your face (a few drops is plenty) then I would suggest the smaller size, because it is quite generous and a 2 oz bottle should last quite a while.  I am so satisfied that I have recommended it to family and friends, something I rarely do.  This is my first review, but again, I am rarely willing to stick my neck out there to recommend something unless I really am satisfied with it -- this I am very satisfied with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE August 2012: I am still using this on my face and body -- more than a year later.  I am now 38 and often get mistaken for someone who is at least 10 years younger than I am.  I imagine that is due to taking good care of my skin and good genetics, but I must say that I think the hyaluronic acid helps to keep me moisturized and to keep the fine lines at bay. I was sold on this a year ago when I bought it and still continue to be sold on it.</li>
            <li> This is a reorder. I liked it so much I dbl the volume bottle and quadrupled the quantity. Use it daily</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it and have high hopes it will help keep my skin from looking aged  Price was right!  Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, LOVE IT...&lt;br /&gt;Its need couple weeks to see how it is work. Wrinkles go away ( not completely), face look  fresh.</li>
            <li> After this my skin feels very tight(may be good for wrinkles), but not realy moisturized. Well, it&#x27;s good anyway, but it&#x27;s not making any miracles, so you guys are overreacting with this reviews.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have enjoyed for awhile, I dont see over the chart results but I like how my skin feels</li>
            <li> I doubt that this product is the real thing for the cost and texture. pure serum is thicker. what bothered me was no product description on the bottle....I believe in needs a carrier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to post any results,  but I like the product and would recommend it since it is 100% pure.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and radiant complexion. Excellent!</li>
            <li> temporarily tightens skin , works even better after applying a moisturizer- 3-5 drops is all you need, bottle is nice- frosted glass, so looks great on my counter top</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum a couple of months ago and I have used it faithfully every day. The product is absolutely fantastic! My skin is softer, and my breakouts have stopped completely. I recommend it to anyone who asks me what I do to my skin.     Now, I do believe that the serum can work wonders along with a great regimen. I do consume 100 ounces of water a day ( a necessity for an active adult in the Mile high city) and I try to eat well also. HOWEVER, I did all of these things prior to purchasing this product and I still suffered from almost non-stop breakouts on my cheeks and along my jawbone. I also used very mild products (Cetaphil) for my face back then and nothing helped, until I added this. So to anyone who is skeptical that this product can help you have great skin--all I can say is TRY it!    I added the serum to my daily moisturizer and I used a drop at night after washing my face (still using cetaphil) to my night moisturizer which is just a dab of pure shea butter. It&#x27;s phenomonal!!!</li>
            <li> DRYS QUICKLY AND FEELS GOOD  STILL AWAITING RESULTS</li>
            <li> I have introduce to many of my friends to use&lt;br /&gt;I use it day and night, will order more later</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice before. The formula is either being watered down or quality control is falling. It&#x27;s not as nice.</li>
            <li> I like this product, however, its not as potent as the product Episilk hyalogic. It is  much more affordable, which makes it very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually mix both products together so that it lasts longer and is effective.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product should be in a dark bottle to preserve it, however I realize that would increase the cost of the product. I usually keep it in the box to preserve the potency.</li>
            <li> I use this serum mixed with my moisturizer twice daily and after a few weeks I definitely see a difference in my skin; it is brighter and feels softer. I have sensitive skin and I have not had any issue with irritation or redness. It seems like the bottle will last a very long time. I am happy with this purchase and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the exspensive brands even better! Been using the Hyaluronic Serum under the Dermalogica Skin Smoothing cream.   I also love the fact that It arrives quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month and it is not a good moisturizer. I have been reading great things online about this type of acid for moisturizing, but I bought this because I was fooled into thinking that it was actually 100% pure (which is what the bottle totally leads you to believe until you read the fine print). 1% is just not enough, this bottle is all water.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, unfortunately I&#x27;ve had a red bumpy rash all over my face for the last 3 days.....it turns out this product cannot be used in areas with no humidty. The serum actually sucks out the moisture from your face if it cant take from anywhere else. I&#x27;m hoping that my face will go back to normal. And hopefully this review will prevent anyone else from making the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona for the past 3 years has had a negative effect on my skin..  My skin has become so dry!  and the texture is not good...  Decided to try Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and after 1 month, I can deffinately tell the difference.  My skin is softer and clearer  I am amazed.  This product works for me.. I use it morning and night before any other moisturizers...  I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for another bottle of 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid I usually buy from a spa in California. I was hoping to save some money and decided to try this one. Well, I didn&#x27;t save any money since I won&#x27;t be using this bottle by Timeless Skincare. There are 3 ingredients and the second one on the list is Benzyl Alcohol. It&#x27;s used as a preservative in cosmetics but is one of the alcohols you should avoid if you have sensitive skin. Well I do and I know there are a lot of people out there who do as well. If you are prone to break outs from certain products, look at the ingredient lists and you will find one of the alcohols as an irritant (ethyl alcohol -- also known as denatured, or SD, alcohol and ethanol -- benzyl alcohol, methyl and isopropyl alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed a difference in how quickly this product seemed to disappear on the skin. I tested it on my hands and compared it w/ the other brand I normally use. The Timeless HLA evaporated much more quickly than my previous HLA. While it slightly improved moisture on my hand, it did not compare to the moisture level from my original HLA. I also tested it out on my face at night. I have dry skin in colder weather and need extra moisture. I topped this w/ a heavy night cream. The next morning, I found a few red itchy spots on my face and my skin felt dryer. The itchiness lasted the whole day and was only helped by extra moisturizing during the day w/ coconut oil. I avoided the use of this HLA product ever since and will not be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO bottom line, use only if you do NOT have sensitive skin. If you do, you risk the chance of irritation. It offers slight moisture but can also dry out the skin after prolonged use due to the benzyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> I would like to have known the skin type that this product is best suited for before I ordered.  I have dry skin and it made my skin even drier than it was so I had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> I use a microneedle roller then apply this product along with Obagi Vit C and a Vit A cream, its a must to have the 3 of those products. This serum glides on like silk and you do not need a lot, very cheap, just remember most expensive creams contain this serum then charge a lot, use it as initial serum over face before your usual face cream.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff and will be a loyal customer for life. I immediately noticed results the first day I used it.  I honestly had no idea what I was getting upon purchasing this item and only did so based on all the great reviews posted here.  It was an accident that I even came across this serum but I am so glad that I did and for amazon having the feature at the end of the page showing what other customers purchased. Lol. I&#x27;m grateful though because my skin has improved Tremendiously. I&#x27;ve only used it for a month now and have not had any breakouts since it arrived at my door and that was very uncommon for my skin before. I always used products to dry out pimples once I felt them coming on. They would help minimize the appearance but could take days to go away completely and I&#x27;d normally give in and pick at it thinking it would look better, which is never the case.  This serum seems like it would not be good for acne because it hydrates instead of drying but you can physically see it work in minutes after applying. I wish I had known about this product years ago.. I&#x27;ll put it on and then brush my teeth and see results in front of my eyes and my skin has even more intense results by morning.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use drying products again and any acne commercial I see on tv now is just comical. Your skin needs to be hydrated and it will naturally repair, look refreshed, and flush away bacteria on its own.  I&#x27;m mad that I didn&#x27;t figure this out sooner because I could have saved so much money on everything I&#x27;ve tried and also had happier more confident days without breakouts. I&#x27;m glad I know about it now and those days are behind me!!! Yay!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a month and have started to see that my skin is smoother!!  Will continue using this product!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the serum for slight acne and a few wrinkles in my forehead, since using this product I have noticed a big difference in the wrinkles they are almost gone! Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle for acne, but I like it enough I will definitely continue using it. It goes on so light and fresh you can barely feel it on your face! I use right after washing and follow with my moisturizer. I also put a few drops on my hands with my hand cream at night to help keep my hands moisturized. I&#x27;ve heard that you can really benefit from HA by humidity, because it draws moisture from the air into your skin and that keeping a humidifier in your room at night when you apply this has great results, but I have not tried that yet. Hyaluronic acid is used in SO many anti-aging products, you can&#x27;t beat the price of this serum and the fact it is 100% pure!</li>
            <li> I use HA in DIY serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take issue with the description of this product. If it was \\&quot;100% pure\\&quot; it would be in powder form and you&#x27;d have to mix up your own 1% solution. Buried in the middle of the page (amongst all the ads) you&#x27;ll finally see that it&#x27;s a 1% HA solution (the highest recommended amount). I have no qualms with it being 1%, after all, I bought it because I was too lazy to mix my own. The other 99% is water, alcohol, and a fungicide (because bacteria thrive in water...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it was an acceptable solution to a moment of laziness. But I shall now spend the same amount for pure powder, mix my own (without the alcohol and fungicide), and make enough to last a whole lot longer than these 2 ounces. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I just got my bottle yesterday and I put it on immediately, my hands were dry and scaly but totally changed.  you can feel in moments the soft moist skin as soon as you rub it on.  I used only a drop as first on each hand (back only) and then my forehead.  even after i washed with soap i felt a difference.  I am always skeptical about stuff like this but this is the first time that a product makes an actual difference.  Just give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used it on my rough dry elbows and knees and they have much improved. I have one very rough scaly patch that I am using more on but it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product, the skin remains not only hydrated, but also slightly tightened, special attention I give the neckline..after a month of application the ability noticeably evened out in this area wrinkles person..looks more fresh...highly recommend this product for day and night care..</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then brand names same result.  Easy to apply face appears hydrated. Takes that early creepy skin appearance away</li>
            <li> I used to pay $25 for one oz of Hyaluronic acid serum. When I saw this product and its reviews, I decided to give it a try. And I love the result! It works better than my other serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very important step is using the softener. I&#x27;ll first apply this serum over my clean face, then the softener (to seal the moist), then my moisturizer. It works wonderfully. My skin is hydrated, smooth and glowing; skin tone is a lot more even, and make up stays put all day. Even my sister was telling me how great I recently look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price plus free shipping is simply unbeatable, not to mention the great result. I ordered more to give to my family as gifts and I received the order incredibly fast. I&#x27;m just very happy with the purchase!!</li>
            <li> I have fair dry skin, and am in my early 30&#x27;s.  I have been using this product for almost a month.  It does make my skin smooth, and I like to use it on my hands.  It really makes your hands look young.  I apply it morning and night after I wash my face.  It makes my face really soft, but I have not noticed anything else.  I also put it in my damp hair after I washed it, just on the ends.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after I blow dried it.  I probably won&#x27;t replace it, once it is gone.  But if it makes a difference in your skin, then that is awesome.  Just didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I had acne and pimples, not much, but they appear a lot on my cheeks and forehead. My skin is oily in T-shape, looks dull as well.  I combine using Clearasil Ultra daily Face Wash to treat pimples and this one to moisturize my skin (since all ance treatment leads to dryness)  AND I&#x27;M SURPRISED at how these two could combine!  No more pimples, and even better, dark spots gradually go away!  I used both for every morning and night. Wash face carefully and apply this liquid to my face. Thanks God I&#x27;ve found these two! Definitely I feel soooooooo much better!</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely the BEST!!!!  I love it!  Even thinking of ordering a case of it.  Leaves my skin feeling clean and supple.  Best beauty aid I have ever put on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product typically in the larger refill size so it&#x27;s not my first review. However, I guess due to the size I got this time, it requires me to do a posting. I love this pure serum and have used it faithfully for the past 3 years underneath my daily moisturizer. It&#x27;s important to mention that because many people do not use moisturizers with Hyaluronic Acid and thus fail to get the proper results. It&#x27;s not a stand alone product. When used correctly, you will have flawless and dewy skin all year round. This latest purchase was a gift to a friend who&#x27;s getting ready for her wedding and is undergoing intense skin care prior to the big day.</li>
            <li> I have used this in combination with vitamin c for 2 weeks.I&#x27;m seeing some difference in lines and wrinkles around mouth&lt;br /&gt;and eyes.</li>
            <li> This product increased the efficacy of all of my facial lotion and cream moisturizers (I didn&#x27;t try it with oil moisturizers).  Where I would normally have to put on moisturizer in the morning and again at noon, which I put this on first and then moisturizer on top (or mixed them together), it lasted all day and skin looked dewy and fresh, not greasy at all.  Awesome product.  I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I ordered tis product for my wife and she has been using it for over a month, Closer to 2 months and she says she has not noticed any change. She uses it twice a day, Morning and Night. And nothing...Some of the other customers complained of the serum drying their skin out or making it tight. My wife said, she didn&#x27;t experience any of that, But has seen no change at all. We will look for something else, Will not be ordering anything else from this seller........</li>
            <li> I love beauty products. I buy anything that might improve my skin. Based on the reviews of this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I&#x27;m a Prime Amazon member, but this product is not Prime. It says free shipping, but it took forever to get it! The longest of anything I&#x27;ve ever ordered. Then when I finally got it, there are NO DIRECTIONS!!! Not on the bottle, not in the package, NO DIRECTIONS AT ALL. For all I know, I&#x27;m supposed to put it in my coffee every morning. I looked on their website, but no information there. I&#x27;ve used it for the last two weeks based on comments I&#x27;ve read in reviews on Amazon--not the way I want to learn how to use a product, but my only option at this point. No change to my skin. Plus the bottle came in a clear plastic box with no label. The box was filled w/ paper confetti streamers, like the product was packaged at Party City. This product was a waste of my money and a waste of my time. It&#x27;s rare that I post a bad review, but I feel this is worthy information to consider before making a purchase.</li>
            <li> This product glides right on and completely immerses into my skin. I have not yet been able to figure out the long term effects as I have not been using it for very long but I think that it is definitely improving my face.</li>
            <li> This is my second or third bottle of this product.  I will probably continue using it.  It does seem to hydrate well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now...I purchased it on a whim after seeing it as a suggested item...I&#x27;m 31, I have normal, olive toned skin with sun damage and early signs of aging...that I&#x27;m dying to erase!!  I decided to \\&quot;get serious\\&quot; about my skin care and completely switched up my regime...For the last month Ive been using Oil of Olay Regenerist Cream Cleanser 2x a day, THIS SERUM 2x a day, Oil of Olay Micro Sculpting Cream in the morn and a awesome Oil of Olay night cream (forgot the name)...ALSO I have used a 50% glycolic peel 2X a week...well, I barely have any sun damage, my skin is silky smooth with awesome clarity, fine lines are on their way out and I have a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;...I think alot of this has to do with the glycolic peel...BUT the hyaluranic serum is a fab moisturizer after a peel...non irritating and it really \\&quot;seals in\\&quot; the results...here&#x27;s my personal at home facial regime....wash and tone with non-alcoholic toner...apply 50% glycolic peel...rinse with baking soda water and apply hyaluronic serum immed after PATTING face dry to retain the moisture...then apply a light application of Bio Oil...now nighty night time!!1  I promise your face will look fab in the morning!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a few drops of the serum...imo, this bottle should last at least 4-5 monrhs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone used this on the body??</li>
            <li> im very happy with results! im on my second bottle and have seen positive changes in my skin, the serum is light, odorless and absorbs quickly. after cleansing my face this is the first product i layer on, then i follow with moisturizer and sun block, and im ready to go....will continue to purchase!!</li>
            <li> I also purchased this product and used it for about a week.  Very unhappy when I saw it contained alcohol but wanted to try it anyway.  And yes, it really dried my face, actually made it feel rough  and I experienced spots of redness and breakouts.  I would not recomment this product or any one of them that does not disclose the ingrediants anymore.  It may contain 100% pure HA but contains very little of it.  Mostly a bottle of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference in my skin, it did hydrate my skin very well but for some reason it caused me to have tiny bumps along the sides of my mouth and jawline. I didn&#x27;t realize that caused it until I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> this is my second bottle of serum that i have purchased from this seller.  it is no permanant miracle serum , but if used everyday the lines on my forehead are reduced and what is also great is that my skin is a lot smoother.  i have no hesitation in advising other people to use it  thankyou</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to see some results based on the reviews I read. All the ladies in my office have been waiting to hear of my results to see if they should purchase the product.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made a difference and I&#x27;ve been using it for over four weeks. I did look at reviews on line and see that not all Hyaluronic acids are created equal.  It depends upon the percentages used to make the serum.  According  to the reviews I&#x27;ve read, this particular product doesn&#x27;t contain very much.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. It has clear the dark spots in my face and other parts if my body due to burns cooking ect.</li>
            <li> I was allergic to it and my dermatologist told me not to use it!!</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim after seeing it mentioned randomly in a comment on a dermatologist&#x27;s facebook page--I knew it was a stretch, but also didn&#x27;t feel like I had a lot to lose because my face was &#x27;acting up&#x27; so badly at 35.  I was frustrated with acne, blackheads, and always looking worn down.  I wasn&#x27;t blessed with awesome skin and have always struggled with finding products that work.  I&#x27;d read that you need to give this acid a good month before making judgment on it, so I did.  I was already impressed at a month--my acne was less and I felt like the areas around my eyes and on my cheeks were tighter and brighter.  At 3 months, I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle (yes, it lasted 3 months with twice a day use--that&#x27;s a pretty amazing value at the price) and can say my skin looks better than it has in ten years.  My skin is clear, my makeup goes on and stays on better, I haven&#x27;t struggled with dry skin this winter,  and I will definitely continue to use this product.  I am so glad I stumbled on this and would recommend it to anyone who struggles with skin care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/10/16 Still love this stuff! I can tell a difference in my skin if I run out and continue to highly recommend this product for great skin!</li>
            <li> Helps with skin hydration &amp; mixes with other products.  Will know more after using for a month. Have a gel product that works quite well but more costly.</li>
            <li> I use this serum daily followed by a rose water spray toner and wow my skin glows like the skin of my youth!</li>
            <li> At first i didn&#x27;t like it because I experienced some irritation. But after a few days the irritation went away and I immediately noticed a more toned appearance. My skin looks radiant now! I have only used it for a few days but I am very impressed so far!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to apply to my face after I use my derma roller and apply vitamin c.  I was looking for a good vitamin c serum but because my face is so acne prone I was afraid to purchase a moisturizing vitamin c serum so I decided to continue buying my pure vitamin c serum and then use this after for moisture and it works out great!  I have no reactions.  The product is a bit on the watery side but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.  I use it almost every night.  A little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Why did they add benzyl alcohol?  How does that work - on one hand you have HA and on the other Benzyl alcohol?  Which ingredient wins? The moisturizing one or the drying one?</li>
            <li> not sure if this product is working, it is suppose to slough dead skin and give one a glow but it looks and feels like water and does not seem to work as advertised</li>
            <li> Great product to give my skin plenty of hydration. It&#x27;s a must have for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall into the beauty product trap</li>
            <li> seems to work very nicely</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and just bought this product because it was recommended when I bought my Dermaroller. After reading the reviews to see what it&#x27;s for and how to use it I purchased my bottle. I like it a lot and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it twice daily before moisturizing. This only worked OK because I would let it dry on my face before applying moisturizer. And it seemed like more of a barrier in between my moisturizer and skin than anything else. It sort of feels like rubbing egg whites onto your face when applied alone. That works for some, but not for me. For the past week, I have been using a few drops of it mixed with my moisturizer and it made a HUGE difference! My skin feels plump and moist and looks great all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: A few drops (4 to be exact) goes a long way. Works best for me when mixed in my hands with moisturizer, as opposed to applied before my moisturizer. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using this product as it arrive in a clear plastic box with confetti.  It struck me as a home made concoction and there was no information on the label regarding use.  I used this on my face for two months and saw no results at all.  It has no smell, and actually I began to question the quality given the packaging and the fact its unregulated and sold on Amazon.  I threw it out after thinking about it more.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say thank you to Timeless for sending me a requested sample of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I was expecting a small sample size, but there is a lot there and I am still using it.  I do like what this does for hydrating my skin and will definitely be ordering some from you when I run out.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the negative reviews of this product, however in my own hast I ignored them. First this is how I appled the product: Apply to freshly cleansed skin, add a drop or two to palm of hand smooth over face. Apply facial moisturizer directly over top. I repeated this once daily in the morning for one week, after day two my skin started becoming EXTREMELY dry. Let me say I do not have sensitive skin at all, however by day 4 I had hundreds of tiny zits covering my whole face. I had zits in places I have never in my life, my cheeks and below my eyes. To top it all off my face felt and looked like leather. My skin has never looked so bad. I have no idea what this product actually is, is surely feels worse than alcohol. I would compare it to what it would be like to smear industrial acetone on one&#x27;s face. Horrible! Accentuated wrinkles, and caused a rash of zits. This is going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> feels like thickened water, it soaks into my skin immediately. makes no noticeable difference on my acne (which i was really hoping for), but the overall texture of skin has dramatically improved. super hydrating! learned via google that hyaluronic acid retains water extremely well. as it&#x27;s produced naturally throughout your body, it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll suffer any adverse reactions from it. suitable for super sensitive skin. would recommend, esp. for the price!</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It decreases the amount of acne flair ups and helps heal my skin from the eczema and scarring. The product itself doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel moisturized when I apply it so I use some squalene, but the affect are visible after a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year or so and love it. It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated without being greasy. I apply my usual moisturizer on top and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this product when I was looking for something to use after peels. It is great for that but the biggest surprise is how amazing it is to use around the eyes. I am prone to skin tabs there. After 2 months my tabs are gone. Also fine lines around the eyes. I love thefactthet this is non greasy so my eye makeup stays perfectly. After my success, I sent a bottle to my 28 year old son. He suffers from intense dryness around the eyesbut oily skin elsewhere. it istruly amazing the way the skin around his eyes looks now. He also uses it mixed with a lt moisturizer on his face and his breakouts have stopped.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is very good for my oil skin tipe. The price is great. I bought less ounce of this acid in Florence, Italy and i paid 50% more. Is good to know that i can buy by Amazon. Sorry for any error on the gramatic, because english in not my language.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law had ordered this and I tried it and I was so pleased with how smooth my face was when I put it on.  Face didn&#x27;t breakout with use, just continued to feel smooth.  Now I use on skin when I&#x27;m using [[ASIN:B006HTPL8Y NuFace NuFace Trinity]] my NuFace micro current facial machine (instead of buying their serums).  I have other serums, this was a good value.</li>
            <li> Didnt do a thing, used it all and nothing, what a waste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using this, along with argan oil, either on my skin (dry hands, especially) or hair, dramatically moisturizes.  This is my 3rd order and I&#x27;ll continue ordering.</li>
            <li> This product arrived within a few days of ordering. I am not sure if it&#x27;s working because I am also using other product on my skin along with it but I can see the changes in my skin. My skin look smoother and healthier than before. I will definitely reorder this product.</li>
            <li> This make my upper lip to swell up thus hiding wrinkles, but I looked like someone had hit me in the mouth</li>
            <li> Bought this for my face....good price.</li>
            <li> I  have  been  using  this  product  for weeks  now,,,, I  have  noticed  little  if  any  improvement  with  my  laugh  lines. I did  notice a  slight rash  when  using  kit  three  first  couple  weeks.  this  product  sites require aggressive  moisturizing  after  each  use.</li>
            <li> best to use see a difference in my skin great with microneedling</li>
            <li> I am another person with sensitive skin who found the Benzylalcohol ingredient to be an issue. I did a proper patch test and it was fine. Used the serum on my face and neck for several days without noticeable issue. The weird dry patches, overall tightness, and red irritated bumps surfaced after about a week of use. Lesson learned: research the ingredients thoroughly before you buy. There are other HA serums on the market without this alcohol.</li>
            <li> Usually you buy a product and it may not do what it is advertised to do but it at least serves some purpose. Not this product. I don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s in this bottle. I mean I&#x27;ve rarely purchased something that didn&#x27;t do anything, doesn&#x27;t lift, doesn&#x27;t fix wrinkles, doesn&#x27;t moisturize, no great scent; it literally serves no purpose. I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t expensive. Please save your hard earn dollars and pay a little more for a product that at least somewhat does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> This product helps if you have dry skin. I had no allergic reactions or redness from this product. Good if you use as first layer before you put on other lotions, if you can find something that works with your skin.</li>
            <li> i like it because i feel my skin really nourished and fine lines almost disappear&lt;br /&gt;I advise to buy it</li>
            <li> I have only used this serum a few day but I already notice a difference in my skin. Worth the money. I have added a few drops to my lotion and my conditioner. With my conditioner, I have gotten the same results I get from my high priced leave-in conditioner. I will be taking that conditioner back to sephora and using this instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading for years that you should look for Hyaluronic Acid in facial serums but so often the ingredient list is indecipherable.  This one is very straight forward, Hyaluronic Acid.  It&#x27;s light, easily absorbed and has made a dramatic difference with the fine (and not so fine) lines. It&#x27;s a bargain too! I love it!</li>
            <li> The product is VERY mild. The 1st ingredient is Water.  I noticed it dried up excess oil on my face, but that&#x27;s all.  Have been using it 2x @day since I got it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, bought it for my daughter to help clear up her acne, it is working amazingly.  I bought some for myself as a lotion and it is amazing!  Highly recommend for both uses.</li>
            <li> I tried this Haluronic Acid and I like it! This product is very good. I recomend it to every man and women after 30. Very good with law price!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I decided to do a  glycolic peel and I read this stuff is really good for your skin after a peel, so I ordered it. After I did my peel I used it and my skin felt so refreshed, like it was moisturized but not greasy.  A few days after my peel I started to mix this with my alpha hydroxy face lotion and my skin is simply radiant-- it&#x27;s soft, the like fine lines just smoothed right out. . .I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkling (I&#x27;m 47)but this makes my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom! GOOD STUFF.</li>
            <li> It arrived in just a couple of days and I have enjoyed using it.  I know it will take 2-3 weeks to notice the results, but I can see that it is making a difference.</li>
            <li> No difference. Wanted to like. Basically added just water to my face. Pay more and find something more worth your money.</li>
            <li> i believe it works on others but i&#x27;m kinda allergy to it</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND JUST LOVE IT.I USE IT EVERY MORNING AFTER I WASH MY FACE AND I HAVE SEEN SOME REAL TIGHTENING OF MY NECK.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS&amp;#62;  Use on skin first and then over the top with Vitamin C cream.  My Arizona dry skin is revived after just 6 weeks and looks more youthful also.  LOVE THIS LOVE THIS !!!</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time from this company, love it, high quality ingredient plus fast shipping. Thankyou :)</li>
            <li> Hydrates my skin, worth it!</li>
            <li> I put on a few drops of this while my face is still moist from the shower of after I have spritzed mist on my face, then put on eye cream over it once it&#x27;s dry, along with my moisturizer.  If you plan on putting foundation on, put more moisturizer on prior to your foundation, otherwise the hyaluronic acid may make the foundation pil slightly (but only if you use too much hyaluronic acid).  It&#x27;s made my face reduce in creping, has made it look more refreshed and youthful and supple.  The seller is great, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little while now, and I have to say I do see significant improvements in my skin.  especially around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have been adding a few drops to my eyecream and night cream after exfoliating my skin... I have to say my skin has been better and better.  I will purchase this serum again, and although it came with literally no directions, this forum of reviews on Amazon helped me to know just what to do with it!!!  So thanks to everyone who posted their reviews.  It helped me so much!  I can say that I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel good after I put it on, however overall I didn&#x27;t see any difference to my skin.  I will stick to moisturizers that have Hyaluronic Acid already in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It&#x27;s light and goes on so smooth and dries quickly.  I usually keep a  spare so I won&#x27;t run out.  It comes packaged in a box and dropper is very convenient.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.  I&#x27;ve have noticed that the price fluctuates and has gone up a little since I first purchased it last year.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Very effective.  It&#x27;s all you need to retain moisture in the skin.  Can&#x27;t beat the price. I use it with ionic massage device.  ALWAYS get compliments on my skin when I use this.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be SO moisturizing and plumping- it&#x27;s not. I can tell it adds extra moisture but you can&#x27;t use it alone bcuz it dries sticky/ tight feeling. I use a moisurizer that has a small amt of Hyaluronic Acid in it so this serum acts as a booster for that and I can see a difference when used together. So, it helps and for the price I feel its worth it. I think for most people, it will make a solid difference if they aren&#x27;t using any hyaluronic acid at all, but you definitley need moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> At age 50 I was just starting to get the beginnings of fine lines around my mouth and eyes. After three days of using this serum I can barely notice those little unwelcome signs of aging. I will definitely buy this again. I really feel my face is getting back alot of the youthful glow that I had lost over the last couple of years. I put a couple drops of this in my moisturizer and apply that to my face after using my clarisonic brush. Then I use a couple drops of the undiluted serum directly on my little line areas and it really plumps up your skin making lines LOTS less noticeable. This is a wonderful addition to my skin routine. Oh, and I put a little dab along the top edge of my upper lip and I swear it makes my lips look fuller and younger. I love this stuff. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks after a couple months of using my new serum. Aside from my clarisonic, this has given me the most improvement over all other skin products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product, makes skin soft and smooth, and it absorb into skin fast. I used to have dry &amp; sensitive skin and most moisturizers made me break out, but this thing makes your skin moisturized without causing break out.</li>
            <li> I love love this stuff, especially after having either a pixel laser peel or a chemical peel (glycolic acid 35% or salicylic acid 20%). Usually you have to use a reallllly good moisturizer after such treatments because the skin is extremely dry, tight, and temporarily injured. This stuff works so great as after these treatments and as an everyday moisturizer. Yes, I was a very afraid to use it after these procedures because it is an acid after all. However, the name really sounds more harsh then it really is; it didnt burn nor did it tingle when I used it. I also take this stuff in a vitamin pill form for skin care, and it works good on joints. It totally stopped the carpal tunnel I was developing. Anyhow, this stuff works great, and isnt too oily which is a big deal since I have VERY oily acne-prone skin (battling it since early 20s).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and notice a difference in my skin, my pores seems smaller almost invisible and its working very well on my acne. ( I am a 47yr old with acne...wow, I also have oily skin so no wrinkles or lines) Will continue to use and see how well it does on my skin.</li>
            <li> because was not good like they said so they are stole my money it makes my skin sick  i had to go to a dermatologist so the price i a paid was the most expensive customers do something with this  money factory cause they only wants to sell ando dont answer</li>
            <li> YAAAAAAHOOOOZZZZAAA!  Love love love it...want it in a larger size!  The results and benefits over other things I have tried are beyond!  Even using it on my scalp...would tell people with any skin issue including scars, psoriasis etc.. try it!  Even though it is &amp;#34;acid&#x27;&#x27;, that refers to the chemical description!  It is not corrosive or abrasive...feels awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 3/4 of the bottle and have found it to be a bit drying. I apply it to clean skin and then apply a moisturizer immediately following. Don&#x27;t try to use this product alone or it will not leave you with moist skin. I found it to give me mild breakouts if I use it without following it up with my daily moisturizer. I will not be reordering this product as I&#x27;m sadley disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, thinking it might help with mild-moderate acne. I can&#x27;t say whether it helped acne, but it has improved my skin&#x27;s overall appearance to the point where I will buy another bottle when it runs out. I use 3-4 drops with my moisturizer. And, the stuff seems to last quite a while. Anyhow, I&#x27;d recommend it to any person of any age.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid  is an ingredient that the very high priced anti-aging products brag about for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the sample. It has been great so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now. It was a little harsh the first night but no complaints since then.</li>
            <li> This product dries fast on your face, much to fast and doesn&#x27;t do anything but dry my skin even more. There are better formulas on amazon without alcohol. The alcohol in it makes it dry so fast that within a few seconds it feels like nothing is on your skin. Who knows it might be good for drying up poison ivy. I ordered this product and it took weeks to arrive. If you do order make sure you check delivery time it&#x27;s terrible look at reviews for vendor not just for this product you will see a lot of customers are unhappy with shipping time.</li>
            <li> Not to inpressed product does not hydrate skin like the  reviews say :( will purchase this product again.:( don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> it took a little over a month to see results, but i can see my skin getting better everyday. It moisturizes without making your skin greasy…I really love it</li>
            <li> Love it...skin feels smooth and drys quickly.  Pores are diminished and lines appear less deep.  Overall a great product for your skin.</li>
            <li> I add drops to my body/hand lotions. I also use directly by patting a small amount on face after applying moisturizer at night.  My face is moist and plump when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I think this is a quality product at an awesome price. I just finished my first bottle and my skin looks great. The pores on my face are visibly smaller and my lines less noticeable. I put it on my face right before using my moisturizer. I am 49 yrs, I spend a good deal of time outside, and my skin is dry, this product really makes my skin look good!</li>
            <li> I read almost 50 reviews on this product before ordering.  I was very excited to try it out.  I have very angry, acne-prone skin and this product has caused THE biggest flare up I have ever had.  I used it one day...broke out a little.  Used it again the next day...face exploded in rage.  So, although this product seems to be awesome for the majority of users, just be warned that not all that it may cause icky breakouts if your skin is finicky.</li>
            <li> My Mom swears by this product! Hope I see the same results!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I have noticed a real difference in the feel of my face.  The Hyaluronic Acid has softened my skin.  I have ordered this product at least 5 times and will continue.</li>
            <li> Great product at very reasonable price. Will buy it again for my self and as a gift. Recommend it to all ladies who want to preserve their useful look for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003MJ7Z0O Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz.]]</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;serum\\&quot; is very watery. It is the consistency of... sugar water? Slightly thicker than water, but it is definitely not the consistency of what one might imagine a serum to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I think glycerine would prove to be a better/cheaper alternative to Hyaluronic Acid serums. I would love someone to prove me different, but I haven&#x27;t seen any results for my dry skin even when I pair it with other moisturizers. Supposedly, this is supposed to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; onto moisture, but I think it&#x27;s BS. However, I try to remember that all skin types vary!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I purchased this based off a friends recommendation.  She saw the product on Dr. Oz.  I like it so far.  Seems to tone my skin.  Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> great product, does exactly what it describes to do. I add it to the cream I use every day, fast delivery. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use after a VI Peel.  It was great in days 3-4  for moisturizing  my skin  which was insanely dry after the peel.  On day 5 I  dropped the bottle  and broke it :(  After that my skin dried out terribly. I will have to order another bottle before my next peel,  but it seemed to work great!</li>
            <li> This is a great value and definitely something I now buy regularly. Since its 100% pure Hyaluronic acid, it&#x27;s un-necessary to go with a higher priced luxury brand since it should be the same, and this brand is inexpensive and excellent.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz.  I use this night and day. Makes your skin smooth.  I will look for a bigger bottle next time.  Hyaluronic acid is in a lot of expensive face moisturizers. You use this with your own moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product the skin on my face is smoother and firmer and the pores are closing. When I looked at my face before I always hated the visible pores. Now I can barely see them. I am in my 60&#x27;s this serum has turn back the time for my face. I have been using this product 5 months and I am satisfied.  D.B.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face just before i put on a moisturizer,am and pm and my skin has responded well to it.i have very sensitive skin prone to acne and marks....my skin is so so flawless and radiant now to which everybody i know has noticed. happy i am !</li>
            <li> I bought this initially in the winter because, where I live, it is SUPER dry and freezing and windy. I think this product really works because it is really thin (slightly more viscous than water), and soaks into the skin better than a cream. That being said, I always top off my skin with tons of moisturizer even after using this. It&#x27;s a simple product and lasts a long time since you only need 2-3 drops to cover your entire face. I have a love/hate relationship with the bottle because it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s glass, which gives it a little apothecary-type quality, but I don&#x27;t like traveling with it for fear that it&#x27;ll crack. I think I&#x27;ll continue to buy this, especially before the long winter months.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin hydrater I have ever used. Works instantly. Old lady gets many compliments on her skin:)</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me. It feels good to put on like putting cool water on, but that&#x27;s about all its good for.</li>
            <li> best value and good product I have reordered more than once</li>
            <li> I love this product, and have been a faithful user for over 4 yrs now. It has a variety of functions too. I always put a dropper-full of this with my regular facial moisturizer and apply right after washing my face. Hyaluronic Acid has a &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; quality and works great for morning zombie appearance of bags and sleepy looking eyes. I also will drop some of this into a dollop of leave-in conditioner, then smooth it into my hair for a nice, soft, shiny appearance after I get out of the shower. It&#x27;s so very concentrated and will last a long time. I&#x27;ve only had to order this once or twice a year. Well worth it, very hydrating.</li>
            <li> great quality, speedy delivery - everything is perfect! Mix it in your day or night facial creams - just about 5 drops each time - and see the difference. Also a good product for using by itself for those with allergies. good for home and salon use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with a little background as to why I bought this product.  I&#x27;m a medical student, which leads to two things: bags under your eyes from lack of sleep and too much caffeine, and a bit of insight into stuff like hyaluronic acid!  I was sitting in a connective tissue lecture, and heard that hyaluronic acid (which is naturally produced by connective tissue) can bind to tons of water.  I decided to do some research to see if it can penetrate the skin, or if it just sits on the surface.  WELL, as it happens, it DOES penetrate the skin according to the scientific literature (woohoo!), and can go quite deep.  So, here&#x27;s how I recommend using it (since there are no instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with clean, dry skin.  Apply the serum where you want, and let it soak in for like, 15 minutes or so.  You won&#x27;t see a lot of improvement, you&#x27;re just letting it get down in your skin.  THEN apply a good moisturizer over it.  Finally and importantly, make sure you stay hydrated, so you&#x27;re hydrating your skin from the inside AND out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just my two cents on it, and like I said I&#x27;m a student so this is in no way medical advice or anything.  I should also mention that I tested it on the back of my hand 24 hours before putting it on my face, since so many reviews had allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> Best facial (or any skin) moisturizer EVER!!!!  Will order again and again and again...</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before. I like it and would recommend it..Good quality product!Worth the money and at least worth a try for your skin.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing. I have peaches-and-cream skin again, at 44yo! This even helped heal, somehow, my \\&quot;monthly acne\\&quot; - of the cystic variety. I knew Hyaluronic acid is what gives baby skin its softness and plumpness. Its the elixir of youth. As we age, it diminishes, and boy you know it - your skin and joints both tell you. I love my skin again. Wish I bought it years ago. Am now going to never be without it. (I couple this serum every morning and night with La Terre Cosmetique clay mask 2x/week and never need to hit the overpriced beauty counter again. I now have gorgeous skin, for pennies and without relying on a doctor. So happy!)</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night. It seems to help plump up my skin and help creases not seem so noticeable</li>
            <li> Really love this product! A beautiful lady with gorgeous skin came into my office and I had to ask what she used. She told me about this product and because of the price you can hardly believe that it will work so well. It is worth the money and then some! My skin is smoother, more even. I have hormonal acne around my chin and it has even helped with that! My makeup goes on better. Just so happy all around. There are thousands of creams and serums on the market, even within brands they have like 5 different potions, how is anyone supposed to know what to use? This is simple, easy, works great, goes a long way and I will be using this for long time!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any improvement. It&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and have not seen much if any results</li>
            <li> Two stars for not causing any damage but not doing anything useful, either.  Whatever it did at a cellular level didn&#x27;t show up anywhere I could see it.  This was my opinion of a few products I tried over the last year or so.</li>
            <li> I regularly use hyaluronic acid serum on my hormonal acne proned skin, and it siginificantly moisturizes and softens my skin. I use it before I apply my retin-A cream and my acne is well under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product 5 starts because the brand I used before is about five times the price, but didn&#x27;t work as well. I find that my retin-A cream and regular moisturizer absorb much better when I apply this product before hand. This serum absorbs quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to the expensive brands. This one does the job well and I am introducing it to my friends.</li>
            <li> It is perfect and exactly what I was looking for and I will certainly order it again when I need to.</li>
            <li> Works great, recommended by my facial pro for my aging 70 yr old rocesea challenged skin. I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Nice size for the price!</li>
            <li> Part of my daily routine, I have used Hyaluronic Acid Serum for  the past few years and will continue to order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it!  When I use it regularly, my skin looks a lot younger.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and it makes my skin looks a lot younger. It helps generate my skin. I keep buying this product for a year now. I love it.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER EVER be without this!  An absolute must!!!  My only tip is that this must be mixed with another cream or lotion to get results.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning:  I mix with a light cream/lotion for under makeup.  You only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;At night:  I mix with my retinol cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I only rinse my face with water. I only use a cleanser on my face to take makeup off at night and then apply pm skincare routine.  Natural oils keep skin hydrated so I never wash in the morning, I just rinse with water.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I only use it at night. I awake to beautiful, clear, bright skin. I am a 33 y/o African American female. I am always hesitant to use acid on my skin, for fear that the acid will lighten my skin. I have not experienced any lightening with this product. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this daily so can&#x27;t say if that may diminish the effectiveness; Hyaluronic Acid is supposed to plump up the skin so I put this on top of my morning moisturizer but I don&#x27;t really notice any extra &amp;#34;plumpness&amp;#34;.  But is doesn&#x27;t break me out (I&#x27;m prone to breakouts) so it could be I&#x27;m not using it effectively.</li>
            <li> I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! This works well on my skin and under my eyes. Even st the end of the day when makeup under the eyes may begin to look dry. If you lightly dab this under your eyes, it will make the skin look fresh again. I wish this came in a purse size pen. hint. hint.</li>
            <li> I use this with other moisturizers and skin care products that do not have hyaluronic acid in them.  Just a drop a day with my product of choice.  I have read other posts that say this dries their skin, and I do have to agree, it does seem to dry my skin.  However, I do not know if it is this product, or the other product of choice that I use to mix it with.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.  It KEEP MY SKIN SMOOTH, and that&#x27;s why I will keep buying it.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but so far it&#x27;s just okay.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not applying it well, or what the issue is with me.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my skins, but it hasn&#x27;t hurt it either.  More or less meh....</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know about hyaluronic acid, it is amazing.  Research it!  I add a dropper or two to my favorite skin care products that don&#x27;t contain hyaluronic acid.  It is so moisturizing and soothing and such a great anti-aging booster as far as wrinkles are concerned.  HA has been around for ages, and it&#x27;s a shame it doesn&#x27;t get the same press that retinol, niacinamide, etc. do.  It&#x27;s a misconception that it does not get absorbed into the skin.  Google studies.  It certainly does!  Heck, I&#x27;ve even read dermatologists say it can&#x27;t absorb - they need to go back to med school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.  Great price...and it really works!  I&#x27;m about to order my second bottle!</li>
            <li> Great stuff and we&#x27;ll see how well it works.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular brand of this product for a couple of years and I really like it. I use it with a couple of drops of essential oil and it helps my mature skin not to sag or wrinkle.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet. I use this every other day.</li>
            <li> I will admit it took some time to see improvement - it won&#x27;t happen overnight.  And I couldn&#x27;t use it by itself.  I mix mine with a few drops of jojoba and lavender oil - twice a day - morning and night.  It has made my acne prone skin amazingly clear except for the occasional hormonal breakout.  I have already used 2 bottles and have started on my third.  I cannot live without this stuff.  I have received so many compliments on how wonderful my skin looks and so many questions on what I am using.  Like I first said - it takes time, consistent application, and lots of patience.  I highly recommend this product along with bentonite clay and organic apple cider vinegar.  Best skin care products out there.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin, but this moisturizes without making me break out at all. In fact, my skin is no longer oily and is the clearest it has been in 10 years. I am noticing that with continued use, my skin is no longer looking crepe-y from over-drying with other products. I use a sunscreen over the top during the day and apply this serum again at night before bed. It does not feel greasy and does not have any fragrances or coloring to irritate my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of you pure hyaluronic acid serum. Works great for facial, neck and décolletage.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my H.A. on ebay; however, this one contains alcohol and they usually contain 100% hyaluronic acid. As you can see, this seller tries to trick you by saying &amp;#34;100% pure&amp;#34; although it contains alcohol which dried out my skin. Boooo and shame on you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a substitute for the one touted by Dr. Oz however it was not as expensive as that one and I don&#x27;t have to join a club and get my credit card charged every 21 days or so.  I did read several reviews about it where it has no instructions but the side panel does have the instructions and really this is a no brainer. I always wash my face with a good moisturizing cream then pat dry and wait a couple of minutes before applying. You really need only a drop on each area you are going to apply it to. I place one drop each on my forehead, cheeks chin and even a very small amount on each eye lid and I take a drop on my finger and apply it to my neck and I apply it twice a day, morning and night. It glides smooth and dries fast. I have heard that it works well with pure vitamin C but I did not order it so I don&#x27;t know. I have a night cream I use but do so sparingly and it does seem to seep into my skin much better when I use it with the product. I have even used it alone several nights and it does feel like the skin tightens although not so much you feel it will crack as some other skin tightening creams do, nor is there any film left behind. I also use it under my makeup and it does glide on smoother and that is the true test since I&#x27;m 59 years old. No creases seen  after applying powder.  It&#x27;s been about 10 days since I ordered it and I&#x27;ve already begun to see the difference under and around my eyes and around my mouth and nose area. Even the fine wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable. I have every intention of ordering another one but it looks like it&#x27;s going to last me a while since I&#x27;m using only 7 drops twice a day.  I am however going to buy a couple of extra bottles, one for myself and another for my best friend.</li>
            <li> But it does seem to be helping. I&#x27;m in Arizona with a humidity of about 5% this time of year and you feel like a shriveled prune. This does seem to make  my skin look less dried out</li>
            <li> I put this on before anything else</li>
            <li> Received item today. Not greasy. Quickly absorbed into skin. Will update more after few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to purchase, you already know what Hyaluronic Acid does.  This product is clear, and I mix it with my night time routine creams. Make sure you don&#x27;t over use or your face will &amp;#34; swell &amp;#34; up and you&#x27;ll like like a Moon face.  This product works. Moderation.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had an unlimited supply of it.  But this was a good size bottle and lasted me quite a some time.</li>
            <li> I use it faithfully twice a day (a little actually does go along way). I see results instantly, however, in a couple hours I apply more because my skin takes it and I WANT RESULTS! So far, I rate this a 4-star. I hope I don&#x27;t regret this rating.......</li>
            <li> This is okay, maybe I am not using it correctly, seems to dry my face.  I will keep using and mix it with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good product, well priced. Happy with this purchase. Would recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used two bottles of this serum and noticed a difference in my skin after a few weeks.  My fine lines around my eyes are almost gone and I have some major acne scaring that seems to look &amp;#34;not as bad&amp;#34; since using this serum.</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this about a year ago and I have been using it ever since.  It is very reasonably priced and seems to help reduce the wrinkles and fine lines enough that I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about the hyaluronic acid but this bottle is magic, the non sticky texture and easily absorbed into the skin really helps. Love the neutral scent.</li>
            <li> i see trhe difference in my skin</li>
            <li> This is a very good hydrate serum for youth and affordable price with good value ! I got very impressed when I tried it on my face at the first time....will strongly recommend to all my fris..btw it shipped very fast too with secured box</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now, I like to mix it with my face creams.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Keeps my skin smooth and it takes very little product to work.  Have reordered and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Great, i use it to replace my toner, and it workrs better. No greasy, so it&#x27;s a good match. I also feel safe.</li>
            <li> This product works and is much less expensive than other high priced products</li>
            <li> I am still on the fence about this. I have not noticed any major changes to my skin since I started using this about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I use it everyday morning and evening and can definitely notice a difference in my pore size.  The little wrinkles I had are now practically gone.</li>
            <li> I feel tingling and to me that is a good sign, my skin is heavily damage. But a good way to help  your skin and save money (I have spent a lot on creams and skin doctors) is to combine with the derma roller. No, it was not my idea, I have to give credit to my dermatologist.  My doctor did not say which products to use, I went with the ratings, if I see anything less then 4 1/2 stars on Amazon, I will not buy and I read at least 10 to 12 reviews.</li>
            <li> So far I like it. It&#x27;s not irritating and feels nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a miracle in a bottle, but it does seem to bolster my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a facialist.  She said it is the best for dry skin.  I&#x27;ve been using for a month and my skin does feel less dry.  I use on top of my moisturizer in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time because I bought it and want and answer to the question... &amp;#34;what&#x27;s the big deal?&amp;#34;. I see no difference.</li>
            <li> good moisturizer and does what it says it will. Not much else to say except if you want people to fill these out yopu should not make  us do so much writing before it will accept</li>
            <li> I use this every day. Ever since I had the opportunity to get myself a series of chemical peels and microdermabrasion treatments a couple years ago, the esthetician recommended I use hyaluronic acid as a moisturizing aid. After trying a sample (which they capitalistically tried to then sell to me for a wholesome $60), I did some research a.k.a googled it, and Amazon was the first search result.. At $14, you can&#x27;t beat it and now I&#x27;ve just discovered the 8oz w/ pump?! -yes, please.. This product goes a long way. I find a nickel sized amount over the face is enough for all areas. It sinks in within seconds and does not leave the face glistening like some serums do. It really helps to heal any acne scars &amp; put close enough to the under-eye area, really helps keep the moisture there and stops my eyes from being saggy and tired-looking. I&#x27;m hooked on this one!</li>
            <li> I think this really makes a difference.My second bottle.</li>
            <li> So far I like it!  Too early to see any major differences.</li>
            <li> I like this item. There is a lot in it. It has a dropper on it. It spreads nicely on my face. Winter is just starting so I hope it will keep my face hydrated this year while I am on the mountain.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin  Quality produce at a great price  This bottle will last at LEAST 6 months.  I will be reordering.  My skin feels and looks better after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this product.  I have had dry patches on my face,  once I started using this my skin is soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday at least twice per day for 1 1/2 months and I see considerable improvement in skin texture, skin tone and overall appearance.  I&#x27;ve added this  to my daily routine including hands which are working hands not show fancy hands and might yet end up with fancy hands yet (used in combo w/ AHA) even w/o a dishwasher!</li>
            <li> Love it. I am very happy with the product at a great price.  Great for aging eyes and neck and chest</li>
            <li> Use this on face after every shower and before bed.  At night, I top it with a retinol cream.  I have oily skin, and using this serum under makeup instead of a heavier moisturizer works perfectly for me.  Great value and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> SawVeryChange,OrNone At All,Still Trying ItWith other MoisturizRes To Which It Will Work Best With.Will Inform You Of Results. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use serum for the summer because moisturizer is too thick, so I only wear it if I&#x27;m outside for sunscreen. I use a vitamin c serum, but I added this hyaluronic acid because I&#x27;ve been reading of the benefits. It okay, but not easily absorbed into my skin. It is a little sticky and if I wear make up it balls up under the make up. Other serums haven&#x27;t done this. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time or maybe stick with lotion in the winter that has hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is working like I thought it would, but my face seems a little smoother after about 10 days.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good hyaluronic acid serum, this is the one to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I wish I would have ordered a larger bottle the first time.  I will next time!  The fine lines in my face have poofed up.  Love that!</li>
            <li> it will dry out your face , not for mixing in with a moisturizer everyday , it made my skin dry like the desert ..... but a week and a half later my skin is tight and even .... so .......</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and product as described</li>
            <li> My previous one had more gel consistency. This one is kind of watery. And comparing to other brands I really don&#x27;t see any results. I won&#x27;t order this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used up 1/2 a bottle and see no difference.  A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail, already have a positive love the smoothness it leaves when it drys. So far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I mix a few drops w/ my sunscreen for my chest and w/ my eye cream.  My face is oily and doesn&#x27;t need the added moisture or i would use it on my face also.</li>
            <li> Nothing really improved after using this and didn&#x27;t make anything worsen after stopped using it,&lt;br /&gt;It seems like This product doesn&#x27;t do much except for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;However the moist doesn&#x27;t last long too. It drys pretty quick</li>
            <li> The product presentation appears accurate  no tricks i.e., one other product advertised was $39, at the end, it was $204 (Suzanne Summers TV ad). Arrived in timely manner. Pleased, would recommend to others  Darlene Hastings Southern Calif.</li>
            <li> I love it. This is my first bottle of hyaluronic acid serum and it really make me satisfied. It is easy to absorb and make my face look healthy.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen dramatic changes yet but it&#x27;s only been a few months so I post an update at a later time. This far the love the texture and it seems to eliminate pimples when paired with my Derma Roller.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and the seller shipped fast! responded well to email inquiries and was very professional. The product is also as good as what people on here are saying. It smoothed out my skin a lot. And it now has a moisture, natural look to it. Wrinkles are not erased, or anything like that so far...but the smooth and natural glow tones down fine lines for me. It&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I always thought acid was harsh, but this is actually very nice and soothing, a tiny tiny bit goes a long way. I think my face looks healthy with continued use of this product twice daily.  And any extra I use on my neck and hands!</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid is great...price, consistency, packaging.  My daughter even uses it now and when it disappears I know to go look in her room.  She uses it to spot treat some dry areas from the dry weather and I&#x27;m using it daily on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see a difference. But I continued to mix it with a splash of face cream twice daily and my skin is very smooth and even now. I also use a toner twice daily now which may also have something to do with it. I think this stuff works pretty well and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it. My make up goes on so much smoother now than it used to and my complexion is glowing, that is saying something for a 47 year old! I was told just the other day I looked like I was in my early 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll take that any day! So yes I&#x27;ll keep using this product. Use it twice a day and with my facial creams. Works great on the back of my hands....</li>
            <li> been using it twice a day for a month, zero difference, maybe I am just aging to fast this month?</li>
            <li> this works very well, my skin is visibly looking younger and prettier over the last couple of weeks.  I purchased 1 ounce of vitamin c serum to go along with this.  Best to put on clean dry skin, then put on moisturizer after it dries. I use it on my face, neck, upper chest, arms, hands  and tummy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and absolutely love it. It goes on easily and is not sticky at all - absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling great. I have not had any bad reactions to the product. Will definitely purchase again..</li>
            <li> Great serum. It appears odorless, colorless to me. I put 2-3 drops on the palm of my hand and mix with my nighttime moisturizer to apply. It can also be applied separately like any other serum but I wanted to mention my application method because I wondered if it will be effective used in this manner. It is. I don&#x27;t know if it will work better if I let the serum sink in first before using my night cream but I often find myself time constrained or tired at the end of the day so having it produce results with a simple 1-step approach is great. It also means that even if I&#x27;m tired and don&#x27;t feel like it I can squeeze in an extra minute to do this . So far I have not seen wonders but my skin (already quite clear and smooth) seems to be a bit more clear, a bit more smooth. Best thing is I wake up with almost magazine-photoshopped model-perfect skin. Sadly, that effect does not last the entire day but may with time. So far I have used it just under a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con to this product for me is that it seems to be making me a bit more oily during the day but I already have oily skin to begin with. I also have sensitive skin and have not suffered any adverse effects. I did get one minor red bump for the first couple of days but nothing since then. I should mention that my skin is pretty much normal to oily, clear with zero breakouts so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get any bumps at all and it worried me but passed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly to help even out my complexion and for general improvement as I don&#x27;t do much special for my skin. It has indeed evened out my complexion and hopefully will keep my skin looking good or even better by keeping it well hydrated.</li>
            <li> not much to say here if you know how and why you bought it should be no issues right .</li>
            <li> This serum didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I sent it back. I&#x27;ve since read information about hyaluronic acid which essentially say that they work when injected but have no effect when applied topically. Also, it has the potential of actually drawing moisture out of your skin.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this daily.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this hyaluronic  acid to use after chemical peel. It doesn&#x27;t give burning sensation or irritation as any other creams and moisturizes after peel do. It calms and moisturizes skin. Excellent quality and big bottle. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Really good product. it&#x27;s help my face a lot.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brand much better than previous one with vit c.  This feels pure on face.  I&#x27;ve been using hyaluronic acid serum for over 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice daily for lines around my mouth along with diy face lotion and I see a definite change for the better.  The lines, while not gone are not as deep.</li>
            <li> I use this following dermapem or acupuncture roller treatments. The skin drinks this stuff. I am also a male; I use this after bathing... below... No reason to treat any part of the body as an orphan! Works great.</li>
            <li> In less than a month, I can see a big difference in my skin.  Wrinkle are gone.  I was skeptical, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It works!!!!!</li>
            <li> wonderful serum to smooth over the face after washing and before moisturizing - it really works and with daily use, you&#x27;ll most definitely see results in a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m hooked for life now :)</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, my neck, my body, sometimes on my lips - it plumps my skin so well - I also coat and look up my face with squalene after I apply this H.A. Serum.  Cant live without it!  L-U-V it!</li>
            <li> All makeup sold in America contains Hyaluronic Acid.  Check your lists on the containers in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I have two older Brothers and they do look the age.  Just wanted the best.</li>
            <li> Beauty is my passion, so I try Everything. My skin was &#x27;normal&#x27; with no problems before this serum. I gave it a good 5 months and my skin was getting accumulatively redder, drier, &amp; more irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all of the feedback from Timeless, so I took all of their advice and followed their directions THOROUGHLY (none of which arrived with the product).&lt;br /&gt;I tried several different moisturizers over this serum and my skin kept getting worse &amp; worse. I thought I was just getting old and my skin was changing...(37)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I FINALLY stopped blaming the moisturizers and stopped using the serum and my face is completely different! No more irritation, no more blotchyness/redness...almost back to normal. (I have a new empathy for people with sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidence? During the use of this product my hairline receded (all of my little 2-3\\&quot; long hair disappeared), my finger tips were extremely sensitive to painful, and my finger nails were brittle and breaking off like crazy. I thought that maybe I was over-washing my hands (or that I had cancer, whatever). Now my hands &amp; nails are back to beautiful/supple/healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid can hold 1000x it&#x27;s wait in water...It&#x27;s supposed to pull moisture out of the air and draw it into your skin. This product seemed to do the opposite of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: In order of desperation - I used Philosophy Hope in a Jar, Laura Mercier Repair Crème, CeraVe PM, Josie Maran Argan Oil...It was pretty depressing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way - 4 drops EASILY covers your entire face&lt;br /&gt;It soaks right in&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thinner serum, but very easy to control&lt;br /&gt;Zero Odor</li>
            <li> First about me - I am a 32 year old white female blessed with oily skin plus break outs (hormonal acne) and fine lines (between my eye brows and under my eyes) in addition  :-)  I know that the only advantage of oily skin is that it is supposed to look young longer and it might be the case, but in my case due to mimics and my genetic I started noticing tiny wrinkles under my eyes (especially in the morning when I wake up) and between my eye brows few years ago. Some women are blessed with young looking skin but not me, so I started fighting the signs of aging. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I look fine for my age but I want to look better.  I have been fighting my hormones as well as fine lines on my face for many years and though I have lost the battle with acne but I am winning the battle with fine lines.  This is a miracle product!!!  It&#x27;s easy to apply (it&#x27;s almost like water, liquid gel I would say so non greasy at all), it absorbs quickly, I think it even doesn&#x27;t smell (or I just got used to its smell), what else...haven&#x27;t had any allergic reactions (but I am not an allergic to anything), no irritation, no rush, no other side effects either.&lt;br /&gt;My cosmetologist mentioned me the hyaluronic acid as a very effective anti-aging remedy so I became curious and chose this product based on good reviews and affordable price.  Until I came across this serum I had tried many other product that were supposed to make me look like an 18 year old girl when I wake up next morning but I never noticed a difference or visible results.  None made me feel like it worked.  With this serum I noticed a difference after 1.5-2 weeks - my skin started looking younger and fresher.  I have been applying it on my face incl my eyes and neck every night for three months and I am very happy with the results (especially with skin around my eyes).  I can see a big improvement in how I look now. My skin looks fresher and smoother.  Tiny wrinkles are almost gone, the deeper ones (between my eye brows) look smoother. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t control my mimics that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t expect my fine lines to vanish completely.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d started using it few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Few tips from me - I like how I look now, but only because I:&lt;br /&gt;- apply this serum (on my face, eyes, neck) after using a gentle everyday scrub in the evening every day, let it dry out and then apply a moisturizer for my skin.  It is just an extra step in my skin care routine.  Update: I should have been using twice a day for even better results. I realized it only recently. So my new plan - is the hyaluronic serum in the morning and Retinol Anti-Wrinkle Facial Serum in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;- have regular facials (I love professional massage)&lt;br /&gt;- put on anti-wrinkle patches before I go to bed. Especially under my eyes (a MUST for me)&lt;br /&gt;- once a week apply olive oil on my eyes instead of a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Although there have been no improvements with acne (as I saw in some reviews), but overall - I am very happy with this product, going to purchase it again and highly recommend to anyone who wants to look young. Let&#x27;s face the truth - we can&#x27;t turn back time, but we can slow it down. Well, in my case this serum is one of very few remedies that work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I purchased 2 oz bottle and I expect it to last for another 4-6 weeks, so total 4-5 months depending how much you use (I use about a half of the dropper). I hope it helps.ok smoother.

            <li> dries my pimples ..i super love it!!!it did not irritate at all.helps moisturize witjout the greasy feel.Thanks for this nice product</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was given to me by a friend and I have been using it for several months (I am 55). I see a noticeable difference in my skin. Fine lines and wrinkles are a lot less noticeable. I put drops on my face and neck and gentle smooth over my skin before eye cream and moisturizer. This is the first time that I ordered the product myself and it arrived within 5 days.....very quickly! I will continue to use this forever!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this acid serum in the hope of minimizing my pores. And it&#x27;s working for me!&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks after I started using it I went for a facial and the lady who looked at my skin couldn&#x27;t believe how much my skin had improved (I had not told her I had been using a new product). It made me feel good to see that it wasn&#x27;t just an impression :-) Very happy with this product. My skin is a drier and I have mixed skin. So I make sure to keep it hydrated with a day cream. I do like the fact that my nose is not shiny anymore though...</li>
            <li> This is a great serum for the price. I use it in the am and it seems so far to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My skin is better than it was when I was young and I just turned 61.  I attribute this to my use of this product along with my retonoid product.</li>
            <li> Nothing else needed but Vitamin E Oil...all the money I wasted on fancy creams..what a shame. Put Vitamin E on first allow to absorb in and then apply Hyaluronic acid. Whala!</li>
            <li> i use it with the squalane...goes on like thick water-- if there was such a thing--feels like pure moisture...feels great</li>
            <li> This was a great way to get introduced to Hyaluronic Serum.  Not sure if it&#x27;s did anything for me yet, but I&#x27;m sure it takes a little while to really notice any difference.</li>
            <li> When I opened the boxes inside the shipping box I had two broken GLASS bottles with NO product!!!!  I want my product resent to me. Not sure what happened. The shipping box did not look as if something had leaked. When was attemping to open the product from their box it was a apparent it was not properly bubble wrapped. I coud get at the broken glass with out unwapping the bubble wrap! TWO bottles of broken GLASS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my product reshipped properly and I want what I PAID for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on your skin. If your eyes are puffy in the morning, it helps to relax soothe them. As for wrinkles I did not notice a difference and my esthetician said I wouldn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s best injected in the skin. But as far as making your skin feel smooth and temporary plump, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Apply in the morning and night and I think it has helped. I use this product with vitamin c serum. Applying twice daily more at night and lightly during the day. Don&#x27;t forget the neck and chest with this and the vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Dr Oz recommended it for wrinkles.  This is the second product I have tried that Dr Oz recommended,  that didn&#x27;t work.  I have seen better results from many other products.  It is so messy and often drips from the tube, it can also run down your face.  I used this for about 3 months, twice a day.  I&#x27;m throwing the rest away.</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted, I am using it for some years and it works really good, I am 55 years old.... I recommend it... very good product...</li>
            <li> A great addition to my skincare routine.  No one believes that I am 81 years young, and that is just fine!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for just a short time. It is light-weight and little goes a long way. It makes my skin feel moist. It isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> you can use it on your forehead instead of botox. within 2 weeks, deep frown lines softened up to the point of not showing on pictures. and you can use it on your hair - after washing, while still wet, just massage a few drops into your tips. you will have bouncy, moisturized locks like you never did before.&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell this product did much there r much better serums on the market</li>
            <li> there is nothing better</li>
            <li> Wonderful! As another customer suggested, I paired this with rose water. Pure brilliance! It really does what it says it will. Plumped my skin and got rid of all those fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product is a great find!</li>
            <li> I have been using hyaluronic acid for more than thirty years.  I originally purchased it when I bought a new product that was being advertised in [of all places Star].  I used it for my face, but then one time I got a horrid sunburn on my shoulder.  It was the only place I missed when putting on sun block and I use spf 100 now, but back then only 30.  I decided, since I had nothing else, to use the cream.  OMG, it immediately took away the pain, the next morning no blistering, no freckles, no red, it was a nice even tan.  I have used it ever since.  I use it on everything besides my face, burns [bad ones used in conjunction with six day bandages] bad, bad puncture wounds on my leg from a dog fight, no infection, no scar [other than a very small white area], precancerous skin growths from my arm being exposed to the sun while driving every day, and, even I find this incredible, plaque psoriasis on my arm.  I didn&#x27;t even know it was that, I just had some red scaly patches on my arm that were getting bigger and so, I started rubbing them down and in three weeks they were gone.  I really love this stuff.  I use it for everything.  And when I tell people I am 68 they cannot believe it.</li>
            <li> So far I m waiting to see a difference it&#x27;s been only a couple days of use</li>
            <li> The  price  is  fair  and  in  combination  with  vitamin C serum -  it  could be  helping :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product, skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> Great price for 8 bottles, I use very little in making homemade facial and body serums.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for adding to your homemade moisturizer.  I buy this at least once every three months</li>
            <li> quick delivery and I love this product!</li>
            <li> Item totally damaged. I am really upset about it……..delivering is so bad and I was waiting a long time for it…….</li>
            <li> i love this product so much i ordered it again my skin is so soft after a few weeks of using it. really does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for three days, so I can&#x27;t tell you it&#x27;s long term effects, but I can tell you that I saw results after just two days. My skin is looking absolutely GORGEOUS. My pores look tiny, my skin is looking very clear, and my acne scars look more filled in. Seriously, I&#x27;m 26 and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked so close to perfect in probably eight years. I will post a follow-up review later on, but right now this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried and I could not be more over the moon. I can&#x27;t wait to tell EVERYONE!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !  it works and will order more</li>
            <li> good stuff, does what it says, great for derma pen or derma rolling.</li>
            <li> My skin really broke out after using this. I tried it a few times with the same results. I&#x27;m disappointed because I know many people have great results with it. I will say that it makes your skin very soft though!</li>
            <li> helpful to fighting effects of aging</li>
            <li> tried over 2 months. useless does not feel any change. just like tap water.  don&#x27;t buy this product. you will regret. i am now very skeptical good reviews given</li>
            <li> i dont notice much a difference in a bad way or good. when i mix it with my lotion as what i learned you should do with it because it helps keep moisture in your skin but doesnt supply it, i notice a slight difference but i cant tell yet if its from this or just wishful thinking. also though i have had no side effects either.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...I just ordered it again...thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and definitely feel there is a difference in my face. I have done a trial using it on the top of one hand only and can see the hand with the serum is has more smooth skin than the one without. I definitely will reorder again.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for a couple of weeks.  Still waiting to see&lt;br /&gt;some remarkable results.  Maybe it takes a little while longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually changed my entire skin routine!  Love, love, love.  I put it on in the morning, after I&#x27;m done in the shower and before I put moisturizer on my face.  It is hard to describe the feeling, but I feel like it makes my skin absolutely glow!  When wearing this under moisturizer and a bb cream, it gives me a nice, dewy glow for the summer.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day for almost 6 months now, and it is one of the few beauty products I have stuck with for so long.  Definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> I picked this up after I saw a presentation on Dr Oz.  I use it on my face 2X a day before applying moisturizer/sun screen and it makes a big difference.  I looked all over and this product was at least 1/2 the price of any I found anywhere else and works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now. The change in my skin is remarkable. I have tried numerous other skin care products ranging in price from $5 to $90,this little bottle surpasses them all.  I have combination acne prone skin  that until now was difficult to care for. Add a little of this serum to your favorite moisturizer and watch the transformation. Great price, Great product!</li>
            <li> I liked the smooth, almost gelatinous feel of the serum.  It&#x27;s very soothing after a peel.&lt;br /&gt;Good product. I put mine in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It takes time to see results...I did not see results overnight. You&#x27;ll wake up one morning and walk past the mirror and say &amp;#34;oh, my face looks goood&amp;#34; Results visible after 2 week of use in thh morning and evening.</li>
            <li> This goes on very well goes right into your skin and it dose feel very good on your skin. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This product it is amazing . I love it!! My face is smoother, looks very shiny. my face looks younger and firmer. The fine lines are barely visible, I am delighted with this acid. and I have only a month of using it. I recommend this product 100 percent.</li>
            <li> Excellent, specially for skiing damage and repairs. I recommend daily use.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and soothing. The price for the amount is also very generous. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have spent sooo much money on facial products i cant believe it.  but finally i found this and i dont need anything else for every day use.  my skin has started to heal and get rid of the lines and sagging.  this is a must to try.  it takes a few weeks to see the difference but there is a big differce in my skin and i am over 65.  I also use dr denese facial pads every other day.  this product i use twice a day on clean skin before makeup.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Product is like water but I suppose that&#x27;s how its meant to be. I&#x27;ve used it for a good 2 weeks now. My skin is smoother and slightly less break outs. Will continue to use and monitor changes.</li>
            <li> The best product to use on your skin. A friend of mine went to school for cosmetology and said it was great for my skin. I will repurchase when it runs out!</li>
            <li> I have not yet experienced any noticeable improvements with wrinkle reduction, but then again, I have not used the serum as consistently as I should have. I will apply 2x a day and re-evaluate the product in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t made up my mind on this one yet. I think I would like something a bit more organic.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference after 2 weeks.  Seems to dry my skin as I am prone to oily skin.  I use under my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Many expensive facial lotion will have this serum as their ingredient .  I definitely love using this serum with my everyday facial lotion.  It helps hydrate my skin when the weather is cold or dry.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is doing what it is touted to do, but still using.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the benefits others have, even after trying the various suggestions found in other reviews. I now use a vitamin c serum with hyaluronic acid in it so I won&#x27;t be reordering. However - the price is good and the shipping fast. I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds the moisture well.  Mix with your other creams or use alone.  Apply to clean damp skin and you&#x27;ll soon feel more hydrated and look more dewy.  I use it under foundation and with other creams at bedtime.  It&#x27;s a clear thickish liquid.  No smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this and feel it works for me...fast shipping.....item as described...great transaction....will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly a year now, and have been very happy with the results. Although, I have not noticed any major changes in wrinkles, my skin looks healthier and I do not break out as often.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, and especially when used with Squalane (not Squaline). I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> This is a product that you have to know what it is for because it has no instructions or directions.  I decided to use it as night for best results.  It really works.  You just have to be consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for two years. It was recommended by my medical esthetician for problematic facial skin problems. After I was my face with Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel (removes skin buildup and clears up acne), I place a warm wet washcloth on my face to hydrate my face, then apply the Hyaluronic Acid Serum mixed together with my moisturizing lotion (CereVa Renewing Lotion).  This process keeps my face glowing and soft. It also greatly reduces facial lines and keeps my face young looking. I have sensitive skin and this process has worked better than any other products on the market!  Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops in with my argan oil and massage it into my face, neck &amp; chest every day, and a year later I&#x27;m not wearing foundation! A little eye makeup &amp; lip gloss is all I want.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 48 &amp; my complexion is very smooth and even. I get a lot of compliments about it too!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great price.  Feels great.  Have purchased off and on for three years.</li>
            <li> I cannot not use this product&lt;br /&gt;throw out the junk and buy this&lt;br /&gt;you wont be sorry</li>
            <li> will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> Add this to all my lotions.</li>
            <li> so far it is great, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about two weeks now and my skin seems to be brighter and soft as a new borns. I use the product along with my skin fitness therapy products. I also made a homemade facial scrub using natural honey from fair trade and sugar and put a few drops of the product in that as well. I am an AA female with sensitive skin, and I have had no break outs or bad reactions from using this product.</li>
            <li> Mix this with Virt c 20% absorbic acid and you have a wonderful skin conditioner. My complexion just glows and it is so soft and looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> This product is great..I see a difference with my skin. I like it&#x27;s in a glass bottle with a dropper. Nothing wasted. I purchased another brand with a pump and it squirted everywhere</li>
            <li> I trust this product from Timeless Skin Care.  I purchased a bottle in 2011. Its now 2013 and I have been a repeat customer ever since.  I definitely recommend adding this to any skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews for hyaluronic acid as a beneficial ingredient in topical skin care.  I bought this product, as opposed to finding it in an ingredient in a skin care product.  I was apprehensive since the name includes the word \\&quot;acid\\&quot;.  But, I gave it a try.  Initially, I used it as a skin test for a week, in a selective spot - No issues whatsoever.  Now, and for quite some time, I use it daily. I apply it to my face, including near the eye.  Of course, you should proceed with caution to determine whether you have any special sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consistently buy the product by Timeless. I use it daily.  I apply it to my face, neck, upper chest, and at times my arms, hands and hair. I use it in conjunction with my skin care products.  I love how it gives a glow to the skin. When it dries, the glow remains. I love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only experienced positive results.  No burn, dryness, redness, oily effect, clogged pores, acne or other negative side effect. It feels like a watery gel, something like aloe without any sticky-ness. Also, I have not experienced any issue with this particular product not working well with my skin cream, lotion, make-up or spf (What I mean is that some products when used in conjunction with others results in a gel or rubber like substance that rolls off when rubbed - not this product). The product lasts a good while, the 2 oz. is likely to run out in 4-6 months, with frequent use; you do not need allot of it for each daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do some online research, there is plenty of information concerning topical Hyaluronic Acid.  Here is something I found online at: [...]in a article discussing why your skin needs Hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid plays a key role in the skin&#x27;s extracellular matrix and has been shown to maintain hydration, improve elasticity and protect against free radical damage. In the skin, hyaluronic acid is responsible for capturing water, in turn maintaining the smoothness and plumpness of the skin. When hyaluronic acid is depleted, skin can become dehydrated and lose elasticity, which accentuates lines and furrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use skin care products containing hyaluronic acid, it works by absorbing available moisture from the environment and water already present in the skin. Hyaluronic acid helps the skin retain this moisture, and has a temporary plumping effect on fine lines and wrinkles as the molecules swell. But hyaluronic acid is a costly ingredient, which is why it&#x27;s important to choose a product with an effective concentration. As a general rule of thumb, the higher up on the ingredient list the hyaluronic acid (or sodium hyaluronate) is, the more potent the product, which means better results for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only purchased the Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure from Timeless.  I trust it, and I can tell that it helps to combat the aging process.  If you want to take great care of your skin, include this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I am not affiliated with Timeless - whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this will help someone like me, who wants to take care of their skin.[[ASIN:B0047AKVW6 Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure Refill 8 oz]]</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my face and neck. It works great for my oily skin to balance out my skin tone and keep me freshly hydrated without any film left behind</li>
            <li> it is great for your skin. i mix it with moisturizer. alone it actually helps skin heal faster from peels and any abrasion. it is great will reorder.</li>
            <li> This product is suspiciously indistinguishable from plain old aloe vera in every way. And it made absolutely no discernible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> In love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, giving my skin enough moisture &amp; hydration. It made my skin glowing &amp; youthful texture. Yes I do wear this under my makeup &amp; it doesnt tranfer it.&lt;br /&gt;dont expect..instant miracle from it. you can feel the difference after two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Ps: Dont use it alone ( like other serums), you need to mix it with your day cream/ night cream to see the effect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this works or not but I like to think it does.  It is very easy to use and I use it before bed with a moisturizer applied after it is absorbed .  I don&#x27;t think I will reorder though.  No literature with it so hard to know if you are using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering this soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it takes a while to notice the results but I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and I wont do without it now,&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother plumper and firmer. I use it first, let is sit and then layer my cream on top.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve uses all kinds of serums and creams and always switch, so for me to be reordering 3 times is a testimate to how well it works for me. The price is great too!</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product from this seller.  I add this to my facial cream.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase on these. I have been using every day after I wash my face, put my Obagi toner, then get a small drip and spread all over my face in the morning and at night before I go to bed. I can see great improvement in my skin. I feel that my face looks glowier, plump, and tight. I believe that this product works really well from the outside. Since people are injecting acid hyaluronic as a filler, I thought, why not apply from the outside, eventually my skin will absorb and be plump just like the injections. I think my wrinkles are getting less deeper. I recommend this product to anybody that likes to apply serum in the face.</li>
            <li> great product as expected. I made with it my own hyaluronic + glyco-lactic serum! Its MUCH MUCH cheaper than buy a premixed product from different manufacturers. 1. Quality of  hyaluronic base for my serum from this seller is outstanding(!) 2. Make sure if you make your own  hyaluronic + glyco-lactic serum that glyco-lactic part of this serum is NOT MORE 15% from 100% ready to use volume. (If you are just starting with acids than you better to start from lower amount glyco-lactic in your serum)  So to say normally I use:  glyco-lactic 15% and hyaluronic 85%. I use daily and many times twice a day (if there will be no Sun exposure).Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Pretty much did nothing.  I can tell it&#x27;s not just water (because of how it feels -- it has a very slight viscosity), but it might was well be.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this because of other reviews. I was looking for something to soften aging wrinkles and tighten my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I&#x27;m not sold yet. I&#x27;ve tried using it straight and mixed with my moisturizer. If there is a tightening after using it, it&#x27;s very subtle. I guess I did it backwards, but since getting it, I&#x27;ve done some more research and found that it is used more for medical reasons than cosmetic. It&#x27;s used for joint disorders, eye surgeries, and helping to heal skin wounds. At least there are no bad side effects and I&#x27;ll try it on my next cut or burn to see if it does help healing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer.  I noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li> Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> The product seems as if it is water.  have used it faithfully twice a day since receiving it and have not noticed any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle but did not see the significant result as others. Will not but it again. Was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a MUST BUY--esp for people who suffer from eczema!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great when used properly.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after I use my derma roller for extreme moisture and I also use this on a nightly and daily bases.&lt;br /&gt;You can either mix it in with your favorite moisturizer or you can use it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has improved my dry skin during the winter months and even in the summer when temperatures where 100 degrees out here in LA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also-- extremely fast shipping and great packaging!!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid  is wonderful for your skin. It gives skin a fresh young plump look. This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> not sure about this one yet, It might be due to my age and this being the reason why I do not feel any difference. I might need something specific for my age 58.</li>
            <li> Good used every other day under all other face products be careful in sun</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple of weeks.  Can&#x27;t tell much difference so far but will give it a few more weeks. My sister said she could tell a difference - an improvement.</li>
            <li> Hoping to see results or prevent wrinkles.  I would prefer a pump bottle. It spreads easily and feels good. It puts moisture into my skin.</li>
            <li> This product filled up my atrophic scars from cortisone injections into keloids (in combo with derma roller), super soft baby skin, and thicker lips!</li>
            <li> I do not know what it is, but I really got used to this product, and I like it a lot! Just as other reviewers said - most effective when used on damp skin and under moisturizer.   I just finished my 2oz bottle, and I think I am going to reorder, but bigger version :)  I used it daily on my face, and also on my very dry knees and elbows. I cannot say it changed anything permanently, but when I put it on and finished with body lotion, it felt really good.  As for the face, again - no permanent changes, but I would have that glow that I thought was really nice :)  I also have had dry patches on my face, and when I used this product (together with my face moisturizer), it was not an issue anymore - so that is a huge plus for me!  Generally - I woud receommend it, and I will definitely reorder it.</li>
            <li> I received this very quickly from the supplier and it was packaged well.  However, I have very sensitive, adult acne prone skin and it seemed to make me break out.  I haven&#x27;t given up on it yet as it could&#x27;ve have been caused by my hormones.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the basis of many articles out there marketing the benefits of hyaluronic acid as an anti-aging must-have.  This is 100% pure hyaluronic acid, but I have not seen any difference after using this product for about a few months now.  The name &#x27;serum&#x27; gives me the impression that the product is a bit thicker, but it is actually more watery than what I was expecting.  I mixed it with my moisturizer, or use it under a moisturizer.  Made ZERO difference on my skin, which is neither more or less vibrant, neither more or less wrinkled, and neither better nor worse skin than when I started it out with.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003MJ7Z0O Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz.]]This is the first time I have used this product.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My skin was in a disaster state. When I started using this [[ASIN:B0047AKVW6 Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure Refill 8 oz]] my skin did a complete turn around in 24 hrs. I am hooked and thank God I found it. Add it to your daily regimen. It has a lot of beneficial effects. Research it too!</li>
            <li> From all reviews I understood that this product is wonderful. Ordered... Got on time... Nice package ... But no direction on how to use it!!!!... None!!! Nowhere!!! Common! Can you be more specific ! Now I have to browes websites and try to find direction ...:(  Any help guys?!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this by itself I add a few drops to any and all facial lotions I use and it&#x27;s great.  Noticed a difference in my skin after the first few uses.  I&#x27;m going to get a facial peel this next week and will use this in the sunscreen/lotion.  I understand it helps speed up the results of the facial peel.</li>
            <li> Great product without prescription, but be careful not to leave it too long on your face. I used Q-tips and leave it on for a minute and wash off immediately with cold water several times. Don&#x27;t leave on too long or else face will be red and painful. This is too acidic.</li>
            <li> I liked this product much.</li>
            <li> I was using Reviva Hyaluronic Acid Serum for several years with great results. I have dry skin and Reviva plumped my skin and helped me retain moisture.  I decided to try this(Timeless) Hyaluronic Acid to save some money. Well, you get what you pay for. This product  did nothing but dry out my skin. There is alot of alcohol and water in this product and it shows. Save your money and buy a quality Hyaluronic Acid product to get the skin plumping and moisture retention that one can get from a good Hyaluronic Acid serum.  I wrote to Timeless and their response was a bit sarcastic. I will never order from this company again.</li>
            <li> It works great so far .. I can see a difference in only a few weeks .. Will but again</li>
            <li> Great for skin . Little goes a long way. Definitely see the difference in my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It really does reduce lines, feels great, and combines with makeup or sunscreen etc. well.</li>
            <li> I love this Timeless Hyaluronic Acid Serum for my aching knees.  Tried a more expensive one after first buying this thinking it would do a better job, but I was certainly wrong.  Won&#x27;t change again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product . I was getting jowls the sagging skin from under the cheeks. In the time it took to finish the bottle they were almost completely gone. I for one will continue to use this product. I&#x27;m ordering more right now !  JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, very pleased with the product.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  Very easy to use and goes a long, long way.  I had no reaction even with my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite weapons. I tell EVERYONE  of any skin type to get this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and people comment how I look like I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s all of the time. Yes, it&#x27;s mostly genes, but this stuff moisturizes my acne prone skin and gives it an even more youthful glow!</li>
            <li> Bought for wrinkles after hearing Dr. Oz suggested it. Takes a few weeks to see a difference but it works. Not a 100% but big difference</li>
            <li> Take note: contain 1% Hyaluronic Acid. I thought &amp;#34;pure hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; meant that it was the ingredient, but nope! It&#x27;s almost 99% water. Still useful, but misleading, I think.</li>
            <li> This has made a big difference in the appearance of my skin. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Great all the way around</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products that claim to smooth out the skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines.  The reviews on hyaluronic acid is favorable, so I thought I would give it a try.  Each morning and evening, I apply 4-5 drops and smooth it all over my face and neck.  Then I apply a moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s been three weeks and I am noticing a difference!  My skin has a glow to it and the fine lines on my forehead seem to have diminished.  My makeup is going on more evenly too.  Added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t give five stars on many beauty products, but this one is an exception.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. I plan on buying it and using it a lot. I even use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Did not break me out and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this instead of the dermalogica to save money but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. I will gladly spend the $50 on the dermalogica because it works wonders for my extremely dry skin. It is also great when using Retin-A or a retinol.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes, brightens, tightens my pores. This hyaluronic acid is the secret treasure to amazing skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best HA serum on the market.  The company is great for customer service and delivery.  A small amount last a long time.  Just mix with your regular moisturizer and you will see results in about 30 days.  It takes time and regular use.  You will see a reduction in dry skin and young wrinkles. Highly recommend it especially if you use natural products.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. This isn&#x27;t a substitute for other creams or moisturizers, of course. But I apply it after washing my face. I let it absorb--which only takes less than a  minute--then I apply my eye cream &amp; facial moisturizer. I think it helps those work better by holding in the moisture. (I have normal to dry skin &amp; live in an arrid climate.) I think my lines look less obvious (more \\&quot;shallow\\&quot;). My only complaint is that there is absolutely no information, directions, etc. included so do your research elsewhere on hyaluronic acid and know what your skin needs are if you want to incorporate this into your routine. Also, it seems to last quite a long time--a big plus in the realm of expensive but tiny-portioned skin care products.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old and have some fine lines on my face.  I have very pale combination skin. I clean my face with a salicylic acid astringent every morning.  This helps tame the oily parts, keep me from breaking out, and exfoliates the dry parts.  Of course then my whole skin is dry so I need to use a moisturizer and sunscreen over that normally. I use Neutrogena moisturizer and sunscreen which is the only product that wont clog my pores and helps even out the combo skin throughout the day. My cheeks tend to be a little dry, even after the moisturizing so I thought this product would be good for that, since so many reviews seem to have success with using it to help the skin retain moisture.  I saw at least one review on here saying that the product is as gentle to the skin as water and that&#x27;s true.  It feels slightly thick but it goes on and feels just like water.  It moistens the skin like water, and then quickly dries up like pure water, leaving behind... nothing!  Nothing but very dry feeling skin, just as if you were to apply nothing but pure water to your face.  So, I applied the moisturizer on top of that.  I also did the same thing at night.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for several weeks now, just hoping to see anything improve, and I haven&#x27;t noticed ANY changes.  Cheeks still a tad dry just like they were, no difference in pore size, fine lines all still there, skin tone unchanged.  I feel like I have totally wasted my money and my time buying snake oil.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would love to have instructions on how to use this? Is it supposed to be washed off? Left on the skin? Used under moisturizer or in place of? I read several reviews after watching a show that said Hyaluronic Acid is really great for skin...so I bought it. It arrived and looks great but it has no instructions on the bottle and none in the box. .... HELP? I am anxious to try this out!!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!! My skin has looked so much better since I began using it. The first thing I noticed was my skin looks smoother and pores look smaller. I use mineral makeup and most moisturizers make it go on too thick and cakey. This product dries fast and isn&#x27;t sticky. GREAT STUFF!</li>
            <li> Ok so I have done years of research. Purchased over a hundred books. I know everything about hair skin nails etc. This is the seller to buy your hyaluronic acid from. It comes in fast and the product is perfection. After I wash face with a special soap. I put this on my face neck chest arms and legs. I let it sit for 5 min and then add on the rest of my morning/nightly products. It works. Its a great price to and a little goes a long long way!!!!!! I could not be happier. My Mother uses it as well. We noticed our skin became more smooth and supple when we added this. We use Retin-A and Retinol and this lets everything sink in and seal in faster. Plus it just tightens everything up and makes your skin glow under your make up. It has not clogged any pores or made anything feel greasy. I use this when I do my chemical peels and dermabrasion. It helps to heal faster and keeps moisture in. After I shower and dry brush my legs  I put this on and 15 min later I put on pure organic coconut oil. Talk about soft skin! I also do chemical peels on my legs and this helps so so much. Its just great and this seller gets it to you in a flash. I tried a few other brands and for some reason this one is better. Maybe its all in my mind but this company just seems way better.</li>
            <li> Actually not sure.  Nothing I can see that is obvious.  Do like how my skin feels after use.  Makes creams go on smoothly.  Will continue to use for now.</li>
            <li> I am 54 and a very skeptical consumer and was not certain this product would live up to its reputation. I have used this twice daily for two months and can tell a marked difference in the texture of my skin. It is softer and much smoother. This will continue to be a part of my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> Love this product...good quality and great price.  This stuff is great for your skin...put on, let it dry and then mist face with distilled water and allow to nearly dry before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been impressed. Don&#x27;t use daily as I should because I get in a hurry, but it seems to be doing what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Like the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m ready to order it again. Left  my skin so smooth and healthy looking 😬</li>
            <li> This just arrived and I am really frustrated with the misleading labeling.  It is my fault that I didn&#x27;t scroll all the way down to the bottom to read the list of ingredients.  And I&#x27;ll readily OWN that.  That being said, I still think that the labeling is misleading.  Turns out that the 100% PURE hyaluronic acid is only 1 % of this product.  It is mostly water with a smattering? of benzylalcohol and dehydroacetic acid.  Not sure how much since it does not list the percentage.</li>
            <li> This has done nothing. Consistency is very thin and watery. Almost like water but has a slip to it that makes it feel silky.  I used it multiple ways. Added to water as a toner/spritz, water HA and glycerin, added to face cream.  I hate it. I saw no difference what to ever. Actually that is a lie my skin broke out more when ever this was added to anything.  I have even bought several products since that have HA in them and not once have ever seen anything to write home about.</li>
            <li> This is the third time order I have placed.  I have some slight acne and it helps keep it.  Evening out my skin texture nicley.  This isnt over night..but over time I see a difference in my complexion. I stopped for a month when I ran out and ordered my third bottle.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyones facial care</li>
            <li> I JUST RECEIVED THE PACKAGE THE OTHER DAY,  I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY THIS COMPANY RESPONDED. I STARTED USING THIS YESTERDAY AND THIS MORNING MY SKIN FELT DIFFERENT. IT WAS SOFT, NOT DRY LIKE USUAL. I WILL LET YOU KNOW MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> It is 100 percent and what I wanted</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I love the way it made my skin feel and moisturized.  Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I received this in a timely manner just as the seller promised on June 14th, I did not want to review until I&#x27;d seen some results.  I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and still have oily skin and breakouts when the weather turns hot.  I had some dark spots and what appeared as mylasma going on at the temples of my face and so I combined it with a dark spot remover that contained kojic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some fading, my family noticed it first and there is no burning or itching.  My face and neck looks to be clearing now and the few laugh lines I had are softening as well while my forehead furrows are not as noticeable. I&#x27;m going to order more before this stuff gets scarce!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily or &#x27;T&#x27; zone skin this brand contains benzylalchohol as a preservative and might play a dual part in correcting breakouts. And it will not give off that urine smell like another brand does as it comes into contact with air, yes it will feel a bit drying at first but when used under a light moisturizer it makes the skin feel like butta baby!!!</li>
            <li> This goes on silky smooth and so far has provided added moisture to my skin, my face doesn&#x27;t feel quite as tight this winter.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2 months now, not sure that I see any improvement of my skin. Will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little iffy about this product. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the L&#x27;Oreal serum with hyaluronic acid that I was using (but has been discontinued), but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s much more pure, and has more hyaluronic acid in it. I have been trying to find facial products that don&#x27;t contain the \\&quot;bad stuff\\&quot;. Since this goes on under my face cream, I suppose it doesn&#x27;t matter how it feels initially.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid really works at giving you a bright-eyed appearance since it absorbs moisture. I don&#x27;t know that it has any long term effects, but within 15 minutes of application, you do see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a trained (but no longer practicing) medical esthetician so I&#x27;m quite familiar with the benefits of hyaluronic acid -- but using it in it&#x27;s pure form is usually not an option in professional products...for whatever reason. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a week and have already noticed a huge difference in my skin. I&#x27;m acne-prone and have fine lines -- I use the serum as soon as I get out of the shower while my skin is still moist. It locks in the moisture and has a significant smoothing effect, though a tiny dab of moisturizer is still needed! I highly recommend it for all skin types!</li>
            <li> IDK how this stuff works for ANYONE. Unless ofcourse your skin is made out of tough steel copper metal or something! It just dries out your skin much like super glue or something. My fingers still cant even handle this stuff even after diluting the product to less than 10% with water!!, maybe less. I wish I would have never came across this product. Not for even remotely sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Im convinced MOST these reviews are just a HOAX! I still cant get over how I wasted 15 bucks after reading those 1 star reviews I knew better but the 5 stars were just too tempting, ugh!, but then I try to remember its just $15.</li>
            <li> Um, this has 3 ingredients, INCLUDING ALCOHOL.  What gives?!  This isn&#x27;t what is described...  Benzyl Alcohol is in it, and some other stuff.  It&#x27;s advertised as \\&quot;100% Pure\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> NOT VERY SURE IF IT IS WORKING, I WILL GIVE IT ANOTHER MONTH, SEEMS SMOOTH ON THE SKIN. GOOD TO ADD TO YOUR FAVORITE MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the end of August.  Today it is October 3rd.  It has been over a month.  I used it faithfully every day and every night after cleansing my skin.  I then would apply my other face creams on top.  I didn&#x27;t see a change at first.  I kept trying ways of making this product work so I can see a difference, but didn&#x27;t see anything.  So, a few days ago I decided to use the following strategy:  1). I cleansed my skin 2). Use a facial mask!&lt;br /&gt;3). Apply the Hyaluronic Acid Serum  4). Put on my moisturizer and BAMMMM!!!  I started to see the clear skin come out.  After only 3 days of trying this new regimen for my skin.  I now have a glow with no acne!!!!  I will continue to do this for my skin everyday. After reading all of these reviews, you have to work ways that are best for you because every skin is different.  I love looking at my skin in the mirrow.  It now looks smooth and refreshed.  I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in another month.  I have used half bottle of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I will order more to get the full effect of using it everyday after clearing away dead skin by using my mask first.  I am so excited about purchasing this product from Amazon.  Amazon is the best!!  I will write another review in about a month to share my results.  It just may earn 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have seb derm - a TERRIBLE skin condition that makes your face hideous. So I was absolutely delighted to see the wonderful reviews this cheap but promising serum had, so without haste, I purchased it and egarly waied for it to arrive. Upon it&#x27;s arrival, I noticed the packaging was weird - it was unprofessional and looked like it was homemade. That was a major red flag but I tried it for at least a week, multiple times a day. And nothing came out of it. If anything it made my skin a little worse. But I&#x27;m not shocked - I should have listened to the bad reviews. I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t too expencive or I&#x27;d be angry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my sister for her birthday. She has really enjoyed using it and has told me that she has seen quite an improvement in her skin</li>
            <li> Perhaps I expected a miracle product but what I did notice was good enough to keep me using the rest of the product just cause I didnt want to waste my money. It might work better for others but Im going to keep looking for something that suits my skin a little better.</li>
            <li> This is best I have every use on my face. I use it every morning and night.  I mix the Hyaluronic acid serum with Vitamin C and face cream.  My skin has never looked so good.  Told my smoker friend about this and she is now putting it on her face.  She told me the other day she could see a big difference in her skin. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to notice a change but my skin looks AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to add to your facial moisturizers!  It helps your skin absorb the creams better.  The small bottle lasted me 3 months with me using it two times a day.  All you need is a couple drops each use!!  Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s affordable and fabulous.  I use it over and EVOO and moisurizer emulsion and it retains the moisture in my skin for hours.  Makes my skin feel flawless, which is always a bonus!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.  I use it year round and it goes on so light and absorbs so fast.  An absolute must have!</li>
            <li> I opened this product, tried it on and really like it. It didn&#x27;t smell funny, it looked pure, and I could feel it working. So far my skin is looking better and better every day. I recommend this product and will be buying it again. Awesome experience!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, maybe twice a month. It is just like going to my dermatologist.. I would definately order this again.</li>
            <li> Favorite serum of all time. It is pretty lightweight and feels amazing on my skin! After i tried this, bought the full version (8oz bottle) which is much cheaper compared with the amount of product you get! I have combination skin and use it under my moisturizer day and night. Holy Grail serum!</li>
            <li> After using Hyaluronic Acid for 30 days have noticed just a slight improvement with my skin. The product does work quite well as a moisturizer but has not helped with even slight wrinkles. I have not given up on it yet but at this point would give it just a neutral rating.</li>
            <li> This has done nothing for my skin and comes with no instructions.  It could just be water inside as far as I can tell.  I think that hyaluronic may attract water in the air, but only if it is humid enough.  Then you don&#x27;t need it.  There&#x27;s no way it is going to plump up your aged skin unless you inject it or are young enough to believe the hype and have a great fantasy life!</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this.  I have put it on my clean face every morning, then my moisturizer and make-up.  My skin never feels dry so it must be working.  The bottle goes a long way.  Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I purchase this brand of HA, I have used it with my micro-current device around my neck, eyes, cheeks and face, it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, it absorbs very quickly and give me the hydration I need. I use it twice a day on clean face.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see if I am getting younger.  What do women expect at our age.  But we keep trying.  Product seems great..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff with rosehips heritage w glycerin</li>
            <li> I do like this product. It seems to work better than some more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with thirsty skin.</li>
            <li> Love this Serum. Works great with C Serum &amp; absorbs into the skin! Will continue to use the brand and the serum!!</li>
            <li> very pleased with these purchases.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile and I really love it.  I continue to reorder.  In the very cold weather, I use a good moisturizer after the hyaluronic acid  serum absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this product is doing anything to my skin.  I&#x27;m not seeing any results and it&#x27;s been one month since I&#x27;ve started using it twice a day.  My skin is usually pretty quick to react to new products (at least it seems to).  Maybe I just need to give it some more time.  I wanted to try it because this product got great reviews and it&#x27;s so darn cheap!</li>
            <li> Purchased one for myself. Later, my mother asked me for one (a makeup artist). As its used in many cosmetic products but never in its entirety. These commercial cosmetic products are way over priced for the tiny bit of hyaluronic acid they have in them. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. I use it after my salicylic acid masks at home.</li>
            <li> This serum is very soothing to the skin. It is very moist on the skin. This is a very generous size and a great value.</li>
            <li> I bought hyaluronic acid because it is listed as being a very safe product to put on your skin, but I had no idea it is such a miracle worker. My skin felt dramatically tighter and less saggy within a couple of days. My skin feels and looks firmer - it&#x27;s truly amazing and I am giving it as a gift to all my girlfrinds this holiday season. BTW - I am in my 40s, have dry skin, and live in a dry climate. Not too sure what the recommended application procedure is - I just put on my normal face cream and then blend in a few drops of hyaluronic acid morning and night. This bottle should last quite a while and is a very good value.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I just spent some time reading the 1 star reviews and have to chuckle a little bit. I understand the product doesn&#x27;t come with instructions but hey people, there&#x27;s the internet and your own intuition. It&#x27;s a humectant so it binds whatever moisture is already on your skin to your skin. If there&#x27;s no moisture, it will be drying. I do have a dry spot on my cheek from using this but I know it&#x27;s because I have to incorporate a better moisterizer than the oil free tinted cream I&#x27;m currently using in the now subzero temperatures of winter. Skin is variable per age, per skin type per climate. You have to spend some time working with the amount you will need and which products it will mix well with. That aside, my skin does look so good right now. It&#x27;s so much smoother and firmer and just appears healthier. So many skin products carry this ingredient but at a very inflated price. You buy this and you are essentially saying \\&quot;I&#x27;ll play chemist on my face\\&quot;.. But it&#x27;s not rocket science. Mix this stuff with your favorite moisterizer if your skin is dry or you live in a cold dry climate. When the humidity levels rise you will need less moisterizer. I used to buy clinique&#x27;s moisture surge gel which lists this stuff as an ingredient but at the 50 dollar price a tub I couldn&#x27;t swing it more than twice a year. This product is amazing and I will be buying again! thanks!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product over a month ago. I&#x27;ve been using it pretty regularly since Nov., and have definitely noticed a difference in my skin.  I have always had dark circles under my eyes, with puffiness akin to a raccoon.  Using this product in the AM and before bed have significantly reduced both - to the point that others have commented on how fresh my skin looks.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even pure water.(99%) If this marketeer thinks she can change the definition of the word \\&quot;pure\\&quot;, why doesn&#x27;t she supply her new definition? This is deception on the face of it. How can you believe any of this?</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading so many great reviews. However, after using this serum for 2 months now, I do not see any difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. I&#x27;ve been using the product under my moisturizer and my skin seems exactly the same when I don&#x27;t apply the serum. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> hi ....&lt;br /&gt;I have used the serum and the results were very, very amazing .....&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to dispense with the curse .....</li>
            <li> Not a fan of skin products but wanted to decrease the pore size  in the face. Researched medical studies and decided to use this product in conjunction with derma micro needle skin roller for better penetration. Have seen improvement in pore size. Will try to be more consistent with its use and see how it works.Price is a plus. Ask me in 6 months.</li>
            <li> I Like the product a lot, My skin has shown improvements, can help raise skin&#x27;s moisture level to fill-in furrows, plump up tissues, and tone down age lines. Highly recommend it. [[ASIN:B009Z5Y3Q8 Chia Seeds 2 Pounds All Natural Black Chia Seeds]]</li>
            <li> I have always found hyaluronic acid in the ingredients of good moisturizers so I decided to try it in its pure form. I use it after microneedling and it works great! Its cheap too. I have to reapply after microneedling since my skin is thirsty after that treatment but it works better than some more expensive moisturizers I have used in the past. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. will repurchase again and again. i use this with Bio Oil and a 2.5MM dermaroller for my scars. it seriously makes everything look smoother and helps lessen my scars (NOTHING helps but this and Bio Oil, for real).</li>
            <li> I love this product! We have been using it for about a week. I use it twice a day after I wash my face. My face is smoother and looks better!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it along with my Lancôme moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> im only 1/4 of  the serum done but so  far it has done what you say, i will  be ordering it agian for sure thank you</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase of this particular product. I have tried others and with all due respect, not only is this product more clearly helping your skin and wrinkles...  IT IS CHEAPER AND BIGGER. I kept saying to myself that that OTHER hyaluronic I use in the past really did something. I am happy as punch to have returned this company. AND what a bonus!  To be able to get TWICE AS MUCH FOR LESS MONEY. Ladies, do yourself a favor more expensive isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the A.M. and P.M.  Fresh out of the shower in the morning, put on a dropper of this along with my daily moisturizer and let that be absorbed into my face, neck and breast area.  Cleanse my face in the evening and again apply a dropper with my nighttime moisturizer.  I Love This Product!</li>
            <li> This is my sweetheart</li>
            <li> This product is very hydrating. So far I like it. Need to use this product a little longer to see if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my use. I desired the lotion. I can formulate personal products for my own use. Dehydroacetic acid is the perfect preservative.</li>
            <li> This is a mess it came broken and frozen</li>
            <li> Seems a bit watery, however, the product worked well to help reduce acne scar recovery time. I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t say it helped with that. I am also using a lot of products that are very drying, so I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement in hydration. I used it on a nearly everyday/every other day basis, it lasted well over 6 months. I am ready to repurchase, but will likely look for another brand.</li>
            <li> I will never be without this stuff it&#x27;s great, Definitely a improvement in my fine line And wrinkles My skin is so soft now I use with the Argon oil I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it as primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this. I first got introduced to HA serum years ago when my retin-a prescription came with some samples of an HA serum that&#x27;s no longer available. I didn&#x27;t even look at the samples...but I guess I over did the retin-a and it literally ate my face off. It was sooo miserably painful. Anything I put on my face to moisturize it and help soothe my poor skin just made it worse or caused stinging and burning so bad I was crying. I tried just basic face lotion, skin oil, everything. I even put an aloe burn gel on my face and that hurt so bad I had to sit down because the pain made me dizzy and I nearly fainted. Finally, my boyfriend went to get the bag from the pharmacy to see if there were directions or something &amp; he found the HA samples. He said \\&quot;hey what&#x27;s this?\\&quot; and I said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know, it came with the retin-a\\&quot;...so he googled it and then suggested I put it on my face (and then I felt stupid for not trying that first!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my goodness! Instant relief! It didn&#x27;t burn at all. No stinging...my skin just drank it up &amp; it was so helpful. After I used up all the samples I tried to get more and I learned that it had been taken off the market because the manufacturer was only offering it as an injection moving forward. I was so bummed and I started looking for alternatives. That&#x27;s when I got my first bottle of Timeless HA serum. since I haven&#x27;t made an ongoing habit of burning my face off...I rarely need it to sooth a retin-a crisis...but I find lots of uses for it otherwise. For example, as soon as the dry heat kicked on this winter I was blowing my nose and trying to keep it hydrated, but after a few days, the skin around my left nostril cracked and it just kept re-cracking. everything I put on it stung except for my HA serum. I just made a habit of adding a drop to that spot every couple of hours and it finally healed within a day and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts forever. A little goes a long way. It feels really nice and is absorbed almost immediately. It&#x27;s not oily at all. It&#x27;s only slightly thicker than water. Most of the research I&#x27;ve done on HA has suggested applying it all over your face underneath your regular moisturizer to fight wrinkles and such. I&#x27;m not struggling with wrinkles just yet, but if I get a cut or scrape anywhere I will first apply a drop of this underneath some neosporin &amp; band aid and it mitigates any scrabbling or scarring and generally seems to heal more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive skin. If I get something suspect near my eyes they swell up so bad I only have little slits to see out of. I have to be really careful. I apply this around my eyes when that part of my face feels dry &amp; it&#x27;s never bothered me. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than having to buy a seperate eye cream. Maybe when I&#x27;m older I will go through it more quickly but for now it&#x27;s the least expensive (and most valuable) item in my skin toolbox. The first bottle I go was one ounce and that lasted 5 or 6 months. Since then I&#x27;ve purchased the two ounce bottles and they each lasted about a year. It&#x27;s a great serum to stock at home  for many reasons, but if you have a lot of skin allergies or if you&#x27;re acne prone - this is about the safest way to possibly go to avoid irritation, clogged pores, breakouts &amp; even more rapid healing of popped blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else important to note, much of what I&#x27;ve read about HA serum as a daily moisturizer all over has recommended not using it alone with any regularity. I&#x27;m paraphrasing, but basically the idea is that it helps draw moister from the air and pull it to your skin &amp; I helps with absorption of your other moisturizer....but when used by itself, in certain climates/environments, it could start to draw the moister from your skin rather than from the air and it could lead to dryness. Ive used it by itself as well as underneath something at different times. It definitely has a better effect when used in conjunction with something else....but i have my reasons for occasionally using it alone &amp; it has only worked in my favor. I&#x27;ve not experienced it as being drying at all.. So, just be aware.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.  There is absolutely no greasiness.  It is so light that you cannot tell anything is on your skin except it being soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HA is the youth ingredient in all connective tissue, such as skin.  It helps skin stay plump.  HA is a primary component in the synovial fluid in joints to keep joints lubricated and gliding well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research demonstrates that regular use of HA in your skin care routine will help skin maintain elasticity, reduce the development and appearance of wrinkles, and contribute to skin health.  My dermatologist recommends HA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this particular product from Timeless Skin Care for over a year and recommend it to my daughter and friends.  I am super satisfied with all of their products and the quality.  The price point cannot be beat and there is almost always a special if you purchase multiple items.  The standardized bottle and simple label probably help keep costs low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gentle product.  Do not be afraid because of &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; in its name.  It is naturally occurring in our skin.  Use it everyday.  For best results, apply it prior to your micro needle routine.  This is great for all skin types and will benefit acne-prone skin as well as tired and aging skin.  I cannot say enough good things.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what it was supposed to be.  Didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do.  Disappointed.....</li>
            <li> Works very well on my skin. Started seeing difference after a month. Skin looks younger</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin look better along with the moisturizer. It is one of the better products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for moisture without risking any oil on their face. Living in the tropics, I must be very careful with my moisturizers. This, however, is perfect every time and leaves my face feeling amazing soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is not very good.  It seems to dry my skin.  I read another review about it having alcohol in it.  That makes sense since it burned a little.  I like the capsules you break open and the serum is in it.  They made wrinkles less noticeable and my skin was soft.  This leaves skin slightly sticky.  I only lost about 10 bucks, but it still sucks.  You wait all week for your package and then it&#x27;s not what you wanted. :(</li>
            <li> I use a serum with MTS-Roller and very happy with the result, complexion was more even and  skin  is more moisturize .</li>
            <li> The best product I have used in a long time, helps keep my skin young and flawless and I am a skin junkie. 5 STARS all the way!</li>
            <li> wonderful for helping keep your skin moist without the oil.  skin feels great to touchd.  Hubby even noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about four months. I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve been getting more compliments on my skin than I&#x27;ve ever gotten, and I&#x27;m 52! It goes on smooth and light. It&#x27;s non greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight, even though you would think it would since there has been a significant decrease in pore size. I will be a user for life. And even though I hate telling my beauty secrets, I can&#x27;t stay quiet about the serum. The other plus to this product is the price 14.95 for two ounces and free shipping. There is no other product out there that I&#x27;m aware of that gives the excellent results for this low price! I highly recommend this product, oh, and I also use it on the back of my hands at bedtime. My hands have never looked younger!  R. Louw  Trafalgar, Indiana</li>
            <li> My skin likes this product and feels more hydrated for sure. i do however, use it in conjunction with vitamin e, elastin, and other creams. I like the price as well.</li>
            <li> i can only rate if i could try it. It came in broken , all i saw was broken pieces of container.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and I must admit, I asked for a sample and BOY WERE THEY GENEROUS!!! For that, they deserve 5 stars for their service alone. I have only tried this once but I will do another update. I purged my skin for over a year using nothing but natural products due to all the harmful stuff I was used to using. It has been well over 2yrs now and I am using nothing but natural stuff on my skin now with everything being 0 hazardous BTW. I applied this for the first time today and it was a diff feel, not quite water and not quite gel...it was almost what other reviewers had stated about aloe vera but without the sticky-ness (I assure you, it isn&#x27;t aloe vera lol). I have sensitive skin and with any bad ingredients my skin burns and my pores have a reaction immediately, but with this stuff, there was NO reaction! I had applied too much so I brang the access down to my neck area and after a few hours gone by, I forgot about it and started touching my neck (which I do alot at the computer area) and OMG my neck feels like a newborns skin!!!! I&#x27;m amazed so far and will update again soon........&lt;br /&gt;3/18/13&lt;br /&gt;Next day update..I applied it twice now (last night and this morning) and my pores are noticeable. W/my 0 hazardous facial cream, I don&#x27;t have this problem, especially when I wake up but my skin feels soft w/this HA stuff. Usually when my pores look like that, there&#x27;s something in the product so maybe it&#x27;s the alcohol or who knows. I applied it to my fiancee&#x27;s skin last night and he NEVER EVER puts products on his skin and he said that it burned but it wasn&#x27;t hurtful enough to complain about. He does stay outside in the sun unprotected so I&#x27;m assuming he had a little too much sun?! Who knows...I will update again in a month or so on the both of us. His skin should be more accurate since he has never applied product to it &#x3D;P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/28:&lt;br /&gt;Ok another update, my skin looks like it&#x27;s in it&#x27;s early 20&#x27;s! My fiancee only used it twice on his face, he wouldn&#x27;t allow me to apply any more LOL he said it was unnatural and there was something that didn&#x27;t feel right....ha, men! Since he didn&#x27;t let me apply to his face, I used it on his legs instead since he has a case of bad psoriasis and overnight this worked wonders!!! His psoriasis made a tremendous improvement! Far better than hydroquinone cream. Am I a lifer? We will see. I asked for samples from another amazon seller for HA serum (cosmedica) and I&#x27;m comparing the two. Cosmedica&#x27;s HA serum is much more thick and timeless is more watered down so I will come back and update between the two but by far I am not changing the rating as timeless has excellent customer service!!!wouldn&#x27;t allow me to apply any more LOL he said it was unnatural and there was something that didn&#x27;t feel right....ha, men! Since he didn&#x27;t let me apply to his face, I used it on his legs instead since he has a case of bad psoriasis and overnight this worked wonders!!! His psoriasis made a tremendous improvement! Far better than hydroquinone cream. Am I a lifer? We will see. I asked for samples from another amazon seller for HA serum (cosmedica) and I&#x27;m comparing the two. Cosmedica&#x27;s HA serum is much more thick and timeless is more watered down so I will come back and update between the two but by far I am not changing the rating as timeless has excellent customer service!!!</li>
            <li> when it arrived, it was broken so i couldn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;its a unpleasant that you paid for something that you don&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> I can already tell a difference!  I&#x27;m 51 and my skin is already getting firmer!  I can tell a difference in the wrinkles on my forehead too😃</li>
            <li> A great value on this product.  I have tried some of the other brands but feel this one gives me the most bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any obvious result on this product. I don&#x27;t feel any change after putting that.  I found alpha hydrox has better result.</li>
            <li> Not sure yEt. Been using this and have not seen a diffrence</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a hyaluronic product that was pure serum . . . but wasn&#x27;t sure just how or when to apply it . . . instructions for its use would have been helpful.</li>
            <li> I have had break out problems with just about any facial moisturizer since peri-menopause began. Never had an issue till then with my skin.  It is sad to wake up to white heads all round my mouth, chin and nose.  This product has saved me!  It goes on and is instantly soaked into my skin.  My skin is soft, plumped, and white head free!  Highly recommend Timeless Skin Care.</li>
            <li> thank you is good product, but I need more for eraser my wrinkles.  Is nice for help your skin in winter</li>
            <li> Awesome, great for skin absorbs quickly! Non greasy, works good over night wake up w smooth skin. Go try it</li>
            <li> It seems to be working fairly well, but I&#x27;m using more than one product at the same time, so I can&#x27;t be sure which one is doing the job. It is economical and goes a long way, so I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> To early to tell if it give my smoother skin or not we will see.  It does appear to make my skin smoother but again to early to tell</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a recommendation of a book I read.  There was really no clear explanation of what the product is supposed to do...I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell much difference after using this product for a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that feels like a touch of cool water but is absorbed immediately as my skin drinks it in.</li>
            <li> Have seen better but not for the money</li>
            <li> I am using the serum for a month now and my skin looks good. After applying it my skin feels a bit tightened but after a while it is really soft. This is a very good alternative of a daily cream for people with dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to realize that this product actually does not contain ANY hyaluronic acid and the ingredient list is as follows: Water, Sodium Hyaluronate (1%; 100% pure), Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  A little research will show you that Sodium Hyaluronate is not \\&quot;hyaluronic acid\\&quot;.  I should have read the entire description in more detail on the website, as the ingredients are listed.  I suppose after I saw a label that read \\&quot;Hyaluronic acid Pure\\&quot; that I assumed that a) it contained hyaluronic acid and b) it did not contain other filler ingredients.</li>
            <li> Bought this for dry skin during pregnancy and it worked wonders. Went from cracked and bleeding to radiant glow in abt 3 days. This may be tmi but it even worked on my nipples which was my biggest problem.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb! There are so many expensive products out there that say they include hyaluronic acid especially at the department stores and this inexpensive buy blows them all away. I have been using it for two years now and I look amazing. Great for moisturizing you face.</li>
            <li> Use this daily mixed with my spf moisturizer. Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and hydrates very well. What else can you ask? This ingredient found in lots of high end moisturizers and this product is more effective and affordable. Go for it ladies! (and gents)</li>
            <li> I love this and this is my second purchase.  It&#x27;s very light and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I did not see a noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I have recently switched from soap to cleanser.  After going through a couple of pricier cleansers, I went wih Derma E Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Glycolic Cleanser.  I have already ordered more.  I love it.  I am 41 and this is definitely helping my face look clean, young and it really helps with wrinkles used with this Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure.  A previous review recommended this combination and she is spot on!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will use forever!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  as always.</li>
            <li> Love this serum---this serum and others have saved my badly sun damaged skin.  i love the large bottle this comes in.  The texture is silky--not greasy and has not caused break outs--which I still get--even though I also have a few wrinkles........pain in the arse skin!  Good thing I have freckles that can hide most break outs---but with these serums---I am finally happy with my skin.  Thank you so much! :-0</li>
            <li> I used this product hoping it would help my skin stay hydrated as the seasons changed from fall to winter.  WAY WRONG ANSWER!!!  I have very oily skin and hesitated to purchase this product, but I did purchase because many reviews said it worked fine on oily skin. That is NOT true. To sum it up, my face exploded.  It was like I had 3 layers of congestion and it took 2 months to clear up.  Other than that, I actually enjoyed the product.  It is very light weight and obsorbs very quickly.  It is a good serum for dry, aging skin.  I am a black 36 year old women with oily skin.  Buying and using this product was a big mistake for me.  We all have different skin, know yours and make purchases accordingly.</li>
            <li> Not to sure about this - it just seems like glorified water.  Not sure how it got such good reviews from others.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great ! I am a 41 year old male, workout daily and is attempting to keep off the visible years of aging. I use HA every morning along with retin A at night. These two products have done wonders with erasing and minimizing the apperance of wrinkles. The retin A has worked well with somewhat erasing the fine lines and the Hyaluronic Acid tightens the skin around the eyes causing the fine lines to be largely diminished..&lt;br /&gt;This is my regimen: Wash face at night, let dry for 30 minutes, apply retin A, sleep&lt;br /&gt;next morning - wash face, pat dry, apply Hyaluronic acid, apply spf15 face lotion. I have done this for 3 months and people have commented that something is different and that I look younger. My wife also uses the same regimen but not with the same consistency.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to try something relatively inexpensive then try HA and give it at least a week... I first used HA at night and in the morning but then started retin A.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD stuff !!!</li>
            <li> This serum does wonders, it&#x27;s like your skin is on water staying hydrated for ever. Gliding it on, or mixing it wish another cream moisturizer is just a breeze as it&#x27;s putting it on alone. I am oily-skinned, and this is perfect for anyone with oily skin because you will need a skin conditioner that&#x27;s water based on your face. Once I used it, it&#x27;s like love at first touch! Tee hee!</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple different things online and this was the first thing to arrive. It only took two or three days. Very prompt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple days I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work for me as it was drying my skin out pretty badly. I was using it twice a day after face washing and salicylic acid pads. This caused a lot of skin flaking and made me feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to give up yet so I started mixing it with my vitamin c serum and applying to my face while my face was soaking wet. When it dries, I put on a regular moisturizer. Now my skin looks healthy and moisturized! I haven&#x27;t felt so confident in the quality of my skin in a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetic student &amp; have already purchased over 15 bottles total for myself &amp; my classmates. Love the 50% off deal (code) when purchasing 5+ bottles in each order. I use it on all my normal to dry skin clients and they feel the difference too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about a week now and my skin looks amazing.  I am 46 and suddenly having breakouts, but in one week my breakouts have stopped and everything is almost healed, my fine lines are improving and yesterday at work 5 people commented on how flawless my skin looks YAY!!  I always wear foundation and have not changed anything else so its definately working.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle. the first lasted forever !!! really has made a difference in tone and texture of my face. hooked on it for sure !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and I like the way it hydrates my skin after I wash my face.  It keeps it soft and radiant.  I just love it and will continue making it part of my daily/nightly ritual for my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now.  I am not sure if it is working like I thought it would. I was expecting to see highly moisturized, dewy skin after using it, but it isn&#x27;t doing that. Also, not sure if it is making skin more dry or not as it is winter-time her in the the mid-west which is drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I use this with other natural products for a face serum and have wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Vitamin C Serum and have noticed a big change in the texture of my skin-it is much smoother than before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference from using it.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff especially when mixed with rose water as another reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. leaves the skin smooth and can be used with daily cream.</li>
            <li> I  love this serum.  Please don&#x27;t increase the prices excessively.  I will continue buying it.  It is an effective addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Last night, I used this product along with rose water and... DAMN... can this serum hydrate or what!&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been peeling because I have been using a sulfur mask daily (for acne, highly recommended).&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I purchased this item was because of its reviews. I am sad it only has 4stars when it really deserves 5 stars. Super hydrating and at a low price...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for your skin and a great set up before you put on make up. it goes on feeling a little slimy but it dries quick and fills in all your fine lines so make up goes on super smooth. no residue either!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I have been using it for over 3 months. It took forever to arrive, didn&#x27;t have any directions. I can only hope it was hyaluronic acid like the sticker said. But I&#x27;m no chemist. I do know this product did nothing for me. I have no amazing results of softer, smoother, clearer skin like all the reviews claim. I&#x27;m just glad I only paid $15.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, my skin seems much smoother and I do plan to buy more when this is all gone.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this bottle to be so big for the price. Product is silky smooth and makes my face feel fabulous! I use it after dermarolling, and it leaves my laugh lines and under eyes looking so nice I started using it every night. I would recommend trying it! This is as good if not better than more expensive products! [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for quite some time now and i can tell you it works! I am african american which combination skin and occasional black heads. I&#x27;ve used many serums before but sommehow they were too heavy and made me break out more. Since i&#x27;ve used this, i&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is softer and more supple looking and hardly ever any blackheads. i love looking at my face in the mirror and for the first time I can walk outside without makeup and it just looks dewy and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this is not done alone. you must have a strict regimen. At nights i use a retinol product and anti aging moisterizer. and on mornings i use face wash and rose water as a toner followed by this serum and  at times a regular moisterizer. then there are times where i just use this serum alone. It works!! i love it!!</li>
            <li> I have oily &amp; sensitive skin so finding moisturizing products is difficult.  This is awesome.  Not only can I use it alone but I can also combine it with my favorite dept store acne moisturizer and I get  perfect hydration  It is great under my make up w/o making it too slippery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now and am so happy. My neck and face look much healthier, less &#x27;droop.&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is watery crap. Most of the reviews of this are old and out dated. Maybe this was a good product before but when items get popular companies cut corners. This does nothing and feels like water. A true waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 3 weeks and have seen a great improvement in my completion. I had cyst like acne for several months! It was almost impossible to tame! Even makeup didn&#x27;t help conceal this problem! I purchased this serum with a derma roller and used both right away. For my acne the serum didn&#x27;t have much much of an effect when used alone. With the roller my face became smooth and bright! So I also use it on my back, neck and shoulders now. It&#x27;s non greasy, unscented and easy to apply. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;My new acne cure is Aloe vera juice, derma roller and this serum twice a day. Hope this review helps someone. :0)</li>
            <li> Have been using for a long time, came highly recommended by my doctor of 13  years. Do not hesitate to purchase is excellent for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love it, my skin is more soft and moisturized. I don&#x27;t like my skin to feel oily, and that is why, I only use this as a moisturizer. It works.</li>
            <li> love product and service I am using it and it works great for what I want it for I will be ordering it again thankyou</li>
            <li> Applies easily with water consistence...haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a determination&lt;br /&gt;Of its effectiveness.  Think I received A defective tube applicator, but still am able to use it.</li>
            <li> In the winter, I get dry skin. To make it much worse, I get eczema on my eyelids.  My doctor told me that he couldn&#x27;t do anything for me because he would normally prescribe a topical steroid for eczema.  Any topical steroid cannot be used on the eyelid because the skin is too thin.  I was annoyed with his answer...and determined.  I researched my condition up one side and down the other.  I came up with this.  I purchased this serum from Timeless along with their argan oil.  I mix one drop of serum to two drops of oil, and apply it to clean skin before bed.  THIS IS A MIRACLE!!  Beautiful...perfect...*insert any other wonderful adjective you can think of*.  This stuff saved my skin.  I&#x27;ve repurchased these two Timeless products over and over.  The quality never disappoints, and the product will last me about 10 months with daily use.  Since starting the regime, my eczema cleared up in about a week, and I haven&#x27;t had an outbreak since.  It&#x27;s been over two years...and I have a new doctor.</li>
            <li> I began using this/these products a year ago and I am so pleased.  As my toner, I spray on the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid w/Matrixyl 3000 Spray and let it dry.  Next, I smooth the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid PURE over my face and neck. This takes less than a full dropper, but be sure and LET IT COME TO A COMPLETE DRY before putting on your foundation.  With my last order of December 18, 2012, I added a new product from Timeless.  It is the Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid + Algae Eye Cream.  I&#x27;ve only been using the eye cream for the past few weeks, but can definitely see results.  My regime, now, is to use the Spray smooth on with fingertips, next the Eye Cream under the eyes and on the eyelids, then Timeless Pure over face and neck. Remember, FOR SURE, LET IT COME TO A COMPLETE DRY.  I just turned 69 and people guess my age at early to middle 50&#x27;s.  I have been blessed with good skin genes, but I am so happy to have found these products and the cost is nominal.  So, I highly recommend all of the above.  Another plus,  when I looked at my previous orders of the Spray and Pure I found it had been exactly one year since I had ordered the original bottles. So this proves a little goes a long way!!!  I do hope this may encourage some of you to use these products as they are priced reasonable and they have been really good for me.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  IT does keep my face moisturized.  I put this serum on my face and neck first then top with face cream to seal it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic acid before with good results, so I ordered some of this. Well this is full of alcohol, it&#x27;s hardly PURE as the name would suggest! This dries out my skin like nothing else. It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> After a clinical peel course, the clinician had me use HA serum daily after each peel.  A few drops goes on slick and a little goes a long way.  It absorbs quickly and you can put regular moisturizer/make up over.  The clinician brand was $80 for 10 days!  So this isn&#x27;t in individual ampules, it&#x27;s a great bargain.  Keep the serum clean by not touching the eyedropper directly - drop the fluid on your fingers to use.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look so plump and soft! It&#x27;s is my new favorite when I get out of the shower I put under my moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had this bottle for months now and haven&#x27;t used half of it.</li>
            <li> seems pretty good so far but there is no ingredient listing that I can find. I think it has alcohol as I do itch a little after using it.</li>
            <li> I MIX THIS WITH MY MOISTURIZER, JUST A COUPLE OF DROPS.  LOVE HOW IT FEELS AND ALSO TAKES SHINE AWAY FROM FACE WHILE KEEPING IT MOISTURIZED.  I WILL ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Didnt do the much and I usually use it after a deep skin peel. It&#x27;s just ok, not sure if I will be a retun buyer, I didn&#x27;t feel a difference between using it and not using it.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product; pure, leaves no oily residue, however  doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, makes it velvety and plump..</li>
            <li> And this is according to my wife who uses it.  I don&#x27;t have a clue what it is or what it does, but she raves about how well it works and that it&#x27;s a quality product.  My wife should&#x27;ve done this review but she refuses to review anything and begs me to do it for her.  So while she would&#x27;ve done a much better job evaluating this product than I have, just remember that it works and that it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I have to say that I use this every week and love it.  I really works and I plan on reordering it soon.  It goes a long ways...great seller thanks again</li>
            <li> Really good at controlling the oil and keeping my skiing firm.</li>
            <li> the most wonderful serum out there. It has completely changed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had some lines on the outer eyes and around mouth, and the forehead that are now so gone...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 50, so despite that I have been taking care of my skin all my life, wrinkles happen....&lt;br /&gt;This product is sensational. You have to be patient though. Use it twice a day with a clean skin for about 2 months to notice the big difference. Don&#x27;t give up! you will notice a change from first week, but big change after a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;I use it under a day cream/lotion  and night cream. Can&#x27;t wear it alone.</li>
            <li> Buy this for my Mom who lives out of the country. She loves it and notices a big difference in her skin. Just ordered again for her Christmas present.</li>
            <li> My 50-yr-old daughter turned me onto this.  She had even sent me her before and after picture --amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month now.  This is one great product.  And it really does lessen the deepness of wrinkles. I even use it on my fingernails, cuticle, etc.  What a difference this product has made.  The incredible dryness is now gone.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a real help for the woman of my age...</li>
            <li> Excellent and great price.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum - the cheapest, best kept skin secret...I used to buy expensive products and I kept seeing hyaluronic acid listed as an active ingredient; a large percentage, in fact.  So, I just bypassed the expense and the fragrance and went straight for results.  It does make a visible difference.</li>
            <li> really cant review this... it is what it is... but i like the bottle... i like the whiteness...  kinda hospital looking...</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different serums, this one was less expensive and twice as much product. Works just as well as the version with vitamin C, in my experience so far. I am alternating use of both.</li>
            <li> good product. my skin did not break out or have any type of redness after using it. my sister also uses this product and she loves it</li>
            <li> My skin is plumper, my acne scars (which are pretty severe) are not as visible because of the plumpness.</li>
            <li> An amazing deal on an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in skin texture after one week. Used with vit C serum. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Its pretty watery and i dont think this does much for my skin.I didnt see any change in my skin after applying for a whole week.</li>
            <li> ...I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about. It&#x27;s nice that it hydrates and it is absorbed quickly into my skin, but I don&#x27;t see any dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, keeps skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Only used this product for a week... however, it appears to have made some improvement ....this is my first bottle.  I can see improvements ..will continue to use this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know....the reviews on this serum are mostly good but I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all.  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and I think I should be seeing some kind of change....anything, but nada.  This is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> This serum definatly moisturizes my skin, although it will benefit me more during the winter months. I use a small amount.with a vitamin C serum, before using a quality moisturizer. If you are needing mega moisture for dry skin I highly recommend this. For the price its a great deal and should last a few months.</li>
            <li> This is really good to use in the morning, I use it first then either jojoba oil or argon and my face does not dry out at all. I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional skin care therapist and after purchasing this incredible product I have committed to buying all my peels from Timeless.  The products are pure and effective.  I use them on myself as well as my clients with wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I am already noticing a difference using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum! The wrinkles above and below my lips are much less noticeable. The serum is definitely &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> OMG, I ordered this because of the high positive reviews but this stuff broke me out that made my face looks like a pizza face. It made my face grew some huge big zits that are painful and infected with white stuff. I could not go out because I am so embarrassed. I guess reactions varies from skin to skin. This is definitely not for very sensitive skin. Beware buyers, if you have sensitive skin, think twice before even trying this on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews from everyone else and it was totally worth it! I have been battling adult acne for four years and I started using this 4 days before my typical breakouts. This is the first time in four years I did not suffer a single break out! Coupled with the Vitamin C Serum from Queen Bee and a regular moisturizer, it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr Oz and have been researching for months. I could not wait to get this item in the mail and start using it. When it arrived, it had been shoved in my mailbox, causing the bottle to break and soak the packaging. The bottle hadn’t been properly wrapped with the bubble wrap in the box and there was glass everywhere. Although I was refunded for the purchase, I wish I would have been able to use the product. I will not repurchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> It has been a dry winter and usually my skin is flaky and chalky when the weather is so dry.  I use it in the morning mixed with my moisturizer and apply it directly to my problem areas in the evening. It takes about a month to see the results, but the wait is worth it. So far my skin quality has improved, it no longer has the winter dullness and a dark spot on my face has faded (not completely). I love it because it is not greasy or thick like a lot of lotions for dry skin, it is so light. I recommend getting the smaller quantity as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This Serum dries almost instantly and makes your skin feel very smooth. Good price and fast shipping. Hope it works but it&#x27;s hard to know until you use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was gonna do a tca peel and also I had dry skin patches on my face and I tell u IT WORKED WONDERS!! No more dry skin and the peel is hydrated and peeled nicely. I will definitely buy a refill and maybe try the coq10 that they have on their website</li>
            <li> I love it, and I wish they don&#x27;t raise the price in the future,  because I&#x27;m going to order more. It works really good.</li>
            <li> i use this daily but especially when i have a reaction to something harsh or unknown...any kind of allergic reaction or hives or any rash.  hyaluronic is very soothing and cooling</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it and my skin look a lot better now.  I use it with the 20% C + E + Ferulic Acid Serum and the Skin Obsession Face Lift Serum.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried, I love it! I think it&#x27;s best to use this product in combination with Cerve face wash, or any face wash that has hyrolnic  acid in it! Cerve face wash can be bought in most drug stores...</li>
            <li> I was unable to try this product since the container was broken.  Since the container was made of glass, the contents leaked out.</li>
            <li> There is very little to comment on here...no softening effect, like other serums, no effect from &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34;.  No results period. It is sticky, annoying, but worst of all, useless .</li>
            <li> I like the product but I would have liked it better if it had NOT leaked.  Quite a bit of it leaked into the envelope.  I would suggest that if I should buy anymore that you package it differently.  I really like to get what I pay for.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Very firming without being greasy</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this product.  So far it feels nice on the skin and absorbs quickly.  I like that it does seem to work with other products and hasn&#x27;t caused any acne or rashes. It is too soon to see any effects yet.  In a few weeks I&#x27;ll write an update.</li>
            <li> This serum is great on my skin!  Loving it!! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!!! Love love love</li>
            <li> I liked this serum, but I feel like it was mostly glycerin, despite what the label says.</li>
            <li> I mix this with vitamin C powder and glycerine/water. makes a great serum to make my skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my face. I don&#x27;t look ten years younger but I like the way it brightens my skin and makes my skin tone more even,</li>
            <li> This is a great value. Hyaluronic acid really does help improve the skin - plumping effect, etc. I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> Just bought this too soon to judge</li>
            <li> In english:A great product! All the products I&#x27;m using for my skin is oily, acne gave me, but this product does not change my pele.Eu saw a review here on Amazon for a person who used the hair and decided testar.Pinguei 10 drops in my conditioner and my hair is curly it was soft.&lt;br /&gt;Portugues:&lt;br /&gt;Um ótimo produto!Todos os produtos que eu tenho utilizando para a minha pele que é oleosa, me davam acne, mas esse produto não altera minha pele.Eu vi um comentário aqui no Amazon de uma pessoa que utilizava nos cabelos e resolvi testar.Pinguei 10 gotinhas no meu condicionador e meu cabelo que é cacheado ficou macio.</li>
            <li> omg I love this.. I cant believe I lived without it. I mix a couple drops with my under eye cream.makes it work better. plumps the skin. I am 48 and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. not the best but really good for the price</li>
            <li> A must for aging skin!!!!!</li>
            <li> Says pure hyaluronic acid...but its disguised as a trade name.&lt;br /&gt;Its really only 1% hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special.</li>
            <li> This serum is like a regular serum, it didnt hurt my skin. It helped my wrinkles and very easy to put on and i had no bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Thie product is a non-oily moisturizer that absorbs well into your skin leaving no greasy residue.,..Your foundation spreads evenly over this product. There are no chemicals like propolene glycols to have to worry about. An excellent product!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I think it has really helped my oily skin.  Seems to me to be much less oily then it ever has been.  And it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
            <li> I see no change using this serum, other than giving my face a bit more color. Have since found that this serum doesn&#x27;t reduce wrinkles, just provides a little more moisture. I have bags and dark circles under my eyes. This product does nothing for that.</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff you pay 10x more for at the doctor&#x27;s office or at a high end spa where they have an RN on hand for the Botox and they offer you the expensive serums for your skin post microdermabrasion or chemical peel. I use this with a high grade olive oil and add a couple of drops to the oil, mix it in the palm of my hand, and apply to my damp face. It helps my skin to retain moisture and somehow helps the olive oil sink in for better overall absorption of both products. I&#x27;ve also put this into other moisturizers (Oil of Olay, Lancome, Estee Lauder, I&#x27;ve got a bunch.) FYI: I&#x27;ve used this product alone and found that as long as I put it onto my damp face it absorbs nicely; however, I still have to put on a moisturizer afterward. So I just combine the two, the combination seems to work better than using the products individually.</li>
            <li> I actually see no difference when I use this serum.  I note that the label says, &amp;#34;pure,&amp;#34; but the first ingredient is water.</li>
            <li> It does the trick.  Brightens your facial skin.  Only needs to be done once or twice a week.  Best to use the roller with it for optimum results.</li>
            <li> I was looking for hyaluronic acid serum when I came across this product.  I read one of the reviews that said the product came without instructions, and several other negative remarks, but it did seem to be the best value, so I decided to give it a try.  The product was beautifully packaged with instructions clearly printed on the box.  This is not a &#x27;cheap&#x27; product.  It looks like I went to a high-end department store to purchase it (without the expense!). The container is frosted glass with a glass eyedropper.  I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days, so it is a little early to tell how effective hyaluronic acid is at revitalizing skin, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> A very good moisturizer that I use for my arms as well as my face.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then other brands by far&lt;br /&gt;Works slower though but a good buy</li>
            <li> I do not see any difference.</li>
            <li> i dont like the idea of injectables in my face and know that it&#x27;s hyalouronic acid that plastic surgeons use as fillers for the face. I also realize that by not being injected , the likelihood of this product actually working is minimal, but it&#x27;s a nice clear serum , free of other ingredients. I love the idea of no propylen glycol or other annoying preservatives that most products have in them , so I use this, realizing there is nothing miraculous going to happen, but also realizing it cant hurt!</li>
            <li> Why buy expensive skincare products with diluted hyraluronic acid when you can just use this with your normal products?  It&#x27;s awesome!  I pat a few drops onto my face after serum and then spray a face mist before locking in all of the water with my normal moisturizer.  My skin absorbs so much more moisture this way than it used to with minor additional cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a master esthetician and I was using a $84 serum and this is phenomenal for any price. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> I have had mixed feelings about this product up until recently, and I have had it for almost a year. I have been mixing it with other lotions and creams, and I didn&#x27;t notice anything special. Lately, though, I have begun using it on its own after cleansing and toning, and now I love it! I have oily, acne prone skin and am in my early thirties. Usually when I use a lotion or cream, my face is left shiny and greasy feeling. Within a couple of hours, my forehead looks like an oil slick. With this serum my skin feels lightly moisturized and nourished, and has a nice matte finish. I don&#x27;t get that heavy, greasy feel that I get with almost every regular lotion or cream. I have only been using this at night, however, because I must wear spf during the day. That said, this is a wonderful serum for a fraction of the price of any drugstore serum containing hyaluronic acid. To those who doubt this, I say give it a try on its own for a while. You might be surprised!</li>
            <li> I have been using this a few weeks and I really think it is nice. It is affordable and it really helps smooth out my skin. Love it. Dermotalogist agrees it is a good product....(I asked him)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have had a love hate relationship with moisturizer for as long as I can remember due to the fact that I have sever acne. I&#x27;ve tried everything oil-free on the market and they all seem to make me break out. Hyaluronic Acid is pure moisture and the major moisturizing ingredient in all moisturizers. There is nothing in this to clog your pore or make your face angry. It is light and non-greasy and feels smooth going on your face. I usually mix it with my Benzoyl Peroxide Gel to keep me from drying out too much and from getting a chalky white face look.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs moisture in their skin care regimen, but wants one that keeps their face clear.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month, and I can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference, except that my skin seems to absorb this quickly and it makes my skin feel soft then I put my regular moisturizer over it. I have been using this on my chest, and it seems to have helped keeping it hydrated, but I don&#x27;t see a significant difference using this product overall.</li>
            <li> There was alcohol in this product and caused a reaction! This is not 100% Hyaluronic Acid like it suggests. 00000.</li>
            <li> I ordered the hyaluronic acid and just started using it. The first place I put it was on my eyelids, as they&#x27;re starting to droop. It tightened that area and kept it that way all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been mixing it with my face moisturizer and it kept my face moisturized without looking shiny or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No major improvments anywhere else, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Its great to use after a chemical peel.</li>
            <li> Great product with good moisturization!!! It is non-greasy and does not cause problems with sensitive skin. It is good quality and a drop goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Did not see any change. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Try Josie Maran Argan Oil. This &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; Hyaluronic Acid won&#x27;t do anything for your face. Argain Oil is much better. Really worked for me.</li>
            <li> my skin feels tighter and drier since using it.  I guess I was expecting my skin to feel more moisturized and plump.  Not the opposite.  Maybe it is too soon to rate it?  I have been using it with the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and have dry skin. This is a good product to help with that. I use it sparingly under face moisturizer. but it can be used anywhere externally to reduce dry skin.</li>
            <li> Using it has made my skin so soft, and fresh looking. I am so glad I found this new product!</li>
            <li> Does not do a thing except get chalky and flake off. No moisturizing properties whatsoever  Could be anything. Who knows? I took a risk and it did not pay off.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better since I have been using this.  Doesn&#x27;t look so dry and my face looks much smother and softer.</li>
            <li> I love to use this on freshly washed face and hair. Works best on damp face and hair since this product helps hold in moisture! I saw an instant lifting around my eyes and forehead but keep using it to get the full benefit! I also apply a good moisturizer to my face to soften those fine lines. I&#x27;m 55 but my friends can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them my real age. I&#x27;m so glad to find this product cause any Hyaluronic acid added to the others are just too darn expensive! I hope I can always buy from this retailer at a great price and fast shipping. Buy some now so you can look marvelous for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Makes me look younger</li>
            <li> I have never tried this type of serum before, so I am unable to compare it to other treatments or brands. I add 3 drops or so to a dime size amount of my favorite moisturizer and it works great. At first my skin feels a bit tacky to the touch, but that dissipates in about five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally purchased this for intensive post-peel moisturizing - which it works great for - but have also now started using it daily. Will definitely buy larger bottle next time!</li>
            <li> So you know my wrinkles &amp; sags are deeply embedded. I have been using the serum for about 1 month and people are telling me how good I look. I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m 20 again but I can see that it&#x27;s made some difference.</li>
            <li> This product does seem to be so helpful and I have used several bottles and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product three times.  I love this stuff.  I see people saying they have problems, but speaking for myself, this is a fantastic anti-aging, moisturizing product.  I have adult onset acne, so this helps.  I pair it with my teatree soap and natural coconut moisturizer, and voila no more horrendous breakouts.  I will keep ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tacky like some products do. I just began using it so I can&#x27;t tell if it works.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I would put 5 for a miracle product!!  It does help with my moisturiser....it helps with wrinkles...  Price is good.  If your young you don&#x27;t need this just moisturise but past 35 well you might want to look at it,  So far I&#x27;m liking this company.  This is my 2nd bottle and I will re-purchase.  Let say that I still needs fillers BUT I feel better using this than not using it.  There!</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN THE BEST THING IVE EVER USED ON MY FACE. PERIOD.&lt;br /&gt;If this was available on auto-ship id sign right up. Ive used face products costing up $250 by a well known doctor - this beats them out of the gate. In 3 days I had a new face. My skin looks like it did when i was 30, im way beyond that. Ive also found my face never gets greasy or shiny anymore either, something I used a matt moisturizer for - no more. I put it on a clean face before bed and after my shower in the morning. Nothing else.</li>
            <li> I used the product and loved it.  Order a few to give to my girl friends and the feedbacks were all good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any change. Waste of money. Should be a suggested uses pamphlet or something included. I guess the company assumes that consumers ordering plain Hyaluronic Acid knows what to do with it. I tried it by itself and with Vitamin E lotion... no change.</li>
            <li> My complexioni looks brighter and smoother... I love it and will be ordering more very soon! I recommend this to all ... I&#x27;ve gotten do many complements on my skin. One more thing, I don&#x27;t have that excess of oil anymore and my makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> I am actually in LOVE with this product.  I bought it about a year ago because of my acne scars and I can absolutely say that this product is the best.  I used to have really bad acne.  Like, really bad.  But I started this product and within a week of using it I noticed a huge different.  It prevented acne it really did.  All that I had to do was wash my face every morning and evening and I would put on a moisturizer afterwards and my skin felt healthier than it has every before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been waiting to review this product because I didn&#x27;t want it to only be a faze or a passing thing, but after one year I can honestly say I will be a customer forever.  My mom has started to use it and she is noticing a HUGE different in her skin.  With her it&#x27;s helping her out with the laugh lines she has around her eyes and mouth and she is loving AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone who asks me what I have started using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just need to find a product to take away the discoloration caused by my acne scars now that my skin is clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAVE NOT FELT THIS GOOD IN YEARS!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the serum....actually, I love it!  I use it on everyone I do facials on....very concentrated, so a little goes a long way.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  It does not work by itself.  You have to apply a moisturizer over it.  I prefer Boots No. 7.  I get many compliments about my lack of wrinkles (71 years young).  Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Always on the look-out for products that are natural based that work.  Voila&#x27;!  Here is one!  I use this after I wash my face.  I smooth it on my face, neck, arms, hands, and decolletage.  It has visibly reduced wrinkles, esp. on my neck, and my decolletage looks and feels more youthful.  Very affordable.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke.....save your money....didnt do a thing...felt like water going on..i should have sent it back for a refund, I am that unhappy with it....</li>
            <li> Great product, good price.  Will do business again.</li>
            <li> Great Product! The Quick Red Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Brown Dog! Quack Quack Quack said the little yellow duck!</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer and am very happy! Plumps up the skin and leaves it so soft. Soothing too.</li>
            <li> I make all my own skin care and realized I was missing a certain level of moisturization.  I bought this, experimented with how to use it, and finally have hit on a magic solution. I use this stuff by putting a dropper full on my plan and then adding two droppers of my facial oil (combo of kukui nut, jojoba oil, apricot kernel oil, rose hip seed, borage seed and essential oils I mix up myself) rubbing them together and applying them to my face and decolletege.  After two days of doing this, my skin looks better than it has in twenty years.  I feel like I have cracked the secret of youthful skin and thesis not breaking the bank.  I am 56 and my skin looks fantastic.  Thanks for making a good product affordable and available.</li>
            <li> I wish i had known about this hyaluronic acid before i spent a lot of money on other expensive moisturizing product.&lt;br /&gt;This is absorbed on skin fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky feeling. I recommend this to anyone. And the price is great! I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wow is my initial reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a cream with Hyaluronic acid in it and after several weeks my skin tone started evening out, fine lines around my eyes grew softer. Then I saw this product here for the same price &amp; a much larger bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this bottle here with a simple facial cream instead of the one I had previously been using to see if it works as good &amp; to my surprise it works better! Within the first 2 days my skin was soft just like with the other cream, fine lines are still smoothing out, (with this one my acne breakouts are going away!), and impressive of all puffiness under my eyes is less noticeable. My skin tone is still clearing up. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s with fair skin that is very sensitive. During the day I wear natural sunscreen from Aubrey over this &amp; at night I mix a couple drops in with my facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle easily will last me a few months. A little bit goes such a long way. I have even shared some of this with family members &amp; still have enough left to last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting compliments on my skin, and the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently is start using Hyaluronic Acid (initially the cream made of this &amp; now the serum with my own facial cream).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather put something on my skin that I know what I am using (natural facial creams from Aubrey) than chemicals that burn my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is gentle directly on my skin &amp; has not caused dryness or burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update**&lt;br /&gt;Since my initial review I have been using this serum twice daily under moisturizer for puffiness under my eyes &amp; some fine wrinkles. My skin tone is evening out still, it is too the point where I almost don&#x27;t need to wear a liquid foundation, I can almost get by with powder only.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned putting this in conditioner &amp; it leaving her hair soft, so I added a few drops to a spray bottle with some leave in conditioning treatment &amp; spray that on before blow drying &amp; my hair is silky, shiny &amp; has less static. This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s been really gentle on my skin &amp; even around my eye area, when almost nothing else is.&lt;br /&gt;This is really a good product, I&#x27;ve also added it into my hand moisturizer, put it on my cuticles. Works great.ing &amp; my hair is silky, shiny &amp; has less static. This stuff is amazing.

            <li> I did my research after ordering this product. Unfortunately, there is no research showing anti-aging benefits from hyaluronic acid used as a topical serum or cream. Save your money for something else!</li>
            <li> This does work really well.  It takes time so be patient, and use moisturizer after using the serum to lock it in the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and still occasionally get a few pimples on my back. After complaining how acne body wash doesn&#x27;t help, my brother (who has the same issue) recommended to try this stuff. I rub a drop on my shoulders after drying off when getting out of the shower and it has completely cleared up my back acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my acne, I am in my early 20s and have worse acne now than I did when I was a teenager, this product not only helped bring my acne under control but it has smoothed out wrinkles and lines I was only suspected I had, I am young but I feel like my skin looks even younger now, it helped the tone and clarity of my skin. At this price its definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my NuSkin galvanic spa as their face gell is pricy. I do like it for&lt;br /&gt;This use. I can&#x27;t say if it would work without a device but Ive used it with both my spa&lt;br /&gt;And my ultra sound.</li>
            <li> Fountain of youth in a bottle. Timeless. This product has made me a very happy consumer. A must have to a everyday skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I combined this serum with some oils for my skin and I massage it in after every shower. My skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I  love this product it makes my skin  feel fantastic.  I seen instant results after using this product.  I going to be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> Ordered the product to use with my retin A cream. Its very hydrating but can&#x27;t tell anything outstanding about it. I like it though. At the price its a bargain even for just moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t see it made any huge difference for me. I am 53 and used garnier cream for about a 1 1/2. I will keep using this maybe it will do more after more time. I have used it about a month.</li>
            <li> The Customer Service people were great! Friendly as can be and I appreciate them giving me a sample. It came in the mail fast! I like the product and I will be purchasing it. I also told two other ladies I work with about it today and they plan on buying some also! Thanks Timeless Skin Care!</li>
            <li> I bought it a while ago for 5 bottles I used it continuously but didn&#x27;t like it I don&#x27;t think it helped my skin moisturize or anything AT ALL. In fact I think maybe this is not real Hyaluronic Acid or it&#x27;s just bad bad quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff.  And I can say this. My face stopped breaking out. Use just a light moisturizer over it.  As far as adding moisture...I can&#x27;t really say and lines look the same. But my complexion is clearer and I can&#x27;t live without it.  I stopped using it during a trip and my skin broke out immediately.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered.  Great product that has helped my skin hold moisture.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I use this with microneedling and its okay. It gets raves Zollverein the Internet but its just something good to put on your skin when your bored with everything else. Its odorless and not oily so why not.</li>
            <li> Love this product will continue to always order. Going on my third order soon, love the way it feels on my face!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivers in it&#x27;s promises. My skin feels very soft and supple and looks plumper by the day! I will order more of this! By the way.... a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using it along with the Micro Roller Skin roller and what a team they make.  In 3 weeks my skin is looking fresher and younger.</li>
            <li> After I have bought item, I have realized there is a Benzylalcohol in a product.  There are discussions about it and I started to worry to use it since I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what types of alchol is Benzylalcohol but it is one I want to avoid using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, this product does not irritate my skin at all and works great.&lt;br /&gt;I use it mixing with toner in a morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as face mask (I soak cotton in a toner with this) and leave for 10min.&lt;br /&gt;I went out with not foundation on (only sunscreen cream...) and people telling me I had such a beautiful skin recently.&lt;br /&gt;I have not changed any skin care I have use started to use derm roller (twice still) and this.&lt;br /&gt;I have also bought same product without Benzylalcohol in other seller.( I have not receive them yet..)&lt;br /&gt;I have they work same as this item......&lt;br /&gt;Because this item work so good, with a item Benzylalcohol might better?</li>
            <li> Due to the mostly good reviews on here about this product, I bought it. I used it faithfully for a few weeks. The only difference I saw in my skin was breakouts. I had three large pimples on my forehead that wouldn&#x27;t go away and my chin kept breaking out in whiteheads. I thought I would continue using it, because I thought maybe the breakouts were due to the change in weather or something else other than this product. I finally stopped using it (after using about 1/3 of the bottle)....and my skin cleared up practically overnight. Yup, this stuff was the culprit. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple since I stopped using this stuff. I gave what was left of my bottle to a friend at work who was interested in using a HA product (I warned her about my breakout). I asked her how she liked it and she said she&#x27;s had no problems with it and she likes it...but she also said she&#x27;s been using other products as well.</li>
            <li> I cant believe I read so many good reviews about this product. Its just water and doesnt do anything to your skin.</li>
            <li> I love it ! Make my skin smooth, and very bright, I used before bed, is very good for my face</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered this.  It seems to be doing good.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my skin at all.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.  Will order it again.</li>
            <li> high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
            <li> I just really dont know what I had hoped for. It does tend to tighten the skin a bit, I am uncertain if it leaves a lasting result-if it can actually get into and remain in the subdermal layers...maybe it does with the use of the skin roller once or twice a month would be my recommendation</li>
            <li> causes big skin pores</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I stumbled across this on Amazon when I was looking to add to my skin care routine during Chicago&#x27;s wonderful polar vortex. No matter what I did my skin was so dry.  So I bought this and gave it a try. I can&#x27;t say it necessarily aided in hydration, but it really helped clear up my skin! My skin was always pretty good but I&#x27;d get breakouts around my chin and nothing I did could prevent them. They were cystic too. After using this stuff, the cystic breakouts have significantly subsided and if I do get a pimple, it goes away faster.  Now I haven&#x27;t done a ton of research on hyaluronic acid but everything I see tells me it&#x27;s awesome for my skin.  So many expensive serums have it as an ingredient. Well this is how I get my fix for $13. Don&#x27;t have to shell out $30+ for a name brand.  My skin looks better so this is all that matters. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends too.</li>
            <li> At first I was cross because I had wanted the oral version but after adding to my skin cream I am impressed with the added flexibility and texture of my 90 year old skin. It looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make any appreciable difference.</li>
            <li> Perfect - fast shipping. Would user again</li>
            <li> Making own night face cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and so far have seen a marked improvement in my skin tone and firmness. Combined with the Merlot Grapeseed moisturizer, this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> A very lovely product, at a great price.  A little goes a long way.  if you have dry skin, this is the product for you.  Hyaluronic acid (originally extracted from rooster&#x27;s combs!  How grisly is that factoid?!) is one of the greatest humectants available today, and is easily absorbed into the skin.  I feel plumped up, in a good way, after one application.  Since the price is good, I am not so frugal with my application.  A must have in every home!</li>
            <li> I love the high quality glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;the product is light, non greasy and makes my skin feel better!&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see results, not really sure about that??</li>
            <li> Like many of the others commenting that it didn&#x27;t work for them, I was using it wrong! I used it twice a day for a month and thought what am I missing here? It didn&#x27;t feel moisturizing at all, if anything my face felt tight and dry after. So I came back and read the reviews again and noticed the company had replied to one, you need to follow up with a moisturizer. I thought what is point of it then, I can just use my normal routine for that. When my skin is feeling dry, especially in the winter, I would get out of the shower, apply my own mix of 50% jojoba oil and 50% apricot kernel oil. I let that sit on my face while I put lotion on the rest of my body, brush teeth etc. Then I would wipe all the extra oil off my face with a dry washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I did this but I applied the Hyaluronic Acid Serum FIRST. About 4 drops (this bottle will last a very long time!) Applied my oils like normal. But when I went to wipe off the excess, there wasn&#x27;t any! My face had actually absorbed it! My skin felt smooth and moisturized and not oily at all (which is hard to find when you have combo/oily skin), and the lines around my eyes are much softer. Think of this as your favorite product&#x27;s magnet, or a moister &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used this product faithfully night and morning. I am still awaiting the results I was told to expect. I shall carry on trying. Maybe my age is against me. I am 77 years old. I have always been told I looked younger than my age but one has to keep on trying.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing... Instantly firms and plumps the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to find 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid over the counter anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Every product I have found in stores with Hyaluronic acid in it is at least three times the cost..&lt;br /&gt;This is a steal!!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I started using the small jar before I bought the large one (which is more worth it) The first time you ever use this product, you will feel like your face is so soft and smooth and plump. However, after a while, your face get used to it so you might not feel it&#x27;s soft enough or plumps. I use it for my entire face and eye and like I said in beginning it does hydrate and works but after a while, it kind of became one of those products where you don&#x27;t see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I must say, the product is good if you are mixing your creams or sunscreen . Sometimes some products you put on seems too sticky or leaves a heavy feeling on your face, well when combining with this acid, your face will instant starts to absorb your other cream faster and most time leaving your face feel unsticky. That&#x27;s the main reason I love this.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what I was expecting, but I am pretty happy about  this product. I think it works great after rolling m micro needle.</li>
            <li> So I often use hyaluronic serum. I decided to give this brand a shot. However, I will not be ordering it anymore. It&#x27;s very watered down it feels like I am applying water to my face. My usual hyaluronic serum by asdm beverly hills is much better very thick and moisturizing. I gave two stars only because it does contain natural ingredients and does not make me breakout. A quality hyaluronic serum should only require you use two drops I have to use more with this one. Also I thought this serum was 100% hyaluronic serum but it has other filler ingredients. I prefer a serum that only contains the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> I admit this product is excellent. I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I already can see the result. It gives nice glowing and moist. I initially used it after my toner and then put my moisturizer+ argan oil after this. But I did not see much effect so I started to mix it with my moiturizer. And the result was great!! I recommend to use this product to mix with your serum or moisturizer. This product itself is worthy of 5 stars but I had to give 4 stars because it did not come with any instruction.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference since adding this to my skincare regimen. Please be aware that hyaluronic acid is to be used with other items, namely moisturizers. Pat on a small amount (I use it all over my face, including my eye area, neck and decollete), give it about ten seconds to dry, then top with moisturizer of your choice. The most dramatic difference for me was finally seeing my eye cream diminish my dark circles and seeing my Palmer&#x27;s Bust Cream go to town on my stretch marks. A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;d expect my bottle to last at least a year. Packaged nicely and well-wrapped. Came a few days early.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a very nice change in my skin since using this product.</li>
            <li> This product performs as advertised. A little bit goes a long way. I would recomend this product and I will purchase it again. Seller was prompt and efficent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay for the price...does not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> Not greasy on the skin... very light! This product already has really good reviews... I probably wont have anything more to say to convince people of its awesomeness! Just another satisfied customer! :)</li>
            <li> Love this so much. i use it a least once a day sometimes twice. skin is not dry or oily when i use it. love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this serum dried out my skin. Additionally, the packaging for this product included confetti and no instructions. Save the confetti for a party, I&#x27;ll take the instructions... I gathered from the reviews, 2 drops were needed, so I applied, then applied a moisturizer. My skin felt dry... So, I used alone with the same results. Then I used with other trusted moisturizers and broke out. I kept at it because of the good reviews, but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Got it on time and am using it as it is intended to be used.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel great.  My only complaint is that there were no instructions included.  I had to read the reviews to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> This is like applying water to my face, has done nothing for me, you will get the same results from it if you were to use facet water</li>
            <li> I am not sure if maybe I am doing this all wrong or what.&lt;br /&gt;The product came with no information saved for the name on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;the directions I found on their amazon page was quite vague.&lt;br /&gt;So i based it on all the many many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I actually got the thayer witch hazel toner, and dab a cotton ball with that all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;after that, i use the dropper with the hyaluronic acid serum, and focas most around my eyes and the side of my face that had some scaring from pimples. I also have slight wrinkles around my nose/mouth area.&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of using this 2x/day, my skin started to produce more oil and I started breaking out, so afer i rubbed the serum in a thin layer over my face, when it dried I applied a regular anti-aging serum (which is light and sprays on, usually I never break out with this and my skin is so sensitive, this usually never burns or anything when using).&lt;br /&gt;However, my face just felt all blocked up, my skin felt heavy, and it seems my wrinkles are more defined than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I am not sure if I am doing it wrong. So I decided not to put it directly on my skin (the hyaluronic acid) and instead drop it onto the cotton that had the witch hazel toner, and decided to spread over my skin that way. I noticed nothing.&lt;br /&gt;my next attempt will to take the witch hazel completely out, though it has helped my skin feel less dry, i am just over the oily skin I am getting on hr to 2 hrs later.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid 20&#x27;s so my wrinkles aren&#x27;t crazy, but after all the reviews I had high hopes, so I will continue to use this until it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish there was more information on how to use this product to it&#x27;s full potential. I usually never use facial cream moisturizers as pretty much all of them are too heavy for my skin and irritate/make it greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;till next time....i guess</li>
            <li> Busted in 100&#x27;s of pieces. No one will replace bunch of crap</li>
            <li> I used to spend a lot of money on expensive anti-aging creams. Now I buy this Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Timeless Skin Care, and a Vitamin C Serum, and along with a tiny bit a Retin-A (prescription strength), add them to an inexpensive moisturizer like CeraVe.  This serum is a great value (I did a lot of comparison shopping) and also works well on its one too!</li>
            <li> I use this daily. I am 76 with no wrinkles. I&#x27;m sure heredity plays a part. However, I will continue to use this because I think this has value.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for several months now, and I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and it is very gentle on my skin. The price seems fair compared to&lt;br /&gt;other brands. I use this twice a day. I have not had any allergic reaction to this at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are so many really positive reviews on this product. Nothing special here and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled. Expected much higher concentration of HA.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I got this product mostly because I didn&#x27;t like my how my neck was starting to look. It was dry and wrinkled. I started using this product hoping it would help. I made a good choice, I&#x27;m half way thru the bottle now &amp; I do see a difference. My neck does not look dry anymore and I can see wrinkles are less noticible. They have not disapeared and they won&#x27;t but I&#x27;m happy that it doesnt look like a turtle&#x27;s neck. On the other hand my face looks great and flawless and like when I get compliments as to how young I look. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s &amp; I believe this product certainly helps me keep my younger appearance.</li>
            <li> This in combination with the Triple C serum is nothing short of amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. As described. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my skin. It felt nice going on but that means nothing in the long run. Did not give me any extra moisture, did not even skin tone, did not help complexion. I honestly like others, am dumbfounded by this product. I think too many of us are tricked by all of the amazing fake reviews on Amazon. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this product!!!</li>
            <li> I get this for my mom and she likes it.  She&#x27;s been using it for years and she looks younger than her age. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of this or something else but it can&#x27;t hurt right.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel. And the price is right.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because everyone raved about it.  In the end, I didn&#x27;t have noticeable results so I won&#x27;t be purchasing another one :_(</li>
            <li> I used this religiously every night for about 4-6 months... It did not work... Absolutely a fail product. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It instantly lifts my skin. The only downside is that it leaves kind a kind-of sticky film on my face, which seems like it takes forever to dry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hyalauronic acid after vitamin C serum morning and night. At this time I&#x27;ve seen zero changes to my skin. I will continue with this regimen for another month to give this combo a fair trial. I&#x27;m 68 years old so I know not to expect much. Gave it 3 stars for being fairly priced, quick delivery and good consistency</li>
            <li> Mixed with Retinol for better results, but great product even if used alone. Does make skin peel as if light sunburn but had beautiful glowing skin that was commented on by random strangers after!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is not greasy on my sensitive, acne prone skin.  It did not give me a break out and I mix it in with other night cream I use.  Will recommend this product to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item twice not realizing the second time round it was from \\&quot;TIMELESS\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t understand how this is a serum. Just as another reviewer stated, the product has a watery consistency, there&#x27;s no ingredient listed, just the label the shipper could have printed himself in a labeler and guess what the Argan oil is the same way - not a bit of oiliness. Same label, no info. I wont be making a purchase from TIMELESS ever again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! IT DOES GREAT FOR OILY SKIN AND DOES IT&#x27;S JOB WORKING WITH YOUR CURRENT MOISTURIZER OR BB CREAM! I ACCIDENTLY BROKE MY HYALURONIC  ACID BOTTLE AND IT ALL SPILLED TO WASTE! THE MERCHANT WAS SO KIND ENOUGH TO REPLACE IT RIGHT AWAY! AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I WILL BE BUYING THIS PRODUCT FROM NOW ON! TRY IT! YOU WILL SEE AMAZING RESULTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH OILY SKIN!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from amazon, it arrived fine.  Used for 3 weeks, no change.  Used for 2 more months, no change.  Mine feels like glycerine so I tasted it.  No taste.  Save yourself some money and buy something that works.  This is not it.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate it properly but my face feels great after using it, will continue use of it.</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this product. I have used this for a year and noticed no change in my skin. I could skip this step altogether and notice no difference. I am disappointed but will try another brand next.</li>
            <li> amazing product , really helped improve my skin, be smoother, fine lines deminished, no smell, wears nice under make up, but you may need a bit of a moisturizer over it , at night I use argan oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Question i have is, after the bottle is about half way empty I noticed the clear acid turning more and more yellow?&lt;br /&gt;I use the dropper and only drop a few drops in the palm of my hand, not touching my hand, yet this is my second bottle&lt;br /&gt;and it happens every time. I use enough of it so it is not like the product is getting old and turns yellow.?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does anyone know why this happens?</li>
            <li> Add to my body lotion each day. I have noticed a difference with better moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> They say this is the best moisturizer, and I believe it. A little bit goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Well, I got lucky! This stuff did actually make a difference. I don&#x27;t know if it is the best on the market, but it helped me. And I didn&#x27;t think anything that wasn&#x27;t gonna cost me an arm and a leg would work! You do have to continue to use it though...religiously!</li>
            <li> A few drops mixed in with my moisturizer plumps up fine lines under my eyes. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Have dark spots on my face and this stuff is actually working,, was using Clinique products that didn&#x27;t work!! Now my dark spots are very light color and now I am able to cover them with foundation (have been using this product only three weeks) I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I write VERY few reviews.  I&#x27;m a skeptic and don&#x27;t believe it until I see and experience it for myself.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this, but I&#x27;m 50+, had a crease between my eyebrows that&#x27;s literally almost gone now, my fine wrinkles are barely perceptable, and my neck area looks to be tighter.  I mix 3 drops at night with my night oil or cream and wake up looking younger.  Don&#x27;t know how it works, but I&#x27;m gonna keep buying it - and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so inexpensive!  I&#x27;ll never buy expensive branded serums again.</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for since my teens. I have annoyingly awful combination skin; super dry in the winter; easily sensitive; oily and acne prone. All of these fascist of my skin are contradictions of themselves and have caused me to breakout for half of my life. Most moisturizers are too oily (even the oil-free ones, somehow) and cause breakouts, but my skin craves some sort of hydration. If I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer I look like a molting snake, but with acne. Not attractive. This stuff solves those annoying issues I&#x27;ve been having for years. It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft. My horrendous breakouts are for the most part gone, (that time of the month will always be unforgiving) my skin looks dewy and fresh, and the slight lines I was starting to see around my almost thirty eyes are much less noticible. For the first time in quite a while I&#x27;m okay going out in public without makeup. That&#x27;s a big deal!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I was able to buy the 2 oz . I wear this everyday and have seen a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Gentle but effective facial moisturizer keeps my skin soft and firm would recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> Just what does pure mean? What is the actual percentage of the acid in the solution in the bottle? There is plenty of room on the label to print this information. I would think that it would also have an MSD (Material Safety Data) sheet available. It comes in a heavy weight poly bottle with dropper and is sealed and bubble wrapped before being boxed for shipping. It looks good but gives no other data about it. I kept it, putting my trust in the seller, because it is a good value. The reason I questioned the &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; is it is my understanding that if the bottle contained 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid it would be dangerous to use as is. My trust is given due to the word Serum added here which to me denotes a mixture. However my bottles label doesn&#x27;t say that. It says &amp;#34;Hyaluronic Acid Pure&amp;#34;. More info would equal 2 more stars.</li>
            <li> i have been using this to fade age spots for about three days.I &#x27;m not sure if its working just wait and see</li>
            <li> Second bottle I purchased. Makes your skin feel nice. Whether it helps the wrinkles - maybe. My 30 year old niece thinks it does. I am twice that age and I need the big guns like retin A and Rodan and Fields. I use this with Rodan and it works best this way. I tried to find a cheaper alternative to Rodan and Fields but kept noticing more fine lines. Yikes. So, back on the R&amp;F wagon.</li>
            <li> Feels very good on the skin and seemed to help the dryness although it might be better as a additive to a moisturizer rather that out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It took 19 days to reach China; quickly! After my family use to say good use! If you have American friends need Chinese products can contact me, My Home: www.facebook.com/far1006</li>
            <li> I like how my skin feels after using this product. Early days yet, as only used for one week, but certainly shows promise as lines appear softened and makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum based mostly on the glowing reviews.  The first week I used the serum I was happy as my skin was so soft and smooth, however by the end of the second week I&#x27;d started to resemble the Mummy&#x27;s bride.  The serum really sucked all of the moisture out of my skin and left me looking a little dessicated.  I have normal/combination skin.  I used the serum on damp skin and followed with a good moisturizer and water spritzer but still ended up with dry skin so I&#x27;ve stopped using it.  I&#x27;ll give it another try in late summer when the humidity is higher, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum with my moisturizer in the AM and at night.  My skin doesn&#x27;t look dry.  It&#x27;s more plump and dewy.  Not greasy or sticky.  Great product and can be added with moisturizers or other serums.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> If this is 100% Pure Hyaluronic Serum then why is the first ingredient on the label water? I&#x27;m hoping someone can explain. I haven&#x27;t used the product yet so I cannot review it&#x27;s efficacy, but I will be sure to update in a few weeks. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Even if this stuff is 99% water, I have to admit that I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results. My skin has been much clearer than it typically was prior to using this product. Another bonus is that I don&#x27;t seem to be wearing as much makeup lately - it just doesn&#x27;t seem necessary as my complexion is so much better. I used to feel naked without a full face of makeup, but not anymore. Now I just need a miracle cure for all those little lines and wrinkles :)</li>
            <li> Not sure why anyone, including myself, would buy this product. It&#x27;s a waste of money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I loved doing business with this seller.  This is great to add to your skin care products or to use alone. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works.  Even without prepping my skin with the microneedling (as suggested on other skin care sites), it works with clean skin, still moist from shower or washing...rub it in gently and let it dry down....it&#x27;s very good for my skin. I can already see the difference....can&#x27;t wait to actually use it AFTER I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of needling my skin and then using it!!</li>
            <li> Had adult acne prone skin with bumps! Never bothered since I &#x27; almost 40 thinking it would go away along with mild rosacea.. But I soon realised unless I take care of my skin, the acne would stay forever &amp; not to mention the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I have been using the pure hyaluronic  acid with skin actives restoration cream &amp; sea buckthorn oil, never even once saw an acne invading my face! Bonus, my skin has become soft, supple &amp; the bumps disappeared! It&#x27;s been only 3 weeks since I incorporated into my nighttime regime. My skin just love this product! Can never think of skin care without this wonderful product. I only use 2 drops of it into my Restorative cream every night! I&#x27; getting compliments for the clear skin! Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anymore what works and what doesn&#x27;t, or if i&#x27;m just blessed with some pretty decent genes, but i use this stuff every night under my night cream and get compliments on my skin all the time.  At 55, that makes me pretty happy!</li>
            <li> It feels like it is doing \\&quot;something.\\&quot; Absorbs well and I think my skin likes it! It is inexpensive and arrived quickly so I will reorder for sure!</li>
            <li> I have tried a million products and this is the best. I have extremely oily skin and this product has accomplished what no other product has ever done it has kept my skin so moist and blemish free.  I use it in the morning and night. I will highly recommend this product and will continue to use it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This hydrates skin with a silky feeling and not a greasy feeling.  I loved using it not only on my face but arms and hands too.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this especially in the winter when the air is so dry. I even get my husband to use it once in awhile. Now that&#x27;s an endorsement right there.  I definitely would recommend it to anyone with dry skin and for mature skin to rehydrate skin back to its luscious younger self.</li>
            <li> It smooths your skin a great deal. I have seen no difference in its affects for fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for the skin and really helps with moisture retention. It is one of my favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin as well as numerous allergies. The fewer ingredients, the better.  Less expensive products cause far fewer problems. A cosmetic surgeon reccomended HA, especially for my upper chest which has long years of sun (and wind) exposure. I live in the South and drove convertibles year round most of my adult life. I&#x27;ve reordered Timeless Ha Serum several times, and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s not any sort of miracle, but there is obvious improvement in my skin, especially the crepey areas. I usually mix it with a very simple non-allergenic moisturizing lotion, day and night, but it can be mixed with sunscreen and other creams and lotions. I like the glass bottles and droppers which can be sanitized and re-used. I&#x27;ve had no interaction with Timeless, so I can&#x27;t comment on their customer service, but I didn&#x27;t find any of their explanations and comments here to be out of line and I can&#x27;t imagine  why a large number of people have made the effort to state they&#x27;ve never used it and never will. As a consumer, I want to hear about actual experiences. Anything else muddies the waters and makes it difficult for people to get useful information. It&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s right to boycott a company for any reason at all, of course. Nothng wrong with that at all.</li>
            <li> So far (2 weeks) this serum has behaved like a calming humectant without causing redness and irritation. The trick, as another user points out, is to use it in combination with another wetting agent/humectant. I mix it with my rosewater/glycerin and spritz it on. It appears to fill out lines by plumping out my skin. I don&#x27;t know what long term benefits this formulation but I love the price, it&#x27;s unbeatable!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the hyaluronic acid now for more than a year. The stuff is great! I see a huge improvement in my skin, and the texture of skin has improved. When my wife looks at me, she lucks my face because she says I&#x27;m one smooth skin chocolate man. Amen to this stuff! 5 stars on that ass!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! As a woman approaching 60 I am concerned about my complexion and the effects of aging. This is a lovely product. I&#x27;m using it with some of their other products and I am loving the results. My face and neck are fresh glowing and so smooth. This blends easily and is non greasy and easily absorbs. I use this after derma rolling for deep down results.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product !!! Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know why I bought this. I am also still unsure as when to use it? Someone tell me.... It&#x27;s just sitting in my drawer. I know I was supposed to use it in conjunction with my needler.... But when, how?</li>
            <li> I Love it I Mix With my regular lotion it&#x27;s not greasy so far so good. I use morning/night my face doesn&#x27;t have That Winter dry feeling. I Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This company sends quality items and quick delivery.  I started using this on my face and have noticed a huge improvement on the texture and fine lines.  It soaks in easily and can be worn under makeup.  I use it in the morning before I put on moisturizer and in the evening.  A must have!</li>
            <li> Love this product, works great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Hyaluronic Acid Serum by a brand that will remain nameless, for several years.  It was very pricey, but I loved what it did for my skin, especially after an at home peel or microdermabrasion treatment as it really soothes my skin and speeds up recovery time.  The brand I used was very pricey, and I found I used it less and less because it felt prohibitive to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the reviews on this serum, and the price, I figured I&#x27;d take a chance.  I love the dropper vial as opposed to the pump system my old brand used - this helps me ensure I&#x27;m getting just the right amount of product vs. too much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself goes on smoothly, absorbs into my skin quickly and plays nicely with the apple stem cell serum I use.  I find my under eye concealer goes on much better with it, and my mineral make up goes on smoother after letting this soak in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive and reactive to new product and I did have a very minor break out from this the first week I used it.  By week two, the breakouts had resolved as my skin adjusted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like this serum.  It didn&#x27;t knock my socks off like my old serum did, which approached mythical &amp;#34;miracle in a bottle&amp;#34; proportions (with a hefty price tag attached!), but it does the job very well, at a fraction of the cost, so I&#x27;ll definitely reorder it when I run out.</li>
            <li> not even sure if the product is what it is - not good at all</li>
            <li> Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
            <li> 3rd purchase - love this, use it on my hair too :)</li>
            <li> Made big different on my skin!</li>
            <li> After a month of using this product I do not see any changes. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, its the pores on my face I want to be less prominent.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff! I wear under my make up , wear it at night etc.</li>
            <li> When mixed with liquid vitamin c serum it helps with wrinkles</li>
            <li> First of all, good luck getting any products from timeless skin care, if you are lucky and you get it, they have a reputation of charging your credit and not sending the products, it is not authentic hyaluronic acid serum, I have used skinceuticals from the dermatologist hyaluronic acid for years, thought I would save some money and buy this, my skin got so irritated had to go to the dermatologist and get some hydrocortisone cream to calm down the redness, the doctor said the timeless skin care hyaluronic acid was a cheap imitation and causing my skin to breakout, in the end it cost a lot more then buying the authentic hyaluronic acid by skinceuticals and having to wears makeup to cover the redness</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  I saw no diference. I didn&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> Save your most, this does NOTHING! You get netters results using organic coconut oil everyday on your skin and as a conditioner on your hair...</li>
            <li> Great mositurizer for people with acne prone skin and cant use other mositerizers becasue so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face glows after application of this product, it feels like water, not sticky at all....its the best and i will order more &amp; more.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, am used to humidity and am living in a dry climate. My package arrived quickly and I tried it the same evening on my hands. I noticed that paper dry feeling was no longer there the next day. The following evening I tried it on my face. The next night I forgot to use it and felt my skin was tight and dry. I&#x27;m now using it twice a day. Wonderful stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this. My skin gets extremely dry, but this has made winter so much easier. I also feel like it has kind of a plumping/firming effect. Nice to use under makeup because it is not at all greasy like a lotion moisturizer. I can easily see and feel if I skip it for a couple of days, and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> i can see the result in my face and neck, with my dairy face cream. It&#x27;s a miracle !!&lt;br /&gt; Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Just a little drop goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it even tightens my skin, and I am 61 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I feel and look younger when I use it under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;You will see the difference in your skin texture, brightness, and softness!</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> Still not sure about how great this is, does no harm</li>
            <li> READ THE INGREDIENT LIST !!!!!  Water is the First Ingredient, then only  1%  Sodium Hyaluronate , plus 2 addtional additives.  I do not consider any product that list 4 ingredients to be 100%  pure, particularly when it only contains 1% of the product advertised,  Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Timeless.</li>
            <li> I would reccommend this product to any of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;The product works and produces fabuloous results. Reccommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. The serum feels so good on my face. Not sure it plumps wrinkles but makes my skin moist.</li>
            <li> This really does work well with vitamin c. Kind of pumps up saggy skin</li>
            <li> the older you get, you loose elasticity, your skin get dehydrated, I was looking for a super hydrator. this serum is a refresher, your skin is moist all day. still using my bottle. will definitely purchase again if I run out.</li>
            <li> I use this after derma rolling. First I use the Vitamin C with E Ferulic Acid Serum followed by the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. So far, my skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> Helps women who have thinning hair, regrow that hair. Use it daily and you will see results.</li>
