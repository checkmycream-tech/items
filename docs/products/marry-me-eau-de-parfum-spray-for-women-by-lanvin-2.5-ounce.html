            <li> I love this perfume.  I bought it without ever having smelled it with the intention of wearing it on my wedding day.  It was just a little more harsh than I wanted for that day, so I went with something else, but I wore it to all the events the week before the wedding leading up to the big day.  Now whenever I smell it, I am reminded of all the fun things going on during that week and how excited and happy I was.</li>
            <li> delivery was fast. i really love the scent of this perfume. however, i&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s really the original perfume as it doesn&#x27;t last on the skin as long as eau the parfums normally do. next time i&#x27;ll spend the few extra bucks and buy it from a trusted retail store.</li>

            <li> bought this to be worn on my wedding day. Love the name as it suits how I felt at the time. Now each time I wear it, I&#x27;m reminded of how I felt on the day we got married - excited, happy, nervous, elated. Love how the smell is not too flowery or too strong.

            <li> Definitely one of my favorite perfume scents.  I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a perfume for so long and this is perfect for a night out and even everyday.  As soon as I smelled this after my friend wore it I knew it was the perfect one. The packaging is amazingly elegant and very pretty.  I recommend this for older teens to even mid 20s. It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent.</li>
