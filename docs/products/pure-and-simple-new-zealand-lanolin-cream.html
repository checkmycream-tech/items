            <li>I love the New Zealand Lanolin Cream.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, is not greasy, and is a great value for the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a thick, heavy cream as you might imagine with being lanolin based but just the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>Very soothing with a light, neutral and pleasing fragrance that&#x27;s pleasing to both my husband and me.  </li>
            <li>This product feels just right</li>
            <li>However, the perfume, which is very strong, totally puts me off using the cream - even my husband commented on it!</li>
            <li>I tried other lotions for dry and stressed skin but this works best for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will purchase more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NZ lanolin highly recomended!!</li>
            <li>It is light, absorbs quickly and does not sting any open cracks or eczema you may have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a shame as the texture of the cream is lovely and it seems to be quite gentle.</li>
            <li>The whole family is pleased to add Koru products to our daily lives.</li>
            <li>This is a true workhorse as far as skin cream goes.</li>
            <li>Made my feet super soft.</li>
            <li>I would have given this cream 5 stars but the smell really is so pungent I can&#x27;t use the cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy but is very creamy..</li>
            <li>I use it as a whole body moisturizer -- hands, face, elbows, arms, legs, etc.</li>
            <li>thanks for such quick service.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to pure lanolin products on an extended trip to New Zealand.</li>
            <li>Most are not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I knit a lot with high quality wools</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s JUST the high quality cream</li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>Too heavy to use under my makeup but other than that its a great cream.</li>
            <li>I really wish they would modify or completely leave the perfume out.</li>
            <li>the Australian Golden Lanolin sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is not too strong, however we bought it for our son and perhaps it would suit a little girl better since the fragrance is slightly feminine...to my opinion.</li>
            <li>all day long I enjoy the simple benefits of this pure, wholesome product.</li>
            <li>This is LOADED iwth lanolin that somehow goes right into dry skin, and really softens and helps.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product by my friend&#x27;s mother-in-law, a native New Zealander.</li>
            <li>I gave them the New Zealand Lanolin Cream.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night to keep my skin on my hands and arms soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it never ever gives me a problem.</li>
            <li>I work in the healthcare industry and have to wash my hands frequently.</li>
            <li>I never expected it to come so quickly; well before the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and the moisturizing effects last a long time.</li>
            <li>Six more, I am tired typing.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have commented on the smell -- I don&#x27;t find it to be that pungent and you really don&#x27;t notice it once the cream has been applied.</li>
            <li>No matter how rough and hard your skin is, this product can make it so much better.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry skin or live in a semiarid region of a country this is a must product for your skin.</li>
            <li>Very creamy so use little bit.</li>

            <li> My skin was cracked and dry before I received the product and now my hands are soft and no longer dry.</li>
            <li> Looks as if the container will last a long while.</li>
            <li> Pure Lanolin is hard to apply on larger areas of the skin.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smooth and it really does not smell bad either.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to include it in an otherwise lovely, natural product :(</li>
            <li> cream is not greasy, vanishes moments after you massage it in, and has lasting power way beyond any/many other dry skin formulas I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even need every day unless I&#x27;m working with dry stuff  </li>
            <li> I purchsed this item for hubby since he has arms that have a lot of flakes on them (being dry).  </li>
            <li> It is a skin condition that you are born with and it makes your skin so dry you have no idea.  </li>
            <li> Lanolin is so hard to find these days,  in New York city went to five places</li>
            <li> We have noticed an improvement over the past few days of not seeing so much dryness on his arms.  </li>
            <li> it helps condition the yarn I&#x27;m working with.</li>
            <li> My aunt and a friend of mine both have had skin cancers removed from their arms leaving rough places.  </li>
            <li> I had expected it to be softer texture when getting it out of the jar..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a customer from now on and want some of their other products.</li>
            <li> seemed a trifle pricey, but very small amounts go a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> Little jar lasts.</li>
            <li> No overwhelming, heavy scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;Kristin</li>
            <li> It was the only product that relieved the dryness due to wind, cold, and rarefied air.</li>
            <li> When we got home I was anxious to keep the protection and relief going.</li>
            <li> I retract my past review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know why lanolin got such a bad reputation.  </li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I needed this so badly for my babies skin.</li>
            <li> Use it as a night cream and under makeup base.  </li>
            <li> that is very bad for a persons body.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved lanolin since the first time I knit with hand-spun wool and discoverd that it made my hands nice and soft.  It was great to find a lanolin product for sale since it isn&#x27;t in any of the stores in our area.</li>
            <li> The only thing that doesn&#x27;t appeal to me is the perfume smell. It is quite pungent to me. Otherwise I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I use this cream on my feet at night - it&#x27;s so soothing and moisturing. I love it and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> I would have given this cream 5 stars but the smell really is so pungent I can&#x27;t use the cream. It&#x27;s such a shame as the texture of the cream is lovely and it seems to be quite gentle. However, the perfume, which is very strong, totally puts me off using the cream - even my husband commented on it! I really wish they would modify or completely leave the perfume out. There&#x27;s no need to include it in an otherwise lovely, natural product :(</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or live in a semiarid region of a country this is a must product for your skin. I use it every night to keep my skin on my hands and arms soft. My skin was cracked and dry before I received the product and now my hands are soft and no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to pure lanolin products on an extended trip to New Zealand. It was the only product that relieved the dryness due to wind, cold, and rarefied air. It also provided relief from the sandfly bites. When we got home I was anxious to keep the protection and relief going. My daughter found Koru Naturals as a Christmas gift. Each morning and evening, I relive the joy of New Zealand and all day long I enjoy the simple benefits of this pure, wholesome product. The whole family is pleased to add Koru products to our daily lives. Thanks!</li>
            <li> thanks for such quick service. I never expected it to come so quickly; well before the expected arrival date. I needed this so badly for my babies skin. I will definitely order from you in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have sensitive skin and it never ever gives me a problem. Smells great and works. I have used all kinds of expensive creams. Most are not worth the price. This is a true workhorse as far as skin cream goes. Too heavy to use under my makeup but other than that its a great cream.</li>
            <li> When you ask for a review of a product you never used and just received I have to wonder what you are wanting to review was it advertised correctly was the product received on time? Wasit packed to prevent damage in shipment?  will it work for the purpose you intend to use it for? The answer on this product is YES</li>
            <li> I love the New Zealand Lanolin Cream.  Is is the best, blends right in doesn&#x27;t leave oily film and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> love the cream.  quick shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> Arizona outdoor hans.  Lots of hand lotions around that do a job.  ..but not like this!  I&#x27;m into my fourth year with this stuff.  No moisture holding ingredients to coat the surface of your hands and gradually use body moisture.  This is LOADED iwth lanolin that somehow goes right into dry skin, and really softens and helps.  ...and STAYS.  Don&#x27;t even need every day unless I&#x27;m working with dry stuff  Totally deligthed.  seemed a trifle pricey, but very small amounts go a long, long way.  Little jar lasts.</li>
            <li> this the best cream I have ever used.  It&#x27;s not greasy but is very creamy.. It feels good on the skin and absorbs quickly...I actually think my facial wrinkles have been helped</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful for my hands!  Very soothing with a light, neutral and pleasing fragrance that&#x27;s pleasing to both my husband and me.  Goes on silky smooth and relieves my chapped hands nicely.</li>

Six more, I am tired typing. plus fragrance and dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not recommend this lanolin product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the Australian Golden Lanolin sold on Amazon. It is 100% lanolin and pharmaceutical grade. It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it works so much better than mineral or plant based creams to keek skin soft.  Since you cannot find Lanolin from the US anymore, I went to the best sheep land in the world, New Zealand.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin</li>
            <li> I love this product. It moisturizes without greasiness, and I like that! I would buy it over and over because of its richness, and it smells very pleasant. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction. Item was delivered as described by seller. Very creamy so use little bit. Would buy again if needed. Looks as if the container will last a long while.</li>
            <li> This cream is luscious and the ultimate in skin pampering. It leaves your skin feeling silky and smooth and is a wonderful winter skin-treat. There is a reason they say that sheep shearers have the softest hands in the world---they are immersed in lanolin while doing their job! This is as close as the rest of us get to that softness and it is well within our reach.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is not greasy, vanishes moments after you massage it in, and has lasting power way beyond any/many other dry skin formulas I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this is very nice and feels soft on your hands, it takes a few minutes before it is obsorbed, but sure feels good</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again because it is a quality cream that I not only use on my hands but on my face. It&#x27;s not a thick, heavy cream as you might imagine with being lanolin based but just the perfect consistency. I knit a lot with high quality wools and I apply this to my hands for dryness and it helps condition the yarn I&#x27;m working with. It is a fine quality beauty item with good ingredients. I&#x27;m a customer from now on and want some of their other products. Spa quality.</li>
            <li> Lanolin is very good for your skin and this product is very light and creamy. Don&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my friend&#x27;s mother-in-law, a native New Zealander. I love this product. It absorbs into the skin quickly and the moisturizing effects last a long time. I use it as a whole body moisturizer -- hands, face, elbows, arms, legs, etc. Other reviewers have commented on the smell -- I don&#x27;t find it to be that pungent and you really don&#x27;t notice it once the cream has been applied. I&#x27;ll be taking one of the jars I bought to keep at work. I work in the healthcare industry and have to wash my hands frequently. This product is just the thing to keep my hands from becoming chapped.</li>
            <li> My aunt and a friend of mine both have had skin cancers removed from their arms leaving rough places.  I gave them the New Zealand Lanolin Cream.  After just days of use they are both showing off their smoother skin.  This product is wonderful.  No matter how rough and hard your skin is, this product can make it so much better.  It absorbs quickly, is not greasy, and is a great value for the money.  I most highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product -was suggested and approved by my Doctor</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  I do tend to break out from products with Lanolin (wool reaction I believe), and this one is no exception.  I will endure some irritation with this cream because it does work that well.</li>
            <li> I had expected it to be softer texture when getting it out of the jar.. but it seemed to be a bit chunky then when warmed up and rubbed on it did become a smoother texture.</li>
            <li> WANT TO BUY THIS GREAT PRODUCT IN A LARGER CONTAINER.  PLEASE ANSWER.  THANK YOU  JOEL COHEN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s JUST the high quality cream i could&#x27;nt buy in a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for dry skin during these winter months...Fragrance is not too strong, however we bought it for our son and perhaps it would suit a little girl better since the fragrance is slightly feminine...to my opinion. So guess what? Mommy uses it and we don&#x27;t have to wait for mother&#x27;s day to make mommy happy! How about that!</li>
            <li> I purchsed this item for hubby since he has arms that have a lot of flakes on them (being dry).  The cream goes on smooth and it really does not smell bad either.  We have noticed an improvement over the past few days of not seeing so much dryness on his arms.  I will purchase more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I retract my past review this product did not list it had propylene glycol in it. that is very bad for a persons body.</li>
            <li> Made my feet super soft. Rubbed it in at night and wore socks to bed. One week and all the callouses were gone.</li>
            <li> This company has proved to me that they are indeed all about 100% customer satisfaction This product feels just right and it&#x27;s soft, lovely fragrance is great. No overwhelming, heavy scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;Kristin</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. Lanolin is one of the best things you can do to your skin. Really wonderful for dry skin and areas where the skin needs to stretch more like elbows or knees. I tried other lotions for dry and stressed skin but this works best for me. Pure Lanolin is hard to apply on larger areas of the skin. It&#x27;s much easier and better to use this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have ichthyosis.  Most people have never heard of it.  It is a skin condition that you are born with and it makes your skin so dry you have no idea.  All my life I have searched for products that work for me, and this is one of them.  Others have commented that the fragrance is off-putting, but I don&#x27;t think it is.  It is very light and goes away very quickly after application.  I still don&#x27;t know why lanolin got such a bad reputation.  It is a wonderful natural remedy for dry skin!  I guess some people were allergic to it, but so what?  Some people are allergic to peanuts, but peanuts have not been banned the way lanolin has.  It&#x27;s ridiculous.  Anyway, I highly recommend this cream.  It is light, absorbs quickly and does not sting any open cracks or eczema you may have.</li>
            <li> Feels so good both on my body and my face.  Use it as a night cream and under makeup base.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Lanolin is so hard to find these days,  in New York city went to five places no one had it.&lt;br /&gt;I play bongos and my hands get busted and the skin cracks. Lanolin is the only thing that works and works also for the drum skins.&lt;br /&gt;NZ lanolin highly recomended!! A++++</li>
            <li> Good product. Love it. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> If you cannot use scented products, you won&#x27;t be satisfied with this.</li>
