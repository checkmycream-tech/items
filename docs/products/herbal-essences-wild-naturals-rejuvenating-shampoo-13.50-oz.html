            <li>in my opinion it worked great for me and</li>
            <li>The Shampoo smells great and leaves hair</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are great</li>
            <li>that being said, I was happy with how nonirritating this shampoo was.</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>I find that it controls my medium length hair very nicely -</li>
            <li>This shampoo did not irritate my scalp which was great and had a really pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I had been using inferior shampoo, this is excellent quality and my hair looks a lot better, and feels great.</li>
            <li>I have one word for this shampoo, AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The scent of this product is also amazing!</li>
            <li>I have one word for this shampoo, AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing!</li>
            <li>While some people may find that tingle pleasant, to me it means my scalp and hair are drying out.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, but not too feminine.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>It wasnt too strong, and was very pleasant!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I LOVED the smell.</li>
            <li>The good news?</li>
            <li>I really loved this product.</li>
            <li>I am not as smitten with the shampoo, but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li>I already loved the rejuvenating conditioner, so I was eager to try the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I reciecved a sample of it in a voxbox from Influenster and loved it.</li>
            <li>I have problems finding good conditioners/shampoos because it fritzes easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t have anything good to say either.  </li>
            <li>From looking at the bottle, reading the name and smelling in the bottle I would&#x27;ve never assumed it would smell so good.</li>
            <li>It smelled good.</li>
            <li>I could not stop smelling it because it smelled so good to me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this if you are looking for a good smelling drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: A good choice to control hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good product for those on a budget.</li>
            <li>So I had my doubts that this line scented with Turkish figs and Cassia (a flower) would smell good.</li>
            <li>Shampoo feels good on the head, but not as good as the commercials show on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it out today and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Smells nice lathers good.</li>
            <li>I am happy that my hair has life and I am able to manage my hair better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: this is a great product for the ladies, an update of the old school herbal essence shampoo that did wonderful things in the shower.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo !</li>
            <li>I have fairly healthy but processed hair and warn you NOT to use this shampoo if you have bleached, permanently colored or lifted your color in any way!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this Shampoo!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more stoked!</li>
            <li>shampoo, even better TV commercials!</li>
            <li>After my shower I let my hair air out a bit until it was just damp and followed up with the oil which was amazing.</li>
            <li>The scent of the shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of Turkish fig essences before, but it smells amazing</li>
            <li>With a family of 4 we go through a lot of shampoo and so seeing this item come available on the Vine was a welcome thing.</li>
            <li>It was a bit corny, but added to the ambiance of nice fragrance and treating yourself to something luxurious for your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and creates a nice aroma in the shower that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I received this as a sample in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Use at your own risk, girl.</li>
            <li>shampoo lathers up nicely and cleanses well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell nice</li>

            <li>It has a great natural smell and it works great</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself smells amazing and refreshing with a nice fruity Turkish fig scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy because of how easy it is to brush my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li>Of all the years I have used herbal essence this new line is by far the best feeling for my hair and the best smelling.</li>
            <li>If you shampoo more frequently or do not have oily roots, then this would be great, as the scent is very nice!</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, shiny, moisturized, and smelled great!</li>
            <li>This product was a complimentary gift, and I could not be more happy with it.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair with a good clean feel.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that it is a pretty great shampoo.</li>
            <li>I followed it with the conditioner that made my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>I will say that I like it, although it isn&#x27;t my favorite product ever.  </li>
            <li>The smells is great (nice and strong, the way I like it), and my hair feels fresh and clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way that thus shampoo feel..</li>
            <li>I love the scent, it&#x27;s invigorating.</li>
            <li>I had to keep applying more since I do have longer hair</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Most shampoos don&#x27;t have that as an ingredient, so it did kind of shock me when I launched into a coughing fit.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and the way it lathers up.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>She loves it, and is buying more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about keeping my hair healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I make a point to only use the best shampoo for my flowing locks.</li>
            <li>It also has a lovely smell to it that I absolutely love and its not an overpowering smell either.</li>
            <li>it like most conditioners do to my hair</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>But it does leave the hair more silky like conditioner</li>
            <li>I was actually given a free sample of this conditioner by influencer to test and ended up going out and buying my own bottle its so incredible!</li>
            <li>I tend to have  oily hair, but as I age and get more gray hair, I find I need a more moisturizing shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>but if you, like me, dislike overbearing scents, then you should be well pleased by this product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what fig smelled like, but it&#x27;s a light fruity smell!</li>
            <li>I needed to use a bit more conditioner in order to fully work into my hair-</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the products!</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences is my favorite brand for in-store shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>and I must say, this has been my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>As always herbal essences filled my shower and bathroom with the most amazing smell.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve smelt better.</li>
            <li>Could have been a tad more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>and I love it and the conditioner and oilf</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of those.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floral and fruity scent is my favorite attribute of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells great, and really removed any oils that I had on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Im sure thats just because of the fruits and oils they use</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is lovely and not too overpoweringly fruity with a tinge of citrus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like &#x27;drugstore&#x27; shampoos keep getting better and better.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I have become a fan for sure.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s own and was very impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only issue is that it contains menthol, which I didn&#x27;t know until I was in the shower, happily lathering it up and started to have an asthma attack.</li>
            <li>It leaves it feeling smooth</li>

            <li>Well to start off I just received this product free to test and review from influenster.</li>

            <li>I will be definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample from Influenster and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and light.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences shampoo fit my modest standards very ably.</li>
            <li>In particular, I liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>I like the fresh smell and clean finishing feel!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t a super amazing shampoo, but it is excellent for normal everyday use.</li>
            <li>Sweet but light fragrance.</li>
            <li>hair is fairly damaged and generally needs conditioner</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s maybe not the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever smelled, but I&#x27;ve never gotten such soft hair from a shampoo in my life!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>The oil elixir is also great and helps to keep my frizzy hair tamed when my hair starts to  dry.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel clean without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>It has fruity, floral, and clean smell to it.</li>
            <li>I like my hair, which I was every day, to be clean.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner in this collection is even better, and the elixir oil is AMAZING, so I would definitely purchase those 2 items again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I find it to work well at controlling the hair, to require bit of extra rinsing to come off cleanly, and to have a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is clean but not uncontrollable.</li>
            <li>then this is the shampoo for you because it will strip all the oil off your hair and clean any build up off.</li>
            <li>The products work great together on my dry, frizzy hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get your hair clean.</li>
            <li>It ssmells wonderful and leaves my hair feeling very moist when used with the other two products in the series.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy more.</li>
            <li>I just used the shampoo tonight since I got a free sample complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster I got to try it for free !</li>
            <li>They lather really well and smell so lovely.</li>
            <li>I’ve had my share of figs, sure, but I’ve yet to visit Turkey, so can’t really tell you if this assertion is on-point.  </li>
            <li>I could tell no difference in my hair before or after the shower, and I have no way to make any kind of empirical measurement of it.  </li>
            <li>but I think the Naked line smells just as good</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>Worked good and especially with the conditioner after.</li>
            <li>Maybe if the shampoo smelled like a sweet scent</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells nice, surprisingly so since I don&#x27;t usually like fig scents.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and, while this shampoo cleans well, I don&#x27;t think it is a good fit.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating has a nice scent and suds up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this to be a superior product that I would pay upwards of $1.00 more for less</li>
            <li>This shampo not only smells incredible but leaves your hair soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo did not leave a residue- which is great for me because I have fine hair and that can make my hair look limp.</li>
            <li>Smells great and left my hair soft and full of volume !</li>
            <li>I was able to test Herbal Essences Wild Naturals rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner and oil elixer for free from influenster.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I was able to test Herbal essences wild naturals rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner and oil elixir for free by influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it does not leave my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>And I was very pleased with the way after just one use left my hair feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>The scent is somewhat strong, not quite as intense as a “fruit”-flavored slurpee, but it’s rather close to the fruity scents you’ll associate with processed foods.  </li>
            <li>First of all I love shampoos with strong and/or sweet scents and I could barely even smell this shampoo at all.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>and it does exactly that!</li>
            <li>My hair feels/looks clean for easily 3 days between washes and as a new mom that&#x27;s beyond helpful.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was fine, but the shampoo wasn&#x27;t much of a step up from dollar brands, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and left my hair silky.</li>
            <li>These products worked very well for my hair it made it frizz-free and smooth.</li>
            <li>The oil elixer makes my hair very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>received this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received this collection complimentary for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this shampoo complimentary from influenster.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is most distinctly fruity, with clear and almost tasty tinge of citrus.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is quality enough that it is not thin or watery, but it does not feel as good to my head as the Hello Hydration line.</li>
            <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>It has a similiar nice scent as conditioner, but not quite the same....</li>
            <li>My hair was gummy, which rarely happens with the Joico Color Endure shampoo line that I use.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary through Influenster, however all opinions are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent does linger and keeps you smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>better then this clear shampoo.</li>
            <li>I received this shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir combo complimentary from influenster.</li>
            <li>I felt fresh and relaxed by the aroma.</li>
            <li>makes it feel really soft and healthy</li>
            <li>I receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>The new scents are amazing and make my hair feel super soft and luxurious all day!</li>
            <li>The fragrance had a hint of sweetness and was just right.</li>
            <li>Right</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my hair feeling clean, smooth and overall healthy again!</li>
            <li>shampoo is a clear liquid with a distinct aroma of grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;Their milky conditioner has a strong lemon</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t buy Herbal Essences Shampoo, but I received it free to test and review.</li>
            <li>From its packaging, with that post-disco silver headband/ring at the top of the cap to the colors and product copy (“nurture yourself into a natural knockout”—I do love that alliteration, though), this is aimed at the female demographic.  </li>
            <li>When used in the shower is when I really got the full scent of it.</li>
            <li>I normally use a sulfate free shampoo (helps with some shine)</li>
            <li>I was looking for a shampoo to help my hair since it looked kind of dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a soft lather and rinses out very quickly leaving my hair feeling refresed and looking lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Performance wise this shampoo makes my hair silkier and less tangled after washing.</li>
            <li>My normal hair routine is unique in that I tend to coconut oil my scalp and use a rinse of apple cider vinegar before shampooing and conditioning</li>
            <li>A decent shampoo, I guess, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>This shampoo stripped my semi-permanent blue and silver Pravana color right off, more efficiently than any clarifying shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It lathers up very nicely, and overall simply gives me what I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>price is just fine, perfectly competitive with any other similar product in a similar size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>price is just fine, perfectly competitive with any other similar product in a similar size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’m old enough to remember those semi-scandalous Herbal Essence shampoo TV commercials when it seemed that this very same hair care product was more than just a way to get clean hair, that it was so potent, so powerful, so awesomely stimulating that it seemed, at least from the TV spokesmodels’ enthusiastic portrayals, that it could actually product physical, ahem, ecstasy in its consumers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what my grandma used, and what I used consistently up until a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li>The smell does not denote any sort of menthol-like odor, but when the hot water was added and steam began to enter my lungs, I was in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wife thought it was too fruity; it didn’t smell “competent” enough in her</li>
            <li>Paired with the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner, my hair felt incredibly smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was smell it because I had no idea what scent a Turkish Fig would even have.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely addicting!</li>
            <li>only thing I wish it had was more information on the ingredients-</li>
            <li>I actually really like it!</li>
            <li>it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>first impression was the smell.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to test this product as a free sample through Influenster, and I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo free by Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster!</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo to review and test for free in my Influenster Vox Box.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the scent is not as pleasant as classic HE, nor is the shampoo as good as the new repackaged and redesigned HE</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product for free to sample and review</li>
            <li>I did notice that right after shampooing it did feel very moisturized, like I could run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>I actually usually use Head and Shoulders but for a change it is nice to use something different and this shampoo smells good and cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel fluffy.&amp;#34; She needs her thin straight hair to be a bit fluffier so this is very good.</li>
            <li>Usually dont use this product but it left my hair feeling super soft both shampoo and conditioner plus smelling delicious cant stop smelling it</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>It left my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The first day it was great, the second day it was ok, and by the third I felt like it smelled sour.</li>
            <li>the refreshing smell will make mid rinse out of hair very purchase it again.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pretty straight forward.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t be getting this again, simply because I had an allergic reaction to it, but for those who aren&#x27;t allergic to the ingredients, I think you will enjoy this very much.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t amazing smelling and didn&#x27;t seem to blow me out of the water with making my hair softer or less frizzy.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;later left tangle-free and easy to comb out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals has a strong fruit smell from the initial use, but subsides quickly.</li>
            <li>The bottle should last a long time making it a good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently found my new love in Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine, which leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Just by looking at the bottle it looks like it will be a nice shampoo to use, but it didnt live up to what i expected.</li>
            <li>have thin hair and although healthy I need a shampoo that gives me a clean and full body feel.\&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>While we both loved this shampoo, it is worth noting that we both have very thick hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change switching from regular paraben/sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>up really well</li>
            <li>and I am very picky when it comes to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this collection!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn’t really a product for guys; this is a fem-product.  </li>
            <li>I can not tell how much protection I am getting from the seed.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>My Hair Feels So Much Cleaner</li>
            <li>Also, because it foams so well, it doubles as a bubble bath, which was when I really appreciated the scented aspect of this product.</li>
            <li>This product I felt like I didn&#x27;t need the conditioner because of how smooth it left my hair after shampoo alone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this and will be using again!</li>
            <li>I feel like you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>When I used it in the shower it lathered up really well.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference between this and others.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of the 3 products.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Clairol and Influenster.com for the product to test</li>
            <li>It smelled really fruity</li>
            <li>and it really cleans the hair</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get oily as fast.</li>
            <li>Popping the cap for the first time in the shower was exactly like those old Herbal Essences commercials.</li>
            <li>It isnt to harsh and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>think this combo (shampoo/conditioner/oil elixer) is good for people with hair not as thick as mine, because I’ve tried the combo three times and each time</li>
            <li>hair is short, straight, dry, very fine and regularly coloured, this produced a lovely gloss with noticeable volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>small amount of shampoo quickly works into a thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing it out the hair is impressively thicker in volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The three Wild Naturals products complemented each other nicely and I felt that my hair was very moisturized after.</li>
            <li>to Influenster for making me try something new that is exactly what I needed for my hair</li>
            <li>I must say, it works better when paired up with its other products.</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo with the conditioner, the two together made my hair soft, less frizzy, and still smelled great the next day after using the product,</li>
            <li>The soap did seem to lather quite well and make my scalp feel clean during initial application, I just couldn&#x27;t keep it on and had to rewash with another product.</li>
            <li>but it did clean my hair well enough</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and left my hair soft and frizz-free all day</li>
            <li>It left my hair clean of course, and has decent lather.</li>
            <li>I also didn’t really feel any more or less rejuvenated after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the free shampoo I received to review will go a long way.</li>
            <li>It lathered nice and plenty with a small amount.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around very long.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair with highlights that is dry and frizzy at times.</li>
            <li>Makes a decent body wash though.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly  recommend  this to my clients  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>id probably like it a little bit more.</li>
            <li>My hair has such a clean feeling after the shampoo and there is no dried out strands for me to doctor after using Herbal Essences shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating line is an absolute winner.</li>
            <li>This is not my normal shampoo brand</li>
            <li>I recently received this product in my complimentary box from Influenster.</li>
            <li>clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the shampoo to my normal hair routine because I wanted to see what the results would be.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair, so that was nice.</li>
            <li>It left my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is no small victory, as they are used on very curly hair with a sensitive and psoriatic scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the way it left my hair, clean and ready for my regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I don’t think this works for me, but it might for other people.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I got these products free to test and review through Influenster</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a new shampoo since I began growing my hair longer, so I gave this one a shot.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely curly and dry, this adds a nice sheen and smooths the Frizzies.</li>
            <li>It was super dry.</li>
            <li>Its a clear shampoo which work great for me as it cleans my hair well and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird shampoo film.</li>
            <li>and  I must say I was surprised that it was a decent sample bottle for me to use and experiment with cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>the product also did rinse out of your hair very well not extremely moisturizing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone who washes my hair very frequently, but I would probably use this product again.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this shampoo was able to tame it.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner made my hair soft and shiny- even when I didn&#x27;t add product to my hair afterward!</li>
            <li>Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter used this shampoo for the first time last night</li>
            <li>That’s a big positive (and the bottle is moving upstairs soon).  </li>
            <li>When I do, I need to be able to clean my roots very well and remove all residue, and this unfortunately only does a mediocre job of that.</li>
            <li>It definitely has less chemicals and sensitivities than most of its competitors.</li>
            <li>I have long natural curly hair so that being said its very rare that I actually find products that work for my hair.</li>
            <li>I had to use a little extra more shampoo</li>
            <li>Since the ends are dry, I try not to shampoo more than every other day.</li>
            <li>clean hair with a slight citrus perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put:</li>
            <li>but it actually was really lightweight on my hair and washed completely out.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is clear and it seems like there is not buildup after I use it.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is clear.</li>
            <li>B00OP25LBW Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo]] and</li>
            <li>but I do know I am wild about this shampoo I got from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It helped my hair become soft again and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments from my peers and family because of how soft my hair feels and smells.</li>
            <li>After using this, in combination with the conditioner, my hair was soft and had body to it, without frizziness.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes, so I was worried about the smell being overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so pleasantly surprised by the products I received.</li>
            <li>This shampoo claims to be rejuvenating, but I found it to strip my hair&#x27;s natural oils rather than rejuvenate the strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really all about personal preference.  </li>
            <li>I tried this after trying the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo&#x27;s scent is much sweeter than the conditioner, and fruitier although they are supposed to have the same scent.</li>
            <li>So I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Product</li>
            <li>it uses natural ingredients to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li>I was given a bottle of herbal essences wild naturals rejuvenating shampoo to review and try and</li>
            <li>It completely cleansed my hair as well as nourishing it.</li>
            <li>it says natural on the label</li>
            <li>I used a conditioner from HE wild naturals as well.  </li>
            <li>the only downfall to this product was that it did not produce a whole lot of lather</li>
            <li>I have the complete line</li>
            <li>After I applied these three items and dried my hair was smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li>well its not harsh at all on the hair  </li>
            <li>It does what it says and so far it does it well.</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo along with the Wild Naturals conditioner and oil elixir.</li>
            <li>The shampoo scent is also supposed to be fig and does contain some peppermint oil, according to the ingredients, but it was generic fruity sweet to my nose, and lasted all day long.</li>
            <li>I use dry shampoo and usually need to shampoo twice to feel like I got it completely out of my hair, but this shampoo foams up quickly and seemed to rinse clean in one wash.</li>
            <li>Whereas the primary scent in the conditioner was supposed to be fig, but was actually mint (at least to my nose), it was quite nice and left no lingering scent to clash with other lotions or products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but hair looks, well, healthier and more vibrant following use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akin</li>
            <li>but it does seem that there are unnatural ingredients included unlike some of their other hair products lines which specifically say like their naked products which are free of silicones, parabens, and dyes.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Wild Naturals are a harkening back to classic Herbal Essences, but with updated branding.  </li>
            <li>so my hair doesn&#x27;t get too used to one particular product, and this is one I would definitely add into my rotation.  </li>
            <li>I guess im just a bigger fan of the older H.E shampoos</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is a fruity, herbal scent, which is a little odd, but smells nice.</li>
            <li>The only down sound is</li>
            <li>A really lovely shampoo, that smells a little herbal but also of figs - not highly perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers</li>
            <li>Clear colored shampoo which gave a rich lather from a small amount .</li>
            <li>I used three times what I would normally use and it still wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>My scalp can be very flaky during the dry winter months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry this isn&#x27;t much help to many out there...</li>
            <li>, so a little goes a long way but is easy to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shampoo is clear and you don&#x27;t need a big amount of it for it work</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Wild Naturals was a big surprise for me.</li>
            <li>The next day, my hair returned back to its normal feel.</li>
            <li>a little less enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp, so I’m not usually keen on buying new products to try since it may irritate the scalp and be a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Herbal Essence, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would purchase this one out of all the other choices.</li>
            <li>What she likes about is that it takes only a small amount to suds up and clean her hair.  </li>
            <li>(Although I&#x27;m sure the scent is to a large degree artificial, it doesn&#x27;t immediately come across that way.)  </li>
            <li>And the smell lasted so much longer than my other shampoos.</li>
            <li>Nothing special from the other herbal essences products but compared to other drug store brands is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>For reference I have natural African American type 4 hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I noticed a little difference.</li>
            <li>I have used it a few times, and it does leave my hair pretty clean, but not as much as others have (in other words, it feels like a slight residue remains unless you rinse extremely well).</li>
            <li>And though it is a given, I always use conditioner directly afterwards but for me there is a principle- shampoo should not leave your hair feeling dry and tangled.</li>
            <li>It was a thick shampoo that lathered quickly.</li>
            <li>Even with very little, it makes curls gently shine while it moisturizes, and continues the trend of Wild Naturals smelling absolutely terrific.</li>
            <li>I just bought myself the full sized version and my only complaint is that it is not sold in sizes larger than 13.5 oz!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered right away when only using a small amount.</li>
            <li>Its a very lightweight product so it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair either!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If your shampoo does not leave your hair feeling great</li>
            <li> And Smells Great</li>
            <li> in my opinion it worked great for me and</li>
            <li> The Shampoo smells great and leaves hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are great</li>
            <li> that being said, I was happy with how nonirritating this shampoo was.</li>
            <li> It smells great.</li>
            <li> I find that it controls my medium length hair very nicely -</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not irritate my scalp which was great and had a really pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I had been using inferior shampoo, this is excellent quality and my hair looks a lot better, and feels great.</li>
            <li> I have one word for this shampoo, AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is also amazing!</li>
            <li> I have one word for this shampoo, AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing!</li>
            <li> While some people may find that tingle pleasant, to me it means my scalp and hair are drying out.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, but not too feminine.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> It wasnt too strong, and was very pleasant!</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I LOVED the smell.</li>
            <li> The good news?</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.</li>
            <li> I am not as smitten with the shampoo, but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li> I already loved the rejuvenating conditioner, so I was eager to try the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I reciecved a sample of it in a voxbox from Influenster and loved it.</li>
            <li> I have problems finding good conditioners/shampoos because it fritzes easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t have anything good to say either.  </li>
            <li> From looking at the bottle, reading the name and smelling in the bottle I would&#x27;ve never assumed it would smell so good.</li>
            <li> It smelled good.</li>
            <li> I could not stop smelling it because it smelled so good to me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you are looking for a good smelling drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: A good choice to control hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good product for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> So I had my doubts that this line scented with Turkish figs and Cassia (a flower) would smell good.</li>
            <li> Shampoo feels good on the head, but not as good as the commercials show on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it out today and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smells nice lathers good.</li>
            <li> I am happy that my hair has life and I am able to manage my hair better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: this is a great product for the ladies, an update of the old school herbal essence shampoo that did wonderful things in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo !</li>
            <li> I have fairly healthy but processed hair and warn you NOT to use this shampoo if you have bleached, permanently colored or lifted your color in any way!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Shampoo!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more stoked!</li>
            <li> shampoo, even better TV commercials!</li>
            <li> After my shower I let my hair air out a bit until it was just damp and followed up with the oil which was amazing.</li>
            <li> The scent of the shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Turkish fig essences before, but it smells amazing</li>
            <li> With a family of 4 we go through a lot of shampoo and so seeing this item come available on the Vine was a welcome thing.</li>
            <li> It was a bit corny, but added to the ambiance of nice fragrance and treating yourself to something luxurious for your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and creates a nice aroma in the shower that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Use at your own risk, girl.</li>
            <li> shampoo lathers up nicely and cleanses well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell nice</li>

            <li> It has a great natural smell and it works great</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself smells amazing and refreshing with a nice fruity Turkish fig scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy because of how easy it is to brush my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> Of all the years I have used herbal essence this new line is by far the best feeling for my hair and the best smelling.</li>
            <li> If you shampoo more frequently or do not have oily roots, then this would be great, as the scent is very nice!</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, shiny, moisturized, and smelled great!</li>
            <li> This product was a complimentary gift, and I could not be more happy with it.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair with a good clean feel.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that it is a pretty great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I followed it with the conditioner that made my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> I will say that I like it, although it isn&#x27;t my favorite product ever.  </li>
            <li> The smells is great (nice and strong, the way I like it), and my hair feels fresh and clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way that thus shampoo feel..</li>
            <li> I love the scent, it&#x27;s invigorating.</li>
            <li> I had to keep applying more since I do have longer hair</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Most shampoos don&#x27;t have that as an ingredient, so it did kind of shock me when I launched into a coughing fit.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and the way it lathers up.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> She loves it, and is buying more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about keeping my hair healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I make a point to only use the best shampoo for my flowing locks.</li>
            <li> It also has a lovely smell to it that I absolutely love and its not an overpowering smell either.</li>
            <li> it like most conditioners do to my hair</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> But it does leave the hair more silky like conditioner</li>
            <li> I was actually given a free sample of this conditioner by influencer to test and ended up going out and buying my own bottle its so incredible!</li>
            <li> I tend to have  oily hair, but as I age and get more gray hair, I find I need a more moisturizing shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> but if you, like me, dislike overbearing scents, then you should be well pleased by this product.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what fig smelled like, but it&#x27;s a light fruity smell!</li>
            <li> I needed to use a bit more conditioner in order to fully work into my hair-</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the products!</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences is my favorite brand for in-store shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> and I must say, this has been my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> As always herbal essences filled my shower and bathroom with the most amazing smell.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve smelt better.</li>
            <li> Could have been a tad more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> and I love it and the conditioner and oilf</li>
            <li> and I love the smell of those.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floral and fruity scent is my favorite attribute of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells great, and really removed any oils that I had on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Im sure thats just because of the fruits and oils they use</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is lovely and not too overpoweringly fruity with a tinge of citrus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like &#x27;drugstore&#x27; shampoos keep getting better and better.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I have become a fan for sure.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s own and was very impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only issue is that it contains menthol, which I didn&#x27;t know until I was in the shower, happily lathering it up and started to have an asthma attack.</li>
            <li> It leaves it feeling smooth</li>

            <li> hair is fairly damaged and generally needs conditioner</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s maybe not the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever smelled, but I&#x27;ve never gotten such soft hair from a shampoo in my life!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The oil elixir is also great and helps to keep my frizzy hair tamed when my hair starts to  dry.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel clean without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> It has fruity, floral, and clean smell to it.</li>
            <li> I like my hair, which I was every day, to be clean.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner in this collection is even better, and the elixir oil is AMAZING, so I would definitely purchase those 2 items again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I find it to work well at controlling the hair, to require bit of extra rinsing to come off cleanly, and to have a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is clean but not uncontrollable.</li>
            <li> then this is the shampoo for you because it will strip all the oil off your hair and clean any build up off.</li>
            <li> The products work great together on my dry, frizzy hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get your hair clean.</li>
            <li> It ssmells wonderful and leaves my hair feeling very moist when used with the other two products in the series.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly buy more.</li>
            <li> I just used the shampoo tonight since I got a free sample complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster I got to try it for free !</li>
            <li> They lather really well and smell so lovely.</li>
            <li> I’ve had my share of figs, sure, but I’ve yet to visit Turkey, so can’t really tell you if this assertion is on-point.  </li>
            <li> I could tell no difference in my hair before or after the shower, and I have no way to make any kind of empirical measurement of it.  </li>
            <li> but I think the Naked line smells just as good</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> Worked good and especially with the conditioner after.</li>
            <li> Maybe if the shampoo smelled like a sweet scent</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells nice, surprisingly so since I don&#x27;t usually like fig scents.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and, while this shampoo cleans well, I don&#x27;t think it is a good fit.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating has a nice scent and suds up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this to be a superior product that I would pay upwards of $1.00 more for less</li>
            <li> This shampo not only smells incredible but leaves your hair soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> The shampoo did not leave a residue- which is great for me because I have fine hair and that can make my hair look limp.</li>
            <li> Smells great and left my hair soft and full of volume !</li>
            <li> I was able to test Herbal Essences Wild Naturals rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner and oil elixer for free from influenster.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I was able to test Herbal essences wild naturals rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner and oil elixir for free by influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does not leave my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> And I was very pleased with the way after just one use left my hair feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent is somewhat strong, not quite as intense as a “fruit”-flavored slurpee, but it’s rather close to the fruity scents you’ll associate with processed foods.  </li>
            <li> First of all I love shampoos with strong and/or sweet scents and I could barely even smell this shampoo at all.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> and it does exactly that!</li>
            <li> My hair feels/looks clean for easily 3 days between washes and as a new mom that&#x27;s beyond helpful.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was fine, but the shampoo wasn&#x27;t much of a step up from dollar brands, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and left my hair silky.</li>
            <li> These products worked very well for my hair it made it frizz-free and smooth.</li>
            <li> The oil elixer makes my hair very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li> received this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received this collection complimentary for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo complimentary from influenster.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is most distinctly fruity, with clear and almost tasty tinge of citrus.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is quality enough that it is not thin or watery, but it does not feel as good to my head as the Hello Hydration line.</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> It has a similiar nice scent as conditioner, but not quite the same....</li>
            <li> My hair was gummy, which rarely happens with the Joico Color Endure shampoo line that I use.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary through Influenster, however all opinions are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent does linger and keeps you smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> better then this clear shampoo.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir combo complimentary from influenster.</li>
            <li> I felt fresh and relaxed by the aroma.</li>
            <li> makes it feel really soft and healthy</li>
            <li> I receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> The new scents are amazing and make my hair feel super soft and luxurious all day!</li>
            <li> The fragrance had a hint of sweetness and was just right.</li>
            <li> Right</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair feeling clean, smooth and overall healthy again!</li>
            <li> shampoo is a clear liquid with a distinct aroma of grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;Their milky conditioner has a strong lemon</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy Herbal Essences Shampoo, but I received it free to test and review.</li>
            <li> From its packaging, with that post-disco silver headband/ring at the top of the cap to the colors and product copy (“nurture yourself into a natural knockout”—I do love that alliteration, though), this is aimed at the female demographic.  </li>
            <li> When used in the shower is when I really got the full scent of it.</li>
            <li> I normally use a sulfate free shampoo (helps with some shine)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo to help my hair since it looked kind of dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a soft lather and rinses out very quickly leaving my hair feeling refresed and looking lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance wise this shampoo makes my hair silkier and less tangled after washing.</li>
            <li> My normal hair routine is unique in that I tend to coconut oil my scalp and use a rinse of apple cider vinegar before shampooing and conditioning</li>
            <li> A decent shampoo, I guess, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> This shampoo stripped my semi-permanent blue and silver Pravana color right off, more efficiently than any clarifying shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very nicely, and overall simply gives me what I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> price is just fine, perfectly competitive with any other similar product in a similar size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> price is just fine, perfectly competitive with any other similar product in a similar size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m old enough to remember those semi-scandalous Herbal Essence shampoo TV commercials when it seemed that this very same hair care product was more than just a way to get clean hair, that it was so potent, so powerful, so awesomely stimulating that it seemed, at least from the TV spokesmodels’ enthusiastic portrayals, that it could actually product physical, ahem, ecstasy in its consumers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what my grandma used, and what I used consistently up until a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> The smell does not denote any sort of menthol-like odor, but when the hot water was added and steam began to enter my lungs, I was in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wife thought it was too fruity; it didn’t smell “competent” enough in her</li>
            <li> Paired with the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner, my hair felt incredibly smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was smell it because I had no idea what scent a Turkish Fig would even have.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely addicting!</li>
            <li> only thing I wish it had was more information on the ingredients-</li>
            <li> I actually really like it!</li>
            <li> it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> first impression was the smell.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product as a free sample through Influenster, and I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo free by Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li> Thanks Influenster!</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo to review and test for free in my Influenster Vox Box.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scent is not as pleasant as classic HE, nor is the shampoo as good as the new repackaged and redesigned HE</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product for free to sample and review</li>
            <li> I did notice that right after shampooing it did feel very moisturized, like I could run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> I actually usually use Head and Shoulders but for a change it is nice to use something different and this shampoo smells good and cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel fluffy.&amp;#34; She needs her thin straight hair to be a bit fluffier so this is very good.</li>
            <li> Usually dont use this product but it left my hair feeling super soft both shampoo and conditioner plus smelling delicious cant stop smelling it</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> It left my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The first day it was great, the second day it was ok, and by the third I felt like it smelled sour.</li>
            <li> the refreshing smell will make mid rinse out of hair very purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are pretty straight forward.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be getting this again, simply because I had an allergic reaction to it, but for those who aren&#x27;t allergic to the ingredients, I think you will enjoy this very much.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t amazing smelling and didn&#x27;t seem to blow me out of the water with making my hair softer or less frizzy.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;later left tangle-free and easy to comb out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals has a strong fruit smell from the initial use, but subsides quickly.</li>
            <li> The bottle should last a long time making it a good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently found my new love in Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine, which leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Just by looking at the bottle it looks like it will be a nice shampoo to use, but it didnt live up to what i expected.</li>
            <li> have thin hair and although healthy I need a shampoo that gives me a clean and full body feel.\&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> While we both loved this shampoo, it is worth noting that we both have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change switching from regular paraben/sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> up really well</li>
            <li> and I am very picky when it comes to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this collection!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn’t really a product for guys; this is a fem-product.  </li>
            <li> I can not tell how much protection I am getting from the seed.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> My Hair Feels So Much Cleaner</li>
            <li> Also, because it foams so well, it doubles as a bubble bath, which was when I really appreciated the scented aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> This product I felt like I didn&#x27;t need the conditioner because of how smooth it left my hair after shampoo alone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this and will be using again!</li>
            <li> I feel like you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> When I used it in the shower it lathered up really well.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference between this and others.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of the 3 products.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Clairol and Influenster.com for the product to test</li>
            <li> It smelled really fruity</li>
            <li> and it really cleans the hair</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get oily as fast.</li>
            <li> Popping the cap for the first time in the shower was exactly like those old Herbal Essences commercials.</li>
            <li> It isnt to harsh and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> think this combo (shampoo/conditioner/oil elixer) is good for people with hair not as thick as mine, because I’ve tried the combo three times and each time</li>
            <li> hair is short, straight, dry, very fine and regularly coloured, this produced a lovely gloss with noticeable volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> small amount of shampoo quickly works into a thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing it out the hair is impressively thicker in volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The three Wild Naturals products complemented each other nicely and I felt that my hair was very moisturized after.</li>
            <li> to Influenster for making me try something new that is exactly what I needed for my hair</li>
            <li> I must say, it works better when paired up with its other products.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo with the conditioner, the two together made my hair soft, less frizzy, and still smelled great the next day after using the product,</li>
            <li> The soap did seem to lather quite well and make my scalp feel clean during initial application, I just couldn&#x27;t keep it on and had to rewash with another product.</li>
            <li> but it did clean my hair well enough</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and left my hair soft and frizz-free all day</li>
            <li> It left my hair clean of course, and has decent lather.</li>
            <li> I also didn’t really feel any more or less rejuvenated after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the free shampoo I received to review will go a long way.</li>
            <li> It lathered nice and plenty with a small amount.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around very long.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair with highlights that is dry and frizzy at times.</li>
            <li> Makes a decent body wash though.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly  recommend  this to my clients  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> id probably like it a little bit more.</li>
            <li> My hair has such a clean feeling after the shampoo and there is no dried out strands for me to doctor after using Herbal Essences shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating line is an absolute winner.</li>
            <li> This is not my normal shampoo brand</li>
            <li> I recently received this product in my complimentary box from Influenster.</li>
            <li> clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the shampoo to my normal hair routine because I wanted to see what the results would be.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, so that was nice.</li>
            <li> It left my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is no small victory, as they are used on very curly hair with a sensitive and psoriatic scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the way it left my hair, clean and ready for my regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don’t think this works for me, but it might for other people.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I got these products free to test and review through Influenster</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a new shampoo since I began growing my hair longer, so I gave this one a shot.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely curly and dry, this adds a nice sheen and smooths the Frizzies.</li>
            <li> It was super dry.</li>
            <li> Its a clear shampoo which work great for me as it cleans my hair well and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird shampoo film.</li>
            <li> and  I must say I was surprised that it was a decent sample bottle for me to use and experiment with cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> the product also did rinse out of your hair very well not extremely moisturizing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who washes my hair very frequently, but I would probably use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this shampoo was able to tame it.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair soft and shiny- even when I didn&#x27;t add product to my hair afterward!</li>
            <li> Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter used this shampoo for the first time last night</li>
            <li> That’s a big positive (and the bottle is moving upstairs soon).  </li>
            <li> When I do, I need to be able to clean my roots very well and remove all residue, and this unfortunately only does a mediocre job of that.</li>
            <li> It definitely has less chemicals and sensitivities than most of its competitors.</li>
            <li> I have long natural curly hair so that being said its very rare that I actually find products that work for my hair.</li>
            <li> I had to use a little extra more shampoo</li>
            <li> Since the ends are dry, I try not to shampoo more than every other day.</li>
            <li> clean hair with a slight citrus perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put:</li>
            <li> but it actually was really lightweight on my hair and washed completely out.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is clear and it seems like there is not buildup after I use it.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is clear.</li>
            <li> B00OP25LBW Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo]] and</li>
            <li> but I do know I am wild about this shampoo I got from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It helped my hair become soft again and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments from my peers and family because of how soft my hair feels and smells.</li>
            <li> After using this, in combination with the conditioner, my hair was soft and had body to it, without frizziness.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes, so I was worried about the smell being overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so pleasantly surprised by the products I received.</li>
            <li> This shampoo claims to be rejuvenating, but I found it to strip my hair&#x27;s natural oils rather than rejuvenate the strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really all about personal preference.  </li>
            <li> I tried this after trying the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo&#x27;s scent is much sweeter than the conditioner, and fruitier although they are supposed to have the same scent.</li>
            <li> So I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Product</li>
            <li> it uses natural ingredients to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of herbal essences wild naturals rejuvenating shampoo to review and try and</li>
            <li> It completely cleansed my hair as well as nourishing it.</li>
            <li> it says natural on the label</li>
            <li> I used a conditioner from HE wild naturals as well.  </li>
            <li> the only downfall to this product was that it did not produce a whole lot of lather</li>
            <li> I have the complete line</li>
            <li> After I applied these three items and dried my hair was smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> well its not harsh at all on the hair  </li>
            <li> It does what it says and so far it does it well.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo along with the Wild Naturals conditioner and oil elixir.</li>
            <li> The shampoo scent is also supposed to be fig and does contain some peppermint oil, according to the ingredients, but it was generic fruity sweet to my nose, and lasted all day long.</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo and usually need to shampoo twice to feel like I got it completely out of my hair, but this shampoo foams up quickly and seemed to rinse clean in one wash.</li>
            <li> Whereas the primary scent in the conditioner was supposed to be fig, but was actually mint (at least to my nose), it was quite nice and left no lingering scent to clash with other lotions or products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but hair looks, well, healthier and more vibrant following use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akin</li>
            <li> but it does seem that there are unnatural ingredients included unlike some of their other hair products lines which specifically say like their naked products which are free of silicones, parabens, and dyes.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals are a harkening back to classic Herbal Essences, but with updated branding.  </li>
            <li> so my hair doesn&#x27;t get too used to one particular product, and this is one I would definitely add into my rotation.  </li>
            <li> I guess im just a bigger fan of the older H.E shampoos</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is a fruity, herbal scent, which is a little odd, but smells nice.</li>
            <li> The only down sound is</li>
            <li> A really lovely shampoo, that smells a little herbal but also of figs - not highly perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers</li>
            <li> Clear colored shampoo which gave a rich lather from a small amount .</li>
            <li> I used three times what I would normally use and it still wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> My scalp can be very flaky during the dry winter months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry this isn&#x27;t much help to many out there...</li>
            <li> , so a little goes a long way but is easy to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shampoo is clear and you don&#x27;t need a big amount of it for it work</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals was a big surprise for me.</li>
            <li> The next day, my hair returned back to its normal feel.</li>
            <li> a little less enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp, so I’m not usually keen on buying new products to try since it may irritate the scalp and be a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Herbal Essence, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would purchase this one out of all the other choices.</li>
            <li> What she likes about is that it takes only a small amount to suds up and clean her hair.  </li>
            <li> (Although I&#x27;m sure the scent is to a large degree artificial, it doesn&#x27;t immediately come across that way.)  </li>
            <li> And the smell lasted so much longer than my other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Nothing special from the other herbal essences products but compared to other drug store brands is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> For reference I have natural African American type 4 hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I noticed a little difference.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times, and it does leave my hair pretty clean, but not as much as others have (in other words, it feels like a slight residue remains unless you rinse extremely well).</li>
            <li> And though it is a given, I always use conditioner directly afterwards but for me there is a principle- shampoo should not leave your hair feeling dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> It was a thick shampoo that lathered quickly.</li>
            <li> Even with very little, it makes curls gently shine while it moisturizes, and continues the trend of Wild Naturals smelling absolutely terrific.</li>
            <li> I just bought myself the full sized version and my only complaint is that it is not sold in sizes larger than 13.5 oz!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered right away when only using a small amount.</li>
            <li> Its a very lightweight product so it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair either!</li>
            <li> First of all, it works no better or worse than the Herbal Essences Naked line (without extra chemicals like other brands) and it costs more than the Naked line</li>
            <li> This shampoo is guaranteed to make other women befriend you in a jealous attempt to learn your secret and make men want to hike with you to exotic waterfalls in the rain forest.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little bit dry and sometimes a clear shampoo strips out too much of my natural oils but not in this case.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While this shampoo doesn&#x27;t excessively lather, it applies easy with only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was a little bit shinier and smoother than normal.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers up really well and has a fruity but not overwhelming fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects, since I&#x27;ve only begun using it, but if anything turns up (or falls out!)</li>
            <li> I am not sure how potent is powder of 100 Cassia seeds in each bottle when the ratio of the seeds seems very small.  </li>
            <li> It removed the heavy feeling that my most recent shampoo was leaving behind.</li>
            <li> I actually noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t have the same dry brittle feeling it always does after I shower!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove everything from the hair, so it takes a bit of extra rinsing to get out of there, but in return it doesn&#x27;t fluff up the hair like one for \\&quot;oily hair\\&quot; or for \\&quot;extra body\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely not worth paying extra money to get a more expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use Herbal Essence shampoo for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo was a thick consitancy which I really like.</li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every 3-4 days in the winter, I had just washed it only two days prior</li>
            <li> It was not drying to my hair and a little does go a long way, so a big bottle will definitely last awhile.</li>
            <li> It has a very natural fruity-floral smell that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Price is in line with other similar products.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend it for other ladies with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> but I just felt like I needed to wash my hair every other day rather than every third day.</li>
            <li> have extremely thick strands, high volume, and long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair came out looking like I haven&#x27;t seen in a very long time.</li>
            <li> One of my pet peeves is shampoo that leaves my hair feeling dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get frizzy and is dry.</li>
            <li> So my hair has  a tendency to feel dry.</li>
            <li> But I have dry hair anyway.  </li>
            <li> Every product I&#x27;ve used always ended up being dry again.</li>
            <li> I felt that the shampoo made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I used the combo of three for 6 washes and did not see any changes except that my hair was frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry and brittle hair and I hoped this product would help out my hair.</li>
            <li> second thing I noticed was that it was thick and clear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday due to the fear that it will dry out of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> Use this with Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner and even with highly processed hair, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> (my scalp is very dry).</li>
            <li> You only need a little dollop to get lots of suds.</li>
            <li> The other thing I didnt like is it made my hair feel really dry after rinsing it out, which my hair was a little oily prior to washing it with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair felt heavy and oily no matter which one I used (this is also around the same time that their packaging changed as well).  </li>
            <li> So far, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or limp either.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use a wide tooth comb to separate and side sweep my bangs on the unconditioned crown, my hair was a tight dry tumbleweed.</li>
            <li> A little shampoos goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I feel that a little shampoo went a long way when I lathered up.</li>
            <li> It cleans well enough, but I can&#x27;t get past the grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li> then other shampoos ive used before.</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re a person with extremely oily hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a simple man, I use any shampoo that the wife buys, so I have smelt plenty shampoos in the past.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (hair is a little below half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other hair products, but instead, my hair ended up looking dull and frizzy.</li>
            <li> but in this case, this HE shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair dull, so I will continue to use it in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> and then I applied the conditioner and left the conditioner on for at least two minutes.</li>
            <li> It did not make my hair greasy or weigh my hair down like a lot of moisturizing shampoos do.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> I found myself scratching at my scalp less and was relieved to see that my bangs did not look greasy whatsoever.</li>
            <li> (My hair is black, but brown in the sun) and fritzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you get less of it for your money.</li>
            <li> so I was a little hesitant on whether or not it would just smother my hair and coat</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a little too fluffy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run out of the bottle and down the drain!</li>
            <li> I disliked how it did make a lot of suds.</li>
            <li> It seems a lot of products leave it feeling heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> i like the product because it cleans the hsir without being harsh to tge hair or drying it out.</li>
            <li> If you were a previous fan of the product line, give this one a try!</li>
            <li> Good grief, I had a hard time rinsing the shampoo out as there was residue the next morning, just a bad experience all around.</li>
            <li> In the morning I add a small amount and notice it is not so heavy</li>
            <li> I usually try to avoid anything with that word in it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I would measure that.</li>
            <li> I usually struggle finding shampoo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually fairly subtle and just little fruity.  </li>
            <li> I was just disappointed when it came to how much I had to apply.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes along way!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the negative.</li>
            <li> At least to me.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s not too thick, so</li>
            <li> but it was a thick substance which I didn&#x27;t like either.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was thick</li>
            <li> This shampoo is thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s another thick shampoo, which I happen to like.</li>
            <li> but I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair that is really, really thick.</li>
            <li> I did a thorough rinse the next day then recolored with semi-permanent lavender in a base of conditioner and let it rest at least an hour to revive my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> The scent is very like and stinks like a grapefruit, which i hate grapefruits and citrus scents.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not great for your hair, but who can resist the smell?  </li>
            <li> and I was concerned that this would either make it worse or leave my hair too oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird to say but it seriously is intoxicating.</li>
            <li> For me it was just average ....not terrible but not amazing.</li>
            <li> Well I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with it  .</li>
            <li> No need for expensive treatments because it&#x27;s all packed in this bottle when used with the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> hair is dry and damaged after a horrible experience at the hair salon.</li>
            <li> so I scared this product would so something crazy to it.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner every day and am sad that I&#x27;m almost out!</li>
            <li> I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> Soo I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice smell to me, and I like that it comes in a clear bottle.  I also like that it&#x27;s not too thick, so I can use it on my kids as well.</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating line is an absolute winner. All three products I&#x27;ve reviewed - shampoo, conditioner, and elixir -  are highest quality at a lower price point. This is no small victory, as they are used on very curly hair with a sensitive and psoriatic scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this shampoo doesn&#x27;t excessively lather, it applies easy with only a small amount. Even with very little, it makes curls gently shine while it moisturizes, and continues the trend of Wild Naturals smelling absolutely terrific. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but hair looks, well, healthier and more vibrant following use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akin to its Rejuvenating counterparts, this review product led to buying this product in bulk. Well done, Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> I used to use Herbal Essences all the time when I was younger.  I know it&#x27;s not great for your hair, but who can resist the smell?  Then something happened and the formulas all seemed to change.  My hair felt heavy and oily no matter which one I used (this is also around the same time that their packaging changed as well).  I saw this come available and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I will say that I like it, although it isn&#x27;t my favorite product ever.  The smells is great (nice and strong, the way I like it), and my hair feels fresh and clean after I use it.  So far, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or limp either.  I do like to switch up my shampoo so my hair doesn&#x27;t get too used to one particular product, and this is one I would definitely add into my rotation.  If you were a previous fan of the product line, give this one a try!</li>
            <li> A really lovely shampoo, that smells a little herbal but also of figs - not highly perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up really well, so a little goes a long way but is easy to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;I used it several times without a conditioner to see how it would perform on it&#x27;s own and was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short, straight, dry, very fine and regularly coloured, this produced a lovely gloss with noticeable volume.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it with the Herbal Essences conditioner for coloured hair and I&#x27;m still pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good product. Nothing special from the other herbal essences products but compared to other drug store brands is one of my favorites. Smells great &amp; does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> I love the way that thus shampoo feel..I was given samples from Influenster To try this , and I am definitely Be buying them when I run out of the samples given to me..I love the scent, it&#x27;s invigorating. .thanks to Influenster for making me try something new that is exactly what I needed for my hair</li>
            <li> I just used the shampoo tonight since I got a free sample complimentary for testing purposes. I&#x27;ll start with the negative. I disliked how it did make a lot of suds. I had to keep applying more since I do have longer hair but it was a thick substance which I didn&#x27;t like either. I also did not like the smell of it. It was really strong. At least to me. I did like how easy it was to brush through my hair after wards. What I did was apply it on my wet/damp hair and then I applied the conditioner and left the conditioner on for at least two minutes. It&#x27;s a good buy because of how easy it is to brush my hair afterwards. I was just disappointed when it came to how much I had to apply.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes.  This is not my normal shampoo brand and I am very picky when it comes to my hair.  The smell is fantastic! I have naturally curly hair and this shampoo was able to tame it.  I was pretty impressed with this product and would consider purchasing it as my main shampoo brand.  I used the shampoo with the conditioner, the two together made my hair soft, less frizzy, and still smelled great the next day after using the product,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 2 weeks now. I was sent this product to review in my VoxBox by Influenster. I have always been a fan of Herbal Essences. It&#x27;s what my grandma used, and what I used consistently up until a couple of years ago. I LOVED the smell. It has a very natural fruity-floral smell that is not overwhelming. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change switching from regular paraben/sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. I did notice that right after shampooing it did feel very moisturized, like I could run my fingers through it. I have thick wavy hair, so that was nice. If you are looking for a quality shampoo you can get at the grocery or retail store I definitely recommend this one</li>
            <li> AMMY has recently given me the opportunity to test out&lt;br /&gt;HERBAL ESSENCES [[ASIN:B00OP25LBW Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo]] and [[ASIN:B00OP25Z2C Detoxifying Conditioner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is a clear liquid with a distinct aroma of grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;Their milky conditioner has a strong lemon scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount of shampoo quickly works into a thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing it out the hair is impressively thicker in volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is instantly swallowed up by the hair, which is&lt;br /&gt;later left tangle-free and easy to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result: clean hair with a slight citrus perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put: HERBAL ESSENCES is very good stuff!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so good smelling! There is a romantic story on the bottle about ingredients being picked from the wilds of the forest as the pickers skipped through the meadow, or something like that. It was a bit corny, but added to the ambiance of nice fragrance and treating yourself to something luxurious for your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that it contains menthol, which I didn&#x27;t know until I was in the shower, happily lathering it up and started to have an asthma attack. So, if you are allergic to menthol, be warned. Ordering online, I didn&#x27;t check the ingredients, and when it came, I did the smell test and didn&#x27;t initially smell menthol. Most shampoos don&#x27;t have that as an ingredient, so it did kind of shock me when I launched into a coughing fit. The smell does not denote any sort of menthol-like odor, but when the hot water was added and steam began to enter my lungs, I was in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be getting this again, simply because I had an allergic reaction to it, but for those who aren&#x27;t allergic to the ingredients, I think you will enjoy this very much. The soap did seem to lather quite well and make my scalp feel clean during initial application, I just couldn&#x27;t keep it on and had to rewash with another product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for three weeks and I can tell a difference in my hair.  The lather is so luxurious when you soap it up in your hair and the aroma is awesome.  You will think you are in a salon.  I haven&#x27;t the faintest idea what cassia seeds are or what Turkish figs smell like but I do know I am wild about this shampoo I got from Amazon.  My hair has such a clean feeling after the shampoo and there is no dried out strands for me to doctor after using Herbal Essences shampoo.  I would recommend you order your from Amazon today.</li>
            <li> One of my pet peeves is shampoo that leaves my hair feeling dry and tangled. And though it is a given, I always use conditioner directly afterwards but for me there is a principle- shampoo should not leave your hair feeling dry and tangled. The good news? This shampoo does NOT do that. It leaves it feeling smooth and it smells really terrific!! Use this with Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner and even with highly processed hair, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, not overpowering. The shampoo though, not a fan. I used three times what I would normally use and it still wasn&#x27;t enough. I couldn&#x27;t work up enough of a lather to fully wash my hair. I typically wash my hair every 3-4 days in the winter, I had just washed it only two days prior and it still couldn&#x27;t quite lather up my hair. The conditioner was fine, but the shampoo wasn&#x27;t much of a step up from dollar brands, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter used this shampoo for the first time last night and she said this morning. &amp;#34;I love it. It makes my hair feel fluffy.&amp;#34; She needs her thin straight hair to be a bit fluffier so this is very good. Plus, her hair looked great this morning. I love the way it smells and the way it lathers up. I think this shampoo is a winner!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product to test and review and now I&#x27;m going to have to buy me a bottle! It has a great natural smell and it works great my hair felt clean and smelled fantastic after using this!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I had the opportunity to try in when sent in my influenster box and I&#x27;m grateful. The shampoo is clear and you don&#x27;t need a big amount of it for it work it&#x27;s wonder. The smell is great, as if you&#x27;re in a tropical vacation. My hair is damaged so I scared this product would so something crazy to it. I was very wrong. It helped my hair become soft again and shiny. I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments from my peers and family because of how soft my hair feels and smells. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday due to the fear that it will dry out of its natural oils. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my head stink but stays smelling great.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from Influenster and was excited to try it. My scalp can be very flaky during the dry winter months and I was concerned that this would either make it worse or leave my hair too oily. Well I was wrong. I found myself scratching at my scalp less and was relieved to see that my bangs did not look greasy whatsoever. Smells amazing and left my hair silky. I would definitely recommend the trio of rejuvenating products!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife.  She loves it, and is buying more.  What she likes about is that it takes only a small amount to suds up and clean her hair.  And when she rinses and dries she says her hair feels more full and moisturized.  She&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> Of all the years I have used herbal essence this new line is by far the best feeling for my hair and the best smelling. The new scents are amazing and make my hair feel super soft and luxurious all day!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo ! Smells great and left my hair soft and full of volume ! Highly recommend ! Thanks to Influenster I got to try it for free !</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy Herbal Essences Shampoo, but I received it free to test and review. I have to say that it is a pretty great shampoo. My hair tends to get frizzy and is dry. After using this, in combination with the conditioner, my hair was soft and had body to it, without frizziness.  Also, I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes, so I was worried about the smell being overpowering. The fragrance had a hint of sweetness and was just right. It lathered up well too. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Got these products for free to test and really liked the products! They made my hair look and feel great! Will definitely be buying some soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about keeping my hair healthy and hydrated. That&#x27;s why I make a point to only use the best shampoo for my flowing locks. This product was a complimentary gift, and I could not be more happy with it. I just bought myself the full sized version and my only complaint is that it is not sold in sizes larger than 13.5 oz!! This shampoo is guaranteed to make other women befriend you in a jealous attempt to learn your secret and make men want to hike with you to exotic waterfalls in the rain forest. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this collection complimentary for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleasantly surprised by the products I received. I have used the shampoo and conditioner every day and am sad that I&#x27;m almost out! They lather really well and smell so lovely. The oil elixir is also great and helps to keep my frizzy hair tamed when my hair starts to  dry. I would highly recommend this collection!</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo complimentary from influenster. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it, even though I&#x27;m always hesitant when it comes to my hair. It seems a lot of products leave it feeling heavy and oily. Not this shampoo! It left my hair nice and soft. The smell was a wonderful bonus! I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I used the shampoo followed by the conditioner and oil. I have long natural curly hair so that being said its very rare that I actually find products that work for my hair. These products worked very well for my hair it made it frizz-free and smooth. Its a very lightweight product so it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair either! It also has a lovely smell to it that I absolutely love and its not an overpowering smell either. The shampoo felt like it actually had cleaned my hair while hydrating it not just coating my hair. I followed it with the conditioner that made my hair very smooth. The conditioner was thick so I was a little hesitant on whether or not it would just smother my hair and coat it like most conditioners do to my hair but it actually was really lightweight on my hair and washed completely out. After my shower I let my hair air out a bit until it was just damp and followed up with the oil which was amazing. It was easy to apply and left my hair soft and frizz-free all day and it didn&#x27;t leave my hands all oily.</li>
            <li> Okay. A decent shampoo, I guess, but nothing special. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Sweet but light fragrance. I might buy it if it was on sale, but  wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to look for it. It left my hair clean of course, and has decent lather.</li>
            <li> I’m old enough to remember those semi-scandalous Herbal Essence shampoo TV commercials when it seemed that this very same hair care product was more than just a way to get clean hair, that it was so potent, so powerful, so awesomely stimulating that it seemed, at least from the TV spokesmodels’ enthusiastic portrayals, that it could actually product physical, ahem, ecstasy in its consumers.  Great commercials, those, if a bit hyperbolic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn’t quite get that experience with this shampoo.  But I sure got great-smelling and clean hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn’t really a product for guys; this is a fem-product.  From its packaging, with that post-disco silver headband/ring at the top of the cap to the colors and product copy (“nurture yourself into a natural knockout”—I do love that alliteration, though), this is aimed at the female demographic.  No matter.  It cleaned my hair just fine, with no residue, no difficulty, and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is most distinctly fruity, with clear and almost tasty tinge of citrus.  Officially it’s “Turkish fig.”  I’ve had my share of figs, sure, but I’ve yet to visit Turkey, so can’t really tell you if this assertion is on-point.  The scent is somewhat strong, not quite as intense as a “fruit”-flavored slurpee, but it’s rather close to the fruity scents you’ll associate with processed foods.  If this scent were in a food, I think I’d like to eat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It promises to moisturize, and I guess it does.  I could tell no difference in my hair before or after the shower, and I have no way to make any kind of empirical measurement of it.  I also didn’t really feel any more or less rejuvenated after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 16-y-o son liked it, and told me that a couple of girls at his school had noted the scent positively.  That’s a big positive (and the bottle is moving upstairs soon).  The wife thought it was too fruity; it didn’t smell “competent” enough in her estimation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is just fine, perfectly competitive with any other similar product in a similar size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this is a great product for the ladies, an update of the old school herbal essence shampoo that did wonderful things in the shower.ompetent” enough in her estimation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is just fine, perfectly competitive with any other similar product in a similar size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this is a great product for the ladies, an update of the old school herbal essence shampoo that did wonderful things in the shower.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use Herbal Essence shampoo for a long time.  This is a free sample from the manufacture and I have used it for almost 20 days or so.  This  shampoo has fruity and flowery scent.  I don&#x27;t use a lot since I have a very short hair.  Therefore I don&#x27;t smell a lot of shampoo scent next morning.  I am not sure how potent is powder of 100 Cassia seeds in each bottle when the ratio of the seeds seems very small.  But it does leave the hair more silky like conditioner is used.  I can not tell how much protection I am getting from the seed.  $6 a bottle meets my need of washing my hair daily.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals are a harkening back to classic Herbal Essences, but with updated branding.  Unfortunately, the scent is not as pleasant as classic HE, nor is the shampoo as good as the new repackaged and redesigned HE you more often see (opaque bottles in curved shapes and bold colors). While this scent is described as Turkish Fig, the predominant scent is actually the peppermint and menthol.  That will be the takeaway on your scalp as well.  While some people may find that tingle pleasant, to me it means my scalp and hair are drying out.  This shampoo claims to be rejuvenating, but I found it to strip my hair&#x27;s natural oils rather than rejuvenate the strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really all about personal preference.  The shampoo is quality enough that it is not thin or watery, but it does not feel as good to my head as the Hello Hydration line.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo, conditioner, and the revitalizing hair oil. All three smell amazing, made my hair happier + healthier + clean + shiny. But seriously - such a yummy smell.</li>
            <li> This shampo not only smells incredible but leaves your hair soft and shiny!  My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this moisturized in forever!! Definitely do recommend this shampoo to everyone.  I was actually given a free sample of this conditioner by influencer to test and ended up going out and buying my own bottle its so incredible!</li>
            <li> I have one word for this shampoo, AMAZING! I received a trail sample in the mail last week and my hair has never smelled soo good! Even after I get out of the shower and after I blow dry my hair it still smells good! I will be definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li> I really loved this product. My hair was soft, shiny, moisturized, and smelled great! I was given this product for free for testing purposes and I would definitely buy this after my sample is gone.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It makes my hair feel clean without feeling stripped. For reference I have natural African American type 4 hair. So my hair has  a tendency to feel dry. But this shampoo didn&#x27;t do that at all. My hair actually felt hydrated after using it. Great product! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> The scent of the shampoo is amazing. I don&#x27;t know what turkish figs smell like, but I like the scent. It has fruity, floral, and clean smell to it. I&#x27;ve tried using the shampoo by itself and with the conditioner in this line. I must say, it works better when paired up with its other products. I noticed my hair was a little bit shinier and smoother than normal. But this effect did not last. The next day, my hair returned back to its normal feel. **Product was sent free of charge by Influenster to review.**</li>
            <li> I tried this after trying the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner. The conditioner was lightly scented and left my hair feeling great. I am not as smitten with the shampoo, but it&#x27;s still good. The shampoo&#x27;s scent is much sweeter than the conditioner, and fruitier although they are supposed to have the same scent. Whereas the primary scent in the conditioner was supposed to be fig, but was actually mint (at least to my nose), it was quite nice and left no lingering scent to clash with other lotions or products. The shampoo scent is also supposed to be fig and does contain some peppermint oil, according to the ingredients, but it was generic fruity sweet to my nose, and lasted all day long. The shampoo did a fine job, my hair got squeaky clean. But I prefer the conditioner in this Herbal Essences team.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is thick. I have never smelled a Turkish fig so I don&#x27;t know what it SHOULD smell like, however, to me, it smells like a perfume-y grapefruit. It cleans well enough, but I can&#x27;t get past the grapefruit scent. I don&#x27;t like grapefruit. Fortunately, the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around very long. My hair is dry and, while this shampoo cleans well, I don&#x27;t think it is a good fit. It leaves my hair a little too fluffy. Makes a decent body wash though.</li>
            <li> I already loved the rejuvenating conditioner, so I was eager to try the shampoo. It&#x27;s another thick shampoo, which I happen to like. It doesn&#x27;t run out of the bottle and down the drain! It has a similiar nice scent as conditioner, but not quite the same....a little less enjoyable. However, it lathers well and makes my hair shiny. I tend to have  oily hair, but as I age and get more gray hair, I find I need a more moisturizing shampoo/conditioner. This works for me. Recommended</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating has a nice scent and suds up quickly.  It leaves the hair with a good clean feel.  Price is in line with other similar products.  If your shampoo does not leave your hair feeling great you should try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  A 51-year-old guy.  So I am not a shampoo snob by any stretch.  I like my hair, which I was every day, to be clean.  And I don&#x27;t want to smell perfumy.  I don&#x27;t worry or notice things like &amp;#34;full body&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34;, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Herbal Essences shampoo fit my modest standards very ably. In particular, I liked the smell.  It&#x27;s actually fairly subtle and just little fruity.  It&#x27;s a nice pleasant smell that is absolutely NOT perfumy or &amp;#34;artificial&amp;#34;.  (Although I&#x27;m sure the scent is to a large degree artificial, it doesn&#x27;t immediately come across that way.)  It lathers up very nicely, and overall simply gives me what I am looking for.  I&#x27;m sorry this isn&#x27;t much help to many out there...but if you, like me, dislike overbearing scents, then you should be well pleased by this product.  I&#x27;ll certainly buy more.</li>
            <li> Provided the opportunity to test it free through influenster. I really like it. It ssmells wonderful and leaves my hair feeling very moist when used with the other two products in the series. Would definitely recommend it for other ladies with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> So I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Product Yesterday Free From Influenster And I Couldn&#x27;t Wait To Try It Out!! I Hopped Right In The Shower... I Wish They Had Candles That Smelled This Good!! My Hair Feels So Much Cleaner And Smells Great... I&#x27;ll Be Stocking Up On tHis Product Next Time I Head Out To The Stores!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo and usually need to shampoo twice to feel like I got it completely out of my hair, but this shampoo foams up quickly and seemed to rinse clean in one wash. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and creates a nice aroma in the shower that lasts all day. Also, because it foams so well, it doubles as a bubble bath, which was when I really appreciated the scented aspect of this product. I reciecved a sample of it in a voxbox from Influenster and loved it.</li>
            <li> I was able to test Herbal Essences Wild Naturals rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner and oil elixer for free from influenster.&lt;br /&gt;They all smell wonderful- I wasn&#x27;t sure what fig smelled like, but it&#x27;s a light fruity smell! The shampoo lathered right away when only using a small amount. I needed to use a bit more conditioner in order to fully work into my hair- but I have thick hair. The oil elixer makes my hair very shiny and smooth. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the products!</li>
            <li> I recently received this product in my complimentary box from Influenster. I tried it out today and I am very pleased with the results. My hair feels clean and light. It removed the heavy feeling that my most recent shampoo was leaving behind. The scent is pleasant, but not too feminine. I think it is a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences is my favorite brand for in-store shampoo/conditioner and I must say, this has been my all time favorite. I got this product for free to test and review. The shampoo itself smells amazing and refreshing with a nice fruity Turkish fig scent. It has a smooth texture and was easy to work through my hair. Paired with the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner, my hair felt incredibly smooth afterwards. Compared to products bought in hair salons, my hair didn&#x27;t necessarily feel any stronger but I like that it uses natural ingredients to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair that is really, really thick. I have problems finding good conditioners/shampoos because it fritzes easily.&lt;br /&gt;I think this combo (shampoo/conditioner/oil elixer) is good for people with hair not as thick as mine, because I’ve tried the combo three times and each time it didn’t work out too well.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo kinda blew my hair up. It’s all brown (My hair is black, but brown in the sun) and fritzy.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don’t think this works for me, but it might for other people.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I got these products free to test and review through Influenster</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of herbal essences wild naturals rejuvenating shampoo to review and try and boy did I hit the jackpot! As always herbal essences filled my shower and bathroom with the most amazing smell. It completely cleansed my hair as well as nourishing it. I would always recommend their products. Just try it for yourself and you won&#x27;t try anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> I received this free from influenster for review.  Ok.. Soo I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product.  But I don&#x27;t have anything good to say either.  It has a pleasant smell.  But I&#x27;ve smelt better. Lathers nicely and leaves my hair feeling clean.  It did it&#x27;s job. but nothing about this shampoo stood out to me above the rest. Could have been a tad more moisturizing.  But I have dry hair anyway.  Would I buy it?  Eh.  If it were on sale.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo to help my hair since it looked kind of dry and I got this in my voxbox for free to test and try and I love it and the conditioner and oilf fixer- in my opinion it worked great for me and my hair- it helped it look healthier and moisturizer without lookingn greasy and a plus to it is that it smells great too!! I would definitely recommend this! A little bit goes along way!!</li>
            <li> I recieved the shampoo and conditioner in a kit for free to try from influenster.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly damaged and generally needs conditioner everytime I shampoo. This product I felt like I didn&#x27;t need the conditioner because of how smooth it left my hair after shampoo alone. The scent of this product is also amazing! From looking at the bottle, reading the name and smelling in the bottle I would&#x27;ve never assumed it would smell so good. When used in the shower is when I really got the full scent of it. It&#x27;s a fruity scent with an amazing minty clean fresh after tone! I would highly recommend this and will be using again!</li>
            <li> I receive this product as a sample from influenster.com. And I was very pleased with the way after just one use left my hair feeling. It smelled good. The shampoo was a thick consitancy which I really like. I feel like you don&#x27;t have to use as much. All in all wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me this product to try out. I have not used Herbal Essence since I was younger. I still remember the commercials from back in the day. The first thing I did was smell it because I had no idea what scent a Turkish Fig would even have. I could not stop smelling it because it smelled so good to me. Almost like a grapefruit and I love the smell of those. When I used it in the shower it lathered up really well. Its always a plus for me when I can get a bunch suds going. All in all it seemed to do its job. The only down sound is I saw that in the ingredients there is sulfate. I usually try to avoid anything with that word in it. I would recommend this if you are looking for a good smelling drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li> Ugh. I received this as a sample in return for my honest review. As a beauty blogger and student cosmetologist, I have to tell the truth: RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. I have fairly healthy but processed hair and warn you NOT to use this shampoo if you have bleached, permanently colored or lifted your color in any way! This shampoo stripped my semi-permanent blue and silver Pravana color right off, more efficiently than any clarifying shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair was gummy, which rarely happens with the Joico Color Endure shampoo line that I use. Good grief, I had a hard time rinsing the shampoo out as there was residue the next morning, just a bad experience all around. DO NOT USE if you have color and want to keep it. I couldn&#x27;t even use a wide tooth comb to separate and side sweep my bangs on the unconditioned crown, my hair was a tight dry tumbleweed. I did a thorough rinse the next day then recolored with semi-permanent lavender in a base of conditioner and let it rest at least an hour to revive my hair. Use at your own risk, girl.</li>
            <li> Received this shampoo as a trial size for free from Influenster. The first time I used it, I was amazed at how well it works. The smell is absolutely addicting! It wasnt too strong, and was very pleasant! The shampoo left my hair feeling clean, smooth and overall healthy again! After I finished the trial size, I immediately purchased this because I was hooked! A+ in my book!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. ..made my hair feel soft, full and so beautiful.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from influenster. This shampoo smells nice, surprisingly so since I don&#x27;t usually like fig scents. I have fine, straight hair and this did not tangle or damage my hair as some shampoos do - it foams well and washes out easily. I probably won&#x27;t be using it regularly as it has parabens and sulfates, but I will be adding it to my routine to change it up.</li>
            <li> Usually dont use this product but it left my hair feeling super soft both shampoo and conditioner plus smelling delicious cant stop smelling it</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary through Influenster, however all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floral and fruity scent is my favorite attribute of this shampoo. I have used it a few times, and it does leave my hair pretty clean, but not as much as others have (in other words, it feels like a slight residue remains unless you rinse extremely well). The scent does linger and keeps you smelling fresh. The conditioner in this collection is even better, and the elixir oil is AMAZING, so I would definitely purchase those 2 items again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick strands, high volume, and long hair. Since the ends are dry, I try not to shampoo more than every other day. When I do, I need to be able to clean my roots very well and remove all residue, and this unfortunately only does a mediocre job of that. If you shampoo more frequently or do not have oily roots, then this would be great, as the scent is very nice!</li>
            <li> I received this product free to test and review for free and was happy with the outcome considering the price of the shampoo (I tend to use higher priced hair products). The Shampoo smells great and leaves hair clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the shampoo to my normal hair routine because I wanted to see what the results would be. My normal hair routine is unique in that I tend to coconut oil my scalp and use a rinse of apple cider vinegar before shampooing and conditioning (my scalp is very dry). This shampoo did not irritate my scalp which was great and had a really pleasant scent. It did not make my hair greasy or weigh my hair down like a lot of moisturizing shampoos do. I would def recommend using this shampoo whether you are on a budget or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish it had was more information on the ingredients- it says natural on the label but it does seem that there are unnatural ingredients included unlike some of their other hair products lines which specifically say like their naked products which are free of silicones, parabens, and dyes.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to test and review. I actually really like it! I have always been a fan of herbal essences products, but I have never tried anything from there naturals line. It left my hair super soft and shiny. The shampoo smells great, and really removed any oils that I had on my scalp. The conditioner made my hair soft and shiny- even when I didn&#x27;t add product to my hair afterward! The shampoo did not leave a residue- which is great for me because I have fine hair and that can make my hair look limp. One thing I will say is that the smell is great! However, if you&#x27;re like me, and you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day, the smell changed as the days went on. The first day it was great, the second day it was ok, and by the third I felt like it smelled sour. Im sure thats just because of the fruits and oils they use but I just felt like I needed to wash my hair every other day rather than every third day. Overall, its great and I will be purchasing this in full size as soon as my sample runs out! The shampoo and conditioner are great and I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I had been using inferior shampoo, this is excellent quality and my hair looks a lot better, and feels great. A little shampoos goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers up really well and has a fruity but not overwhelming fragrance.  The shampoo is clear and it seems like there is not buildup after I use it.  My hair is a little bit dry and sometimes a clear shampoo strips out too much of my natural oils but not in this case.  I like the way it left my hair, clean and ready for my regular conditioner.  It didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair but it helped my curls to look neat and bouncy.  I used a conditioner from HE wild naturals as well.  I normally use a sulfate free shampoo (helps with some shine) but in this case, this HE shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair dull, so I will continue to use it in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> Lovely and refredsing and leaves my hair feeling full and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair and although healthy I need a shampoo that gives me a clean and full body feel.\&lt;br /&gt;This does the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is lovely and not too overpoweringly fruity with a tinge of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft lather and rinses out very quickly leaving my hair feeling refresed and looking lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely suggest this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a new shampoo since I began growing my hair longer, so I gave this one a shot. I find it to work well at controlling the hair, to require bit of extra rinsing to come off cleanly, and to have a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always seems to me as if these Herbal Essences have the same basic smell and texture, and this one was no different. I really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference between this and others. Shampoo comes in various strengths, which are to be used based on (fundamentally) how oily the hair is. I would classify this one as for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair. It doesn&#x27;t remove everything from the hair, so it takes a bit of extra rinsing to get out of there, but in return it doesn&#x27;t fluff up the hair like one for \\&quot;oily hair\\&quot; or for \\&quot;extra body\\&quot;. I find that it controls my medium length hair very nicely - it is exactly what I wanted. My hair is clean but not uncontrollable. I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects, since I&#x27;ve only begun using it, but if anything turns up (or falls out!) I&#x27;ll report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: A good choice to control hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essence products on and off for years. I have yet to run into one I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a fruity, herbal scent, which is a little odd, but smells nice. I had to check the ingredients list to figure it out. Turkish Fig is the primary, and is what is pictured on the bottle, but it also includes peppermint oil and that is the herbal smell.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers up nicely and cleanses well. The Cassia seed supposedly helps protect hair from damage and breakage. I am not sure how I would measure that. For now I&#x27;ll just say I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. The shampoo also advertises a rejuvenating effect from the fig, but I can&#x27;t say I noticed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a super amazing shampoo, but it is excellent for normal everyday use.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product. First of all, it works no better or worse than the Herbal Essences Naked line (without extra chemicals like other brands) and it costs more than the Naked line and you get less of it for your money. I don&#x27;t find this to be a superior product that I would pay upwards of $1.00 more for less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell nice but I think the Naked line smells just as good and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> I feel like &#x27;drugstore&#x27; shampoos keep getting better and better. I recently found my new love in Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine, which leaves my hair super soft and shiny. I never thought I&#x27;d find another shampoo like it... and then I discovered this. Herbal Essences Wild Naturals was a big surprise for me. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the packaging, For some reason, it reminded me of the Herbal Essences bottles from the 90&#x27;s. But the product itself? It was a miracle worker! It smells a bit minty and fruity... it&#x27;s maybe not the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever smelled, but I&#x27;ve never gotten such soft hair from a shampoo in my life! It is so sleek and manageable! It is absolutely not worth paying extra money to get a more expensive shampoo. This is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked wonders on my sister&#x27;s hair. While we both loved this shampoo, it is worth noting that we both have very thick hair. I will definitely be buying this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I received it for free from influenster and I have become a fan for sure. Smells wonderful and has a great lather. Can&#x27;t wait to try the rest of the products in this line.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to review for influenster. overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good shampoo. Left my hair feeling clean and soft. I really like the smell of the 3 products. Didn&#x27;t leave any residue in my hair. Definitely a good product for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; beautiful fruity,citrus smelling scent .  Clear colored shampoo which gave a rich lather from a small amount . loved, loved, loved the scent,  used the matching conditioner  which left my hair so soft .</li>
            <li> I have one word for this shampoo, AMAZING! I received a trail sample in the mail last week and my hair has never smelled soo good! Even after I get out of the shower and after I blow dry my hair it still smells good! I will be definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell.I had never heard of Turkish fig essences before, but it smells amazing can&#x27;t go wrong with it  . Worked good and especially with the conditioner after. My only problem with this product is the ingredients I don&#x27;t like hair products with a lot of chemicals  in them because I don&#x27;t want damaged hair. I also only shampoo my hair once a week so the free shampoo I received to review will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who washes my hair very frequently, but I would probably use this product again. I received a free sample from Influenster, and used this product along with the coordinating conditioner. I did like the fragrance, and it did the job of cleaning my hair well!</li>
            <li> I got a sample from Influenster to review, and I absolutely love everything about it. The smell, the lightness, and the way my hair feels. I will definitely buy a bigger size when I run out of the sample.</li>
            <li> i received this product free for sample and i am in love with the smell fig is simply amazing. the only downfall to this product was that it did not produce a whole lot of lather but it did clean my hair well enough the refreshing smell will make mid rinse out of hair very purchase it again. the product also did rinse out of your hair very well not extremely moisturizing so if you need that quality definately follow with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Shampoo! Why? Because there&#x27;s nothing that I don&#x27;t like about it.  The product label states that it rejuvenates your hair and makes it smooth and shiny and it does exactly that! My hair came out looking like I haven&#x27;t seen in a very long time. I&#x27;ve tried several other hair products, but instead, my hair ended up looking dull and frizzy. Not in this case though. I am happy that my hair has life and I am able to manage my hair better! No need for expensive treatments because it&#x27;s all packed in this bottle when used with the matching conditioner. It also smells fantastic! Thanks to Clairol and Influenster.com for the product to test or I would still be looking for my magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Well to start off I just received this product free to test and review from influenster. Ive always been a fan of H.E. but this was one shampoo I will probably never use again or buy for myself. The only thing i have nice to say about the shampoo is the look of the bottle it came in is very appealing. Just by looking at the bottle it looks like it will be a nice shampoo to use, but it didnt live up to what i expected. First of all I love shampoos with strong and/or sweet scents and I could barely even smell this shampoo at all. The scent is very like and stinks like a grapefruit, which i hate grapefruits and citrus scents. Maybe if the shampoo smelled like a sweet scent id probably like it a little bit more. The other thing I didnt like is it made my hair feel really dry after rinsing it out, which my hair was a little oily prior to washing it with this shampoo. I had to use a little extra more shampoo then other shampoos ive used before. In my opinion this shampoo reminds me of those cheap hotel shampoos you get in your room. I guess im just a bigger fan of the older H.E shampoos and I like the ones with color better then this clear shampoo. I guess if you&#x27;re a person with extremely oily hair then this is the shampoo for you because it will strip all the oil off your hair and clean any build up off.</li>
            <li> I was able to test Herbal essences wild naturals rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner and oil elixir for free by influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was the smell. It smelled really fruity and I enjoyed it. I really enjoyed that the smelled wasn&#x27;t so overpowering after using it. It was there but not so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed was that it was thick and clear. I enjoyed that it wasn&#x27;t watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dry and damaged after a horrible experience at the hair salon. Every product I&#x27;ve used always ended up being dry again. The first time I tried it, I noticed a little difference. It was super dry. I didnt have to use a lot of product either. It lathered nice and plenty with a small amount. I have long hair (hair is a little below half my back) so that was a plus. I use it at night and use the oil after. In the morning I add a small amount and notice it is not so heavy and it does not leave my hair super shiny. It helps with keeping it smooth. Overall, I am impressed with the product. It does help with damaged hair. It makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells nice lathers good.A little goes a long way. My hair shines and has body.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. They say it&#x27;s \\&quot;FIG\\&quot; scented. My nose smells citrus/floral overtones. Anyhow,the scent is fantastic without being overwhelming. The shampoo is clear.You only need a little dollop to get lots of suds. The bottle should last a long time making it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;Performance wise this shampoo makes my hair silkier and less tangled after washing. I have the complete line and I sometimes use the matched conditioner with the shampoo. The products work great together on my dry, frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great shampoo with an unique scent.</li>
            <li> This shampoo ROCKS! Its a clear shampoo which work great for me as it cleans my hair well and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird shampoo film. I was lucky enough to receive this product for free to sample and review and I couldn&#x27;t be more stoked! Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir combo complimentary from influenster. I have light brown hair with highlights that is dry and frizzy at times. I felt that the shampoo made my hair dry. I used the combo of three for 6 washes and did not see any changes except that my hair was frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product as a free sample through Influenster, and I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I have a very sensitive scalp, so I’m not usually keen on buying new products to try since it may irritate the scalp and be a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I was happy with how nonirritating this shampoo was. It definitely has less chemicals and sensitivities than most of its competitors. The shampoo itself is lighter than most I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of the shampoo. Although, I have never smelled Turkish fig, I can now say I like it. The scent will stay in your hair all day. I didn’t notice any build up or residue either. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo free by Influenster to test and review. I suffer from dry and brittle hair and I hoped this product would help out my hair. Immediately after I received it I used it during my next shower. I have to say that the smell is delightful. I used the shampoo along with the conditioner. After I rinsed it all out I towel-dried my hair. I actually noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t have the same dry brittle feeling it always does after I shower! And the smell lasted so much longer than my other shampoos. I&#x27;m really glad I got to test this product out. Thanks Influenster!</li>
            <li> When opening this product the aroma was delightful. I applied this shampoo and massaged it in to cover all my hair. While applying it and rinsing it I felt fresh and relaxed by the aroma. I used this shampoo along with the conditioner and the oil Elixir. After I applied these three items and dried my hair was smooth and shinny. I will definitely be purchasing this item. I got this product free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I absolutely in love with a this product.  I&#x27;m currently a cosmetology student  and I never use anything on my clients that I wouldn&#x27;t use myself. i like the product because it cleans the hsir without being harsh to tge hair or drying it out.I&#x27;ve used it on my clients who smoke and it get rid of that smell I highly  recommend  this to my clients  the smell is wonderful  and it really cleans the hair well its not harsh at all on the hair  makes it feel really soft and healthy</li>
            <li> I got this product to use and review for free, and it is amazing! I use about a quarter size drop worked into my hair and my hair stays cleaner longer it doesn&#x27;t get oily as fast. It also smells amazing! I usually struggle finding shampoo but I swear by this now</li>
            <li> Received this shampoo in my Voxbox. My hair is extremely curly and dry, this adds a nice sheen and smooths the Frizzies. 👍 definitely a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this product to review; all opinions are 100% my own. This shampoo smells as good as you can imagine and it cleans perfectly too. Popping the cap for the first time in the shower was exactly like those old Herbal Essences commercials. It&#x27;s weird to say but it seriously is intoxicating. I have used it for a couple weeks now and I&#x27;m obsessed. My hair feels/looks clean for easily 3 days between washes and as a new mom that&#x27;s beyond helpful. When paired with the oil elixir - it&#x27;s a match made in heaven!</li>
            <li> I had received this as a sample from Influenster to try. I love Herbal Essence, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would purchase this one out of all the other choices. It wasn&#x27;t amazing smelling and didn&#x27;t seem to blow me out of the water with making my hair softer or less frizzy. For me it was just average ....not terrible but not amazing.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo Free from Influencer. It smells great. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get your hair clean. My hair was soft, clean &amp; shiny. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh smell and clean finishing feel!</li>
            <li> So I had my doubts that this line scented with Turkish figs and Cassia (a flower) would smell good. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! My first thought is that is smells like bubble gum, sweet and warm. It was a thick shampoo that lathered quickly. Will definitely use again! I receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  It isnt to harsh and has a nice smell.  I have been using it for a week now and I can say my hair is softer.  The ingredients are pretty straight forward.  It does what it says and so far it does it well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a simple man, I use any shampoo that the wife buys, so I have smelt plenty shampoos in the past. This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals has a strong fruit smell from the initial use, but subsides quickly. I personally like the smell and so does the wife. Shampoo feels good on the head, but not as good as the commercials show on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good shampoo, even better TV commercials!</li>
            <li> I love the feel, I love the smell... It just makes my hair feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing the name tells it all it made my hair feel amazing thanks to influenst era for sharing this with me 😘</li>
            <li> With a family of 4 we go through a lot of shampoo and so seeing this item come available on the Vine was a welcome thing. We&#x27;ve used this brand before and this version did not disappoint. I actually usually use Head and Shoulders but for a change it is nice to use something different and this shampoo smells good and cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo to review and test for free in my Influenster Vox Box. Honestly, I loved this shampoo it smelt amazing, lathered richly, and deeply moisturized my hair! I used the shampoo along with the Wild Naturals conditioner and oil elixir. The three Wild Naturals products complemented each other nicely and I felt that my hair was very moisturized after. I have very thick hair and I feel that a little shampoo went a long way when I lathered up. I would recommend this product and plan to continue using it myself!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo as a great cleanser for my natural hair (4c). I got it for review from influenster and  I must say I was surprised that it was a decent sample bottle for me to use and experiment with cleaning my hair. It was not drying to my hair and a little does go a long way, so a big bottle will definitely last awhile.</li>
