            <li>(You can use the search feature on my blog and search for &amp;#34;Azure Naturals&amp;#34; to find all the reviews).&lt;br /&gt;The Organic Vitamin C Moisturizer is a great moisturizer and really light weight</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a nice 1.7 ounce bottle which is so convenient with the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>all thoughts and or opinions are my own</li>
            <li>Very nice, goes on light.</li>
            <li>But the great part is that when I used to try the store toners and they would clean my face and get rid of the oil</li>
            <li>this comes in a nice sized pump bottle and is very easy to use .</li>
            <li>This is a light, pleasant smelling moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any real significant improvement to my skins since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>Azure Naturals was kind enough to send me some to review, and I must say that I am impressed!</li>

            <li>It is perfect for the mornings as it will leave your skin looking and feeling hydrated for the entire day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is another favorite of mine from Azure Naturals.</li>
            <li>Matter of fact, you don&#x27;t get faster results just because you apply more.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for better and better.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Love this wifi order again</li>

            <li>Azure Naturals always make high-quality skincare products that all come with a money-back guarantee so you know you will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This worked great for me because I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has a sweet citrus scent to it, and is nice and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>The scent is so nice and smells just like fresh oranges.</li>
            <li>This product smells wonderful, but I will give it a little more time to see if it does the job described.</li>
            <li>Make up application afterwards was easy and throughout the day my skin held in the moisture.</li>
            <li>Fighting the signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles is something I think we all want to do.</li>
            <li>I love when a company provides only the best and high quality ingredients rather than saturating it with chemicals that can be harmful or cause skin</li>
            <li>First thing I have to say is, you know your product is the best when it is backed by a  Risk Free One Year Unlimited Money Back Guarantee!</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t too light.</li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>

            <li>This product goes on lightly.  </li>

            <li>The product is beautifully formulated with Vitamin C, Organic Aloe, Green Tea ,Sweet Orange, and more.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its supposed to,the scent is great,i love it.</li>
            <li>Also, another thing I noticed has helped me is eating clean and drinking water.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin (or I used to) but living in Florida has caused me to develop some sun damage which in turn has made my skin tone extremely uneven.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li>I ordered the full line - for morning</li>

            <li>Try buying these individually and see how much more money it will cost.</li>
            <li>I am 56 and keep fit and young.</li>
            <li>I will most likely purchase this again.</li>

            <li>I use three of their products and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>face is a whole other story.</li>
            <li>there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and my skin sucked it right up.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way, and my skin sucked it right up.</li>
            <li> I also recommend ordering the cucumber eye product from the same company and putting it on your cheeks, eyes, and nose for dry climates.</li>
            <li> but they would also dry my skin out to the point of flaking.  </li>
            <li> The winter weather tends to dry out my skin and</li>
            <li> No new winkles.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to use this for a few days and see major changes.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and it is hard to hold moisture in.  </li>
            <li> I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone.</li>
            <li> Not only has this moisturized help plump and firm my skin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Damaged skin, dark circles, and uneven skin tone will soon seem like a distant nightmare.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit and apply to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Vitamin C products in the past and this one has to be one of the tops in my book.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to apply makeup over it as it does not have that nasty greasy residue that can be associated with other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually apply my makeup after my moisturizer application.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this moisturizer everyday!</li>
            <li> It also leaves behind no sticky or greasy residues.</li>

            <li> Damaged skin, dark circles, and uneven skin tone will soon seem like a distant nightmare. I have very fair skin (or I used to) but living in Florida has caused me to develop some sun damage which in turn has made my skin tone extremely uneven. I don&#x27;t mind not wearing makeup on my eyes but face is a whole other story. My complexion went from almost being nearly flawless to being blotchy and just sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Ultimate Vitamin C Sweet Orange Infused Organic Moisturizer has drastically improved my skin tone. Not only has this moisturized help plump and firm my skin but it has also helped make my skin tone improve. I have noticed that after using this moisturizer for a few weeks, some of my blotchiness has started to fade away and has left my skin looking more even and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer has a great consistency where it isn&#x27;t too heavy and it isn&#x27;t too light. It has a fine enough consistency that it absorbs into the skin quickly rather than just sitting on the surface of the skin. It also leaves behind no sticky or greasy residues. This moisturizer has left my skin looking radiant and smooth after every application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I particularly like about this product and company is that it is paraben free, gmo free, and uses all natural and organic ingredients. Another terrific thing is that it is cruelty free and is absolutely NEVER tested on animals. I love when a company provides only the best and high quality ingredients rather than saturating it with chemicals that can be harmful or cause skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this moisturizer day and night. It is perfect for the mornings as it will leave your skin looking and feeling hydrated for the entire day. It is also easy to apply makeup over it as it does not have that nasty greasy residue that can be associated with other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an outstanding moisturizer that will also improve your skin tone while keeping your skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.

            <li> Works really nicely and will no pill with other products . this one smells great and spa like . this comes in a nice sized pump bottle and is very easy to use . This one really evens out skin tone and is a fantastic buy</li>
            <li> First thing I have to say is, you know your product is the best when it is backed by a  Risk Free One Year Unlimited Money Back Guarantee! I heard about 30 days no one year...how awesome is that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another favorite of mine from Azure Naturals. I use three of their products and I have no regrets. The product is beautifully formulated with Vitamin C, Organic Aloe, Green Tea ,Sweet Orange, and more. I call their products the all-in-one pack. Try buying these individually and see how much more money it will cost. This is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This Sweet Orange Infused Vitamin C Moisturizer will leave your skin naturally radiant, healthier and younger looking. It is very light and therefore does not clog my pores. I use a little bit and apply to my face. I usually apply my makeup after my moisturizer application. It has a very pleasant and tolerable smell even for someone like me that has migraines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It last for months because I don&#x27;t need that much. Matter of fact, you don&#x27;t get faster results just because you apply more.  As it is stated in the descriptions, consistency is the key to see great results. Don&#x27;t expect to use this for a few days and see major changes. Also, another thing I noticed has helped me is eating clean and drinking water. When you combine all with this product you&#x27;ll get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li> I ordered the full line - for morning I use the Vitamin C toner, Vitamin C serum and Vitamin C moisturizer, plus the cucumber eye. in the evening I use the Vitamin C toner, Retinol serum and Retinol moisturizer plus the cucumber eye. I also purchased the Vitamin C cleanser but I haven&#x27;t been using it yet as I finish up another cleanser. there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products. I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone. I use a Clarisonic daily. there&#x27;s been no issue with irritation or dryness. My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully. My forehead lines appear to be smoothing out and my eye crinkles do as well. for the affordable price I am REALLY IMPRESSED. I will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this moisturizer! Azure Naturals was kind enough to send me some to review, and I must say that I am impressed! A little goes a long way, and my skin sucked it right up. Make up application afterwards was easy and throughout the day my skin held in the moisture. I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li> On my 2nd purchase so far I really like this cream. It smells wonderful and it hydrates and smooths. I am 56 and keep fit and young. I am always looking for better and better. This seems to help me do so so far. I plan to reorder again.</li>
            <li> This is a light, pleasant smelling moisturizer. It does a good job in moisturizing and plumping up the skin for a few hours. Its a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> So far this product is keeping my face and neck moisturized.  No new winkles.  I am satisfied.  I live in a dry climate and it is hard to hold moisture in.  I will most likely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love this wifi order again</li>
            <li> On my second bottle of this moisturizer.  Don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it hydrates just right.  Leaves my face soft, not greasy.  I use the&lt;br /&gt;gel cleanser, vitamin C serum and moisturizer.  It works well with my sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> Very nice, goes on light.</li>
            <li> Product has made my face look radiant!</li>
            <li> This product works okay. I haven&#x27;t seen any real significant improvement to my skins since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> This product goes on lightly.  It&#x27;s only been three weeks, but I feel it&#x27;s helping my much ignored skin already.</li>
            <li> Green Tea, Orange and Aloe all combine with Vitamin C to make this awesome moisturizer.  Azure Naturals always make high-quality skincare products that all come with a money-back guarantee so you know you will be satisfied.  This moisturizer has a sweet citrus scent to it, and is nice and lightweight.  It goes on smoothly and leaves no residue, just freshness and toned skin.  Be gone early signs of aging!  I would suggest combining this product with other Azure Naturals products in order to really obtain the ultimate effects :)  This worked great for me because I have really oily skin and it is specifically made to eliminate that oil.  But the great part is that when I used to try the store toners and they would clean my face and get rid of the oil but they would also dry my skin out to the point of flaking.  I highly recommend this and any other Azure Naturals product to help achieve the beautiful skin you deserve!  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> I have been loving this Organic Vitamin C Moisturizer that Azure Naturals sent me to test out and review for them along with their entire line of Ultimate Vitamin C products!  They are all fantastic products and I highly recommend them so make sure to read all of my other reviews. (You can use the search feature on my blog and search for &amp;#34;Azure Naturals&amp;#34; to find all the reviews).&lt;br /&gt;The Organic Vitamin C Moisturizer is a great moisturizer and really light weight so it&#x27;s perfect for both a morning &amp; evening skincare routine.  Not only does the Organic Vitamin C Moisturizer keep your skin well hydrated it helps diminish those fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots, as well as give you a tighter and more toned complexion.  I love the way my skin has been looking using all these great Vitamin C products from Azure Naturals!</li>
            <li> This is a really great moisturizer from Azure Naturals. I really like that their products are organic and all natural. They are really good for your skin and for your body. Vitamin C is good for your skin. Using this moisturizer has given my skin a healthy glow and has left my skin moist. The winter weather tends to dry out my skin and this moisturizer holds in the moisture in my face and keeps it from drying out. Another plus is that this moisturizer smells amazing! I look forward to using this moisturizer everyday!</li>
            <li> Good, smells like orange</li>
            <li> I love the smell, this feels really great on my skin and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful, but I will give it a little more time to see if it does the job described.</li>
            <li> Fighting the signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles is something I think we all want to do. I&#x27;ve tried a few Vitamin C products in the past and this one has to be one of the tops in my book.  This is a nice 1.7 ounce bottle which is so convenient with the pump dispenser.The scent is so nice and smells just like fresh oranges. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming but just right to me.The cream goes on smoothly and really absorbs fast. It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or oily feeling on my skin at all. I like how it makes my skin feel very soft and smooth and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> ***Disclaimer**** I received this product for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was not compensated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love azure naturals products,i have a few now and have loved them all,including this moisturizer.It does exactly what its supposed to,the scent is great,i love it.It smells like oranges,citrus wakes you up and smells nice,it moisturizes well.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product along with the cleanser and toner is fantastic. My skin looks young, fresh and blemish free. I also recommend ordering the cucumber eye product from the same company and putting it on your cheeks, eyes, and nose for dry climates. The moisturizer was not enough until I started doing this. They all feel so light like I am not using anything. I had a blemish for about a week before I got this product. It cleared up in two days. Amazing.</li>
