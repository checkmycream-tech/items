            <li>It is by far the BEST of the BEST pre-shave product on the market.</li>
            <li>always keep 5 o 6 bars at one time in stock, because I know it&#x27;s too good</li>
            <li>The price is good but the shipping and handling makes up for what you save.</li>

            <li>Everything works good.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product when using it with my Remington foil razor</li>
            <li>It was wonderful finding it and at a reasonable price with good response time.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it behaves a lot like talcum powder, which means you end up with powder all over your shirt or counter after using, and it isn&#x27;t especially easy to clean out of an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I already rated this product but we are very pleased to have it available.</li>
            <li>Remington Face Saver Pre-shave is excellent at preventing those red bumps that electric razors cause on your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I have used FaceSaver Powderstick for shaving for many, many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using these sticks for many years</li>
            <li>Was able to purchase on line with no problem.</li>
            <li>It really makes shaving a joy, and not a chore, I just love using it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times and every time I do the smell</li>
            <li>What used to be a pleasant experience first thing in the morning has turned into a trial.  </li>
            <li>I just rinse my foil heads under warm water and they look clean.  </li>
            <li>You can use this with any type of electric, not just Remingtons, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean out, just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush.  </li>
            <li>The powder makes shaving much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for men with sensitive skin.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>If you use a electric shaver, you will enjoy the smooth shave using this powder stick!</li>
            <li>This product is exceptional with my electric razor it makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, is not greasy</li>
            <li>it touches your face skin it pulverizes again and remains in the skin as a fine lawyer of talc-like powder.</li>
            <li>so thank goodness that AMAZON.COM had it available.  </li>
            <li>Applying the powder should be done with a light touch across your stubble.</li>
            <li>and they do a great job of helping to keep your face from getting razor burn from daily shaving.  </li>
            <li>Really fantastic, but......    </li>
            <li>It allows a smooth shave without rashes, burns, or pimples.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff that my husband uses daily.  </li>
            <li>this shave stick - and so far this stick provides the most comfortable and close shave.     </li>
            <li>Face Saver not only helps the razor glide more easily, it helps get those hairs on your neck that just won&#x27;t stand up so they can get</li>
            <li>I purchased several of them and it is burn free rash free, and easy to apply you do not have to use your fingers</li>
            <li>My beard hairs are curly and require multiple cycles of shaving with an electric trimmer to get  an even and nice cut.</li>
            <li>This product makes an electric shaver worth having.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s basically paraffin powder, it doesn&#x27;t rinse out easily, you pretty much have to thoroughly brush out your razor periodically.</li>
            <li>A quick application before shaving each morning gets me a close, consistent shave.</li>
            <li>It is essentially just parafin and talc -- I very much wish they would stop adding perfume -- so it should be inoffensive to even the most allergic users.  </li>
            <li>Of course if you press the electric shaver to much it will burn your skin! &lt;</li>
            <li>Main ingredient is parafin, a petroleum destilate grounded to a very fine powder and molded thru extrusion into a solid bar.  </li>
            <li>However, I found that it really does make a difference--</li>
            <li>The caregiver at my companion&#x27;s board and care assisted living facility uses this as requested by my companion and it really works well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving electric with this face saver makes a real difference.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>so this really makes a difference for me.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling this stuff is really meant to be applied to your head.</li>
            <li>The increase of &#x27;parfum&#x27; is too much and just</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with rotary and foil shavers - works very well with both, and clean-up is a snap.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t press too hard - it will push the powder back into the box, and isn&#x27;t as effective at transferring the powder to your face as a light rub.    </li>
            <li>Of course, it also works well enough for a quick shave without a washed face, but just not as close.</li>
            <li>Unlike one reviewer, I don&#x27;t find the scent objectionable (but I&#x27;ve never used the older version</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless this is a high quality product (Made in Switzerland)</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It makes dry shaving extremely smooth, as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess.  </li>
            <li>I was revolted when I tried the new ones with the white/red/blue cap.  </li>
            <li>Using this stick for a shave after a shower, or at least washing and drying your face, seems to work best - the shave is closer than shaving before a shower (at least in my case).</li>
            <li>another reviewer says, the powdery waste easily dumps out of the cutter head - no brushing</li>
            <li>Since I first reviewed this product back in March, I finally found one without the intense smell.  </li>
            <li>The company I bought it from was easy to order from and they got it delivered two days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>you can hardly find it in many stores.</li>
            <li>The description of the product clearly states Pack of 6, which I thought meant six sticks.</li>
            <li>The scent does not bother me and I am sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The price was a little higher than I had been paying, but considering I only use 1 or 2 a year, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>When I can find it in the store it was fine, but from Amazon it was money down the drain!!</li>
            <li>This is a variation of the classic pre-shave lotion, but in solid form.</li>
            <li>No other way to shave, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my neck and chin, which are the areas that are the most difficult to shave.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is it will fall out of it&#x27;s holder and break if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>

            <li> I can only use an electric shaver due to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The small size of the stick is also very convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down.  </li>
            <li> Tried other dry methods and they do not work nearly as well as this product.</li>
            <li> When I got a new Remington electric razor a few years ago a package of Remington FaceSaver came with it.</li>
            <li> Price on Amazon was far less than what i would pay in the store.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is it&#x27;s a little messy, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> And the stick lasts a long time, so the cost per use makes sense.</li>
            <li> Waste of money as far as I concerned.</li>
            <li> I shave every other day, and am less than half way through my first stick after 3 months.</li>
            <li> It does help with dry shaving, and lasts a long time.    </li>
            <li> Use it dry before showering and you won&#x27;t have any &#x27;burn&#x27; or rash.</li>
            <li> (in fact it&#x27;s dry) and because it&#x27;s talc, it lubricates and protects the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried 5 different pre-shave methods - a wet shave with cream, a wet shave without cream, a dry shave with foam, a dry shave without foam, and dry shave</li>
            <li> However this was not the case, plus it makes a big mess.</li>
            <li> Not much to review.</li>
            <li> I recommend shaving one last time with a razer then use your electric shaver with face saver everyday for a week while your face hair adjusts (it&#x27;ll get softer over that week).    </li>
            <li> Although the stick looks small, it seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> Not able to find it locally, I appreciate finding it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is hard to find, when I do I usually buy several.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used FaceSaver for at least ten years.</li>
            <li> hunt this stuff down.</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent, which is not altogether unpleasant.    </li>
            <li> stays with me half the day.  </li>
            <li> This thing is messy and does not seem to improve shaving comfort and clugs both cutters and screen.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a few years.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago I began using some nasal spray to help with some bronchitis</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the value of Remington&#x27;s pre-shave talc stick, especially given the price.</li>
            <li> and no more noseplugs.</li>
            <li> I usually bought it at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> Now it is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> I hated my electric razer for years until buying face saver and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It came dried out and just fell apart when opened!!!</li>
            <li> The powder forms a thin layer on the skin that allows the shaver to move a lot easier across the face while shaving.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base.  </li>
            <li> that is why is rather on the expensive side, but it certanly delivers 100% on its intended use and purpose.  </li>
            <li> This is false advertising!</li>
            <li> This is false advertising!</li>
            <li> stinks - imho.  </li>
            <li> If you are sealing 1 sick and not a pack of 6</li>
            <li> I hate the smell.  </li>
            <li> use this as a base of sorts before I shave, makes for a smoother shave.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Remington FaceSaver for several years, ever since I switched to an electric shaver. The powder makes shaving much more comfortable. The only down side is it&#x27;s a little messy, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Face Saver for almost 20 years and swear by it.  A quick application before shaving each morning gets me a close, consistent shave.</li>
            <li> Remington Face Saver Pre-shave is excellent at preventing those red bumps that electric razors cause on your face and neck.  One stick lasts several weeks, so it&#x27;s inexpensive and makes your shave even smoother.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for men with sensitive skin.[[ASIN:B002J0N7IG Remington SP5 SP-5 Face Saver Talc Powder Stick]]</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the value of Remington&#x27;s pre-shave talc stick, especially given the price. However, I found that it really does make a difference--I&#x27;ve had my best shaves ever from an electric razor since I started using this product. I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s allowed me to get a shave comparable to a blade shave with all of the convenience of an electric. And the stick lasts a long time, so the cost per use makes sense.</li>
            <li> Not much to review. I&#x27;ve used FaceSaver for at least ten years. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer so I went online.   The price was a little higher than I had been paying, but considering I only use 1 or 2 a year, it&#x27;s worth it. I can&#x27;t stand lather &amp; water any longer.   The company I bought it from was easy to order from and they got it delivered two days earlier than expected. I&#x27;m very happy with the vendor.</li>
            <li> The caregiver at my companion&#x27;s board and care assisted living facility uses this as requested by my companion and it really works well!&lt;br /&gt;We could not find it anywhere in town so thank goodness that AMAZON.COM had it available.  Thank you, Amazon!  We appreciate you.</li>
            <li> This is a find! No local stores carry this product! If you use a electric shaver, you will enjoy the smooth shave using this powder stick! Try it, you will like it!</li>
            <li> The stick contains condensed powder which you apply to your face before an electric shave. It has a mild scent, which is not altogether unpleasant.    I tried 5 different pre-shave methods - a wet shave with cream, a wet shave without cream, a dry shave with foam, a dry shave without foam, and dry shave this shave stick - and so far this stick provides the most comfortable and close shave.     Using this stick for a shave after a shower, or at least washing and drying your face, seems to work best - the shave is closer than shaving before a shower (at least in my case). Of course, it also works well enough for a quick shave without a washed face, but just not as close. Applying the powder should be done with a light touch across your stubble. Circular motions work well. Don&#x27;t press too hard - it will push the powder back into the box, and isn&#x27;t as effective at transferring the powder to your face as a light rub.    The small size of the stick is also very convenient for traveling. Although the stick looks small, it seems to last forever. I shave every other day, and am less than half way through my first stick after 3 months.</li>
            <li> My regular supplier for this product (Wal-Mart) is no longer carrying it in our area. It was wonderful finding it and at a reasonable price with good response time.</li>
            <li> This thing is messy and does not seem to improve shaving comfort and clugs both cutters and screen. Waste of money as far as I concerned.</li>
            <li> This is a variation of the classic pre-shave lotion, but in solid form. Main ingredient is parafin, a petroleum destilate grounded to a very fine powder and molded thru extrusion into a solid bar.  &lt;br /&gt;Once it touches your face skin it pulverizes again and remains in the skin as a fine lawyer of talc-like powder. &lt;br /&gt;Contrary to apparences it lubricates the skin almost flawlessly. Of course if you press the electric shaver to much it will burn your skin! &lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless this is a high quality product (Made in Switzerland) that is why is rather on the expensive side, but it certanly delivers 100% on its intended use and purpose.  &lt;br /&gt;I always keep 5 o 6 bars at one time in stock, because I know it&#x27;s too good a product before it substituted by a chinese cheaper import.</li>
            <li> The price is good but the shipping and handling makes up for what you save.</li>
            <li> I have used FaceSaver Powderstick for shaving for many, many years. It sets up my face for the electric shaver and for very pleasant electric shaving. Not able to find it locally, I appreciate finding it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I can only use an electric shaver due to my sensitive skin.  The powder forms a thin layer on the skin that allows the shaver to move a lot easier across the face while shaving.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me an electric razor. With this razor she picked up Facesaver pre-  shave and I have not looked back.  This product is exceptional with my electric razor it makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> I order 1: \\&quot;Remington SP-5 Pre-Shave Talc Stick Face saver for all Men&#x27;s Shavers (pack of 6)\\&quot;.  From the title it stats \\&quot;(Pack of 6)\\&quot;.  When I got in my order in the mail I received 1 stick not 6.  If you are sealing 1 sick and not a pack of 6 the title should eliminate \\&quot;(pack of 6)\\&quot; since it is contradicting to what the customer gets!</li>
            <li> This description states it is a package of 6.  However, when received there is only 1 item in the packaging.  This is false advertising!</li>
            <li> This description states it is a package of 6. However, when received there is only 1 item in the packaging. This is false advertising!</li>
            <li> Shaving electric with this face saver makes a real difference.  I get it done way faster and it seems to help with the closer shave.  Price on Amazon was far less than what i would pay in the store.  One stick lasts forever.  I have very oily skin so this really makes a difference for me.  I&#x27;ve purchased twice and will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> The items came in a timely fashion and just what I wanted. Our local Wal-Mart quit carring it.  remington face saver</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference with this stuff. My beard hairs are curly and require multiple cycles of shaving with an electric trimmer to get  an even and nice cut. I was hoping that the FaceSaver would help the beard hairs stand-up making only one or two passes necessary. However this was not the case, plus it makes a big mess. I have a feeling this stuff is really meant to be applied to your head.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, have been using it for years. Tried other dry methods and they do not work nearly as well as this product.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my heavy beard.  It is a great aid to a close shave.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product when using it with my Remington foil razor</li>
            <li> I have been using these sticks for many years and they do a great job of helping to keep your face from getting razor burn from daily shaving.  Really fantastic, but......    Remington decided to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; the scent.  I was revolted when I tried the new ones with the white/red/blue cap.  The increase of &#x27;parfum&#x27; is too much and just stinks - imho.  What used to be a pleasant experience first thing in the morning has turned into a trial.  I keep thinking I&#x27;ll get used to it but I never have.  Hmmm.....maybe noseplugs.    I would not recommend buying these in bulk, (as I used to do) until you&#x27;ve tried one to see if you can handle the smell.      Since I first reviewed this product back in March, I finally found one without the intense smell.  It&#x27;s called Derma Bloc Pre Shave Powder Stick.  It&#x27;s also sold by a great company - Shavetronics, which you can order thru Amazon.  It&#x27;s great! - and no more noseplugs.</li>
            <li> The title of this ad says (PACK OF 6) but I only received one, not six!    This item&#x27;s description needs to be changed.</li>
            <li> The description of the product clearly states Pack of 6, which I thought meant six sticks. I was sent one stick. I could not find a way to notify Amazon or Target of this discrepancy when my shipment arrived. There is a wall between the suppliers and the customers.</li>
            <li> This is the only non alcohol based preshave I could find, It works well. The only problem I have is it will fall out of it&#x27;s holder and break if you&#x27;re not careful. Then it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to keep it in there.</li>
            <li> Works great - not a hint of razor burn or irritation. I use it mainly on my neck and chin, which are the areas that are the most difficult to shave. Face Saver not only helps the razor glide more easily, it helps get those hairs on your neck that just won&#x27;t stand up so they can get clipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with rotary and foil shavers - works very well with both, and clean-up is a snap. Unlike one reviewer, I don&#x27;t find the scent objectionable (but I&#x27;ve never used the older version so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to). In fact, I think it smells rather nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave with an electric shaver, you simply have got to give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find this in the store.  Was able to purchase on line with no problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased several of them and it is burn free rash free, and easy to apply you do not have to use your fingers etc to apply it, and one sticks LASTS AND LASTS.  It really makes shaving a joy, and not a chore, I just love using it and you will too.  It is by far the BEST of the BEST pre-shave product on the market.</li>
            <li> After trying many pre-shaving products I found this to be the best one. The only problem is that it is hard to find, when I do I usually buy several.</li>
            <li> I use Face saver with every shave and it works great.  Use it dry before showering and you won&#x27;t have any &#x27;burn&#x27; or rash.</li>
            <li> Using a product like Williams Lectric Shave leaves the skin oily or greasy. This talc is great. It goes on easy, is not greasy (in fact it&#x27;s dry) and because it&#x27;s talc, it lubricates and protects the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy several at a time so I never run out.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a few years.  Now it is getting hard to find. I usually bought it at Walmart.  They quit carrying it.  Now I purchased 3 from Amazon.  All in good shape.  One probably lasts me about a year.  I used it with my Norelco Arcitec 1090.  Now I have a Braun 790cc.  Everything works good.  I just rinse my foil heads under warm water and they look clean.  Once every three days, into the auto cleaner.  The scent does not bother me and I am sensitive.  A few years ago I began using some nasal spray to help with some bronchitis I got and it seems to have diminished my smelling though.  C&#x27;et La Vie.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use my electric shaver without this item... I&#x27;ll try different shavers but will not give up this product.</li>
            <li> This is a paraffin based product that basically spreads powder over your face.  It does help with dry shaving, and lasts a long time.    It also REEKS.  If you do not like perfumes and colognes like me, do not get this.  I hate the smell.  I&#x27;ve used it many times and every time I do the smell stays with me half the day.  YUCK.  Why they are adding perfume to this product?    Furthermore, it behaves a lot like talcum powder, which means you end up with powder all over your shirt or counter after using, and it isn&#x27;t especially easy to clean out of an electric razor.  Since it&#x27;s basically paraffin powder, it doesn&#x27;t rinse out easily, you pretty much have to thoroughly brush out your razor periodically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to shave infrequently with a blade, or else use a clipper, leaving stubble, in order to avoid breaking out.  FaceSaver changed that.  It is essentially just parafin and talc -- I very much wish they would stop adding perfume -- so it should be inoffensive to even the most allergic users.  It allows a smooth shave without rashes, burns, or pimples.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The only stick I use!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down.  As other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base.  It makes dry shaving extremely smooth, as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess.  You can use this with any type of electric, not just Remingtons, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean out, just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The Advertising states \\&quot;Pack of 6) but I only received one (1) item.  The Advertising is misleading.[[ASIN:B005DCTACO Remington SP-5 Pre-Shave Face Saver Talc Stick]]</li>
            <li> It came dried out and just fell apart when opened!!! Never again!!! When I can find it in the store it was fine, but from Amazon it was money down the drain!!</li>
            <li> When I got a new Remington electric razor a few years ago a package of Remington FaceSaver came with it. I used it until it ran out then started with the liquids like Lectric Shave. They never worked as well.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is a talc, which dries that clingy bit of moisture on your skin, plus paraffin, which with the talc lets the head glide over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer says, the powdery waste easily dumps out of the cutter head - no brushing required.&lt;br /&gt;I hunt this stuff down. No other way to shave, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product makes an electric shaver worth having. It smooths the shaving experience and prevents razer burn. If you buy it I recommend shaving one last time with a razer then use your electric shaver with face saver everyday for a week while your face hair adjusts (it&#x27;ll get softer over that week).    I hated my electric razer for years until buying face saver and recommend it highly. Shame you can hardly find it in many stores. One stick lasts years though.</li>
            <li> I noticed my barber used this when he shaved my face and head. However he charged an extra fee for its use.&lt;br /&gt;Went to Amazon....problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a base of sorts before I shave, makes for a smoother shave. Good product.</li>
            <li> The description states it is a package of 6. However, when received there is only 1 item in the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I will be disputing the charge .&lt;br /&gt; I will return for credit.&lt;br /&gt;Received on Jan. 26, 2013</li>
            <li> Great stuff that my husband uses daily.  I already rated this product but we are very pleased to have it available.</li>
