            <li>that&#x27;s not the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best quality like Ken pave, but I just don&#x27;t want to pay for something I already had paid a lot for before, so this will make do.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>a great change from beach hair to everning hair!</li>
            <li>Product is beautiful, can&#x27;t fault the item.</li>
            <li>Beautiful extension</li>
            <li>and it was over 30 bucks, but I accidently threw it away and looked for a cheaper one online since I&#x27;ve gotten Great heap clipons and wefts on amazon for 1/2 the price of Ken Pave and HairDo.  </li>
            <li>bought based off of good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a good hairpiece.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Still a nice item.</li>
            <li>Item pictured has two ribbons with which to tie the pony tail around your own, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll still need to find a way to wrap it around your own hair/</li>
            <li>I tried everything to keep this taaaaaail on my own pony tail.</li>
            <li>This price is nice.</li>
            <li>It is nice, it&#x27;s a quality thing.  </li>
            <li>The quality is great and the color is rich.</li>
            <li>This matches great with my hair color and looks so real!</li>
            <li>so you have to get creative on how to attach it.  </li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>Okay so I owned the Ken Pave&#x27;s pony tail just like this</li>
            <li>I really love it for the price</li>
            <li>Friends helped and it looked 100% better than I did it.</li>
            <li>My daughter couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>It did such a great job !</li>
            <li>I love wearing it</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;i loved the color and the style so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It tangled easily and when you comb it out, it &#x27;ll fall out in clumps.</li>
            <li>I can easily fix it, but you have to play around to fix it..</li>
            <li>Also it tangles easy and the hair falls off a lot.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to maintain</li>
            <li>it tangles o so easily, so i have turned it into a permanent over-sized bun.</li>
            <li>This came in and was very pretty, I love the color and the look of the hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put in and is a quick way to add length to your hair.  </li>
            <li>u can use it so many different ways I love putting it in a cute bun</li>
            <li>The hair and wave is Gorgeous, but it&#x27;s the actual poney tail part</li>
            <li>Although I wish that this had hair wrapping around it instead of the ribbon, for my fine hair this worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>ponytail is very pretty..</li>
            <li>Its fun</li>
            <li>The clip used to keep the hair in place broke off right away.</li>
            <li>It was easy to put on, and it will hide your own little ponytail while its growing out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Potential purchasers should be forewarned that what they receive may or may not resemble exactly the product shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>First of all, there is no ribbon as depicted.</li>
            <li>but i doesn&#x27;t have many clippers ,only one :</li>
            <li>for my job thank you so much !</li>
            <li>If you find the right color match it will look realistic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price though if you want to try a new look.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it to wear as part of a 70&#x27;s costume, but loved it so much that I wear it regularly and actually purchased a 2nd!</li>
            <li>but it looks like the real hair.</li>
            <li>clips on well and had no problem wearing it for the whole evening..</li>
            <li>my real hair easier.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s short above the shoulders, what kind of ponytail is that.  </li>
            <li>the only thing is that I ordered dark brown but it looks more like a light or medium brown&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it full on stars is the clip it comes with.</li>
            <li>The product didnt come with a ribbon like in the pics it honestly doesnt look like the pics, it wouldve been nicer if it did :/</li>
            <li>I really like this one easy to wear long soft curls..</li>
            <li>It is ideal for costume or use for a few times, but its not something that will last long.</li>
            <li>I think we&#x27;re supposed to hook the clip above and down into our ponytail holder/rubber band thing of our own, and then take the separate lock on the elastic bit to wind around our ponytail, so it hides the clip and the rubber band.</li>
            <li>Once you get this piece attached properly, it looks real, and very flattering.</li>
            <li>and it was completely diffrent from what u have in the picture.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several different hair pieces over the years and had yet to found one with red highlights/tones and this one does...not blonde as most.  </li>
            <li>alright for the first 3 times wearing it, then the hair started falling out in clumps and the clip came loose.</li>
            <li>The hair itself is okay,but there is nothing but a small pin to secure it.</li>
            <li>This hair (dark brown/redish in color) is fun to wear, i think b/c of the color it passes for</li>
            <li>The color chart is too small to really see the exact color.</li>
            <li>The hair looked realistic and I was hoping it would match the dark color of my natural color</li>
            <li>fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I received, much as a lot of other reviewers, was not what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>This dark brown is really closer to brown than a black/brown.</li>
            <li>If you have black hair, this has too much auburn in it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This dark brown is really closer to brown than a black/brown.</li>
            <li> If you have black hair, this has too much auburn in it.</li>
            <li> If your hair is colored, it may match, but I can&#x27;t imagine it matching any dark natural color.</li>
            <li> The ponytail is a little skimpy on content but the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; itself was soft and curly.  </li>
            <li> Not even close to the picture, says it&#x27;s long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product if you need long hair.  </li>
            <li> Mine has the clip in the middle of the net, and on one side, a lock of hair attached to a somewhat elastic black ribbon that&#x27;s just about an inch long, attached perpendicularly to the fall of the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But i love telling people its fake, so i don&#x27;t have a high standard for fake hair.</li>
            <li> What arrived had no ribbons, a green hair net (because green blends with all hair colors, right?--cut that right off) and a small, flimsy comb that could not hold the weight of the wig on my head.</li>
            <li> Slightly reddish/auburn tint to the brown hair, especially at the end or tip, blends well and stays put.</li>
            <li> It is still plenty thick enough but not overwhelmingly thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> hair is not a real one</li>
            <li> Regarding the last review here from mid-March 2013, mine also seems to be missing something.  </li>
            <li> The clips are not strong enough.</li>
            <li> The pictured item has black grosgrain ties on either side for attaching to a pony tail in addition to the single three-pronged comb (which is included).</li>
            <li> I ordered other hair pieces which stated it as &#x27;dark brown&#x27; and it matched.  </li>
            <li> Some \\&quot;dark browns\\&quot; work for black/brown hair, some don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, but this is way off color than my hair.  </li>
            <li> The picture that shows you how to do it seems to show a little black ribbon or something you can tie.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time.  </li>
            <li> The string for tying the hair is missing.</li>
            <li> It is just too heavy to.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> not dark brown and very fake</li>
            <li> It does get tangled, because it is synthetic hair and hair strand are too hard.</li>
            <li> it was a total disappointment the clips had being torn off whoever sold these is so mean</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just useless to me.</li>
            <li> Also, the comb is useless, as it is just dangling by a thread.</li>
            <li> I am so sad that they fool me.</li>
            <li> way to fake looking and shiny.</li>
            <li> Of course with longer fake hair</li>
            <li> but idk if they&#x27;ll let me. :(</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This came in and was very pretty, I love the color and the look of the hair. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it full on stars is the clip it comes with. It&#x27;s not secured to the piece and fell out after on use. I use bobby pins to hold it in place now and it still works.</li>
            <li> The ponytail is a little skimpy on content but the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; itself was soft and curly.  Color seemed a bit darker than I thought, but still a keeper!</li>
            <li> Product is beautiful, can&#x27;t fault the item. This dark brown is really closer to brown than a black/brown. If you have black hair, this has too much auburn in it. Still a nice item. Some \\&quot;dark browns\\&quot; work for black/brown hair, some don&#x27;t. This one tends to the lighter side. Will probably still wear it just for fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I received, much as a lot of other reviewers, was not what you see in the picture. The pictured item has black grosgrain ties on either side for attaching to a pony tail in addition to the single three-pronged comb (which is included). Mine has a hunk of hair and mini cap sticking out to the side, definitely not the item pictured. I will make it work somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potential purchasers should be forewarned that what they receive may or may not resemble exactly the product shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> It was reddish brown not dark brown and very fake looking</li>
            <li> Too heavy. hurt after an hour of wearing it.</li>
            <li> Not even close to the picture, says it&#x27;s long it&#x27;s short above the shoulders, what kind of ponytail is that.  Took 2 months to recieve after writing to inquiries to Amazon.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or time.  It is also a reddish brown.</li>
            <li> Item pictured has two ribbons with which to tie the pony tail around your own, which is what I wanted. What arrived had no ribbons, a green hair net (because green blends with all hair colors, right?--cut that right off) and a small, flimsy comb that could not hold the weight of the wig on my head.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a closure so you have to get creative on how to attach it.  Plus I thought I was buying brown but it has a lot of deep auburn and redish colors in it which my brown hair does not have.</li>
            <li> The string for tying the hair is missing. I had to find the string and sew it in. Take sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;The 45cm(~18in) is when is not curling. When it is curled, the length is too short. It does get tangled, because it is synthetic hair and hair strand are too hard.</li>
            <li> When I got this. It was nothing like the one in this photo. It also had no bow tie what so ever. The clip used to keep the hair in place broke off right away. Now it&#x27;s just useless to me.</li>
            <li> i like the quality of the hair but the comb that was connected to it broke after 1 use. i want to return it but idk if they&#x27;ll let me. :(</li>
            <li> The quality is great and the color is rich. It is just too heavy to. Attach to hair. The clips are not strong enough.</li>
            <li> If I could give it a 0, I would! First of all, there is no ribbon as depicted. Also, the comb is useless, as it is just dangling by a thread. You&#x27;ll still need to find a way to wrap it around your own hair/ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;It tangled easily and when you comb it out, it &#x27;ll fall out in clumps. No exagerration.&lt;br /&gt;I bought based off of good reviews. I don&#x27;t know which hair piece they received, but it couldn&#x27;t be the same one I received.</li>
            <li> its ok but i doesn&#x27;t have many clippers ,only one :(&lt;br /&gt;i loved the color and the style so much&lt;br /&gt;The hair is not a real one but it looks like the real hair.</li>
            <li> The hair itself is okay,but there is nothing but a small pin to secure it. I tried everything to keep this taaaaaail on my own pony tail. I am so sad that they fool me.</li>
            <li> it was a total disappointment the clips had being torn off whoever sold these is so mean and it was completely diffrent from what u have in the picture.</li>

            <li> Okay so I owned the Ken Pave&#x27;s pony tail just like this and it was over 30 bucks, but I accidently threw it away and looked for a cheaper one online since I&#x27;ve gotten Great heap clipons and wefts on amazon for 1/2 the price of Ken Pave and HairDo.  The hair and wave is Gorgeous, but it&#x27;s the actual poney tail part that&#x27;s not the best.  I can easily fix it, but you have to play around to fix it.. It&#x27;s not the best quality like Ken pave, but I just don&#x27;t want to pay for something I already had paid a lot for before, so this will make do.  It&#x27;s worth the price though if you want to try a new look.</li>
            <li> I really love it for the price it&#x27;s amazing u can use it so many different ways I love putting it in a cute bun</li>
            <li> alright for the first 3 times wearing it, then the hair started falling out in clumps and the clip came loose.</li>
            <li> Slightly reddish/auburn tint to the brown hair, especially at the end or tip, blends well and stays put. Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This price is nice. But it does not come with the strings that it shows on the picture. Also it tangles easy and the hair falls off a lot. It is ideal for costume or use for a few times, but its not something that will last long.</li>
            <li> The product didnt come with a ribbon like in the pics it honestly doesnt look like the pics, it wouldve been nicer if it did :/</li>
            <li> way to fake looking and shiny.</li>
            <li> Once you get this piece attached properly, it looks real, and very flattering. Hair does tend to tangle, and losing hair is inevitable when untangling.</li>
            <li> Although I wish that this had hair wrapping around it instead of the ribbon, for my fine hair this worked pretty well.  I just pinned ribbon underneath and then took some of the pony to wrap around it.  It is still plenty thick enough but not overwhelmingly thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> The hair looked realistic and I was hoping it would match the dark color of my natural color (I currently have highlights), however it has a red tint to it and wasn&#x27;t even close. If your hair is colored, it may match, but I can&#x27;t imagine it matching any dark natural color.</li>
            <li> It is nice, it&#x27;s a quality thing.  Regarding the last review here from mid-March 2013, mine also seems to be missing something.  The picture that shows you how to do it seems to show a little black ribbon or something you can tie.  Mine has the clip in the middle of the net, and on one side, a lock of hair attached to a somewhat elastic black ribbon that&#x27;s just about an inch long, attached perpendicularly to the fall of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I think we&#x27;re supposed to hook the clip above and down into our ponytail holder/rubber band thing of our own, and then take the separate lock on the elastic bit to wind around our ponytail, so it hides the clip and the rubber band.</li>
            <li> Beautiful extension but I didn&#x27;t even get to use it once because the hair started coming out in chunks immediately!!! Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a last minute item. Purchased at a local store and lost it the same day.  I ordered the product on Monday and received on Tuesday.  Very happy with the product. It&#x27;s comes with 3 hair clips and you slide it on the hair and pin it.  I not into hairstyling and needed help with it. Friends helped and it looked 100% better than I did it. I&#x27;d recommend this product if you need long hair.  My daughter couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> I really like this one easy to wear long soft curls..the only thing is that I ordered dark brown but it looks more like a light or medium brown&lt;br /&gt;but overall I do like this one.</li>
            <li> It did such a great job ! for my job thank you so much ! you made feel so gorgoues again!</li>
            <li> I am so upset with this product. This won&#x27;t clip in my hair. The picture looks different from the actual material. I just got mine today and it doesnt have the two things that hold the hair together. So disappointed. Just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is a good hairpiece. It was easy to put on, and it will hide your own little ponytail while its growing out. However, it can tangle and need to be handled with care since its synthetic. If you find the right color match it will look realistic. The color chart is too small to really see the exact color.</li>
            <li> This matches great with my hair color and looks so real! I love wearing it and it&#x27;s easy to maintain</li>
            <li> ponytail is very pretty..clips on well and had no problem wearing it for the whole evening..a great change from beach hair to everning hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several different hair pieces over the years and had yet to found one with red highlights/tones and this one does...not blonde as most.  It&#x27;s easy to put in and is a quick way to add length to your hair.  I originally purchased it to wear as part of a 70&#x27;s costume, but loved it so much that I wear it regularly and actually purchased a 2nd!</li>
            <li> This hair (dark brown/redish in color) is fun to wear, i think b/c of the color it passes for my real hair easier. But i love telling people its fake, so i don&#x27;t have a high standard for fake hair. Its fun a some what affordable. Of course with longer fake hair it tangles o so easily, so i have turned it into a permanent over-sized bun.</li>
