            <li>But Olay&#x27;s triple moisture body wash (I think that&#x27;s what its called) is amazing for moisturizing, and still smells great</li>

            <li>I love to use this for shaving, skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I have the body wash and the lotion.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>As much as I love it, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the summer time.</li>
            <li>So glad I can find this Olay body wash on Amazon, it&#x27;s my fav.</li>
            <li>Love all of Olay products.  </li>
            <li>I love this smell.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of most Olay products, and this body wash is just what I expected from Olay - GREAT!  </li>
            <li>I use it with the Aquasentials Exfoliating Sisal Cloth and I get a great lather in the shower and skin that is very soft after I am done.  </li>
            <li>smells great, makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li>It kind of smelled like a normal bar of soap, instead of the nicely scented bodywash I had picked up at the store.</li>
            <li>Olay Luscious Embrace Moisturizing Body Wash lathers up very nicely and smells so good and really makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Love the clean light scent</li>
            <li>Hands down the best body wash.</li>
            <li>This was is nice and creamy and smells great and rinses off well leaving me feel not only clean and fresh but moisturized.  </li>
            <li>the Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons</li>
            <li>Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz (Pack of 3).</li>
            <li>They work fabulously together.</li>
            <li>but this body wash leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth</li>
            <li>I picked this up at a store, simply because I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.</li>
            <li>it gives you a smooth clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Keep your showers clean or there will be a greasy film.  </li>
            <li>If you’re looking for a body wash that will leave you feeling “squeaky clean,” this isn’t it.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful; it’s very pleasant and soft, even for those of us that aren’t crazy about florals.</li>
            <li>i use mine for special occasion like when i have to see my boyfriend because he sticks his noes on me</li>
            <li>I also am a bit of a night owl, and am often showering in the wee hours of the morning; the Olay wash is great for times when, let’s be honest, you’re just too lazy to do the whole bath time rigmarole.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping to never have to contact amazon about a product but they resolved so quickly and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dry skin, so this product is good for me.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much more soft and silky after using this.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much more soft and silky after using this.</li>
            <li>but what doesn&#x27;t happen to often is a company that will make it right</li>
            <li>I like this bath wash because it is smooth and ok for dry skin but no residue and no grease.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that drys out easily</li>
            <li>Leaves you fresh, soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I have never been too picky when it comes to body washes, I&#x27;ll pretty much buy anything that is reasonably priced and smells feminine and clean.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s first couple of uses</li>
            <li>I tried this wash when it was first introduced by Olay and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Last but not least the scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very Moisturizing without leaving your skin feeling greasy and slimy after the shower.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the Olay Ribbons Body</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t like this body-wash AT ALL.</li>
            <li>After I shower you can smell it in the air with the mist, so it definitely makes you smell good, unlike some other body washes that leave nothing.</li>
            <li>This isn’t a huge deal because I take two baths a day, and I’m not out digging ditches, so I’m not generally too grubby.</li>
            <li>It both cleanses and mositurizes better than other products I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>The purple is better (more moisturizing) than the pink or green versions, in my experience.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is long lasting and fragrant but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>second complaint would be that it didn&#x27;t really moisturized as much as it just kind of sat on the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feel so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>The scent and the added moisture are a bit too much for me and makes me feel like I haven&#x27;t bathed properly.</li>
            <li>I washed, and rinsed REALLY well, and that didn&#x27;t seem to be enough.</li>
            <li>Something I really love about this is that a little bit goes a long way -</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s hard to clean off!</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling good and moisturized even through the cold winter days.</li>
            <li>All in all, this wash is nice occasionally, and I would repurchase it, but for me, it is too heavy for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It does leave a film on your loofa, as well as the tub; but it also leaves a very nice veil of moisture on your skin, so that aspect isn’t all bad.</li>
            <li>It leaves your body feeling soft and the smell last a long time.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and a little goes along way.  </li>

            <li> Very moisturizing and a little goes along way.  </li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , other body wash that I have tried that is meant to be hydrating leaves my skin dry and red.</li>
            <li> It also helps in the wintertime when the skin gets so dry.</li>
            <li> However, if you do have dry skin, then this might not be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that winter dry skin itch when I use this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to come by in a lot of stores, but it&#x27;s formula is thick, rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> I have hard water and that mixed with dry air makes for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> other negative review is correct, it will make your tub or shower very slick/greasy if you don&#x27;t wash your tub out after each use--especially if your shower drains slow or you take bubble baths with it.</li>
            <li> This conundrum leaves me with the choice of whether to deal with my hair, or apply lotion; my hair always wins out, and my skin suffers.</li>
            <li> The subject says it all.  </li>
            <li> I have long, curly, dry hair, and I have to get my products in it while it’s sopping wet; if my hair dries too much, it’s difficult to distribute my products through it.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the scent, however.</li>
            <li> Its not strong, but its body wash not perfume.  </li>
            <li> Usually I switch on and off between body washes</li>
            <li> I like to use this when I wash my hair, or when I’m too lazy to apply lotion.</li>
            <li> But this product has me addicted.</li>
            <li> The next day, my skin was sticky, and I hated it.</li>
            <li> This wash is moisturizing enough that when I wash my hair, skipping the step of applying a moisturizer doesn’t leave me with nasty, dry-skin consequences.</li>
            <li> So addicted in fact that I bought the lotion to match!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, when \\&quot;I bathe, I find that I do Not leave a dirty, bathtub ring!\\</li>
            <li> I purchase a batch every year for the cold months.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but once I got it soaped up in the loofa, the smell was NOTHING like it was in the bottle.</li>
            <li> and/or be disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I liked the way it smelled and it&#x27;s first couple of uses but then it made my tub feel waxy as well as my skin. So gross! And it&#x27;s hard to clean off!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  My skin feel so soft after using it.  It also helps in the wintertime when the skin gets so dry.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, very light and sexy.  Its not strong, but its body wash not perfume.  Leaves you fresh, soft and clean.</li>

            <li> I love this smell. I can&#x27;t get enough. Usually I switch on and off between body washes but I haven&#x27;t done that for months because of this smell. This stuff is also great for your skin! My skin feels much more soft and silky after using this. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of most Olay products, and this body wash is just what I expected from Olay - GREAT!  The smell is nice, but not overpowering.  I use it with the Aquasentials Exfoliating Sisal Cloth and I get a great lather in the shower and skin that is very soft after I am done.  I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I love to shower with this body wash.  It makes my skin feels so soft.  I feel clean and fresh! I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess, what, I updated my comments on 10/9/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use both the Dove Cr&amp;egrave;me Body Wash, Visible Care Toning, 18 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;with the Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons Soothing Cr&amp;egrave;me + Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz (Pack of 3). The experience was both revitalizing, invigorating and rejuvenating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when \\&quot;I bathe, I find that I do Not leave a dirty, bathtub ring!\\&quot; I&#x27;m sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly.  They work fabulously together.</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash!  It keeps my skin feeling good and moisturized even through the cold winter days. And the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great bodywash and has a nice creamy texture. It doesn&#x27;t leave any gross residue after you rinse it off. I am not a huge fan of the scent, however. I think the rose and cucumber varieties have a nicer smell.</li>
            <li> Olay products work well and this body wash does indeed leave you feeling moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Olay Luscious Embrace Moisturizing Body Wash lathers up very nicely and smells so good and really makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Was hoping to never have to contact amazon about a product but they resolved so quickly and effortlessly.  I feel confident in buying products from them.  Life happens shipping mistakes happen but what doesn&#x27;t happen to often is a company that will make it right and they did just that.  The product is great by the way, smells floral.  Very moisturizing and a little goes along way.  Keep your showers clean or there will be a greasy film.  I love to use this for shaving, skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have the body wash and the lotion. The smell is amazing. It leaves my skin feeling SO SOFT. It has a good lather as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other negative review is correct, it will make your tub or shower very slick/greasy if you don&#x27;t wash your tub out after each use--especially if your shower drains slow or you take bubble baths with it.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells amazing. After I shower you can smell it in the air with the mist, so it definitely makes you smell good, unlike some other body washes that leave nothing. I don&#x27;t have dry skin, so this product is good for me. However, if you do have dry skin, then this might not be what you&#x27;re looking for. But Olay&#x27;s triple moisture body wash (I think that&#x27;s what its called) is amazing for moisturizing, and still smells great (I wrote a review on it as well). That one makes your skin like silk practically.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite scent. It&#x27;s hard to come by in a lot of stores, but it&#x27;s formula is thick, rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> smells great, makes my skin feel soft and it goes a long way. Can use in shower or bath. love it</li>
            <li> I like this body wash quite a lot, in its place. If you’re looking for a body wash that will leave you feeling “squeaky clean,” this isn’t it. If you are covered in dirt and grime, this isn’t the wash you’ll be reaching for. For this reason, when I use this wash, I will pre-wash areas of my body with bar soap. This isn’t a huge deal because I take two baths a day, and I’m not out digging ditches, so I’m not generally too grubby. It does leave a film on your loofa, as well as the tub; but it also leaves a very nice veil of moisture on your skin, so that aspect isn’t all bad. I like to use this when I wash my hair, or when I’m too lazy to apply lotion. I have long, curly, dry hair, and I have to get my products in it while it’s sopping wet; if my hair dries too much, it’s difficult to distribute my products through it. I feel the same way about body lotion; if I don’t apply my lotion while my skin is still damp, it seems to just sit on the surface in a greasy film. This conundrum leaves me with the choice of whether to deal with my hair, or apply lotion; my hair always wins out, and my skin suffers. Enter the Olay Moisturizing Body Wash in Luscious Orchid, and my problem is solved. This wash is moisturizing enough that when I wash my hair, skipping the step of applying a moisturizer doesn’t leave me with nasty, dry-skin consequences. I also am a bit of a night owl, and am often showering in the wee hours of the morning; the Olay wash is great for times when, let’s be honest, you’re just too lazy to do the whole bath time rigmarole. The scent is wonderful; it’s very pleasant and soft, even for those of us that aren’t crazy about florals. All in all, this wash is nice occasionally, and I would repurchase it, but for me, it is too heavy for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I like this bath wash because it is smooth and ok for dry skin but no residue and no grease.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this body wash! I have never been too picky when it comes to body washes, I&#x27;ll pretty much buy anything that is reasonably priced and smells feminine and clean. But this product has me addicted. So addicted in fact that I bought the lotion to match! I love the smell, it is long lasting and fragrant but not overbearing. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Love the clean light scent</li>
            <li> I tried this wash when it was first introduced by Olay and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. It is wonderful! I purchase a batch every year for the cold months. The formula is perfect. Very Moisturizing without leaving your skin feeling greasy and slimy after the shower. The scent is a non-overpowering floral and has excellent staying power. I like to use an unscented lotion after I shower with this, because it smells that good! This is my go to body wash in the winter time. It keeps my skin moisturized and soft. I don&#x27;t have that winter dry skin itch when I use this. As much as I love it, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the summer time. The scent and the added moisture are a bit too much for me and makes me feel like I haven&#x27;t bathed properly. Otherwise a great buy. Go ahead.... try it. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best body wash. It moisturizes the skin beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I will only buy this body wash</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling body wash. My daughter loves it. Got this for her as part of a gift.</li>
            <li> I have hard water and that mixed with dry air makes for very dry skin. This body wash keeps my skin moisturized and it smells great!</li>
            <li> This is the best bodywash on the market. It leaves your body feeling soft and the smell last a long time. I would def. recomend this bodywash to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash- it has a nice smell and didn&#x27;t try out my skin- I would purchase again</li>
            <li> So glad I can find this Olay body wash on Amazon, it&#x27;s my fav.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore the Olay Ribbons Body Wash. I have sensitive skin that drys out easily but this body wash leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth, other body wash that I have tried that is meant to be hydrating leaves my skin dry and red. Something I really love about this is that a little bit goes a long way - just place a quarter size dollop on your puff and it will lather up nicely. Last but not least the scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li> The subject says it all.  If you do I promise you will not regrett and/or be disappointed.  Trust me it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at a store, simply because I&#x27;ve heard great things about it. This scent is the one I chose, cause it smelled good... Until I actually used it in the shower. Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but once I got it soaped up in the loofa, the smell was NOTHING like it was in the bottle. It kind of smelled like a normal bar of soap, instead of the nicely scented bodywash I had picked up at the store. I don&#x27;t know what changed from bottle to loofa, but something did.&lt;br /&gt;My second complaint would be that it didn&#x27;t really moisturized as much as it just kind of sat on the skin. I washed, and rinsed REALLY well, and that didn&#x27;t seem to be enough. I still felt like I had something on me. I figured it was just the fact that it was &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; and let it go. The next day, my skin was sticky, and I hated it. Really don&#x27;t like this body-wash AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Love all of Olay products.  This was is nice and creamy and smells great and rinses off well leaving me feel not only clean and fresh but moisturized.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. I can&#x27;t get enough. This stuff is also great for your skin! My skin feels much more soft and silky after using this.</li>
