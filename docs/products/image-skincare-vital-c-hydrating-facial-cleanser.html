            <li>I have rosacea and it&#x27;s very soothing!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product on my travels around the globe--even in hot sticky climates, and I still see that my skin loves it!</li>
            <li>Plus it keeps my skin calm.</li>

            <li>It barely lathers on my face.  </li>
            <li>so when I went back in for a facial, I purchased a bottle from the esthetician and that stuff worked like normal.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use the Image Vital C line as long as my skin likes it.</li>

            <li> This product by Image is great.  I always thought a harsh cleanser was the way to go but now I know  that a gentle cleanser is the best! I love the Image products!</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective skincare</li>
            <li> The best cleanser I have ever used and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Love...love...LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it at my daughter&#x27;s house when I visited and I fell in LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 50+++ and have sensitive skin and psoriasis.  This cleanser doesn&#x27;t irritate&lt;br /&gt;my skin and leaves it clean and smooth. LOVE the orange/citrus smell!&lt;br /&gt;This is my third bottle! Please AMAZON keep carrying it because we do not&lt;br /&gt;have a spa nearby that carries it!</li>
            <li> love this product!!!  pleasure doing business!!!</li>
            <li> great product, good smell, leaves your face soft and healthy</li>
            <li> Great item and good pricing. I use this item twice a day and it makes my face feel wonderful. I recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t take the moister out of my face. Plus it keeps my skin calm. So glad I can order this on Amazon because no one sells it anymore</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL!!!! Great product!!! I have rosacea and it&#x27;s very soothing!! Packaged well and very prompt!!!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser...best I have ever used.  Skin feels soft and very hydrated.  Great for very dry skin like I have</li>
            <li> Always use this in the summer. Excellent product. Great price,great seller.</li>
            <li> I swear, this not the same quality as the face wash purchased from my esthetician.  It barely lathers on my face.  I broke out something fierce when I started using the product purchased on Amazon so when I went back in for a facial, I purchased a bottle from the esthetician and that stuff worked like normal.  This is a great product but I think there&#x27;s something wrong with the stuff sold on Amazon and I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is amazing if you leave it on over night it will make your dry skin beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love it, make your skin feel soft &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> Just as expected...wonderful!</li>
            <li> This cleanser was recommend for redness &amp; mild rosesea.  My complexion has improved greatly in the years that I have been using.  I would rather not use anything else.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician started me using the Image line a few years ago and my skin is loving it--even at over 8,300 ft in altitude! At high altitudes, skin dries out faster than you can say \\&quot;lotion!\\&quot;  This cleanser removes foundation and even my Maybelline mascara without leaving my pores filled with goo or black smudges under my eyes. But, my skin feels soft to the touch and not at all dried out. I have used this product on my travels around the globe--even in hot sticky climates, and I still see that my skin loves it! I will continue to use the Image Vital C line as long as my skin likes it. Hey! At 60, when others tell me I look late 30s...I&#x27;ll take that as a complement that I&#x27;m doing something right.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this face wash and I love it. It was recommended by a estetician who gave me a facial and I really like it. Smells great and super creamy texture.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser and smells good.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff....I really like it, and my face is smoother, softer, more moist...all the time.</li>
            <li> AWSOME, hooked for good repeat buyer</li>
            <li> Love this product, best makeup remover and great price</li>
            <li> Refreshing and moisturizing.  Love the feel and vitamin c scent</li>
            <li> Leaves my face sparkling clean but soft.</li>
            <li> item as described, thanks!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this cleanser.  Meant to be used on skin without adding water, just rub into your face and then just washcloth it off.  I have normal/oily skin and I&#x27;m over 38 so this stuff rocks.  Always get compliments on my skin!</li>
            <li> This product irritated my post accutane skin. I wanted a cleanser that would help plump up my accutane induced damaged skin and this did the opposite. Never using it again</li>
            <li> Great price!  Nice lemon scent and cleanses well without making my face too dry. Would order again.</li>
            <li> Best product for skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product makes my face feel soft and reduces the redness</li>
            <li> Been using for awhile but buying at 2x the price elsewhere.  Wonderful scent and does amazing things to your skin. Does make your skin look less lines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is not counterfeit.....the distinctive Orange aroma is missing.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!  Very good buy &amp; have had compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li> Having been using this for a while. Love this! Nice fragrance</li>
            <li> This product is good for my dry sensitive skin by keeping it hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> i have rosacea this specific product line works best for me - i just use the cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
