            <li>Very dry, doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, tough to get a nice line without smudging</li>

            <li> Best eyeliner ever. Too bad Revlon keeps changing it. I can&#x27;t find this product anywhere so was very happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This pencil did not write. It was hard and dry. I cannot use it.</li>
            <li> Goes on very easy and stays there until I remove my makeup at night.  Great eyeliner</li>
            <li> Very dry, doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, tough to get a nice line without smudging</li>
            <li> Had some before.  This is just buying more of what I like.</li>
            <li> Want the color I was looking for</li>
            <li> Smudges very easy &amp; fades throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have aqua eyes and this medium brown makes them pop. The color stays on and on, yet the effect is soft rather than harsh. Love it.</li>
            <li> It amazes me that every site I go to looking for the top eyeliners has this one listed. I don&#x27;t understand why this is the bestselling one. It doesn&#x27;t stay at all. It lasts like five minutes and then fades. It&#x27;s easy to put on and it has a  perfect bold color, but it doesn&#x27;t stay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed in this purchase. Everyone raves about it, how it stays for so long, how it&#x27;s the longest lasting eyeliner they&#x27;ve ever tried - it&#x27;s crap! I had to re-apply it so often that I finally just gave up. Still looking for a long lasting eyeliner that&#x27;s not ridiculously expensive...</li>
            <li> Great product.  Stays on all day!  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> i ordered a brown eye liner and got a black/brown eye liner my mother is red headed and it does not look good on her i am a blonde and i do not use that color either i wear black blue or hunter green with blue eyes so my mom is green eyed so why would i be sent a black/brown eye liner and asked for a brown i already opened it so do not think i should send it back being opened</li>
            <li> Its been the best eyeliner. Doesn&#x27;t run and stays put. I&#x27;ve even used very expensive liners and this one is still the best</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years now. It is good for a dark outline without being too dark on m fair skin tone. It works great but does need a touch-up if wanting to go out on the town at night after wearing all day. Smooth and not sharp unless wanted so it doesn&#x27;t poke you in the eye, soft too unlike a pencil liner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for my eyebrows, this is the best. Will be purchasing this product more often in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I tried this out for what I thought was going to be a normal day- ended up being a very crazy day and then all-nighter.  Never needed to be touched up, never smudged or flaked.  It looked pretty much the same as when I washed it off as it did when I first put it on, and it&#x27;s a nice solid color. It survived sweat, tears and a blizzard so I have to say, I&#x27;m very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend for any occasion- especially if it needs to be water resistant.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day through 100 degree heat and sweat in a wet, unairconditioned industrial dish washing room. I tested it by sleeping in it and it stayed in place.</li>
