            <li>Perfect condition of product.</li>
            <li>shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li>Great item, makes the target area sweat.</li>
            <li>so happy I got it.</li>
            <li>Your better off getting Saran Wrap from the supermarket and the item took 28 days to get to me.</li>
            <li>Saran wrap would be a better purchase.</li>
            <li>but than again I haven&#x27;t used it that many times....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I would have been better off by using Saran Wrap, since it was supposed to wrap around your and stick to itself.  </li>
            <li>it would be better buying it from some where else because this person is seeling it for 3.99 and where I got it from  paid 1.79</li>
            <li>I realize the product was cheap and you get what you oau</li>
            <li>but this wasn&#x27;t even worth advertising</li>
            <li>It was not helpful really....</li>
            <li>It did not fit and I would have come out better by just wrapping a trash bag around my waist.</li>
            <li>A little small, but pretty good overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really haven&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s only size fort child.</li>

            <li> It did not fit, to small</li>
            <li> Please DO NOT Purchase.  It&#x27;s not worth the $2.00.  Invest the money into something else.  The material is like a shower curtain and it doesn&#x27;t have any closures (ie velcro, tape or button).</li>
            <li> Did not work for us.  sorry</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and plus I couldn&#x27;t read the information on the bag.&lt;br /&gt;So once again u get what u pay for...</li>
            <li> Writing is in a different language I think it&#x27;s a starter wrapping kit</li>
            <li> This was probably the worst product I ever purchased online. It did not fit and I would have come out better by just wrapping a trash bag around my waist. I realize the product was cheap and you get what you oau for but this wasn&#x27;t even worth advertising</li>
            <li> Arrive, instruction written in foreign language.  Plastic wrap-heavy grade junk.</li>
            <li> I like this. I usually wrap with plastic wrap but I can just put this on and it help me sweat when working out..</li>
            <li> Perfect condition of product.</li>
            <li> Great item, makes the target area sweat.</li>
            <li> Not worth it unless you are already a size 2 or below</li>
            <li> The plastic is very thin.</li>
            <li> No good. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> totaly scam, is a piece of pink plastic, no good!</li>
            <li> This did not fit my waste line so I could not use it</li>
            <li> I literally just got it out my mail box but I havent used it but im so happy I got it.</li>
            <li> it does not do the job</li>
            <li> Junk, don&#x27;t waist your time. Doesn&#x27;t even stick to itself.</li>
            <li> This item is a waste . Your better off getting Saran Wrap from the supermarket and the item took 28 days to get to me.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY! Saran wrap would be a better purchase.</li>
            <li> It did not come with instruction. I&#x27;m really haven&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s only size fort child.</li>
            <li> It was not helpful really....but than again I haven&#x27;t used it that many times....props to the color....</li>
            <li> This is just a sheet of plastic it does not have any type of fastener or Velcro or anything to hold the plastic under your body you might as well take a strip of cellophane and use that instead</li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t mean my needs n it gave me a rash</li>
            <li> This item has potential. It is thin and it really made me sweat. However, after about 3 uses, that was it. It didn&#x27;t stick anymore. There&#x27;s no velcro or anything so once the material gets wet, it loses that sticking ability.</li>
            <li> Sucked. Sizes not as advertized.</li>
            <li> Humm It&#x27;s ok nir fu nir fa</li>
            <li> Once yoy put the b crea mm  on it keep sliding off. It won&#x27;t stay at all dry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you get what you pay for.  This is just a plastic strip.  I would have been better off by using Saran Wrap, since it was supposed to wrap around your and stick to itself.  Needless to say, it did not!  :(</li>
            <li> could use house hold items instead</li>
            <li> well i just tried it today hoping to see results.  shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li> Its a strip of material for inflatable pool toys.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work and its different on other people and if you want to try it to see if it can workk on u it would be better buying it from some where else because this person is seeling it for 3.99 and where I got it from  paid 1.79</li>
