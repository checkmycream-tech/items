            <li>I kind of ignored the smell reviews because I figured it would fade, it does not.  </li>
            <li>Got it from my hairdresser as a sample; then bought my own.</li>
            <li>And really, the smell is the best part.</li>
            <li>I have combined this with their shampoo and am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li>Smells good, if you like the patcholie hippy kind of smell, but it for sure is not a detangler and builds up on your hair very easily.  </li>
            <li>Best detangler I&#x27;ve run across so far and has the most amazing smell!</li>
            <li>decent price but great effect!</li>

            <li>Earthy smell, light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The original scent smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the way it detangles my processed hair after I get out of the shower and the scent is nice and spicy without being over powering.</li>
            <li>but my daughter and I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Love love love this detangler!</li>

            <li>it smells super good .  </li>
            <li>The smell is incredible &amp; it leaves my hair feeling so soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;* All-natural, healthy ingredients</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this 4 times for my girlfriend, and she keeps asking for more...</li>
            <li>and if you go more than a day without washing your hair it gets greasy.</li>
            <li>She also sprayed a bit on her hands and worked it through the hair at the top of my head and no flyaways like</li>
            <li>Love the smell, too.</li>
            <li>Its more of a cream spray in now.</li>
            <li>OK, but not what the spouse was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but if I was too purchase it at the salon it can be upwards of more than 30$.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>

            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>It is waist length and wavy and has been feeling dryer and more unmanageable, probably as a result of aging and highlighting my hair.</li>

            <li>I received the product within a day of ordering, and am totally satisfied with it after one use.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair, and this has done great things for keeping it conditioned and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>#60;3 Tames al the frizzies &amp; makes my hair super soft w/ perfect curls.</li>
            <li>this leave in is so nice, and it leaves my hair soft and really smells great for hours!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited amazon prime sold this!</li>
            <li>Like to use it in between washing my hair for a defrizzer (new word)  Great product.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing for my dry and overprocessed hair.</li>
            <li>Love it, everything was fine</li>
            <li>Just three sprays through my tons of very fine, curly, easily snarled hair detangles and manages it while leaving it with a lovely light scent (original).</li>
            <li>Still works perfectly though I have to be careful not get a lot on my face because it can cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>I can have soft hair, without all the fly away....</li>
            <li>It will smooth the hair-no matter the humidity level, yet, doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down, produces a healthy shine, and has a very light, pleasant aroma!</li>
            <li>Smells great, and leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft</li>
            <li>* Lotion that squirts from a spray-top and is easy to apply&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>My hair tangles easily</li>
            <li>It does have a strong spicy-sweet scent</li>
            <li>Super quick delivery always helps!!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy and it really does help detangle!</li>
            <li>Can replace normal conditioner, or be a good supplement.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best hair product I think I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have looked for so long for a good detangler because none were quite amazing.</li>
            <li>really wish more hair products came either unscented or very lightly scented.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent (I got the original.)</li>
            <li>Got a huge deal from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Perfect stocking stuffer for my 3 young adult daughters.  </li>
            <li>with this, I&#x27;m just about tangle free.</li>
            <li>I have curly unruly hair and this leave in conditioner is light weight and helps with the frizz.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d come to enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>If your hair is wavy or tends toward frizziness, this product is a must before blow-drying, leaving your hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>they are totally smooth.</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t get enough of how great it smells.</li>
            <li>It smells, as my boyfriend told me, like heaven, and left my hair so conditioned and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff makes it tangle free.</li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t say that Marrakesh leave in treatment gets rid of all the frizz my hair is capable of, it is certainly better and more manageable.</li>
            <li>It smells incredible, and makes my hair so soft and manageable and absolutely helped with the damage.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled it, I loved it, but after I bought it and started using it on a semi-regular basis, the smell started to change to me and began smelling too much like incense or something smiliar...</li>
            <li>My hairdresser had originally given me a sample of this product, and now I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Originally I came across this at a beauty supply store but it was quite costly.</li>
            <li>Okay first I&#x27;ll describe my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is warm, woodsy, and has a hint of an undertone that is musky (I can&#x27;t place the actual scent) and stays lightly with you in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more....</li>
            <li>And this product works great all day long!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and last all day.  </li>
            <li>Right now I use Nexxus Therappe, and it has worked for me for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely fell in love with the scent and the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>It works really well to get rid of the static.</li>
            <li>Beware I love it so much I purchased the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is good for what it is,, but always start with a tiny bit,,to see how it does,,a</li>
            <li>Only good part was the smell.</li>
            <li>It is strong at first but dissipates as your hair dries.</li>
            <li>Just a few sprtiz after the shower and good to go!</li>
            <li>quickly without greasyness (and...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s super hydrating.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels, soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their hair texture.</li>
            <li>The other Marrakesh products are all really good and smell fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products to use on my natural curly hair!</li>
            <li>Not a true conditioning agent but does a great job as a spray conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I first got a bottle from my hairdresser, and now I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li>I smells so nice and makes my hair feel soft and certainly detangled.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>It really helps me detangle my locks after I shower and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and although this product has a distinct scent</li>
            <li>I love argan oil products, because they do make my hair soft ..</li>
            <li>and I rarely have issues running a pick through my locks.</li>
            <li>Just put a drop and work it through the knot and it slides right out.</li>
            <li>only downside is my boyfriend says its a very strong smell however it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to make my hair less frizzy and make it smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft, and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that makes my hair able to brush right after the shower.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, it detangles great, and it makes my hair so so soft and less frizzy and have less static.</li>
            <li>First product I have found that leaves my hair soft and smelling beautiful without making it greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Detangles very very well.</li>
            <li>I put it on mostly my ends after blow drying my hair to keep is from getting really staticky and to help bring a little more moisture to the ends.</li>
            <li>This product was first used on me by my stylist</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, works instantly and makes it easier to comb my hair as it detangles well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for any of your earthly needs!!</li>
            <li>Most definitely will be buying this again!!</li>
            <li>when you start using up the whole bottle!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair from getting oily for much longer than without use!  </li>
            <li>The price was incredibly reasonable!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>First I thought I ordered the serum in the pump but received this</li>
            <li>And although not many like the original scent, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair tangle-free, soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>One and only argan oil does a much better job for me.</li>
            <li>and they had ULTRA fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this product from Amazon from now on! :)</li>
            <li>I have used it only five or six times, so I will edit my review if my hair gets better.</li>
            <li>When it was dried I was so happy i was nearly running around yelling...</li>
            <li>You need very little of it as well so good value.</li>
            <li>I can smell it all day long :)</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and it tangles and tears, no matter how careful I am.  </li>
            <li>Love the way I can brush my fine, straight hair after washing with very little tugging and pulling when using this product.</li>
            <li>I had a major clean up job.  </li>
            <li>that I like but is certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li>I wish they made it in a large size.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, hair was dry and full of tangles.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves it silky smooth, detangled, and much easier to control, especially when the humidity is higher.</li>
            <li>As far as the leave-in conditioner/detangler part, it definitely does a great job as a detangler, and I don&#x27;t mind leaving it in my hair because it isn&#x27;t super heavy or greasy</li>
            <li>My 3 year old&#x27;s hair is very fine and gets tangled very easily and is very hard to brush out...</li>
            <li>My hair gets very tangled after I shower</li>
            <li>I like to put it on my hair wet (more than damp) and it makes it a lot easier to brush.</li>
            <li>I use the whole line.</li>
            <li>but it is much cheaper on here, so</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell you how it worked</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It work really well.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast .  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel silky and keeps it very shiny.</li>
            <li>Straight out the shower</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to keep the curl going from root to end.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter since she has really curly hair</li>
            <li>This works really well and helping to prevent some of those tangles.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 of them at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li>It smells yummy and makes my daughter&#x27;s hair much easier to brush.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to spread around in your hair either.</li>
            <li>My sister loves this product so much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, dries nicely</li>
            <li>But the original odor of this hair product actually made me gag!  </li>
            <li>Also not CG friendly, I&#x27;d missed the dimethacone when I initially looked at the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, long and defined curly hair that is color treated.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims, detangles your hair and leaves it shiny, soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>maybe I should use more quantities of this product though I am worried it might weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I adore this stuff, i could live in that scent!</li>
            <li>The scent is like an older hippy woman (You know..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I like this leave in because its not too heavy, its very light.</li>
            <li>I think they also have it in High Tide...</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly and makes my hair feel healthy, especially when I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>* Used as a leave-in conditioner, it helps smooth frizz and relax hair (a bit--not too much) without weighing it down</li>
            <li>My hairdresser will not be able to convert me back to any overpriced full of icky stuff products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>The bottom curly half is very dry and gets tangled SUPER easily.</li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is back to feeling more like silk and less like straw.</li>
            <li>In our family we have: Fine hair, medium hair and thick tangled hair; this works really well on all types of hair.</li>
            <li>only use a little or you&#x27;ll have greasy hair :)</li>
            <li>My hair stylist used this when I got my hair cut, and it made my hair so soft, even after she straightened.</li>
            <li>My hair was amazingly soft after using it.</li>
            <li>;  It feels soft too as well as silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable .</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and sorta tames my frizz.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>A note: I&#x27;m really sensitive to smell</li>
            <li>It also make my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>The dreamsicle scent smells like actual oranges, the original scent is described above, and I don&#x27;t care for the third scent</li>
            <li>I just spray it on my wet hair and comb right through.</li>
            <li>The smell is still divine, but the product is weaker and less effective in its watered down form.  </li>
            <li>You can also use it (very sparingly) on dry or damp morning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product after each shampoo, it&#x27;s the only thing that can detangle my hair, especially after too much time in pools and in salt water.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and there has been a big reduction in frizz.</li>
            <li>It did zip the first use as far as getting snarls out of my yard-long (or longer) thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have had the same routine since I first got my perm- take a shower, towel dry, use mousse to prevent frizz and hold curl.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any other leave in conditioner, I&#x27;ve gone through a few bottles and this remains my favorite.</li>
            <li>I really thinks this helps my hair from breaking when I&#x27;m combing it wet.</li>
            <li>When they changed the label they apparently also changed something about the formula.</li>
            <li>Have a mixed daughter and her hair is very unruly, this is the only product i&#x27;ve found that actually detangles her hair and lets me get a comb through it</li>
            <li>My stylist also used this product before using the flat iron and my hair was soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I actually found this at a spa and had to track it down on Amazon bc after I used up the first bottle I found I couldn&#x27;t like without it.</li>
            <li>However it is straight on the top half and loose big curls on the bottom, I&#x27;m guessing because it is so long and heavy.</li>
            <li>Makes my curly, dry hair feel really soft too!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly long hair.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I wondered if it made it a little more dry the next time I used it, unlike what the other reviewers said.</li>
            <li>This product detangles and gives a little extra conditioner to my fine hair, without getting greasy and doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick and heavy but each individual strand is very fine.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way,,especially if you use Hot tools,,,it</li>

            <li> Got it from my hairdresser as a sample; then bought my own.</li>
            <li> And really, the smell is the best part.</li>
            <li> I have combined this with their shampoo and am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, if you like the patcholie hippy kind of smell, but it for sure is not a detangler and builds up on your hair very easily.  </li>

            <li> The smell is incredible &amp; it leaves my hair feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;* All-natural, healthy ingredients</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this 4 times for my girlfriend, and she keeps asking for more...</li>
            <li> and if you go more than a day without washing your hair it gets greasy.</li>
            <li> She also sprayed a bit on her hands and worked it through the hair at the top of my head and no flyaways like</li>
            <li> Love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> Its more of a cream spray in now.</li>
            <li> OK, but not what the spouse was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but if I was too purchase it at the salon it can be upwards of more than 30$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell altho</li>

            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> It is waist length and wavy and has been feeling dryer and more unmanageable, probably as a result of aging and highlighting my hair.</li>

            <li> I received the product within a day of ordering, and am totally satisfied with it after one use.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair, and this has done great things for keeping it conditioned and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> #60;3 Tames al the frizzies &amp; makes my hair super soft w/ perfect curls.</li>
            <li> this leave in is so nice, and it leaves my hair soft and really smells great for hours!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited amazon prime sold this!</li>
            <li> Like to use it in between washing my hair for a defrizzer (new word)  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for my dry and overprocessed hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, everything was fine</li>
            <li> Just three sprays through my tons of very fine, curly, easily snarled hair detangles and manages it while leaving it with a lovely light scent (original).</li>
            <li> Still works perfectly though I have to be careful not get a lot on my face because it can cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I can have soft hair, without all the fly away....</li>
            <li> It will smooth the hair-no matter the humidity level, yet, doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down, produces a healthy shine, and has a very light, pleasant aroma!</li>
            <li> Smells great, and leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft</li>
            <li> * Lotion that squirts from a spray-top and is easy to apply&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it tangles easily.</li>
            <li> My hair tangles easily</li>
            <li> It does have a strong spicy-sweet scent</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery always helps!!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy and it really does help detangle!</li>
            <li> Can replace normal conditioner, or be a good supplement.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best hair product I think I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have looked for so long for a good detangler because none were quite amazing.</li>
            <li> really wish more hair products came either unscented or very lightly scented.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong scent (I got the original.)</li>
            <li> Got a huge deal from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfect stocking stuffer for my 3 young adult daughters.  </li>
            <li> with this, I&#x27;m just about tangle free.</li>
            <li> I have curly unruly hair and this leave in conditioner is light weight and helps with the frizz.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d come to enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> If your hair is wavy or tends toward frizziness, this product is a must before blow-drying, leaving your hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> they are totally smooth.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t get enough of how great it smells.</li>
            <li> It smells, as my boyfriend told me, like heaven, and left my hair so conditioned and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff makes it tangle free.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t say that Marrakesh leave in treatment gets rid of all the frizz my hair is capable of, it is certainly better and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It smells incredible, and makes my hair so soft and manageable and absolutely helped with the damage.</li>
            <li> When I first smelled it, I loved it, but after I bought it and started using it on a semi-regular basis, the smell started to change to me and began smelling too much like incense or something smiliar...</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had originally given me a sample of this product, and now I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Originally I came across this at a beauty supply store but it was quite costly.</li>
            <li> Okay first I&#x27;ll describe my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is warm, woodsy, and has a hint of an undertone that is musky (I can&#x27;t place the actual scent) and stays lightly with you in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more....</li>
            <li> And this product works great all day long!</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and last all day.  </li>
            <li> Right now I use Nexxus Therappe, and it has worked for me for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely fell in love with the scent and the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> It works really well to get rid of the static.</li>
            <li> Beware I love it so much I purchased the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is good for what it is,, but always start with a tiny bit,,to see how it does,,a</li>
            <li> Only good part was the smell.</li>
            <li> It is strong at first but dissipates as your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprtiz after the shower and good to go!</li>
            <li> quickly without greasyness (and...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s super hydrating.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels, soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their hair texture.</li>
            <li> The other Marrakesh products are all really good and smell fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products to use on my natural curly hair!</li>
            <li> Not a true conditioning agent but does a great job as a spray conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I first got a bottle from my hairdresser, and now I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I smells so nice and makes my hair feel soft and certainly detangled.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It really helps me detangle my locks after I shower and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> and although this product has a distinct scent</li>
            <li> I love argan oil products, because they do make my hair soft ..</li>
            <li> and I rarely have issues running a pick through my locks.</li>
            <li> Just put a drop and work it through the knot and it slides right out.</li>
            <li> only downside is my boyfriend says its a very strong smell however it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to make my hair less frizzy and make it smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft, and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that makes my hair able to brush right after the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, it detangles great, and it makes my hair so so soft and less frizzy and have less static.</li>
            <li> First product I have found that leaves my hair soft and smelling beautiful without making it greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Detangles very very well.</li>
            <li> I put it on mostly my ends after blow drying my hair to keep is from getting really staticky and to help bring a little more moisture to the ends.</li>
            <li> This product was first used on me by my stylist</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, works instantly and makes it easier to comb my hair as it detangles well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for any of your earthly needs!!</li>
            <li> Most definitely will be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> when you start using up the whole bottle!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from getting oily for much longer than without use!  </li>
            <li> The price was incredibly reasonable!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> First I thought I ordered the serum in the pump but received this</li>
            <li> And although not many like the original scent, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair tangle-free, soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> One and only argan oil does a much better job for me.</li>
            <li> and they had ULTRA fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this product from Amazon from now on! :)</li>
            <li> I have used it only five or six times, so I will edit my review if my hair gets better.</li>
            <li> When it was dried I was so happy i was nearly running around yelling...</li>
            <li> You need very little of it as well so good value.</li>
            <li> I can smell it all day long :)</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and it tangles and tears, no matter how careful I am.  </li>
            <li> Love the way I can brush my fine, straight hair after washing with very little tugging and pulling when using this product.</li>
            <li> I had a major clean up job.  </li>
            <li> that I like but is certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I wish they made it in a large size.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, hair was dry and full of tangles.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves it silky smooth, detangled, and much easier to control, especially when the humidity is higher.</li>
            <li> As far as the leave-in conditioner/detangler part, it definitely does a great job as a detangler, and I don&#x27;t mind leaving it in my hair because it isn&#x27;t super heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> My 3 year old&#x27;s hair is very fine and gets tangled very easily and is very hard to brush out...</li>
            <li> My hair gets very tangled after I shower</li>
            <li> I like to put it on my hair wet (more than damp) and it makes it a lot easier to brush.</li>
            <li> I use the whole line.</li>
            <li> but it is much cheaper on here, so</li>
            <li> Fast service</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really tell you how it worked</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It work really well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast .  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky and keeps it very shiny.</li>
            <li> Straight out the shower</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough to keep the curl going from root to end.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter since she has really curly hair</li>
            <li> This works really well and helping to prevent some of those tangles.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of them at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> It smells yummy and makes my daughter&#x27;s hair much easier to brush.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to spread around in your hair either.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this product so much.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, dries nicely</li>
            <li> But the original odor of this hair product actually made me gag!  </li>
            <li> Also not CG friendly, I&#x27;d missed the dimethacone when I initially looked at the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, long and defined curly hair that is color treated.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims, detangles your hair and leaves it shiny, soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> maybe I should use more quantities of this product though I am worried it might weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I adore this stuff, i could live in that scent!</li>
            <li> The scent is like an older hippy woman (You know..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this leave in because its not too heavy, its very light.</li>
            <li> I think they also have it in High Tide...</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly and makes my hair feel healthy, especially when I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> * Used as a leave-in conditioner, it helps smooth frizz and relax hair (a bit--not too much) without weighing it down</li>
            <li> My hairdresser will not be able to convert me back to any overpriced full of icky stuff products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> The bottom curly half is very dry and gets tangled SUPER easily.</li>
            <li> It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is back to feeling more like silk and less like straw.</li>
            <li> In our family we have: Fine hair, medium hair and thick tangled hair; this works really well on all types of hair.</li>
            <li> only use a little or you&#x27;ll have greasy hair :)</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this when I got my hair cut, and it made my hair so soft, even after she straightened.</li>
            <li> My hair was amazingly soft after using it.</li>
            <li> ;  It feels soft too as well as silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and manageable .</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and sorta tames my frizz.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> A note: I&#x27;m really sensitive to smell</li>
            <li> It also make my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> The dreamsicle scent smells like actual oranges, the original scent is described above, and I don&#x27;t care for the third scent</li>
            <li> I just spray it on my wet hair and comb right through.</li>
            <li> The smell is still divine, but the product is weaker and less effective in its watered down form.  </li>
            <li> You can also use it (very sparingly) on dry or damp morning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product after each shampoo, it&#x27;s the only thing that can detangle my hair, especially after too much time in pools and in salt water.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and there has been a big reduction in frizz.</li>
            <li> It did zip the first use as far as getting snarls out of my yard-long (or longer) thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have had the same routine since I first got my perm- take a shower, towel dry, use mousse to prevent frizz and hold curl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other leave in conditioner, I&#x27;ve gone through a few bottles and this remains my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really thinks this helps my hair from breaking when I&#x27;m combing it wet.</li>
            <li> When they changed the label they apparently also changed something about the formula.</li>
            <li> Have a mixed daughter and her hair is very unruly, this is the only product i&#x27;ve found that actually detangles her hair and lets me get a comb through it</li>
            <li> My stylist also used this product before using the flat iron and my hair was soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I actually found this at a spa and had to track it down on Amazon bc after I used up the first bottle I found I couldn&#x27;t like without it.</li>
            <li> However it is straight on the top half and loose big curls on the bottom, I&#x27;m guessing because it is so long and heavy.</li>
            <li> Makes my curly, dry hair feel really soft too!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly long hair.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I wondered if it made it a little more dry the next time I used it, unlike what the other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> This product detangles and gives a little extra conditioner to my fine hair, without getting greasy and doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and heavy but each individual strand is very fine.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way,,especially if you use Hot tools,,,it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd or 4th and will continue as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I received this crazy fast!</li>
            <li> I have slightly coarse, dry, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> (: I can run my hand through my hair when it&#x27;s dry, unlike before when my hair did put up some resistance and had a couple tiny knots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells so strongly that it&#x27;s made me feel ill.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry from perming and highlighting; this product is an instant softener without any residue or oily feel.  </li>
            <li> I put this in my daughters hair all winter long.</li>
            <li> (you don&#x27;t need a lot), plus as long as it is in my hair</li>
            <li> have always had long hair.</li>
            <li> The formula is also strange..</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It helps detangle my long hair</li>
            <li> so I have to use it sparingly and mostly as a final step after all my other styling steps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 6th purchase and will keep buying as long as they keep selling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting this dry spring.  </li>
            <li> I use this product after I shampoo, before I dry.  </li>
            <li> It brings her hair under control without having to blow dry and flatten.  </li>
            <li> Not to heavy on the hair, only need a couple sprays on each side and back.</li>
            <li> Such an inexpensive product, not really worth the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and on the dry side, and live in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of breakaways/ flyaways and when I put this on my wet hair and dry it</li>
            <li> I use this on my very dry ends.</li>
            <li> Received package must faster then expected.</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave my hair greasy or wet looking.</li>
            <li> The product helps me get a comb through my wet curls</li>
            <li> I have hair that has been put through some rough stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually buy it in the beauty store but buying online is less expensive and more convenient.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I actually notice a difference.</li>
            <li> It comes in two other fragrances.  </li>
            <li> im hoping to see how well my wife and  daughter  likes this over other products</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Small amount is enough.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend recommended it, so I bought it here for 1/2 the price of other places.  </li>
            <li> I continue to use my other 100% Argan Oil as a make up remover</li>
            <li> I often use a spray of this if I am going to style my hair afterward; vs the oil, use it when I truly want to moisturize and wil not be using any other hair products.</li>
            <li> Adds silkiness and helps with tangles, without the chance of your hair feeling oily like with other argan oil products.</li>
            <li> This complements the other products in the line.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way and keeps my parched hair from looking dry.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron everyday and after using it a few months I have healthier hair.</li>
            <li> It takes very little so the bottle lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s down to my shoulders and it&#x27;s been colored, streaked, bleached and</li>
            <li> No greasy weighed down feeling afterward.</li>
            <li> Then, I purchased it separately (as shown here) and it was runny and watered down.  </li>
            <li> It no longer smells sweet - it&#x27;s smells like patchouli! :(</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount</li>
            <li> The price was $12 less then the beauty supply stores in the mall.</li>
            <li> I have less split ends.</li>
            <li> The brand I previously used had no scent, and was a dropper applicator.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what hair the other reviewers have, because this does not really detangle my hair!</li>
            <li> and I have a lot less breakage.</li>
            <li> This product (Original Scent, Earthly Body) has a strong odor that seems to be the worst combination of these, resulting in a &amp;#34;dead things&amp;#34; smell that permeated the entire room in a distinctly unpleasant way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thin, frizzy, dry, curly, very long hair.</li>
            <li> It was thick and a little went a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just need a little bit and works well on combing out tangles.</li>
            <li> I gamely sprayed the rotting-game scent through the mane of my toweled hair, as I wanted to believe the reviews that said I&#x27;d not only get used to it</li>
            <li> USE IT EVERYDAY.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; conditioner that wasn&#x27;t heavy until this came my way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this every day for a few months basically restored my hair to</li>
            <li> This product helps control the friz and makes my hair softer with out looking heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li> This bottle was to thick, don&#x27;t know if it was old or what was wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Yes it is past my butt.</li>
            <li> The consistency that comes out of the bottle is thicker than a spray and can be hard to spread evenly on hair.</li>
            <li> Well the shampoo sucks.</li>
            <li> Well let me start off with saying i have thick brown hair</li>
            <li> My daughter who has really thick and out of control hair loves this product.  </li>
            <li> It is really thick and curly.</li>
            <li> I have to use much less product to keep everything neat, but on the plus side no more expensive biosilk.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my boyfriend steals the shampoo and conditioner that I have that smell like this just because it&#x27;s so yummy.</li>
            <li> I have dry frizzy curly hair and the weather is getting cold now, so I wake up with one blob of tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to someone who has the hassle of tangled hair, frizzy hair, dull hair, colored hair, unhealthy hair, or someone who loves silky hair.</li>
            <li> When I received this, a day late, it was broken.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very thick and because of that, it doesn&#x27;t spray evenly but globs in one place.</li>
            <li> The Marrakesh X Leave In Treatment &amp; Detangler works so well on my course, wavy/curly, very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The X bottle had broken, gone through the sealed bag it comes in and gotten all over the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t seem to work that well on my thin, wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Try it and you will be addicted to the scent.</li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged due to repeated lightening, and was so bad I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through my hair anymore!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive--</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot find it anywhere and have to order it.  </li>
            <li> Use it and you&#x27;ll smell like fake vanilla until you wash it out.  </li>
            <li> ill stick with this product and my kenra products.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s weird</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s made my hair noticeably drier and has increased tangles.</li>
            <li> I used it before and am unable to find it here in my town.  </li>
            <li> I had a perm about 8 months ago (and it&#x27;s still lingering around, unfortunately).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to brush out without ripping, but</li>
            <li> $ that&#x27;s not too bad</li>
            <li> not THAT bad.</li>
            <li> Bad smell.</li>
            <li> The packaging was terrible.</li>
            <li> VERY FRUSTRATED!</li>
            <li> The smell is also horrible!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;* Lotion that squirts from a spray-top and is easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;* Smells vanilla-cookie-ish--just yummy (Dreamsicle fragrance)&lt;br /&gt;* All-natural, healthy ingredients&lt;br /&gt;* Can be used on skin or on hair&lt;br /&gt;* Used as a leave-in conditioner, it helps smooth frizz and relax hair (a bit--not too much) without weighing it down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s expensive--my 10-year-old daughter and I used our bottle up in three months (it&#x27;s not very big). However, it&#x27;s worth it. Comparable brands are pricy too (like Ouidad and Mixed Chicks)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I blow dry my hair, and this has done great things for keeping it conditioned and in good shape.  Also, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My hair gets very tangled after I shower and it&#x27;s impossible to brush out without ripping, but with this, I&#x27;m just about tangle free. It has a nice smell too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this 4 times for my girlfriend, and she keeps asking for more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy. I like to put it on my hair wet (more than damp) and it makes it a lot easier to brush. I highly recommend it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Smells good, if you like the patcholie hippy kind of smell, but it for sure is not a detangler and builds up on your hair very easily.  It is very thick and if you go more than a day without washing your hair it gets greasy. But it smells good.</li>
            <li> The original scent smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This detangler works great and smells wonderful.  I really thinks this helps my hair from breaking when I&#x27;m combing it wet.</li>
            <li> The best detangler you can buy!</li>
            <li> First of all, I received this crazy fast! This product was first used on me by my stylist and I absolutely fell in love with the scent and the way it made my hair feel. I bought this immediately after getting home and it came two days later! I am absolutely thrilled with the seller and the product! Definitely recommend if you have unruly hair after a shower</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this when I got my hair cut, and it made my hair so soft, even after she straightened.</li>
            <li> I have slightly coarse, dry, wavy hair. This product leaves it silky smooth, detangled, and much easier to control, especially when the humidity is higher. My hairdresser had originally given me a sample of this product, and now I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much! Just three sprays through my tons of very fine, curly, easily snarled hair detangles and manages it while leaving it with a lovely light scent (original).</li>
            <li> My stylist also used this product before using the flat iron and my hair was soft and shiny.  She also sprayed a bit on her hands and worked it through the hair at the top of my head and no flyaways like I&#x27;ve been getting this dry spring.  Love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!! I discovered it and have never looked back. I have tried argon oils that haven&#x27;t worked well but this one is perfect to combat my frizz and fly aways. Amazon has the best prices compared to canadian dealers. I always order multiple at at time to keep my stock up. A little goes along way and keeps my parched hair from looking dry.</li>
            <li> Not the same consistency as the oil that they used to make. Its more of a cream spray in now.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products to use on my natural curly hair!</li>
            <li> OK, but not what the spouse was looking for. Such an inexpensive product, not really worth the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> I got the kit. I love em all and use them all! Best smell ever!</li>
            <li> My hair was amazingly soft after using it. The price was $12 less then the beauty supply stores in the mall.</li>
            <li> Great product...arrived on time</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing after using this Marrakesh product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now.  I have curly unruly hair and this leave in conditioner is light weight and helps with the frizz.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I actually notice a difference. The consistency that comes out of the bottle is thicker than a spray and can be hard to spread evenly on hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years~! Highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to make my hair less frizzy and make it smooth. decent price but great effect!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews.  I did not want my hair to smell like ice cream. I had no idea what the tide would smell like. But the original odor of this hair product actually made me gag!  I gamely sprayed the rotting-game scent through the mane of my toweled hair, as I wanted to believe the reviews that said I&#x27;d not only get used to it, I&#x27;d come to enjoy the smell. It did zip the first use as far as getting snarls out of my yard-long (or longer) thick, straight hair. Maybe if it worked as well as reviewers said I could have forgiven the smell. But wrestle with snarls I did, as I always do, while manfully swallowing my gag reflexes. I did a lot of reading to find this product, and I don&#x27;t want to send it back out of hand. I&#x27;m just thinking I don&#x27;t want to walk around thinking something died in my hair. What to do?!  1-Star for the odor...I&#x27;ve no idea if it works or not.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I was happy to find it through Amazon</li>
            <li> Best detangler I&#x27;ve run across so far and has the most amazing smell! Makes my curly, dry hair feel really soft too!</li>
            <li> The product is great.  I love it. Unfortunately, I cannot find it anywhere and have to order it.  When I received this, a day late, it was broken.  The packaging was terrible. The box it came in was too big.  I had ordered the shampoo and conditioner too.  The X bottle had broken, gone through the sealed bag it comes in and gotten all over the shampoo and conditioner.  I had a major clean up job.  I saved what X product I could, but had to transfer to a different bottle.  I am waiting to hear back to see if they will send me another treatment or refund my money.  VERY FRUSTRATED!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, works instantly and makes it easier to comb my hair as it detangles well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I put this in my daughters hair all winter long. It works really well to get rid of the static.</li>
            <li> Quick, spontaneous and a very pleasant experience. Definitely will order from Earthly Body again!!! Highly recommend for any of your earthly needs!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!! Love, love, love it!! &amp;#60;3 Tames al the frizzies &amp; makes my hair super soft w/ perfect curls.</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by saying, BEST hair SERUM ever!! I literally buy this product like every month and at the price of sometimes as low as 8-15$ that&#x27;s not too bad but if I was too purchase it at the salon it can be upwards of more than 30$. This smells delicious and keeps my curls frizz-free and tangle-free. I would recommend this product to someone who has the hassle of tangled hair, frizzy hair, dull hair, colored hair, unhealthy hair, or someone who loves silky hair. Most definitely will be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> Well let me start off with saying i have thick brown hair and it started to feel brittle especially in the shower rinsing off shampoo and conditioner. Almost like hay but not THAT bad. It&#x27;s down to my shoulders and it&#x27;s been colored, streaked, bleached and I must say this product just puts back the shine(: I can run my hand through my hair when it&#x27;s dry, unlike before when my hair did put up some resistance and had a couple tiny knots.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this on damp hair, a spritz on my roots and then about 4-5 spritz on the body of my hair with one final shot to my ends. When it was dried I was so happy i was nearly running around yelling...&amp;#34;IT LIVES!&amp;#34;  It feels soft too as well as silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle claims that it does 10 things-&lt;br /&gt;moisturizes all hair types (yes)&lt;br /&gt;protects during thermal styling (probably)&lt;br /&gt;gives brilliant shine (yes)&lt;br /&gt;detangles (yes)&lt;br /&gt;controls frizziness (yes)&lt;br /&gt;seals in hair color (probably)&lt;br /&gt;strengthens hair (yes)&lt;br /&gt;prevents split ends (probably)&lt;br /&gt;shields hair from sun and wind damage (probably)&lt;br /&gt;absorbs quickly without greasyness (and...YES)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it with heat yet but I hope to soon...as for the frizz and detangling...BRILLIANT! pick up one of these...I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I use the whole line. Love the smell altho I have heard others don&#x27;t. It comes in two other fragrances.  It takes very little so the bottle lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.  BEST LEAVE IT TREATMENT I HAVE EVER FOUND.  USE IT EVERYDAY.  KEEP LOTS ON HAND SO I NEVER RUN OUT</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and on the dry side, and live in humid weather.  I use this product after I shampoo, before I dry.  It takes the frizz away and puffy look gone and with the help of the Marraskesh oil hair styling exlir my hair is healthier than it has been in years.  I have tried every product out there and finally found one that works.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I love the way it smells, it detangles great, and it makes my hair so so soft and less frizzy and have less static. I have been using this for years and I don&#x27;t think I would want to use anything else. I have yet to order from Amazon, (I have always gotten it from my hairdresser) but it is much cheaper on here, so I am going to order from here for now on. Would recommend this stuff, its great!</li>
            <li> Love love love this detangler! I just spray it on my wet hair and comb right through. No greasy weighed down feeling afterward.</li>
            <li> Love love love! I can&#x27;t get over how amazing the smell of the &amp;#34;original scent&amp;#34; oil is! It&#x27;s not too heavy and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Fast service</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best hair product I think I have ever used. My hair is thick and heavy but each individual strand is very fine. It is waist length and wavy and has been feeling dryer and more unmanageable, probably as a result of aging and highlighting my hair. I wanted my hair to feel like it did when I was a teenager, and now, with this product, it actually does. My hair is back to feeling more like silk and less like straw. It isn&#x27;t oily and heavy. It does have a strong scent (I got the original.) that I like but is certainly noticeable. It smells like something between church incense and spice cake. For the price, I don&#x27;t think there is a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: still using this product. Still works perfectly though I have to be careful not get a lot on my face because it can cause breakouts. The dreamsicle scent smells like actual oranges, the original scent is described above, and I don&#x27;t care for the third scent but it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li> My daughter who has really thick and out of control hair loves this product.  It brings her hair under control without having to blow dry and flatten.  It leaves the curls but eliminates the puffiness.</li>
            <li> The Mrs. Watoozee love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Leaves my hair soft and manageable . Have been using this product for several years. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It works well and smells amazing. If you like a strong scent this great. Originally I came across this at a beauty supply store but it was quite costly. Through Amazon here it was much more affordable.</li>
            <li> I learned about this spray on conditioner from my hairdresser.  It has a wonderful smell and works to protect your hair when using hot hair tools.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
            <li> Love it, everything was fine</li>
            <li> I use this product after each shampoo, it&#x27;s the only thing that can detangle my hair, especially after too much time in pools and in salt water.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I love the way this smells. I put it on mostly my ends after blow drying my hair to keep is from getting really staticky and to help bring a little more moisture to the ends.</li>
            <li> Liquid gold! My hair has been damaged due to repeated lightening, and was so bad I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through my hair anymore!  A couple sprays of this and the brush now glides through my hair like butter!  I will never be without this stuff in my bathroom cabinet!</li>
            <li> I love earthy, woodsy, musky smells.  This product (Original Scent, Earthly Body) has a strong odor that seems to be the worst combination of these, resulting in a &amp;#34;dead things&amp;#34; smell that permeated the entire room in a distinctly unpleasant way.  And it didn&#x27;t seem to work that well on my thin, wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I love, love, love the scent. It is to die for. Seriously, my boyfriend steals the shampoo and conditioner that I have that smell like this just because it&#x27;s so yummy. As far as the leave-in conditioner/detangler part, it definitely does a great job as a detangler, and I don&#x27;t mind leaving it in my hair because it isn&#x27;t super heavy or greasy (you don&#x27;t need a lot), plus as long as it is in my hair I can smell it all day long :) I actually found this at a spa and had to track it down on Amazon bc after I used up the first bottle I found I couldn&#x27;t like without it. THAT is when you know that something is good ... when you start using up the whole bottle! I&#x27;m on my 3rd or 4th and will continue as long as I can get it. The other Marrakesh products are all really good and smell fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the advice of my stylist, she uses it on my hair and I love it. This bottle was to thick, don&#x27;t know if it was old or what was wrong. It won&#x27;t spray out in a spray it just comes out in a stream so you can not spray it in your hair</li>
            <li> Received package must faster then expected. Product is a present so I can&#x27;t really tell you how it worked but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Should havehave the descriptions better I thought thiswas the actual oil. Good product of this is what you are looking for</li>
            <li> This is a great product for wavy or frizzy hair. It relaxes the frizz and makes my hair feel wonderful. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about this product, been using two years and i dont go a day without using it. Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> This is a daily must for me! By using this treatment, my hair combs out effortlessly, smells awesome, and leaves no sticky after effects.</li>
            <li> If your hair is wavy or tends toward frizziness, this product is a must before blow-drying, leaving your hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as good as the oil!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser had given me a bottle a year ago and loved it. Then I ran out and wanted to purchase more. I would recommend it. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I adore this stuff, i could live in that scent! And my hair likes it that it makes it easier to comb out.</li>
            <li> only downside is my boyfriend says its a very strong smell however it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> Earthy smell, light and pleasant.  Keeps my hair from getting oily for much longer than without use!  Just a few sprtiz after the shower and good to go! Especially good for gnarly hair after the gym!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product with a very nice and light scent. Love the way I can brush my fine, straight hair after washing with very little tugging and pulling when using this product.</li>
            <li> I kind of ignored the smell reviews because I figured it would fade, it does not.  Use it and you&#x27;ll smell like fake vanilla until you wash it out.  Also not CG friendly, I&#x27;d missed the dimethacone when I initially looked at the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish more hair products came either unscented or very lightly scented.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far. It keeps my hair soft and sorta tames my frizz. My hair is shoulder length with a wavy/nearly curly appearance. I was using biosilk, which is pricey to manage my frizz. While I wouldn&#x27;t say that Marrakesh leave in treatment gets rid of all the frizz my hair is capable of, it is certainly better and more manageable. I have to use much less product to keep everything neat, but on the plus side no more expensive biosilk.</li>
            <li> The old pink bottle was what I was looking for. When they changed the label they apparently also changed something about the formula. It no longer smells sweet - it&#x27;s smells like patchouli! :(</li>
            <li> Awesome. Super quick delivery always helps!! Will def order again :)</li>
            <li> This Marrakesh product lives up to its superior reputation for hair products! It will smooth the hair-no matter the humidity level, yet, doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down, produces a healthy shine, and has a very light, pleasant aroma! The price was incredibly reasonable! I am one satisfied customer! I would both purchase Marrakesh X again, and buy from this seller! Definitely a FIVE STAR transaction!</li>
            <li> It work really well. The shipping was fast .  This is exactly what i was looking for. im hoping to see how well my wife and  daughter  likes this over other products</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product. It&#x27;s a great leave in treatment. Smells good and does not leave hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Most amazing EVER!!!  I have curly hair!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells heavenly and makes my hair feel healthy, especially when I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff to me it works better than its a 10.</li>
            <li> Got it from my hairdresser as a sample; then bought my own. My hair is very dry from perming and highlighting; this product is an instant softener without any residue or oily feel.  Not a true conditioning agent but does a great job as a spray conditioner.  Very pleased with product!</li>
            <li> Best detangler I have ever used - have been buying it for a much higher price than Amazon at my beauty shop. Got a huge deal from Amazon. Try it and you will be addicted to the scent.</li>
            <li> First product I have found that leaves my hair soft and smelling beautiful without making it greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair beautiful, smells great and does what it says. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, dries nicely</li>
            <li> Love the lightness of it in my hair.  Love the smell.  Like to use it in between washing my hair for a defrizzer (new word)  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Makes my hair feel silky and keeps it very shiny. Very pleased and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> god this stuff smells wonderful.. and leaves my hair SOO silky soft :)</li>
            <li> Been using for years! Love this stuff! The best detangler I have used.</li>
            <li> I use this on my very dry ends. Does a good job keeping the frizz away. Smells great. Price fluctuates drastically (from $8 - $30).</li>
            <li> I love using this product on my hair just after a shampoo.  I smells so nice and makes my hair feel soft and certainly detangled.  I also use the oil, but only one drop then pull it through my hair with my fingers for a non-oily shine.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old&#x27;s hair is very fine and gets tangled very easily and is very hard to brush out... And this product works great all day long!</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair so soft. I have a lot of breakaways/ flyaways and when I put this on my wet hair and dry it they are totally smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, does not make hair feel oily or produce product buildup, works wonderfully as a detangler for after the shower!</li>
            <li> Great product, smells amazing, smooths hair. Love this product</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell &amp; LOVE how it conditions and detangles my hair!! You need very little of it as well so good value.</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave my hair greasy or wet looking. Just need a little bit and works well on combing out tangles.</li>
            <li> Love this product glad I found it on excellent price. Best hair detangler and love the scent.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and it tangles and tears, no matter how careful I am.  This product detangles and gives a little extra conditioner to my fine hair, without getting greasy and doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  I can have soft hair, without all the fly away....</li>
            <li> This is the only product that makes my hair able to brush right after the shower. It&#x27;s amazing and fantastic. Everyone should try this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have less split ends. The gal who does my hair used it on me and I wanted to buy it from her but  she didn&#x27;t have much left gave me the rest of her bottle. it smells super good .  I use a flat iron everyday and after using it a few months I have healthier hair. Beware I love it so much I purchased the shampoo. Well the shampoo sucks. It don&#x27;t lather,and it comes out looking like hand soap..ill stick with this product and my kenra products. I&#x27;ll keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> None of the beauty supply stores can seem to get it.&lt;br /&gt;My coworker uses it on most of her clients. Smells great and works! Received on time too!</li>
            <li> I have fine, long and defined curly hair that is color treated.  Straight out the shower I spray about 3-4 times followed by a comb out.  It&#x27;s light enough to keep the curl going from root to end.  Now as for the smell, it is sorta hippie but without the patchouli I can&#x27;t stand.  I limit how many times I wash my hair a week.  In between washing, a daily with a spritz of water and this on the bottom 4 inches keep my ends from frizz and breaking.  One bottle lasts about 2 months for hair length of 18 inches from scalp used daily.</li>
            <li> Originally bought in a &amp;#34;multi-pack&amp;#34; set and LOVED IT!  It was thick and a little went a long way.  Then, I purchased it separately (as shown here) and it was runny and watered down.  The smell is still divine, but the product is weaker and less effective in its watered down form.  The price dropped since then, too....hmmmm....curious.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter since she has really curly hair and it has a tendency to tangle. This works really well and helping to prevent some of those tangles.</li>
            <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner for your hair if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing. It&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s super hydrating. And really, the smell is the best part. I definitely recommend and so did my hair colorist when I told her what I use.</li>
            <li> Love this it helps a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; conditioner that wasn&#x27;t heavy until this came my way. It smells lovely, too. great product.</li>
            <li> I borrowed this from my sister while in from out of town, no conditioner. Fell in love with the scent, decided I had to have some.  Smell is... a bit incense, a bit coconut,a bit hemp.  Works as advertised.  Can replace normal conditioner, or be a good supplement.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy on the hair, only need a couple sprays on each side and back. First I thought I ordered the serum in the pump but received this and it was a spray version and actually like this to use before I use a hair dryer. Little goes a long way! still great smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this product!! The smell is incredible &amp; it leaves my hair feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. I like it. But when I use big amount of this product, it doesnt make my hair that well. Small amount is enough.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works so well! I love this product and tell my friends all the time to buy it.Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for my dry and overprocessed hair. I love it and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their hair texture.</li>
            <li> Have a mixed daughter and her hair is very unruly, this is the only product i&#x27;ve found that actually detangles her hair and lets me get a comb through it and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels, soft and tangle free.  I also can&#x27;t get enough of how great it smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited amazon prime sold this! My stylist used it on my hair and I bought it from her then. At a hefty salon price, I might not keep buying but since I could find it here I bought 3 of them at a very competitive price. Highly recommend. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft</li>
            <li> It is good for what it is,, but always start with a tiny bit,,to see how it does,,a little goes a long way,,especially if you use Hot tools,,,it does not burn on hair,,but actually conditions..hair gets better and better.</li>
            <li> Perfect stocking stuffer for my 3 young adult daughters.  They love the product and were tickled it was made of hemp oil.</li>
            <li> I overbleached my hair to the point where it was falling off in chunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this every day for a few months basically restored my hair to it&#x27;s former glory. It smells incredible, and makes my hair so soft and manageable and absolutely helped with the damage.</li>
            <li> but my daughter and I have very fine hair and it tangles easily. Without this product I would never be able to Brush either of our hair!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend recommended it, so I bought it here for 1/2 the price of other places.  It smells, as my boyfriend told me, like heaven, and left my hair so conditioned and smelling great.  only use a little or you&#x27;ll have greasy hair :)</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  Really nice detangler and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I usually buy it in the beauty store but buying online is less expensive and more convenient. It feels great on my hair and smells amazing! I will continue to buy this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my hairdresser after she used it on my hair. I loved the smell, and the spray applicator. The brand I previously used had no scent, and was a dropper applicator. I continue to use my other 100% Argan Oil as a make up remover and I use this exclusively on my hair. I love the way it detangles my processed hair after I get out of the shower and the scent is nice and spicy without being over powering.</li>
            <li> The product does well with detangling and conditioning. When I first smelled it, I loved it, but after I bought it and started using it on a semi-regular basis, the smell started to change to me and began smelling too much like incense or something smiliar... that&#x27;s weird I know. I still use it every once in a while though.</li>
            <li> Okay first I&#x27;ll describe my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had long hair. Yes it is past my butt. It is really thick and curly. However it is straight on the top half and loose big curls on the bottom, I&#x27;m guessing because it is so long and heavy. The bottom curly half is very dry and gets tangled SUPER easily. I have looked for so long for a good detangler because none were quite amazing. But this one is. This is the grand winner. It really helps me detangle my locks after I shower and leaves my hair smooth and shiny. I will definitely continue buying this product. What a joyous day!</li>
            <li> Best detangler and calms the frizz from my hair! Only wish it was a prime product because I&#x27;m ordering it all the time!!</li>
            <li> I love this detangler. A little goes a long way. It does have a strong spicy-sweet scent but I like it</li>
            <li> I like this leave in because its not too heavy, its very light. It does detangle a bit but I have a lot of hair so I have to use it sparingly and mostly as a final step after all my other styling steps. And although not many like the original scent, I absolutely love it! Its like an earthy, Moroccan scent. I&#x27;m hooked. I wish they made it in a large size.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had received a sample of the Marrakesh Oil (of which I also purchased) and decided to try the detangler. It makes my hair very soft, and the smell is fantastic. I often use a spray of this if I am going to style my hair afterward; vs the oil, use it when I truly want to moisturize and wil not be using any other hair products. Will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I was very excited to try this product. Unfortunately it&#x27;s made my hair noticeably drier and has increased tangles. The smell is also horrible!!! It smells so strongly that it&#x27;s made me feel ill. The scent is like an older hippy woman (You know.. That weird incense/sweet/spicy/herby smell) for lack of better comparison. The formula is also strange.. it&#x27;s very thick and because of that, it doesn&#x27;t spray evenly but globs in one place. I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with this product, but I wont be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves hair feeling soft and manageable.  I have recommended this product to family and friends.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing and taming the hair.  You only need a very small amount so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Detangles very very well. I love the scent.  It is strong at first but dissipates as your hair dries. I use it on my 5 yr olds blond waist length hair.  A tiny bit goes a long way.  I use it to detangle when she gets out of the tub, and when she gets the occasional knot. Just put a drop and work it through the knot and it slides right out. You can also use it (very sparingly) on dry or damp morning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is warm, woodsy, and has a hint of an undertone that is musky (I can&#x27;t place the actual scent) and stays lightly with you in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more....I think they also have it in High Tide...so I may be getting two :)</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff smell divine - I get compliments on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; all the time - it&#x27;s glorious for my hair. I&#x27;ve got thin, frizzy, dry, curly, very long hair. I use this spray immediately after towel drying my hair, and between washes as extra conditioning and shine. It keeps my hair tangle-free, soft, shiny and smooth. I&#x27;m on my 6th purchase and will keep buying as long as they keep selling!</li>
            <li> Adds silkiness and helps with tangles, without the chance of your hair feeling oily like with other argan oil products.</li>
            <li> I only use it twice after purchase.  Have not manage the touch of applying it satisfactorily.  It seems giving me the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; touch after application.</li>
            <li> It smells yummy and makes my daughter&#x27;s hair much easier to brush. Best detangler we&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Smells great and my skin is smoother since I&#x27;ve been using it. A note: I&#x27;m really sensitive to smell and although this product has a distinct scent it&#x27;s a good one. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Ohh the luxury.  Smells heavenly and is an excellent leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I can&#x27;t live without it. My hair tangles easily but this stuff makes it tangle free. Love love love it.</li>
            <li> Great deal! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Did not work well as a detangler. Left my hair very frizzy when it dried. Will not buy again.  I have naturally curly long hair.  One and only argan oil does a much better job for me.</li>
            <li> Love the product! It helps de-frizz/detangle my curly hair. You don&#x27;t need much to spread around in your hair either.I LOVE the scent and when anyone gets close to my hair they say they love it to and ask me what I use. This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen for it anywhere and they had ULTRA fast shipping! I will definitely be buying this product from Amazon from now on! :)</li>
            <li> This smells VERY good, and detangles well.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims, detangles your hair and leaves it shiny, soft and manageable.  I first got a bottle from my hairdresser, and now I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. I have dry frizzy curly hair and the weather is getting cold now, so I wake up with one blob of tangled hair. I am not sure what hair the other reviewers have, because this does not really detangle my hair! In fact, I wondered if it made it a little more dry the next time I used it, unlike what the other reviewers said. I love argan oil products, because they do make my hair soft .. maybe I should use more quantities of this product though I am worried it might weigh it down. I have used it only five or six times, so I will edit my review if my hair gets better.</li>
            <li> Ordered the incorrect product, but still decided to use it.</li>
            <li> In our family we have: Fine hair, medium hair and thick tangled hair; this works really well on all types of hair.</li>
            <li> The Marrakesh X Leave In Treatment &amp; Detangler works so well on my course, wavy/curly, very thick hair.  I save a step in the shower and only use this as a conditioning agent and protectant, so saves me time and money.  The scent is very nice, not overpowering at all, it&#x27;s relaxing.  This product helps control the friz and makes my hair softer with out looking heavy or oily.  I have combined this with their shampoo and am thrilled.  My hairdresser will not be able to convert me back to any overpriced full of icky stuff products.</li>
            <li> this leave in is so nice, and it leaves my hair soft and really smells great for hours! I LOVE it</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a couple years now and I love it. It smells amazing, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy and it really does help detangle! I have curly hair and I rarely have issues running a pick through my locks.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel healthy and like silk, not to mention the smell is awesome. I would buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing for my hair.  I used it before and am unable to find it here in my town.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser turned me onto this when she used it on me. Smell reminds me of a hippie woodchip smell. Lots cheaper on line then getting at my salon.</li>
            <li> This product keeps hair smelling wonderful, and is easy to  comb after spraying and always looks fresh and shiny. I love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other leave in conditioner, I&#x27;ve gone through a few bottles and this remains my favorite. I have thick/coarse hair, and this works great!&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing, leaves my hair silky, easy to manage and tames the frizz.</li>
            <li> This complements the other products in the line.  I use this with the shampoo/conditioner and oil treatment.  The scent is pleasant and last all day.  The product helps me get a comb through my wet curls so I can style them.  A couple of squirts is enough to help.</li>
            <li> It helps detangle my long hair and I have a lot less breakage. It also make my hair soft and shinny. I hair is bleach blond and this so good for it!  I can&#x27;t see myself using anything else. It also smells good.&lt;br /&gt;I might try the shampoo. Right now I use Nexxus Therappe, and it has worked for me for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li> I have hair that has been put through some rough stuff.&lt;br /&gt; I had a perm about 8 months ago (and it&#x27;s still lingering around, unfortunately). I received the product within a day of ordering, and am totally satisfied with it after one use. I have had the same routine since I first got my perm- take a shower, towel dry, use mousse to prevent frizz and hold curl. I used the product once after a shower and did not even need mousse. My hair is very soft and there has been a big reduction in frizz.</li>
            <li> Bad smell. Left hair too greasy even when I used a tiny amount</li>
            <li> Nothing special, hair was dry and full of tangles.  Only good part was the smell.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this product so much.</li>
