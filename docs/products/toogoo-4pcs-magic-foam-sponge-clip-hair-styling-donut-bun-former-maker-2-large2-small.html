            <li>For the price this is an amazing product</li>
            <li>They are not as well made as I would have liked, but they are functional.  </li>
            <li>Its a really nice hair accessary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t work and didn&#x27;t even come with any kind of instructions of tips for use.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>I have many many hair toys and have one of these in a suede material, thought this would be great light weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this bun maker.  </li>
            <li>The foam is very cheap and will fall apart.</li>
            <li>the price is very cheap.</li>
            <li>good in a pinch when washing my face or a quick shower when not washing your hair.</li>
            <li>very nice exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to get my hair into a bun that I could leave the house in.</li>
            <li>I was so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>There are many of these bun formers on the market.</li>
            <li>I think the sock buns are probably better.</li>
            <li>$2 PLUS Free shipping!  </li>
            <li>- you have to go to youtube if you don&#x27;t know how to use these - search for EXACTLY - Magic Sponge Hair Updo Accessories Tool Twist Curler Roller  </li>
            <li>the price, your okay, if you know how to&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this for my buns now</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to make these work for me, but most things I try don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>this okay</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t love these.  </li>
            <li>I love anything that makes styling hair easier &amp; can give a range of looks.</li>
            <li>This is a simple fix to wear a bun &amp; at a great price!</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it four stars is because I have found a much better use for them.</li>
            <li>I found this out by accident, but I like this use much better.</li>
            <li>These clips take thirty seconds, and I get better results.</li>
            <li>It took so many bobby pins to help keep the hair in place and even then the sponge clip was showing.</li>
            <li>I prefer my hair donuts 10x more.</li>
            <li>i put on her hair at night and since it&#x27;s mostly foam</li>
            <li>la love it.</li>
            <li>Now I can make a bun as fast as a ponytail and it looks great and feels fine on my head.</li>
            <li>I think this product would work best for people who have very long hair.</li>
            <li>love these ... easy to use</li>
            <li>so most others should be fine.  </li>
            <li>I find these really easy to use with my fumble fingers and hands.  </li>
            <li>easy to manage.</li>
            <li>They bend out of shape and lose their rigidity very quickly.</li>
            <li>bend easy.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to create a bun in your hair.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair that is soooo baby fine, everything I put in my hair shows.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made but works</li>
            <li>cheap, and i cannot figure out how to use.</li>
            <li>then again it is a cheap item.</li>
            <li>so I ordered a set for a really cheap price.</li>
            <li>It is cheap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really cheaply made .</li>
            <li>They are a great price, and have multiple uses.</li>
            <li>but I do use it to hold my hair up and its comfortable to sleep in and makes my hair wavey in the morning,</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m more careful with getting the hair to wrap correctly, I can go out like this and feel like the bun is nice and tidy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they were cheap though,</li>
            <li>Took a very long time-- almost a month -- to come, but it came perfectly fine and works great.</li>
            <li>Love it easy to use fast shipping</li>
            <li>Interestingly, it also works better for my daughter, who has longer and thicker (naturally wavy) hair than the donut type.  </li>
            <li>as this item has so many positive reviews i ordered it .and  </li>
            <li>I used it right away for this summer!</li>
            <li>She is six, so her fine hair basically just slipped right out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth $1.09 and free shipping</li>
            <li>My search for something to make my hair look good pulled back continues!</li>
            <li>Very cute and Easy loose bun.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work as perfect as above when you do it yourself, but easier to have someone do it for you, it easier for them to separate your hair the right way and tuck to loose ones.</li>
            <li>Its a good concept but it just dose not really work.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fairly cheaply made, although for what it cost, I kind of expected it.</li>
            <li>This is probably useful for those who have short/thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I like that they shipped it out here pretty quick.</li>
            <li>This works much better for me than the donut type both in ease and final result.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay to use around the house while doing chores,but I wouldn&#x27;t wear this in public.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a better product out on amazon the same exact thing</li>
            <li>Overall, I think I love these clips.</li>
            <li>When it is completely dry, take it down, and you have a beautiful head full of curls.</li>
            <li>I used this couple of times, my hair is long and silky, hence I had little difficulty to keep this bun in place for more than 4/5 hours, but if you pin it good and spray hair, should stay intact for longer than that.</li>
            <li>The idea was nice, but once you put your hair in a wrapped it, I found it hard to secure in place.</li>
            <li>It was very cheaply made and didn&#x27;t hold my long hair in any bun</li>
            <li>(I have thick hair) but the big ones were perfect!</li>
            <li>This made my hair do so much easier, and gives me the look i want for those hot days of summer..</li>
            <li>Very secure through out the day, never have to worry about it coming loose.</li>
            <li>I like the concept and the instructions were easy enough to understand.</li>
            <li>only took off a star because I can&#x27;t easily use one for all of my hair...</li>
            <li>they are easy to work with for younger girls hair.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of practice to get it nice and neat like the picture, and once you get the ends together, you have to spread the hair over them to cover the black foam of the clip.</li>
            <li>and this is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>works, not for large amount of hair</li>
            <li>The quality on these bun-makers is fine, they just aren&#x27;t large enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>The product i dont like soo much.</li>
            <li>Part of the reason for the low score is that when you put your hair into the wrap you have to bend it out of shape to fit your hair into</li>
            <li>Then after my hair was wrapped there was not enough wrap to twist to secure is</li>
            <li>I thought this would make a bun easier, however, I found this brand to be very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>but it really fits and</li>
            <li>They tend to wear out fast.</li>
            <li>They were very affordable, and both my daughter and</li>
            <li>I received them pretty quickly and they were exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for these in particular; I just stumbled upon them.</li>
            <li>These were very cheap and broke after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>These little clips look cute during the day, too.</li>
            <li>They are easy to keep in your purse or briefcase and pull out if you start having frizz or other issues.</li>
            <li>we are always looking for new ways to style, so I bought them.</li>
            <li>The item actually looks smaller than the picture show, but since it&#x27;s really cheap</li>
            <li>even when I put my hair in a ponytail holder to hold my hair as per instructions, it still didnt hold hair to be able to roll it up to put in bun or french twist style, even with the smaller holder it didnt hold hair for smaller bun.</li>
            <li>Not sure which one she uses most.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work as well as the hot bun or regular donut bun.</li>
            <li>Two large and two smaller ones.</li>
            <li>I mean, wow, took a while to ship, but not as long as predicted... and for such a good price I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>I have tried about every bun maker out and this is by far the easiest.</li>
            <li>Getting one that is close to your natural hair color will help as well.  </li>
            <li>then again, i have hair near my butt...</li>
            <li>and it is a two minute concise video.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this thing actually gives her curls that lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>so i guess i cant complain all too much about them (as it wasnt a total loss)...</li>
            <li>I really loved the fact that it came with 4 (two big and two small) because I tend to lose things and there are different sizes for different hair lengths/thickness.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and if I roll my hair up in these after putting product on and just combing it back, it helps the parts around my face dry straighter</li>
            <li>The malleable flat metal  peace inside the sponge  tends to kink where you bend it to make the curvature of the bun, needing to straighten it out as much as you can every time.</li>
            <li>and I get larger soft curls on the ends.  </li>
            <li>and it barely wraps around the bun when I do get it in.</li>
            <li>I will say that the donut type gives you a bigger bun, but I find them to be a lot more difficult and less secure.</li>
            <li>They break easily, they were to short for my hair, and it&#x27;s very hard to get all of your hair into it evenly so that you can roll it up.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t really hold your hair tight.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love it easy to use fast shipping</li>
            <li> Interestingly, it also works better for my daughter, who has longer and thicker (naturally wavy) hair than the donut type.  </li>
            <li> as this item has so many positive reviews i ordered it .and  </li>

            <li> This is probably useful for those who have short/thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I like that they shipped it out here pretty quick.</li>
            <li> This works much better for me than the donut type both in ease and final result.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay to use around the house while doing chores,but I wouldn&#x27;t wear this in public.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a better product out on amazon the same exact thing</li>
            <li> Overall, I think I love these clips.</li>
            <li> When it is completely dry, take it down, and you have a beautiful head full of curls.</li>
            <li> I used this couple of times, my hair is long and silky, hence I had little difficulty to keep this bun in place for more than 4/5 hours, but if you pin it good and spray hair, should stay intact for longer than that.</li>
            <li> The idea was nice, but once you put your hair in a wrapped it, I found it hard to secure in place.</li>
            <li> It was very cheaply made and didn&#x27;t hold my long hair in any bun</li>
            <li> (I have thick hair) but the big ones were perfect!</li>
            <li> This made my hair do so much easier, and gives me the look i want for those hot days of summer..</li>
            <li> Very secure through out the day, never have to worry about it coming loose.</li>
            <li> I like the concept and the instructions were easy enough to understand.</li>
            <li> only took off a star because I can&#x27;t easily use one for all of my hair...</li>
            <li> they are easy to work with for younger girls hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of practice to get it nice and neat like the picture, and once you get the ends together, you have to spread the hair over them to cover the black foam of the clip.</li>
            <li> and this is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> works, not for large amount of hair</li>
            <li> The quality on these bun-makers is fine, they just aren&#x27;t large enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> The product i dont like soo much.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason for the low score is that when you put your hair into the wrap you have to bend it out of shape to fit your hair into</li>
            <li> Then after my hair was wrapped there was not enough wrap to twist to secure is</li>
            <li> I thought this would make a bun easier, however, I found this brand to be very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> but it really fits and</li>
            <li> They tend to wear out fast.</li>
            <li> They were very affordable, and both my daughter and</li>
            <li> I received them pretty quickly and they were exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for these in particular; I just stumbled upon them.</li>
            <li> These were very cheap and broke after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> These little clips look cute during the day, too.</li>
            <li> They are easy to keep in your purse or briefcase and pull out if you start having frizz or other issues.</li>
            <li> we are always looking for new ways to style, so I bought them.</li>
            <li> The item actually looks smaller than the picture show, but since it&#x27;s really cheap</li>
            <li> even when I put my hair in a ponytail holder to hold my hair as per instructions, it still didnt hold hair to be able to roll it up to put in bun or french twist style, even with the smaller holder it didnt hold hair for smaller bun.</li>
            <li> Not sure which one she uses most.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as the hot bun or regular donut bun.</li>
            <li> Two large and two smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I mean, wow, took a while to ship, but not as long as predicted... and for such a good price I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> I have tried about every bun maker out and this is by far the easiest.</li>
            <li> Getting one that is close to your natural hair color will help as well.  </li>
            <li> then again, i have hair near my butt...</li>
            <li> and it is a two minute concise video.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this thing actually gives her curls that lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> so i guess i cant complain all too much about them (as it wasnt a total loss)...</li>
            <li> I really loved the fact that it came with 4 (two big and two small) because I tend to lose things and there are different sizes for different hair lengths/thickness.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and if I roll my hair up in these after putting product on and just combing it back, it helps the parts around my face dry straighter</li>
            <li> The malleable flat metal  peace inside the sponge  tends to kink where you bend it to make the curvature of the bun, needing to straighten it out as much as you can every time.</li>
            <li> and I get larger soft curls on the ends.  </li>
            <li> and it barely wraps around the bun when I do get it in.</li>
            <li> I will say that the donut type gives you a bigger bun, but I find them to be a lot more difficult and less secure.</li>
            <li> They break easily, they were to short for my hair, and it&#x27;s very hard to get all of your hair into it evenly so that you can roll it up.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t really hold your hair tight.  </li>
            <li> The way they work is you put your hair in the hole in the middle, pull it to the end of your hair, and twist the hair around it, finally bending the ends towards each other to make a bun, or a hair donut.</li>
            <li> The black fabric is a thin piece of sponge material and inside is a wire that does not bend easily at all.</li>
            <li> if you do it yourself, it is hard to roll and they dont stay put very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it is not curly, it is wavy and long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for long hair</li>
            <li> i think it would start to poke out a bit after long term use.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too flimsy and incapable of firmly grasping my hair, which caused my layers to completely fall out.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> After you shower, and towel your hair, let it dry halfway.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t roll your hair in the morning and let it dry all day with foam curlers!</li>
            <li> for less than $3 total.</li>
            <li> WRONG, came in a 3 pack because they break quickly...</li>
            <li> the product is a little different than i expected, I can&#x27;t seem to make a bun out of it</li>
            <li> Plus, until recently, my hair went past my waist so it was way too long to work with these.</li>
            <li> I was curious about whether I would ever use something like this</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I like to use these when my hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that it is hard to hide the bottom part where the hair comes together on me since my hair is thinner, but it just takes a few extra minutes and a few extra bobby pins.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> broke two and threw other out</li>
            <li> it comes with 4 bun makers 2 big and 2 small I suggest not buying it and buy something else .</li>
            <li> small enough to pupt in your purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li> Poorly put together, was as described but didnt hold my hair at all which is mid back length,</li>
            <li> Not worth hassle to return.</li>
            <li> Keeps falling down.</li>
            <li> But I have hair down to my butt</li>
            <li> anywaz i recieved it little late but earlier</li>
            <li> this product doesnt work as well, hair hangs loose, still requires hairpins to hold the hair up, not magic at all</li>
            <li> Seems that it would work if I had about a foot less hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium-long, thick &amp; pin-straight with long layers, and this tool did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Thought this was neat , after it coming in the mail, tried it, but it wont stay in my hair, am guessing my hair is to long or to thick for this product.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair short hair it might work on you but honestly this is a very bad quality product.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> What a monumental waste of money.</li>
            <li> Stretch out after a few uses and then won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> never easy tod do</li>
            <li> Since my hair is layered and a few inches past my shoulder</li>
            <li> It would take half an hour at least.</li>
            <li> finally a hair bun for thin hair girls!</li>
            <li> im annoyed i spent money on thid</li>
            <li> We ended up getting the usual \\&quot;sock bun\\&quot;/plastic doughnut thing instead.</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I took one of the small ones and put it in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> The small ones didn&#x27;t work as well for me</li>
            <li> I complained to the company, but I am not sure that I was ever refunded my money.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length and fairly thin.  </li>
            <li> I found out how hard these are to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use and control.</li>
            <li> It works but its hard to cover the foam up with your hair.</li>
            <li> These are really big and really awkward.  </li>
            <li> This is a lifesavor on days when Im late to school or to lazyy.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is not all one length</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with thick hair at all.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, this doesn&#x27;t stay put.  </li>
            <li> than i expected.i tried it immediately after opening the package.my hair is thick</li>
            <li> I have thick, waist-length curly hair</li>
            <li> flimsy and no good.</li>
            <li> hated it on my hair especially because my hair was layered and down to my waist.</li>
            <li> sucks!</li>
            <li> Very hard.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> not happy with this product at all</li>
            <li> After it got shipped unfortunately i saw the negative reviews</li>
            <li> so the wrap was useless to me.</li>
            <li> it did a very poor job of holding the bun together.</li>
            <li> and i felt bad and thought i could buy another one instead of that useless piece.</li>
            <li> they ystunk so bad of smoke.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold any hair and loom stupid i&amp;ntilde;</li>
            <li> These things are absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> it was annoying and i ended up just using the lil ones for my daughter to give her curls.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheaply made but works alright</li>
            <li> keeps hair in place and no jagging like barrettes and bobby pins sometimes do</li>
            <li> LOVE! finally a hair bun for thin hair girls! I used it right away for this summer! love it I would recommend this to any women.</li>
            <li> I like that they shipped it out here pretty quick. The product i dont like soo much. Didnt keep my hair up. Keeps falling down.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is not all one length and these bun holders work great! I have NEVER been able to get my hair into a bun that I could leave the house in. Now I can make a bun as fast as a ponytail and it looks great and feels fine on my head. No pulling or sagging.</li>
            <li> I have tried about every bun maker out and this is by far the easiest. The others work but this one takes about 10 seconds to master! I don&#x27;t even need to use pins! Love it!</li>
            <li> cheap, and i cannot figure out how to use. then again it is a cheap item. dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> i dont know how to use these. it wont stay in my hair and is just ughh. im annoyed i spent money on thid</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for here. I was curious about whether I would ever use something like this so I ordered a set for a really cheap price. I was so glad that I did. I found out how hard these are to use. They break easily, they were to short for my hair, and it&#x27;s very hard to get all of your hair into it evenly so that you can roll it up. Part of the reason for the low score is that when you put your hair into the wrap you have to bend it out of shape to fit your hair into and then when your hair is in, your have to somehow reshape the wrap to wrap your hair. Very hard. Then after my hair was wrapped there was not enough wrap to twist to secure is so the wrap was useless to me.When I took the wrap out I had to reshape it again and it broke. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> These things are absolutely worthless. They don&#x27;t hold any hair and loom stupid i&amp;ntilde; your hair. Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this bun maker.  My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length and fairly thin.  This works much better for me than the donut type both in ease and final result.  You Tube it for instructions.  Interestingly, it also works better for my daughter, who has longer and thicker (naturally wavy) hair than the donut type.  My only problem is that it is hard to hide the bottom part where the hair comes together on me since my hair is thinner, but it just takes a few extra minutes and a few extra bobby pins.  Getting one that is close to your natural hair color will help as well.  I will say that the donut type gives you a bigger bun, but I find them to be a lot more difficult and less secure.</li>
            <li> It was very cheaply made and didn&#x27;t hold my long hair in any bun</li>
            <li> sucks! Doesn&#x27;t work with thick hair at all. flimsy and no good. cheep for a reason. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> i was thinking by the price it would be a good product, but I received a very good sorprise. It&#x27;s perfect for my hair and very quick t do a nice hair styling</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> There are many of these bun formers on the market. I find these really easy to use with my fumble fingers and hands.  They are easy to keep in your purse or briefcase and pull out if you start having frizz or other issues.</li>
            <li> I tried to make a bun in my hair with this thing several times.  I wish I had saved my money. Its a good concept but it just dose not really work.</li>
            <li> I have many many hair toys and have one of these in a suede material, thought this would be great light weight. WRONG, came in a 3 pack because they break quickly...broke two and threw other out</li>
            <li> I thought this would make a bun easier, however, I found this brand to be very flimsy. The malleable flat metal  peace inside the sponge  tends to kink where you bend it to make the curvature of the bun, needing to straighten it out as much as you can every time. It feels as if the metal peace will tear out of the sponge. It&#x27;s okay to use around the house while doing chores,but I wouldn&#x27;t wear this in public.</li>
            <li> I like the concept and the instructions were easy enough to understand. I have very thick hair so I never could get it to work for me like I needed. Plus, until recently, my hair went past my waist so it was way too long to work with these. They will work best for someone with fine hair without a lot of layers and probably not longer than shoulder to in between the shoulder blades, depending on thickness.</li>
            <li> Poorly put together, was as described but didnt hold my hair at all which is mid back length, even when I put my hair in a ponytail holder to hold my hair as per instructions, it still didnt hold hair to be able to roll it up to put in bun or french twist style, even with the smaller holder it didnt hold hair for smaller bun. Another &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; item. Would not recommend. Not worth hassle to return.</li>
            <li> these were awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I only took off a star because I can&#x27;t easily use one for all of my hair...then again, i have hair near my butt...</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it is not curly, it is wavy and long. If you are a person that has similar aspects you should not buy this product. It is cheap. The black fabric is a thin piece of sponge material and inside is a wire that does not bend easily at all. If you have thin hair short hair it might work on you but honestly this is a very bad quality product. Never again will I buy this.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected. It&#x27;s hard to use and control. I think the sock buns are probably better.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the name brand, Hotbuns, but I found this instead, only a dollar... I mean, wow, took a while to ship, but not as long as predicted... and for such a good price I didn&#x27;t really care. Really great product.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, this doesn&#x27;t stay put.  The foam is very cheap and will fall apart.</li>
            <li> I have to put my hair in a bun every day. These were very cheap and broke after a few weeks. If you&#x27;re not planning on using it that often it does the job.</li>
            <li> Still trying to master how to use this but all in all I am very pleased with this product and would recommend to my family and friends.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> this product doesnt work as well, hair hangs loose, still requires hairpins to hold the hair up, not magic at all</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s dance competitions...but I didnt even attempt to use them bc they ystunk so bad of smoke. I complained to the company, but I am not sure that I was ever refunded my money. We ended up getting the usual \\&quot;sock bun\\&quot;/plastic doughnut thing instead.</li>
            <li> $2 PLUS Free shipping!  Is this the deal of the century?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay - you have to go to youtube if you don&#x27;t know how to use these - search for EXACTLY - Magic Sponge Hair Updo Accessories Tool Twist Curler Roller  and it is a two minute concise video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need an entire foot of hair, but you do need shoulder length or better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> no instructions, just receive, packet of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the price, your okay, if you know how to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use them, but besides that, don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Came in a good timing! Thank you so much I love this for my buns now i cant stop using them! In loveeee</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a better product out on amazon the same exact thing but it&#x27;s worth $1.09 and free shipping it comes with 4 bun makers 2 big and 2 small I suggest not buying it and buy something else .</li>
            <li> These are really big and really awkward.  Good luck trying to get the result in the picture!  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Does not come with instructions, took for ever to arrive and it&#x27;s fairly cheaply made, although for what it cost, I kind of expected it.</li>
            <li> What a monumental waste of money. This product does not work as good as it says it does!!!!!.</li>
            <li> great product and price</li>
            <li> not good..doesn&#x27;t stay put in your hair it&#x27;s really cheaply made . not happy with this product at all</li>
            <li> Tried to make a bun using this several times, but just couldn&#x27;t do it. Maybe my hair is too long/thick. Too bad. There are several videos online on how to do it though.</li>
            <li> love these ... easy to use</li>
            <li> easy to manage. like how buns is perfectly done. I get lots of complements when I use it. i recomend it.</li>
            <li> as this item has so many positive reviews i ordered it .and  the price is very cheap.After it got shipped unfortunately i saw the negative reviews and i felt bad and thought i could buy another one instead of that useless piece. anywaz i recieved it little late but earlier than i expected.i tried it immediately after opening the package.my hair is thick but it really fits and the bun looks beautiful.iam happy now :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for long hair</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get these to work for me as claimed</li>
            <li> This is probably useful for those who have short/thin hair.  Definitely not for one who has thick/long hair as I do.  It also lost its shape after trying to put my hair up after the third time.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time-- almost a month -- to come, but it came perfectly fine and works great. You get 4 sponges. Two large and two smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to make these work for me, but most things I try don&#x27;t work.  I have shoulder length hair that is soooo baby fine, everything I put in my hair shows.  My search for something to make my hair look good pulled back continues!</li>
            <li> The item actually looks smaller than the picture show, but since it&#x27;s really cheap and I don&#x27;t have lots of hair I think it still works for me.</li>
            <li> The quality on these bun-makers is fine, they just aren&#x27;t large enough for my hair. I have thick, waist-length curly hair so most others should be fine.  I did find that the wires inside the foam seem to stay creased even after you flatten the bun-maker out i think it would start to poke out a bit after long term use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work as perfect as above when you do it yourself, but easier to have someone do it for you, it easier for them to separate your hair the right way and tuck to loose ones. good in a pinch when washing my face or a quick shower when not washing your hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. Has 2 different types uses both of them. Not sure which one she uses most.</li>
            <li> It worked once but has not worked again since. They bend out of shape and lose their rigidity very quickly. Would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my sister she loved them</li>
            <li> this okay, doesn&#x27;t really hold your hair tight.  they are easy to work with for younger girls hair. bend easy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love these.  They are not as well made as I would have liked, but they are functional.  They tend to wear out fast.</li>
            <li> I love anything that makes styling hair easier &amp; can give a range of looks. This is a simple fix to wear a bun &amp; at a great price!</li>
            <li> Its different from what I imagined it to be, but I still like it. Its a really nice hair accessary.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium-long, thick &amp; pin-straight with long layers, and this tool did not work for me. I found it to be too flimsy and incapable of firmly grasping my hair, which caused my layers to completely fall out. Even with hairspray and styling cream, I could not make this work. I&#x27;m going to stick with my donut-style bun maker to achieve this look. I would not recommend this product for people with my hair type.</li>
            <li> works, not for large amount of hair</li>
            <li> I used this couple of times, my hair is long and silky, hence I had little difficulty to keep this bun in place for more than 4/5 hours, but if you pin it good and spray hair, should stay intact for longer than that. Good part is I got 4 pcs to use, happy about that :)</li>
            <li> This item get stuck in my hair a lot and hurts to undwind out of your hair . But this does make good buns</li>
            <li> This is very easy to work with.  Creates buns in a minute.  Very secure through out the day, never have to worry about it coming loose.</li>
            <li> These make perfect buns easy. I was amazed that 4 of them could be shipped (from China!) for less than $3 total. I received them pretty quickly and they were exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> Love it easy to use fast shipping</li>
            <li> The idea was nice, but once you put your hair in a wrapped it, I found it hard to secure in place. There was no clasping mechanism and if i wanted to use bobby pins, I wouldn&#x27;t need this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work and didn&#x27;t even come with any kind of instructions of tips for use. It also took a while to get here.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for these in particular; I just stumbled upon them. They were very affordable, and both my daughter and I have long hair we are always looking for new ways to style, so I bought them. When they arrived, I took one of the small ones and put it in my daughters hair. She is six, so her fine hair basically just slipped right out. The way they work is you put your hair in the hole in the middle, pull it to the end of your hair, and twist the hair around it, finally bending the ends towards each other to make a bun, or a hair donut. It takes a lot of practice to get it nice and neat like the picture, and once you get the ends together, you have to spread the hair over them to cover the black foam of the clip. The reason I gave it four stars is because I have found a much better use for them. After you shower, and towel your hair, let it dry halfway. Then, put it in the foam bun clip. When it is completely dry, take it down, and you have a beautiful head full of curls. I found this out by accident, but I like this use much better. I used to put my hair in foam rollers all the time, and I would sit and roll it up, curler after curler. It would take half an hour at least. These clips take thirty seconds, and I get better results. If I am going out at night, I shower in the morning, put it in, and take it out at night. Also, where these have an advantage over hair curlers is just that. You can&#x27;t roll your hair in the morning and let it dry all day with foam curlers! These little clips look cute during the day, too. Also, I figured out how to get them to stay in my six year olds hair. When you put the hair through the hole, then twist the clip around the hair to hold it before you roll it. Overall, I think I love these clips. They are a great price, and have multiple uses. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> Thought this was neat , after it coming in the mail, tried it, but it wont stay in my hair, am guessing my hair is to long or to thick for this product.</li>
            <li> the product is a little different than i expected, I can&#x27;t seem to make a bun out of it but I do use it to hold my hair up and its comfortable to sleep in and makes my hair wavey in the morning, so yes i am very happy with it</li>
            <li> I think this product would work best for people who have very long hair. Since my hair is layered and a few inches past my shoulder it did a very poor job of holding the bun together. It took so many bobby pins to help keep the hair in place and even then the sponge clip was showing. I prefer my hair donuts 10x more.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it to make a perfect hair bun for her ballet classes, I will order more for her friends !They all amaze with this products!</li>
            <li> I like to use these when my hair is still wet.  I have super curly hair and if I roll my hair up in these after putting product on and just combing it back, it helps the parts around my face dry straighter and I get larger soft curls on the ends.  If I&#x27;m more careful with getting the hair to wrap correctly, I can go out like this and feel like the bun is nice and tidy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter she loves to do her hail and this is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> hated it on my hair especially because my hair was layered and down to my waist. it was annoying and i ended up just using the lil ones for my daughter to give her curls. i put on her hair at night and since it&#x27;s mostly foam she leaves it alone (she just turned 3) and even with her hair that never holds curls this thing actually gives her curls that lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> This is great to roll your hair up in. Makes it easy to create a bun in your hair.Good product</li>
            <li> Stretch out after a few uses and then won&#x27;t stay in place. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> very nice exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as the hot bun or regular donut bun.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this last week and it came in today. I really loved the fact that it came with 4 (two big and two small) because I tend to lose things and there are different sizes for different hair lengths/thickness. The small ones didn&#x27;t work as well for me (I have thick hair) but the big ones were perfect! They made the perfect bun in literally one minute and I didn&#x27;t even need bobby pins. For the price this is an amazing product and I would definitely recommend this to anyone to try.</li>
            <li> sponge styling hair clip.  easy to use. convenoent. small enough to pupt in your purse or pocket.  bun never easy tod do</li>
            <li> these are great for my kids hair if i happen to put them in. if you do it yourself, it is hard to roll and they dont stay put very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i ordered a bunch of these in a variety of sizes and none of them worked for me to do myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they were cheap though, so i guess i cant complain all too much about them (as it wasnt a total loss)...</li>
            <li> I la la love it. This is a lifesavor on days when Im late to school or to lazyy. Very cute and Easy loose bun.</li>
            <li> Very good and very nice product, I recommend it to all of you.... muy útiles ....muy buen producto, fácil de usar y practicos</li>
            <li> This made my hair do so much easier, and gives me the look i want for those hot days of summer.. Love it!</li>
            <li> Seems that it would work if I had about a foot less hair.  But I have hair down to my butt and I can&#x27;t get this thing to hold and it barely wraps around the bun when I do get it in.</li>
            <li> It works but its hard to cover the foam up with your hair. It took a while for them to get to me.</li>
