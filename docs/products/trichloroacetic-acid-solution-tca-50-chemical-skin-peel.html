            <li>I am so happy!  </li>
            <li>My best advice would be DO NOT PICK AT (OR PEEL)  after it begins to peel.</li>

            <li>great product .thank</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist is amazed by the fact they are selling this kind of product!</li>
            <li>Works good, but made scars</li>
            <li>Worked good.  </li>
            <li>I loved the item.</li>
            <li>This is a very strong acid which works great</li>
            <li>It was very potent and it burned...</li>
            <li>Happy that I was able to find something that works and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Worked great for my use..choose strength wisely for your purpose!other than that the product worked fine for me and my use.</li>
            <li>and you will see amazing results.</li>
            <li>It is not as effective as I though</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Keep a blow dryer handy, I need to use one because I have zero pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li>I applied as directed and had the baking soda solution handy in case</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>does what it states but beware it is very strong and does burn/</li>
            <li>For some people, even a 10% solution can be very strong.  </li>
            <li>the peel itself works but its very strong the seller did suggest to dilute with water which i did.</li>
            <li>Removed tags and warts but very strong chemical , follow directions .</li>
            <li>Beware very strong but took away my stretch marks on my thighs.</li>
            <li>Be sure to have the baking soda paste handy to use after you treat an area, it stops the burning process and stinging.</li>
            <li>This is by far the strongest and best Chemical Peel Solution I’ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a tingly feeling you get after a shot.</li>
            <li>Feelings more like you got punched there</li>
            <li>I will purchase more products from this seller.</li>
            <li>Okay, so this stuff works</li>
            <li>I thought, it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>At this point, I am more worried this stuff is going to leave a permanent discoloration/scar and the tattoo.</li>
            <li>Make sure it&#x27;s diluted before you use it, works just like</li>
            <li>Wud have been better if it comes with a brush.</li>
            <li>But I thought that was supposed to happen, like most of the reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>Used it for 4 days - no Band-Aid - and was able to pinch off the skin tag.</li>
            <li>better results.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, if you have children around (no matter the age), then you need to make sure that they don&#x27;t have access to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I used Vaseline, but I’m sure you can use any type of oil or moisturizer including olive oil or coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>But will work if you use it sparingly and safely.</li>
            <li>-so don&#x27;t do it like me and show up to work like a peeling lizard..:)</li>
            <li>just make sure you read all the warnings befor using the product.</li>
            <li>But as a facial peeler its wonderful!</li>
            <li>but I made sure to treat the areas with vitamin e after.</li>
            <li>luck!I made sure to treat the areas with vitamin e after.</li>
            <li>The 80% did work better.</li>
            <li>Always have a good PH/Acid neutralizer on hand when using and apply very sparingly.</li>
            <li>Works great, will order some more later.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t even email me the instructions, so I email Santa and had a strongly worded conversation with a door knob.......</li>
            <li>This is a chemical with a strong concentration and if you over do it you will hurt yourself.</li>
            <li>even at 50% is it  STRONG..</li>
            <li>I have flawless skin for the most part, except for those small bumps.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered promptly and works fine</li>
            <li>Your eyes are worth so much more, in fact, you cannot put a price on them.</li>
            <li>results were fabulous.</li>
            <li>The results were fantastic.</li>
            <li>It peeled nicely but I wouldnt use it on my whole face... too scared to get wrinkles</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really hurt, but it did look like a burn and the skin kind of rubbed off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable telling people about this product.</li>
            <li>Now you&#x27;ll have light spots (depending on your skin color) for couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Also great on flat warts</li>
            <li>It is super strong.</li>
            <li>The patience and dilligence was worth it!</li>
            <li>With the right application this product is great, and I plan to do a chemical peel on my face next.</li>
            <li>For me 30% is perfect, it’s not too strong and not to weak.  </li>
            <li>I took this as a good sign and put a band aid on it, removing it later at night to do the steps again.</li>
            <li>Of course it would take more than one application to really remove a tattoo, but I haven&#x27;t tried it again yet, working the nerve up to use it again.</li>
            <li>I found out it works much faster and better with the bandaid.  </li>
            <li>Their reply, &amp;#34;in the future we will do better at making sure the product comes with instructions for use&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I suffer from a mild case NF1  </li>
            <li>, I have had several moles removed over the years but those were considered &amp;#34;suspicious&amp;#34; by my derm (luckily, most checked out okay).</li>
            <li>Okay, I feel like I can finally give an accurate review on this product in regards to mole</li>
            <li>This is powerful stuff</li>
            <li>This product is worth $15, but God forbid that you get it into your eyes.</li>
            <li>The skin was a lot lighter (like you&#x27;d see if a fresh wound heeled)</li>
            <li>But I have had success with it.</li>
            <li>The one near the arm pit hurt the most.</li>
            <li>I used this product to get rid of a few skin tags and found the product to be very effective.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am not doing something right?</li>
            <li>Works great, use in small doses to prevent burning and scarring.</li>
            <li>Works (sorta) seems to do a good job at first at making blemishes like freckles, moles and other skin stuff fade away.</li>
            <li>this was the second time I used 50% TCA peel and because I followed proper care in using it, it worked great.</li>
            <li>I am back in theatre and having a nice complexion is mandatory-I HIGHLY recommend this</li>
            <li>the product left me three huge scars!</li>
            <li>....stings at first...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically this is how I did it for the first mole, and since it worked, I do it with the rest of the ones I want to remove as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am assuming, I have just put it on for the first time.</li>
            <li>The first time diluted to about 30% (am using the 100% product).</li>
            <li>I started dabbing on the bumps and it burned so much!</li>
            <li>The proper mix of water and acid and how many times to apply before stop using.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep your face moisturized daily, and wash with water twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try first .</li>
            <li>I first tried applying with a Q Tip, but that affected the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I used it a year ago the first time.</li>
            <li>the first day, I applied the solution to each location.</li>
            <li>OK, I screwed up again and dribbled on a different mole.</li>
            <li>After checking first with a doctor to make sure it wasn&#x27;t cancerous I did extensive internet research.</li>
            <li>I tried a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; remedy first</li>
            <li>I had lot of spots around my neck and it wasn&#x27;t pretty at all.  </li>
            <li>Really worked well on a skin tag just below my right eye.</li>
            <li>The discoloring of the area is where it got burned and is actually a fine scab, it will come off once healed and pretty quickly if you wash the area with soap and water daily really well.  </li>
            <li>Great product, be careful and dilute because I burned myself, wish it came in a bigger size and peeling for me happened within 3 days.</li>
            <li>I’d like to think that I’m somewhat of an expert when it comes to Chemical peels, only because I had them done professionally 5 times, and did it on my own about 10 times.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is very strong and will quickly wick to the surrounding skin so just barely touch the top of the area and let dry, then reapply if you want repeating the same, cover with a spot bandaid -</li>
            <li>It pretty much didn&#x27;t do anything, but burn my skin.</li>
            <li>If you are going to do a TCA peel, it is better to start with a low strength and do a series of treatments than to do one treatment at high strength.</li>
            <li>As other reviews have said it is very strong and care should be taken when using it, it will burn.</li>
            <li>Works on large mole, peel it over time.</li>
            <li>I read somewhere in the great all knowing internet which said not to use band-aid as it needs to air dry like a wet socks on cloth line.  </li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s strong and need to go through 2 weeks of ugliness before it gets better.  </li>
            <li>This stuff will sting like no other (I diluted mine with water slightly because it was too strong, so I suppose it was more like 45%), but boy does it give results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and this work very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product delivered fast.</li>
            <li>I used too much on the mole on my face and put a band aid on it</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t get too much solution on it.</li>
            <li>There really should be instructions given with this product ?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used 30% TCA peels and it did absolutely nothing for me, so I bumped up to the 50%.</li>
            <li>It doesnt take much of this to burn off what you want to get rid of.</li>
            <li>I applied this to 4 skin tags using a pointy cotton swab and applied too much.</li>
            <li>Result is very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li>I did a whole face peel and did ise a qtip it works for that.</li>
            <li>three days later my complexion is clearer and smooth.</li>
            <li>I applied vitamin e to all areas after the whole process which I think it a must.</li>
            <li>so I tried to be more careful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 days and there is much improvement.</li>
            <li>some hydrogen peroxide onto the wound as the scab was ready to come off.</li>
            <li>I have skin tags on my face its kind of flat but its very obvious.</li>
            <li>I love the idea I was able to buy such a small amount so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>As a physician who does chemical peels with TCA, this stuff must be used by someone familiar with it and with different skin types and colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tca by skin obsession and mua in the past on multiple occasions with great results.</li>
            <li>The 2d treatment was 100%, left on a full 4 minutes and 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>How the whole purchase went smoothly received product faster than expected.</li>
            <li>I have already got rid of all my age spots on my face and my daughters moles and still have more then half in the bottle.</li>
            <li>i mainly got it for peeling off my tatoos, after serveral peels tatoo still there.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend applying some sort of oil or protection to the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>Then I decided on this 50% acid solution since my mole is large and old.</li>
            <li>I used this product to smooth rough skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li>You would think after 3 complete peels there would be a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t completely clear my skin, it REALLY lightened my scars and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Takes time to heal and look normal.</li>
            <li>the area did seem to get darker but i stop using &amp; it kinda turn backto normal now.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>It may sound extreme, but I hoped into the shower</li>
            <li>it looked the exact same as when I started.</li>
            <li>This might not be for everyone so just really be aware of what you are getting into and read all of the instructions before starting the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This might not be for everyone so just really be aware of what you are getting into and read all of the instructions before starting the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t recommend this if you are planning on hot date next week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been couple of months of smooth skin now, but no hot dates as my wife wouldn&#x27;t approve!  </li>
            <li>Some people complained about how they were burnt and how this scarred them, but keep in mind this will only happen if you do not use this safely!</li>
            <li>need more treatments, this little bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li>You just have to be super careful!</li>
            <li>When I apply it I press somewhat hard to make sure that my skin fully absorbs the solution</li>
            <li>I just have a wet paper towel ready to saturate the skin if it burns the skin to much.</li>
            <li>Vaseline will stop the acid from reaching the soft tissue that you don&#x27;t want burned off.</li>
            <li>and I softly dabbed it onto the mole.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does really works i tried the 50% only for the face &amp; neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend that you have a professional to help you and both of your should wear science googles.</li>
            <li>So far I stopped treatment...</li>
            <li>After receiving such severe skin and tissue damage I realized it really is time to stop shopping online.</li>
            <li>When they say professional strength...</li>
            <li>it has done wonders so far.</li>
            <li>It definitely burns so be ready</li>
            <li>Like I said, this one is old-</li>
            <li>Had my wife do a couple of large moles on my back, which was a major chore getting her to do it.</li>
            <li>My first and only use left a nasty-gross chemical burn.</li>
            <li>The 50% TCA for my planter wart on the sole of my foot took several applications and about two weeks for the first peel.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It burned a little but not bad.  </li>
            <li>but I guess I&#x27;m not using a high enough percentage since I haven&#x27;t seen peeling.</li>
            <li>The first few days after the peel are uncomfortable but everything is temporary except the beautiful results last!</li>
            <li>If your thinking of using this concentration for a facial skin peel I highly discourage it, this concentrated is very strong and should only be used for removal of moles, tags, or tattoos slowly and gently as possible.</li>
            <li>first peel was not deep enough so I am now working on second peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, second time around I took my time removing a skin tag(about a month and a half) but the skin tag has been removed and the skin left behind is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Huge raw burn on my back from applying 17 days ago.</li>
            <li>and that was a little embarrassing,but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>you’re not sure which size to go with, maybe this picture will give you some idea of how much you really need.  </li>
            <li>Taking all the safety procedures I did, I barely felt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may want to do multiple applications after it heals completely each time to fully get rid of whatever it is</li>
            <li>So be careful as to how much you apply and when you apply it.</li>
            <li>Be careful because it does burn fast.</li>
            <li>First, read the directions carefully!!</li>
            <li>1 small mole on my face went quickly with just a couple applications.</li>
            <li>It is clearly going to burn your skin off, so when people cry about how they dabbed it all over the place and suddenly they have a chemical burn when it&#x27;s obvious why the have one.</li>
            <li>I would consider a lesser concentration for a skin peel or possibly just going to a licensed professional.</li>
            <li>I used this in combination with &amp;#34;rdl babyface 3&amp;#34; and it helps really get rid of dark spots and scars.</li>
            <li>The other was very stubborn and I plan on trying again with that one later.</li>
            <li>That was the mistake as a little dribbled down causing a nice little burn line.</li>
            <li>With that being said it is very important (I cannot put enough emphasis on these words) to go SLOW!!</li>
            <li>Its fading it so far but looks like a burn victim.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a large mole on my forehead for many years and it is ugly.</li>
            <li>I think that did help to get the acid into the mole and helped with the release of the bad tissue from the good.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a very strong acid which works great</li>
            <li> It was very potent and it burned...</li>
            <li> Happy that I was able to find something that works and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my use..choose strength wisely for your purpose!other than that the product worked fine for me and my use.</li>
            <li> and you will see amazing results.</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as I though</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Keep a blow dryer handy, I need to use one because I have zero pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> I applied as directed and had the baking soda solution handy in case</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> does what it states but beware it is very strong and does burn/</li>
            <li> For some people, even a 10% solution can be very strong.  </li>
            <li> the peel itself works but its very strong the seller did suggest to dilute with water which i did.</li>
            <li> Removed tags and warts but very strong chemical , follow directions .</li>
            <li> Beware very strong but took away my stretch marks on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Be sure to have the baking soda paste handy to use after you treat an area, it stops the burning process and stinging.</li>
            <li> This is by far the strongest and best Chemical Peel Solution I’ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a tingly feeling you get after a shot.</li>
            <li> Feelings more like you got punched there</li>
            <li> I will purchase more products from this seller.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this stuff works</li>
            <li> I thought, it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> At this point, I am more worried this stuff is going to leave a permanent discoloration/scar and the tattoo.</li>
            <li> Make sure it&#x27;s diluted before you use it, works just like</li>
            <li> Wud have been better if it comes with a brush.</li>
            <li> But I thought that was supposed to happen, like most of the reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> Used it for 4 days - no Band-Aid - and was able to pinch off the skin tag.</li>
            <li> better results.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, if you have children around (no matter the age), then you need to make sure that they don&#x27;t have access to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used Vaseline, but I’m sure you can use any type of oil or moisturizer including olive oil or coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> But will work if you use it sparingly and safely.</li>
            <li> -so don&#x27;t do it like me and show up to work like a peeling lizard..:)</li>
            <li> just make sure you read all the warnings befor using the product.</li>
            <li> But as a facial peeler its wonderful!</li>
            <li> but I made sure to treat the areas with vitamin e after.</li>
            <li> luck!I made sure to treat the areas with vitamin e after.</li>
            <li> The 80% did work better.</li>
            <li> Always have a good PH/Acid neutralizer on hand when using and apply very sparingly.</li>
            <li> Works great, will order some more later.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even email me the instructions, so I email Santa and had a strongly worded conversation with a door knob.......</li>
            <li> This is a chemical with a strong concentration and if you over do it you will hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> even at 50% is it  STRONG..</li>
            <li> I have flawless skin for the most part, except for those small bumps.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly and works fine</li>
            <li> Your eyes are worth so much more, in fact, you cannot put a price on them.</li>
            <li> results were fabulous.</li>
            <li> The results were fantastic.</li>
            <li> It peeled nicely but I wouldnt use it on my whole face... too scared to get wrinkles</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really hurt, but it did look like a burn and the skin kind of rubbed off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable telling people about this product.</li>
            <li> Now you&#x27;ll have light spots (depending on your skin color) for couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Also great on flat warts</li>
            <li> It is super strong.</li>
            <li> The patience and dilligence was worth it!</li>
            <li> With the right application this product is great, and I plan to do a chemical peel on my face next.</li>
            <li> For me 30% is perfect, it’s not too strong and not to weak.  </li>
            <li> I took this as a good sign and put a band aid on it, removing it later at night to do the steps again.</li>
            <li> Of course it would take more than one application to really remove a tattoo, but I haven&#x27;t tried it again yet, working the nerve up to use it again.</li>
            <li> I found out it works much faster and better with the bandaid.  </li>
            <li> Their reply, &amp;#34;in the future we will do better at making sure the product comes with instructions for use&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I suffer from a mild case NF1  </li>
            <li> , I have had several moles removed over the years but those were considered &amp;#34;suspicious&amp;#34; by my derm (luckily, most checked out okay).</li>
            <li> Okay, I feel like I can finally give an accurate review on this product in regards to mole</li>
            <li> This is powerful stuff</li>
            <li> This product is worth $15, but God forbid that you get it into your eyes.</li>
            <li> The skin was a lot lighter (like you&#x27;d see if a fresh wound heeled)</li>
            <li> But I have had success with it.</li>
            <li> The one near the arm pit hurt the most.</li>
            <li> I used this product to get rid of a few skin tags and found the product to be very effective.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am not doing something right?</li>
            <li> Works great, use in small doses to prevent burning and scarring.</li>
            <li> Works (sorta) seems to do a good job at first at making blemishes like freckles, moles and other skin stuff fade away.</li>
            <li> this was the second time I used 50% TCA peel and because I followed proper care in using it, it worked great.</li>
            <li> I am back in theatre and having a nice complexion is mandatory-I HIGHLY recommend this</li>
            <li> the product left me three huge scars!</li>
            <li> ....stings at first...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically this is how I did it for the first mole, and since it worked, I do it with the rest of the ones I want to remove as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am assuming, I have just put it on for the first time.</li>
            <li> The first time diluted to about 30% (am using the 100% product).</li>
            <li> I started dabbing on the bumps and it burned so much!</li>
            <li> The proper mix of water and acid and how many times to apply before stop using.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep your face moisturized daily, and wash with water twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try first .</li>
            <li> I first tried applying with a Q Tip, but that affected the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I used it a year ago the first time.</li>
            <li> the first day, I applied the solution to each location.</li>
            <li> OK, I screwed up again and dribbled on a different mole.</li>
            <li> After checking first with a doctor to make sure it wasn&#x27;t cancerous I did extensive internet research.</li>
            <li> I tried a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; remedy first</li>
            <li> I had lot of spots around my neck and it wasn&#x27;t pretty at all.  </li>
            <li> Really worked well on a skin tag just below my right eye.</li>
            <li> The discoloring of the area is where it got burned and is actually a fine scab, it will come off once healed and pretty quickly if you wash the area with soap and water daily really well.  </li>
            <li> Great product, be careful and dilute because I burned myself, wish it came in a bigger size and peeling for me happened within 3 days.</li>
            <li> I’d like to think that I’m somewhat of an expert when it comes to Chemical peels, only because I had them done professionally 5 times, and did it on my own about 10 times.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is very strong and will quickly wick to the surrounding skin so just barely touch the top of the area and let dry, then reapply if you want repeating the same, cover with a spot bandaid -</li>
            <li> It pretty much didn&#x27;t do anything, but burn my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are going to do a TCA peel, it is better to start with a low strength and do a series of treatments than to do one treatment at high strength.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said it is very strong and care should be taken when using it, it will burn.</li>
            <li> Works on large mole, peel it over time.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere in the great all knowing internet which said not to use band-aid as it needs to air dry like a wet socks on cloth line.  </li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s strong and need to go through 2 weeks of ugliness before it gets better.  </li>
            <li> This stuff will sting like no other (I diluted mine with water slightly because it was too strong, so I suppose it was more like 45%), but boy does it give results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and this work very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product delivered fast.</li>
            <li> I used too much on the mole on my face and put a band aid on it</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t get too much solution on it.</li>
            <li> There really should be instructions given with this product ?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 30% TCA peels and it did absolutely nothing for me, so I bumped up to the 50%.</li>
            <li> It doesnt take much of this to burn off what you want to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I applied this to 4 skin tags using a pointy cotton swab and applied too much.</li>
            <li> Result is very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li> I did a whole face peel and did ise a qtip it works for that.</li>
            <li> three days later my complexion is clearer and smooth.</li>
            <li> I applied vitamin e to all areas after the whole process which I think it a must.</li>
            <li> so I tried to be more careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 days and there is much improvement.</li>
            <li> some hydrogen peroxide onto the wound as the scab was ready to come off.</li>
            <li> I have skin tags on my face its kind of flat but its very obvious.</li>
            <li> I love the idea I was able to buy such a small amount so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> As a physician who does chemical peels with TCA, this stuff must be used by someone familiar with it and with different skin types and colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tca by skin obsession and mua in the past on multiple occasions with great results.</li>
            <li> The 2d treatment was 100%, left on a full 4 minutes and 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> How the whole purchase went smoothly received product faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I have already got rid of all my age spots on my face and my daughters moles and still have more then half in the bottle.</li>
            <li> i mainly got it for peeling off my tatoos, after serveral peels tatoo still there.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend applying some sort of oil or protection to the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> Then I decided on this 50% acid solution since my mole is large and old.</li>
            <li> I used this product to smooth rough skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> You would think after 3 complete peels there would be a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t completely clear my skin, it REALLY lightened my scars and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Takes time to heal and look normal.</li>
            <li> the area did seem to get darker but i stop using &amp; it kinda turn backto normal now.</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> It may sound extreme, but I hoped into the shower</li>
            <li> it looked the exact same as when I started.</li>
            <li> This might not be for everyone so just really be aware of what you are getting into and read all of the instructions before starting the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This might not be for everyone so just really be aware of what you are getting into and read all of the instructions before starting the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t recommend this if you are planning on hot date next week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been couple of months of smooth skin now, but no hot dates as my wife wouldn&#x27;t approve!  </li>
            <li> Some people complained about how they were burnt and how this scarred them, but keep in mind this will only happen if you do not use this safely!</li>
            <li> need more treatments, this little bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li> You just have to be super careful!</li>
            <li> When I apply it I press somewhat hard to make sure that my skin fully absorbs the solution</li>
            <li> I just have a wet paper towel ready to saturate the skin if it burns the skin to much.</li>
            <li> Vaseline will stop the acid from reaching the soft tissue that you don&#x27;t want burned off.</li>
            <li> and I softly dabbed it onto the mole.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does really works i tried the 50% only for the face &amp; neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend that you have a professional to help you and both of your should wear science googles.</li>
            <li> So far I stopped treatment...</li>
            <li> After receiving such severe skin and tissue damage I realized it really is time to stop shopping online.</li>
            <li> When they say professional strength...</li>
            <li> it has done wonders so far.</li>
            <li> It definitely burns so be ready</li>
            <li> Like I said, this one is old-</li>
            <li> Had my wife do a couple of large moles on my back, which was a major chore getting her to do it.</li>
            <li> My first and only use left a nasty-gross chemical burn.</li>
            <li> The 50% TCA for my planter wart on the sole of my foot took several applications and about two weeks for the first peel.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It burned a little but not bad.  </li>
            <li> but I guess I&#x27;m not using a high enough percentage since I haven&#x27;t seen peeling.</li>
            <li> The first few days after the peel are uncomfortable but everything is temporary except the beautiful results last!</li>
            <li> If your thinking of using this concentration for a facial skin peel I highly discourage it, this concentrated is very strong and should only be used for removal of moles, tags, or tattoos slowly and gently as possible.</li>
            <li> first peel was not deep enough so I am now working on second peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , second time around I took my time removing a skin tag(about a month and a half) but the skin tag has been removed and the skin left behind is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Huge raw burn on my back from applying 17 days ago.</li>
            <li> and that was a little embarrassing,but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> you’re not sure which size to go with, maybe this picture will give you some idea of how much you really need.  </li>
            <li> Taking all the safety procedures I did, I barely felt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may want to do multiple applications after it heals completely each time to fully get rid of whatever it is</li>
            <li> So be careful as to how much you apply and when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Be careful because it does burn fast.</li>
            <li> First, read the directions carefully!!</li>
            <li> 1 small mole on my face went quickly with just a couple applications.</li>
            <li> It is clearly going to burn your skin off, so when people cry about how they dabbed it all over the place and suddenly they have a chemical burn when it&#x27;s obvious why the have one.</li>
            <li> I would consider a lesser concentration for a skin peel or possibly just going to a licensed professional.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with &amp;#34;rdl babyface 3&amp;#34; and it helps really get rid of dark spots and scars.</li>
            <li> The other was very stubborn and I plan on trying again with that one later.</li>
            <li> That was the mistake as a little dribbled down causing a nice little burn line.</li>
            <li> With that being said it is very important (I cannot put enough emphasis on these words) to go SLOW!!</li>
            <li> Its fading it so far but looks like a burn victim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a large mole on my forehead for many years and it is ugly.</li>
            <li> I think that did help to get the acid into the mole and helped with the release of the bad tissue from the good.</li>
            <li> This solution can be used on other areas I think, but you have to be careful not to harm more delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> Test a small area to see how much is enough or too much.  </li>
            <li> First mole I removed I almost left a permanent scar on my skin because I abandoned my common sense and tried to rush it</li>
            <li> My skin was back to normal after a few days.</li>
            <li> I burned the suckers off ;) Thank you</li>
            <li> Have the baking soda water past ready to go before you even start.</li>
            <li> Initially the tattoo became raised with a white ring around it; then a week later - a dark ring around it, and finally about 10 days later, (after peeling one time)</li>
            <li> works as expected and can burn the skin if not careful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they went on a long vacation and now they are moving back in.  </li>
            <li> It did the same thing as when I used 30%, except this time it peeled twice and a spot in the center peeled a total of 4 times.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel good if you pay attention to it, but it hardly painful if you do other things and ignore</li>
            <li> Takes several applications over several weeks for skin tags and other blemishes.</li>
            <li> Still, I was left with other totally benign moles that I just found unsightly.</li>
            <li> The scabs begin to come off after 2-3 days, and left the skin under neath pink.</li>
            <li> but again dont peel off the burnt spot you need to leave those alone as long as the scab will stay...</li>
            <li> GO SLOW- and don&#x27;t put too much on each time.</li>
            <li> As soon as i got this product i tried it at night, i dip a toothpick just to try it, the 1st day it became red, the second day it became darker and dry and less than a week</li>
            <li> It probably took that long, because these skin tags were bigger than my other ones(I am going to start on them in a week, to give my skin a chance to heal up).  </li>
            <li> So the treated area truned a little white, and I left it on overnight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my upper lip, left it for a little while.</li>
            <li> I bought it to remove a mole but left a deep scar similar to small pox scarring.</li>
            <li> After daily appliaction of 8-10 days, little fellas left my body.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the little guys comming back to the same spots.</li>
            <li> I used a Qtip to apply to a brown spot on my back and was very careful not to get it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, washed my face and pat dry before applying this product.</li>
            <li> Soaked the one side, spread it evenly all over, then soaked up reexcess with dry side</li>
            <li> They will scab over and there will be a red mark for a few weeks- same as after a dermatologist freezes them off.</li>
            <li> The key is to not wash your face right after with soap; only use a neutralizer and (cold) water.</li>
            <li> After 3-4 days the age spots became darker, and didn&#x27;t necessarily scab (like a wound would), but became very dry and dark.</li>
            <li> but I had to do a second round later for the other on my chest.</li>
            <li> as for clearing away black marks (hyperpigment) i dont think its for asian skin.</li>
            <li> could only leave it on for a minute as it started to burn and got a little freaked out.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a little lighting, but not enough to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smaller ones took a little longer-</li>
            <li> I use the 50% for little things and 80% for larger items.</li>
            <li> I would like to try freezing these little guys off next time.</li>
            <li> Some of the mole has let loose already!</li>
            <li> Not even sure its not just a cylinder of water with a bad smell I don&#x27;t recomend</li>
            <li> I did my face only, when I do my neck it itches like crazy when it’s peeling, and I don’t really notice big difference on my neck</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> When the scab falls off, wait for it to heal and put Vitamin E on the pink scar to make it fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please, please, please be extremely careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I washed it off with water/baking soda mixture and then left it alone for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> Your skin will be pink when it falls off but will regain color in about a week.</li>
            <li> You have to be soooooo careful...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try a tooth pick next round.</li>
            <li> Be careful and apply sparingly with a Q-tip.  </li>
            <li> Then, I cut the cotton off of the Q Tip at an angle to form a point, and used the pointed tip to carefully apply the solution to just the skin tag.</li>
            <li> Be careful with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove a few moles, and although it does for awhile, they keep coming back.</li>
            <li> The product works but you must be careful when applying  to your skin a Q tip will help with applying the application.</li>
            <li> Does to job but be extremely careful applying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After ten days I let it rest for a few.</li>
            <li> Now working on a few smaller ones elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I do not blame the product or manufacturer but myself because in a desperate move to get rid of dark spots on my face from acne, I must have used something too strong for the purpose intended.  </li>
            <li> The tag will turn black after couple application, so you&#x27;ll need a button up shirt, long sleeve, etc.</li>
            <li> I removed 8 tags, so, I had 8 bandages(use small clear round ones)on</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> That’s all you need, so a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I used a toothpick to apply only to affected area, and then covered with small bandaids.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else has mentioned, DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE USED OTHER PEELS BEFORE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> will be moving on to other alternative.</li>
            <li> It left me with small scars and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It left blotches of ink for my small star tatt</li>
            <li> Because of its potency, and with any other solution that will rid you of skin tags, use with precision and caution.</li>
            <li> it you put it on any place other than your wart or&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied the TCA using a q-tip every other day for a week with each.</li>
            <li> This product on the other hand did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Use EXTREME caution with this.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Use something other than a Q-tip as that will get on other areas of your skin.</li>
            <li> The skin now is tender and dark pink in color so will apply vitamin E oil until it fades a bit.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when applying</li>
            <li> Tag will dry up and fall off, and a scab will form that will fall off in a few days.  </li>
            <li> A slight sting but that is to be expected</li>
            <li> This chemical is nothing to play with, using on a small area on your body seems somewhat less risky then using it across your entire face.</li>
            <li> The skin will turn a dark brown burnt color like a scab.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful to neutralize after usage or your skin will get raw and sore.  </li>
            <li> and I had a slight particle of this stuff on my hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice on a 1&amp;#34; size, black widow tattoo on my neck.</li>
            <li> My face would take less then like the leg area.</li>
            <li> Not real sure about this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week and the mole and surrounding skin is slightly raised but not like a scab.</li>
            <li> I diluted it and removed a mole from my face, that had spread larger and looked ugly, it&#x27;s now gone, thanks.  </li>
            <li> So I dip the q-tip into the little vial of 50% TCA solution ever so slightly</li>
            <li> I did keep a baking soda mixture nearby for any crazy pain, and ended up using it once on my thigh area when I applied too much liquid which ran/dripped down out of the age spot.  </li>
            <li> I got this little squirt thing that will help me to apply it.</li>
            <li> and I was spraying them off with the shower head and a little drop of water went into my eye and it BURNED.</li>
            <li> Scared me a little.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about using the product because of the acid solution.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moral of the story: This product does work it just might take a little longer than stated.</li>
            <li> Took a little while</li>
            <li> It looks like a little bubble on my arm.</li>
            <li> It will burn/sting for 10-20 seconds after applying (it felt like little burn x13 around my neck).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using cotton swabs as it sucks up too much of this expensive stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times</li>
            <li> then skin sloughs off after a few days...</li>
            <li> I got 50% and dilated it with a few drops of water.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount on my face on a dark spot.  </li>
            <li> after using the peel i did started peeling a few days after.</li>
            <li> I have to say it&#x27;s a green tatt which are the toughest to remove.</li>
            <li> It burns for a few seconds but it works.</li>
            <li> Burns for a few minutes when you put it on, but it will remove skin tags.  </li>
            <li> bought 35% TCA, but I diluted the solution to 30% by mixing it with a few drops of water.  </li>
            <li> I have no scarring left behind</li>
            <li> I used a few drops each morn, let it alone till bedtime, then put on some vitamin E and a bandaid for over night, repeating the process each day.</li>
            <li> and I did this after a few days.</li>
            <li> Please be very careful!!  </li>
            <li> If you got even a slight particle of it on your hands, DO NOT RUB YOUR EYES!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from this.</li>
            <li> I used it on a wart, a mole, and a few small skin tags.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I feel such relief from the constant agitation of seeing those ugly skin tags.</li>
            <li> If the mole is atypical, changing, cancerous, etc., removing it at home will likely only take off the surface portion which would be very dangerous!</li>
            <li> I have used this to remove age spots, small moles, skin tags and milia cysts.</li>
            <li> I even applied to three small milia cysts on my face.</li>
            <li> which is plenty for small jobs.</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 2 weeks to heal.</li>
            <li> it seems to be doing what its suppose to not sure yet of the end result</li>
            <li> I found that the small raised skin tags didn&#x27;t fully go away with one treatment.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to remove some small moles.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes between 5-7 days for my skin to fully peel/heal.</li>
            <li> But, I followed the instructions to the T and within 3 weeks, they dried up and came off!  </li>
            <li> Waste of  money!</li>
            <li> It takes a while, but they will eventually fall off and leave small scars.</li>
            <li> I focused on 2 small moles on the side of my face, a larger raised mole at the base of my neck and a similar mole on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> took forever doing it very slowly and little bit at a time to get rid of this fat skin tag.</li>
            <li> and I go over each area at least 5 times.  </li>
            <li> Just follow the directions and use common sense, so you won&#x27;t hurt yourself.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too slow</li>
            <li> Water it down!!!</li>
            <li> I use a soaked toothpick for very small areas.</li>
            <li> Not for the weak.</li>
            <li> If you do decide to purchase this product remember, GO SLOW if you think your being to cautious GO SLOWER!</li>
            <li> bought this in desperate to remove some small bumps under the eye area.</li>
            <li> to cover up ugly dark tags or warts.</li>
            <li> If you go slow (patience, patience, patience)- don&#x27;t try to rush with cutting or slicing-</li>
            <li> , it feels weird</li>
            <li> have African American skin with terrible, TERRIBLE acne scars.</li>
            <li> on my experience it didnt necessary make the pigment worst</li>
            <li> but if you get carried away, you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s burned my skin very badly, even after I dilutes this acid down  to 35%.</li>
            <li> I went a bit crazy and did about 25 areas.</li>
            <li> Can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of this-</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was mad at me for using the chemical peel method instead of going to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I had a ugly skin tag under my arm that I have been trying to shave around for 20 years -</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to remove some ugly skin tags on my throat and one on my underarm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is very dangerous and should not be used if not a professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the instructions are wrong!!</li>
            <li> and it burned like mad!  </li>
            <li> Not healing and is very painful.</li>
            <li> Please please please, be careful with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> But I looked terrible!</li>
            <li> When the air hits the acid the sting is at its worst.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Follow the instructions and this work very well.  I had no problems with this</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as I though</li>
            <li> This removed skin tags, which was what I ordered it for. However, beware: it does burn and leave a mark for weeks afterward.</li>
            <li> does what it states but beware it is very strong and does burn/ I use baking soda as a neutralizer for the acid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times but I guess I&#x27;m not using a high enough percentage since I haven&#x27;t seen peeling. I will keep trying.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and worked great for me.I love the idea I was able to buy such a small amount so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Be careful. This is powerful stuff....stings at first... then skin sloughs off after a few days... needed two treatments...</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for tag mole. Made me want to go search everyone in the family and use it on them! lol</li>
            <li> I got 50% and dilated it with a few drops of water. On my mole I planned on removing, I wiped it off with rubbing alcohol. This will remove dirt, oil, etc. Next, I put Vaseline on the skin around it. This is a MUST! Vaseline will stop the acid from reaching the soft tissue that you don&#x27;t want burned off. I got a Q-Tip and dipped it in the acid and I softly dabbed it onto the mole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it feels weird but it does not necessarily burn. It&#x27;s more of a tingly feeling you get after a shot. Feelings more like you got punched there then you have acid burning your skin off. It doesn&#x27;t feel good if you pay attention to it, but it hardly painful if you do other things and ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I let the acid sit for a min or so, I noticed that there was a white-ish layering over the mole. I took this as a good sign and put a band aid on it, removing it later at night to do the steps again. I put a band aid on it AGAIN. Some people complained about how they were burnt and how this scarred them, but keep in mind this will only happen if you do not use this safely! IT IS AN ACID. It is clearly going to burn your skin off, so when people cry about how they dabbed it all over the place and suddenly they have a chemical burn when it&#x27;s obvious why the have one. You just have to be super careful! Taking all the safety procedures I did, I barely felt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this is how I did it for the first mole, and since it worked, I do it with the rest of the ones I want to remove as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 - Alcohol around the mole, vaseline around it, dip Q-tip in diluted acid and dab it on mole. Put bandaid on when done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 - Repeat day 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 - Repeat day 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4 - Do nothing. It will turn into a scab thingy overnight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5 - Do nothing either. The scab will eventually come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 6 and those following - When the scab falls off, wait for it to heal and put Vitamin E on the pink scar to make it fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people said after it scabs the mole comes back, but mine haven&#x27;t fully healed yet, so I have no idea. I&#x27;ll update if it does! xoxo I have no idea. I&#x27;ll update if it does! xox</li>
            <li> Please be very careful!!  As a physician who does chemical peels with TCA, this stuff must be used by someone familiar with it and with different skin types and colors. You  could cause permanent damage or scarring.  You should also know how to prevent post-treatment hyperpigmentation and how to treat chemical burns.  For some people, even a 10% solution can be very strong.  If you are going to do a TCA peel, it is better to start with a low strength and do a series of treatments than to do one treatment at high strength.</li>
            <li> I used this product to smooth rough skin on my feet.  It works like a dream!  You have to be careful to neutralize after usage or your skin will get raw and sore.  Test a small area to see how much is enough or too much.  This solution can be used on other areas I think, but you have to be careful not to harm more delicate skin.  I used a small amount on my face on a dark spot.  It worked well but I neutralized after about 2 minutes of application.</li>
            <li> I have skin tags on my face its kind of flat but its very obvious. As soon as i got this product i tried it at night, i dip a toothpick just to try it, the 1st day it became red, the second day it became darker and dry and less than a week i did not even notice that it was gone. It does really works i tried the 50% only for the face &amp; neck.&lt;br /&gt;The product delivered fast. I will purchase more products from this seller. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this stuff works I am assuming, I have just put it on for the first time. I want to give a word of warning though to everyone. Please, please, please be extremely careful with this stuff. First, read the directions carefully!! This stuff will burn off your skin in seconds. It is like acid, it burns your skin on the spot. I cannot imagine what it can do to your eyes. If you got even a slight particle of it on your hands, DO NOT RUB YOUR EYES! Wash your hands like you have never washed them before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to apply this stuff on my back, and I thought, it&#x27;s okay, I got this little squirt thing that will help me to apply it. The slightest drop went onto my skin and it burned! I recommend that you have a professional to help you and both of your should wear science googles. This product is worth $15, but God forbid that you get it into your eyes. Your eyes are worth so much more, in fact, you cannot put a price on them. It may sound extreme, but I hoped into the shower and I had a slight particle of this stuff on my hands and I was spraying them off with the shower head and a little drop of water went into my eye and it BURNED. I just put the shower head onto my eye and prayed that I will not lose my eye. This stuff is acid. Please please please, be careful with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It pretty much didn&#x27;t do anything, but burn my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice on a 1&amp;#34; size, black widow tattoo on my neck. The first time diluted to about 30% (am using the 100% product). It burned, but I left it on for 3-1/2 minutes before washing off - as the instructions said. Initially the tattoo became raised with a white ring around it; then a week later - a dark ring around it, and finally about 10 days later, (after peeling one time) it looked the exact same as when I started. The 2d treatment was 100%, left on a full 4 minutes and 20 seconds. It did the same thing as when I used 30%, except this time it peeled twice and a spot in the center peeled a total of 4 times. The healing process the second time was about 3-1/2 weeks. My friends say it is a tiny bit faded, but I can&#x27;t see the difference.At this point, I am more worried this stuff is going to leave a permanent discoloration/scar and the tattoo. You would think after 3 complete peels there would be a very noticeable difference. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used too much on the mole on my face and put a band aid on it then I went to sleep and have a giant red band aid mark on my cheek, please help? !</li>
            <li> Make sure it&#x27;s diluted before you use it, works just like the drs office just take care in using it</li>
            <li> GReat stuff but can burn skin.  Use sparingly</li>
            <li> I have used this to remove age spots, small moles, skin tags and milia cysts. After reading reviews I used a toothpick to apply only to affected area, and then covered with small bandaids. I went a bit crazy and did about 25 areas. The product does sting, but is tolerable. I did keep a baking soda mixture nearby for any crazy pain, and ended up using it once on my thigh area when I applied too much liquid which ran/dripped down out of the age spot.  I did not wash the solution off the treated areas, but would have if using it for a chemical peel. After 3-4 days the age spots became darker, and didn&#x27;t necessarily scab (like a wound would), but became very dry and dark. Don&#x27;t worry about the areas getting darker, because within a week or so they will peel off! My age spots are gone!  The skin was a lot lighter (like you&#x27;d see if a fresh wound heeled) so I applied Maderma daily and wore sunscreen, and the areas blend in with my skin now. For my darkest moles I repeated the application two days later. I even applied to three small milia cysts on my face. They are much smaller now. With the right application this product is great, and I plan to do a chemical peel on my face next.</li>
            <li> Works great, will order some more later. I use it personally and in my establishment for retail. Wud have been better if it comes with a brush.</li>
            <li> This product is very dangerous and should not be used if not a professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in desperate to remove some small bumps under the eye area. I followed the instructions, washed my face and pat dry before applying this product. The company labeling said to remove skin tags and stuff requires up to 50-80% concentration of TCA, I bought the lowest, 50%. So I dip the q-tip into the little vial of 50% TCA solution ever so slightly so I wouldn&#x27;t get too much solution on it. I started dabbing on the bumps and it burned so much! But I thought that was supposed to happen, like most of the reviewers mentioned. So the treated area truned a little white, and I left it on overnight. Next morning when I checked, I had scabs all over the treated area, and I had to go to work, looking like someone with a skin disease. I have flawless skin for the most part, except for those small bumps. But I looked terrible! My boyfriend was mad at me for using the chemical peel method instead of going to a dermatologist. The scabs begin to come off after 2-3 days, and left the skin under neath pink. I hope it doesn&#x27;t leave a permanent scar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that the bumps are still there, the only thing I got out of this is chemical burn on my face and potentially scarring. Did not remove bumps at all!!</li>
            <li> If the ERLENMEYER&#x27;S LABS can give instructions on how to use this for SKIN TAGS The proper mix of water and acid and how many times to apply before stop using. That would be GREAT !  The stuff burns and leaves marks on your skin for days.  There really should be instructions given with this product ?  Can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> Works (sorta) seems to do a good job at first at making blemishes like freckles, moles and other skin stuff fade away. Takes time to heal and look normal. You may want to do multiple applications after it heals completely each time to fully get rid of whatever it is you want to get rid of. Makes your skin red then scab over for maybe a week or two. So be careful as to how much you apply and when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to the tattoo I applied it to.</li>
            <li> I got this product for facial peels and have not used it as of yet! I will post a review afterwards and I will also post the results and the pain that It may cause during the process.... I will also post the results after healing from the peel! Hopefully it will work great!!! The company has been wonderful in their correspondence about the how&#x27;s with this product so I&#x27;m looking forward to performing the peel!</li>
            <li> It definitely works. I used it on a wart, a mole, and a few small skin tags.&lt;br /&gt;It burns like a sonofabitch for a couple minutes. They will scab over and there will be a red mark for a few weeks- same as after a dermatologist freezes them off.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else has mentioned, DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE USED OTHER PEELS BEFORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have African American skin with terrible, TERRIBLE acne scars. I often can&#x27;t leave my house without make up piled on my face because of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 30% TCA peels and it did absolutely nothing for me, so I bumped up to the 50%. This stuff will sting like no other (I diluted mine with water slightly because it was too strong, so I suppose it was more like 45%), but boy does it give results.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it on for 2 minutes, and then I neutralized it when baking soda and water. The key is to not wash your face right after with soap; only use a neutralizer and (cold) water. Make sure to keep your face moisturized daily, and wash with water twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results were fabulous. While it didn&#x27;t completely clear my skin, it REALLY lightened my scars and evened out my skin tone. I still have to wear make up, but after another couple of TCA peels, my face will finally be scar free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin darkened maybe two shades over a span of 3 days, and shed for about 4 or 5 days. The results were fantastic. 10/10 would recommend!</li>
            <li> Works on large mole, peel it over time. Be patient.</li>
            <li> i dont think chemical peel is for me (asian) the peel itself works but its very strong the seller did suggest to dilute with water which i did. after using the peel i did started peeling a few days after. as for clearing away black marks (hyperpigment) i dont think its for asian skin. on my experience it didnt necessary make the pigment worst but it didnt necessary help ither. will be moving on to other alternative. i mainly got it for peeling off my tatoos, after serveral peels tatoo still there. the area did seem to get darker but i stop using &amp; it kinda turn backto normal now.</li>
            <li> I been using this for 2 weeks to rid a tattoo. Its fading it so far but looks like a burn victim. I do use it a lot. I&#x27;ll update later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 12&lt;br /&gt;Tatt only faded, after 8 treatments. I have to say it&#x27;s a green tatt which are the toughest to remove. It left me with small scars and wrinkles. It left blotches of ink for my small star tatt but Im trying to see if this scar will leave. So far I stopped treatment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my upper lip, left it for a little while. It peeled nicely but I wouldnt use it on my whole face... too scared to get wrinkles n burned.</li>
            <li> Run away from this product. Or do some investigating. There are videos on YouTube that will give additional 411and warnings. I contacted the company via email with my concerns,  related to the total lack of instruction for use on or in the box. My first and only use left a nasty-gross chemical burn. Their reply, &amp;#34;in the future we will do better at making sure the product comes with instructions for use&amp;#34;. That was it...really! They didn&#x27;t even email me the instructions, so I email Santa and had a strongly worded conversation with a door knob.......got the same results.</li>
            <li> Really worked well on a skin tag just below my right eye. Used it for 4 days - no Band-Aid - and was able to pinch off the skin tag. left the area red for a few days, but no worse than liquid nitrogen. Nice.</li>
            <li> This product caused severe chemical burning and tissue damage. I bought it to remove a mole but left a deep scar similar to small pox scarring. I felt violated after using this product. I cannot believe amazon sells this product. After receiving such severe skin and tissue damage I realized it really is time to stop shopping online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so scared I&#x27;ve only tried this once. I probably shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing this item but I just wan&#x27;t to let others know if their on the fence maybe they should keep their money.  I used a Qtip to apply to a brown spot on my back and was very careful not to get it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I could only leave it on for a minute as it started to burn and got a little freaked out.  I washed it off with water/baking soda mixture and then left it alone for a few days.  I did notice a little lighting, but not enough to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used face peels and thought this might be about the same.  When they say professional strength...this company means it.  So keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Have to apply it several times to really big spot.  It burned a little but not bad.  But I have had success with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s burned my skin very badly, even after I dilutes this acid down  to 35%. Be careful. Try first .</li>
            <li> Bought the 8ml. which is plenty for small jobs. I have already got rid of all my age spots on my face and my daughters moles and still have more then half in the bottle. I use a soaked toothpick for very small areas. It doesnt take much of this to burn off what you want to get rid of. Be careful because it does burn fast. I just have a wet paper towel ready to saturate the skin if it burns the skin to much. Never peel your area you have burned.The skin will turn a dark brown burnt color like a scab. It usually takes about 2 weeks to heal. My face would take less then like the leg area. Also great on flat warts but again dont peel off the burnt spot you need to leave those alone as long as the scab will stay...better results. Your skin will be pink when it falls off but will regain color in about a week. Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> the product left me three huge scars! I need a series of surgery to remove!!! My dermatologist is amazed by the fact they are selling this kind of product! And the instructions are wrong!! Following the instructions will give you scars irreversible!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this acid to use on a tattoo. Let me tell you, if you have children around (no matter the age), then you need to make sure that they don&#x27;t have access to this stuff. It is super strong. Definitely not for use on face, get a lower concentration for your face. I put it on the tattoo and before I finished applying it, it started to frost. I wiped it off and neutralized it. It didn&#x27;t really hurt, but it did look like a burn and the skin kind of rubbed off. Scared me a little. Of course it would take more than one application to really remove a tattoo, but I haven&#x27;t tried it again yet, working the nerve up to use it again. A little goes a long way. Use caution.</li>
            <li> I used this product to get rid of a few skin tags and found the product to be very effective. Because of its potency, and with any other solution that will rid you of skin tags, use with precision and caution.</li>
            <li> I just started to use this product (TCA) it seems to be doing what its suppose to not sure yet of the end result that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars. How the whole purchase went smoothly received product faster than expected. I would recommend this seller to anyone in need of this product. Thank you for your prompt service  Erienmeyer&#x27;s lab</li>
            <li> The 50% TCA for my planter wart on the sole of my foot took several applications and about two weeks for the first peel.&lt;br /&gt;The first peel was not deep enough so I am now working on second peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy the 100% for the sole of feet might work faster.&lt;br /&gt;But all said it does work!!</li>
            <li> Removed tags and warts but very strong chemical , follow directions . Best stuff I market if I use as prescribed !</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES WORK!. With that being said it is very important (I cannot put enough emphasis on these words) to go SLOW!! This is not a fix my problem over night solution. This is a chemical with a strong concentration and if you over do it you will hurt yourself. First mole I removed I almost left a permanent scar on my skin because I abandoned my common sense and tried to rush it, second time around I took my time removing a skin tag(about a month and a half) but the skin tag has been removed and the skin left behind is beautiful. If your thinking of using this concentration for a facial skin peel I highly discourage it, this concentrated is very strong and should only be used for removal of moles, tags, or tattoos slowly and gently as possible. I would consider a lesser concentration for a skin peel or possibly just going to a licensed professional. This chemical is nothing to play with, using on a small area on your body seems somewhat less risky then using it across your entire face. If you do decide to purchase this product remember, GO SLOW if you think your being to cautious GO SLOWER! the product will work for you, just give it time to do what it does.</li>
            <li> Use as directed. There is a paper included that gives you the proper strength to use for various treatments.  I found that the small raised skin tags didn&#x27;t fully go away with one treatment.  I used a q-tip stem to apply, it still will run and cause that skin to be burned as well.  Be sure to have the baking soda paste handy to use after you treat an area, it stops the burning process and stinging.</li>
            <li> It was very potent and it burned... remember to dilute product</li>
            <li> Great. I used it for some skin tags I had. It got rid of them within three to four days. I had a big one and that one took about a week. It burns for a few seconds but it works.</li>
            <li> Not real sure about this product.  You have to be soooooo careful...it you put it on any place other than your wart or&lt;br /&gt;skin bump ...it will burn your skin.  I don&#x27;t feel comfortable telling people about this product.B</li>
            <li> OMG, IT BURNS! Yeah, it stings quite a bit for 10 mins or so. I applied this to 4 skin tags using a pointy cotton swab and applied too much. I&#x27;ve only used it for a day, but wanted to reiterate what others have said, use sparingly. The one near the arm pit hurt the most. The pain is gradual and creeps up on you like a ninja, but once it hits... SPLADOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah... I&#x27;m going to try a tooth pick next round. I used some tea tree oil to ease the pain. I don&#x27;t know if the burn would have hurt longer without the tea tree. I don&#x27;t want to find out.</li>
            <li> Burns for a few minutes when you put it on, but it will remove skin tags.  Be careful and apply sparingly with a Q-tip.  Reapply once per day trying to keep product off surrounding skin area.  Tag will dry up and fall off, and a scab will form that will fall off in a few days.  Result is very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a mild case NF1  this product is a life saver. I burned the suckers off ;) Thank you</li>
            <li> Use with caution. This is a very strong acid which works great but if you get carried away, you will be sorry. Always have a good PH/Acid neutralizer on hand when using and apply very sparingly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and used it and received a chemical burn on my back.  They should take this off the market.  I sent it back and I have a scar on my back.  If this is a skin peel, they need to go back to the drawing board.  I had a skin tag I was trying to remove and it burned like mad!  I would not recommend this product to anyone who does not know how to use it.</li>
            <li> Works good, but made scars</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to remove my tattoos/fade them. it has done wonders so far. need more treatments, this little bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my use..choose strength wisely for your purpose!other than that the product worked fine for me and my use.</li>
            <li> great product .thank u a lot.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try and get rid of  a tiny skin tag. As other reviews have said it is very strong and care should be taken when using it, it will burn. I purchased 50% solution which, I understand, is the recommended strength for removing skin tags. I first tried applying with a Q Tip, but that affected the surrounding skin. Then, I cut the cotton off of the Q Tip at an angle to form a point, and used the pointed tip to carefully apply the solution to just the skin tag. It does burn when applied. I applied it 2x a day, in the morning &amp; at night. It took about a month for the skin tag to disappear (it was really tiny). The area around the skin tag was red after the skin tag disappeared. It took 7-10 days for the redness to go away. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about using the product because of the acid solution. I tried it on a couple of tags and they are gone now. Be careful with it. Don&#x27;t use too much. It does burn and discolor you skin. My skin was back to normal after a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove some small moles.  I applied cautiously with q-tip.  Daily, over 10 days. Only scared me.  Did not remove moles. Please do not buy.</li>
            <li> For skin tags, look elsewhere, especially if they are larger than a pin head.  Freezing is probably best.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very strong and will quickly wick to the surrounding skin so just barely touch the top of the area and let dry, then reapply if you want repeating the same, cover with a spot bandaid - I found out it works much faster and better with the bandaid.  The discoloring of the area is where it got burned and is actually a fine scab, it will come off once healed and pretty quickly if you wash the area with soap and water daily really well.  I had a ugly skin tag under my arm that I have been trying to shave around for 20 years - Its gone!  I am working on a couple moles and they are almost gone too.  I spilt some of the stuff on my marble counter though and it ruined the finish so caution is advised.</li>
            <li> I’d like to think that I’m somewhat of an expert when it comes to Chemical peels, only because I had them done professionally 5 times, and did it on my own about 10 times.  After using this solution I’m never using anything else again.  This is by far the strongest and best Chemical Peel Solution I’ve ever used.  I’ve tried Lactic Acid, Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid but none of them comes even close to TCA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 35% TCA, but I diluted the solution to 30% by mixing it with a few drops of water.  For me 30% is perfect, it’s not too strong and not to weak.  I used cotton ball instead of brush.  When I apply it I press somewhat hard to make sure that my skin fully absorbs the solution and I go over each area at least 5 times.  I did my face only, when I do my neck it itches like crazy when it’s peeling, and I don’t really notice big difference on my neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re not sure which size to go with, maybe this picture will give you some idea of how much you really need.  I bought 8ml 35% TCA.  From the picture you can tell that I only used about 1/5 or 20% of the entire thing.  That’s all you need, so a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely want to wipe you face with alcohol before applying the solution, and keep it moisturized.  I used Vaseline, but I’m sure you can use any type of oil or moisturizer including olive oil or coconut oil.  Keep a blow dryer handy, I need to use one because I have zero pain tolerance.  Whatever you do DO NOT try to peel it yourself.  That’s when you will get scars.  It usually takes between 5-7 days for my skin to fully peel/heal.</li>
            <li> Worked good.  Took a big mole/tab off my belly.</li>
            <li> This really works! I suffered from unsightly skin tags on my neck.  It effected my self esteem, was a daily source of embarrassment and I tried everything to remove them, but nothing worked. I couldn&#x27;t afford to have them removed by a dr., so, I tried this out of desperation.  I was afraid of this-it&#x27;s acid.  But, I followed the instructions to the T and within 3 weeks, they dried up and came off!  It probably took that long, because these skin tags were bigger than my other ones(I am going to start on them in a week, to give my skin a chance to heal up).  I am so happy!  I can wear lower neck line shirts, I don&#x27;t have to try to hide them anymore . I feel such relief from the constant agitation of seeing those ugly skin tags. I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from this. Just follow the directions and use common sense, so you won&#x27;t hurt yourself.  I removed 8 tags, so, I had 8 bandages(use small clear round ones)on my neck and that was a little embarrassing,but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> this was the second time I used 50% TCA peel and because I followed proper care in using it, it worked great. My best advice would be DO NOT PICK AT (OR PEEL)  after it begins to peel. If you think you can not follow proper care in using it, then you probably should not even be buying it. I used it a year ago the first time.</li>
            <li> I used this for my warts i&#x27;ve had my whole life. This made literally no difference, in fact I just CUT them out of my hand and leg. Do not buy this as a wart remover.</li>
            <li> It worked well on &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; on the back of both hands and &amp;#34;age skin tags&amp;#34; on my face.But does take a couple of weeks for it to heal.Thats after a several applications.</li>
            <li> Works great, use in small doses to prevent burning and scarring.</li>
            <li> Water it down!!! I suggest 2 parts water to 1 part acid.. It stings!! But will work if you use it sparingly and safely. I did a whole face peel and did ise a qtip it works for that. Soaked the one side, spread it evenly all over, then soaked up reexcess with dry side os q tip. Let ti sit till i couldent take it and spread the bakingsoda mix all over my face. Have the baking soda water past ready to go before you even start.</li>
            <li> took forever doing it very slowly and little bit at a time to get rid of this fat skin tag. applying often will lead to open wound.</li>
            <li> I just received my product earlier this week. I bought the small one and first let me state: this is the strongest chemical peel out there. Read the directions and don&#x27;t just put it all over your face. I made the grave mistake of doing the peel during the week, a work week that is, and my face started to peel..three days later my complexion is clearer and smooth. I am back in theatre and having a nice complexion is mandatory-I HIGHLY recommend this but, if you are newer to doing this sort of thing..I would go lower in percentage on this..even at 50% is it  STRONG..and you will peel-so don&#x27;t do it like me and show up to work like a peeling lizard..:)</li>
            <li> Works well.. just leaves a mark. Or maybe it&#x27;s my skin type.</li>
            <li> I loved the item. i used it and it appears to be working 2 tags feel off. just make sure you read all the warnings befor using the product.</li>
            <li> Huge raw burn on my back from applying 17 days ago. Not healing and is very painful. I even diluted this product 2 parts TCA to 1 part water.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove a few moles, and although it does for awhile, they keep coming back. Maybe I am not doing something right? But as a facial peeler its wonderful! Great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to remove some ugly skin tags on my throat and one on my underarm.  I applied as directed and had the baking soda solution handy in case I got some on my skin.  I had 5 tags and applied the solution to them daily.  After 3 days the largest skin tag came off. Yeah!! The smaller ones took a little longer-but after a 9 days they are all gone.  These had been bothering me for years.  I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was.  It does burn when you 1st put the solution on, but the burn goes away after a couple of minutes.  If you do get some on your regular skin (which I did) just put the baking soda solution on and the pain goes away.  You will have a red mark for a while where the solution touched the skin but that goes away after about a week. I highly recommend this product.  Be very careful when applying and you will see amazing results.</li>
            <li> The product works but you must be careful when applying  to your skin a Q tip will help with applying the application.</li>
            <li> Not for the weak. It will burn when applied if you follow the directionsbut it does what it says. Takes several applications over several weeks for skin tags and other blemishes.</li>
            <li> Beware very strong but took away my stretch marks on my thighs. The first few days after the peel are uncomfortable but everything is temporary except the beautiful results last!</li>
            <li> works perfectly melted away any imperfections. Unlike salicylic acid which is self neutralizing this needs a neutralizer. A slight sting but that is to be expected</li>
            <li> This product worked on my wart in two days. I am thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;The last product I tried worked also, but it cost a fortune. Happy that I was able to find something that works and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he uses it for the yellow marks that were around his eyes. Used since Nov and the spots are almost gone.</li>
            <li> Okay, I feel like I can finally give an accurate review on this product in regards to mole removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, please PLEASE do not remove any moles you have not had checked by a dermatologist. If the mole is atypical, changing, cancerous, etc., removing it at home will likely only take off the surface portion which would be very dangerous! See your doctor first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have had several moles removed over the years but those were considered &amp;#34;suspicious&amp;#34; by my derm (luckily, most checked out okay). Still, I was left with other totally benign moles that I just found unsightly. I tried various home remedies but none worked for me. A friend recommended the TCA acid so I looked into it and decided to give it a go. I focused on 2 small moles on the side of my face, a larger raised mole at the base of my neck and a similar mole on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day, I applied the solution to each location. It definitely burns so be ready and I highly recommend applying some sort of oil or protection to the surrounding skin. I used both petroleum jelly and vitamin e; each did the trick. Now, I got varying results with each location. 1 small mole on my face went quickly with just a couple applications. The other was very stubborn and I plan on trying again with that one later. It is, however, much smaller. Each of the raised moles took quite awhile to remove. I applied the TCA using a q-tip every other day for a week with each. That did the trick for the one on my neck but I had to do a second round later for the other on my chest. I applied vitamin e to all areas after the whole process which I think it a must. Also, you might find covering the area with a bandaid after you apply the TCA or during the healing process beneficial (I did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story: This product does work it just might take a little longer than stated. It is corrosive so it will burn your skin and should be used with caution. I have no scarring left behind but I made sure to treat the areas with vitamin e after. This might not be for everyone so just really be aware of what you are getting into and read all of the instructions before starting the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!I made sure to treat the areas with vitamin e after. This might not be for everyone so just really be aware of what you are getting into and read all of the instructions before starting the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tca by skin obsession and mua in the past on multiple occasions with great results. This product on the other hand did nothing for me. Waste of  money!</li>
            <li> This product worked to remove a mole but even after using as directed I got second degree chemical burns. The mole is gone but I would not use this again. Use EXTREME caution with this.</li>
            <li> works as expected and can burn the skin if not careful</li>
            <li> Tried several times now it does nothing! Not even sure its not just a cylinder of water with a bad smell I don&#x27;t recomend</li>
            <li> Does to job but be extremely careful applying it. Read the other reviews.Use something other than a Q-tip as that will get on other areas of your skin.</li>
            <li> Use to take skin tags off. It takes a while, but they will eventually fall off and leave small scars. Nothing else I have tried works. Only apply with qtip on tag, keep off fingers and surrounding areas.</li>
            <li> Great product, be careful and dilute because I burned myself, wish it came in a bigger size and peeling for me happened within 3 days. I used this in combination with &amp;#34;rdl babyface 3&amp;#34; and it helps really get rid of dark spots and scars.</li>
            <li> Review is for the 50% solution with an addition of the 80%.  I used this to remove moles and it worked. Took a little while but I was in no rush. Actually I was in a rush in the beginning and that was a mistake. I dabbed the acid with a Q-tip on a mole on my face and did it a second time because I couldn&#x27;t see anything had been deposited. That was the mistake as a little dribbled down causing a nice little burn line. It did finally go away so I tried to be more careful. OK, I screwed up again and dribbled on a different mole. That time I learned my lesson. Had my wife do a couple of large moles on my back, which was a major chore getting her to do it. That area stung for awhile but subsided once the bandage was on. When the air hits the acid the sting is at its worst. Did order the 80% as it was in a stalled condition on a couple of the moles. The 80% did work better. I use the 50% for little things and 80% for larger items. It does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 days and there is much improvement. I&#x27;ve had a large mole on my forehead for many years and it is ugly. Family and friends have commented on it and then after noticing it was getting bigger and uglier I decided it had to go. After checking first with a doctor to make sure it wasn&#x27;t cancerous I did extensive internet research. I tried a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; remedy first but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything. Then I decided on this 50% acid solution since my mole is large and old. As someone else said on the 30% site- GO SLOW- and don&#x27;t put too much on each time. I used a few drops each morn, let it alone till bedtime, then put on some vitamin E and a bandaid for over night, repeating the process each day. Someone else mentioned sticking the mole with a sterilized needle to help facilitate the process and I did this after a few days. I think that did help to get the acid into the mole and helped with the release of the bad tissue from the good. If you go slow (patience, patience, patience)- don&#x27;t try to rush with cutting or slicing- it WILL work.&lt;br /&gt;After ten days I let it rest for a few. The mole flattened but is still attached. Now applying a paste of organic apple cider vinegar and baking soda. Some of the mole has let loose already! Like I said, this one is old- and deep- so will take longer to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Update: After one month the mole is gone- Yipee!!! Applied the acid for about two weeks then let it begin the healing. I used caution at all times, even applied (w/ Q tip) some hydrogen peroxide onto the wound as the scab was ready to come off. The skin now is tender and dark pink in color so will apply vitamin E oil until it fades a bit. I am so happy with the result! The patience and dilligence was worth it! Now working on a few smaller ones elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Well I give this one star because it left a burnt/dark mark that is taking forever to fade. I do not blame the product or manufacturer but myself because in a desperate move to get rid of dark spots on my face from acne, I must have used something too strong for the purpose intended.  Pls,pls and pls, do not use on your face.</li>
            <li> Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me - I applied this acid with a toothpick to a medium sized mole on my arm for 4 days. It&#x27;s been about a week and the mole and surrounding skin is slightly raised but not like a scab. It looks like a little bubble on my arm. Is this normal?</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly and works fine</li>
            <li> I diluted it and removed a mole from my face, that had spread larger and looked ugly, it&#x27;s now gone, thanks.  It works well</li>
            <li> moles come back after redness has cleared</li>
            <li> On Tags and Warts review. It works, it&#x27;s strong and need to go through 2 weeks of ugliness before it gets better.  Used tip of toothpick to apply to the tags. I don&#x27;t recommend using cotton swabs as it sucks up too much of this expensive stuff and you&#x27;ll get it on the skin as well.  Do not get it on anywhere eles as it will chemically burn it too.  It will burn/sting for 10-20 seconds after applying (it felt like little burn x13 around my neck).  The tag will turn black after couple application, so you&#x27;ll need a button up shirt, long sleeve, etc. to cover up ugly dark tags or warts. I had lot of spots around my neck and it wasn&#x27;t pretty at all.  It was like miniture beef jerkys hanging on me! So, I don&#x27;t recommend this if you are planning on hot date next week. I read somewhere in the great all knowing internet which said not to use band-aid as it needs to air dry like a wet socks on cloth line.  Besides it would have look wierd with dozen mini band-aid around my neck, not mention the cost of band-aids!  After daily appliaction of 8-10 days, little fellas left my body.  Now you&#x27;ll have light spots (depending on your skin color) for couple of weeks.  It&#x27;s been couple of months of smooth skin now, but no hot dates as my wife wouldn&#x27;t approve!  I can feel the little guys comming back to the same spots. It&#x27;s like they went on a long vacation and now they are moving back in.  Doesn&#x27;t work well on Warts and requires longer applications.  This is my results so yours might be different.  I would like to try freezing these little guys off next time. I hope this review helps, Good luck!  Oh yea, for some humor, in some countries they call these tags \\&quot;Mice Nipples\\&quot; for some reason...</li>
            <li> I used it several tims but it&#x27;s too slow so I had my unwanted tat reworked into a Celtic design instead.</li>
            <li> Works awesome for removing warts and skin tags. Must be diluted though!!</li>
