            <li>Walmart, Kmart, BestBuy, Office Depot not&lt;br /&gt;because of sales tax but because of superior service &amp; superior inventory.</li>

            <li>The scalp master was flemsier than I thought it would be and didn&#x27;t comb through my hair as good as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Veyy good product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found the ideal</li>
            <li>This made the blood flow better and felt so good!  </li>

            <li>So it was great to be able to get them on line!&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>There are so many of these in the package!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>and it makes my scalp cleaner and feeling better!</li>
            <li>So this thing is quite lovely!</li>
            <li>I constantly do manicure so this shampoo brush is excellent in giving a great scalp scrub while keeping my manicure in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Bought 2 for me and the hubby so in love !</li>
            <li>it will get your top in tiptop shape!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this brush is pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>My husband and sons love these!  </li>
            <li>This brush is easy to use, feels great and allowed me to get the product effectively massaged in.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>Feels amazing on my scalp</li>
            <li>On the part of the scalp I can get to it is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this thing feels amazing on the head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>nice to use in the shower</li>
            <li>The loop is good for a finger or two (which is better than the nub type handles).    </li>
            <li>the platform could be more flexible for this application, but it gets in there and feels good once you get the knack of it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would rather use this than my fingers.</li>
            <li>It is compact and effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone should own this scalp-brush...</li>
            <li>Works as described and has a nice lil loop for your finger to go through.</li>
            <li>They love the message, and I love the great cleaning.</li>
            <li>some kind of pet of animal not for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>The bristles are effective without scratching or hurting my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now ain&#x27;t that nice?</li>
            <li>Nice rounded tips.  </li>
            <li>Also use on dogs and horses, works good and they love it.</li>
            <li>Still, it feels good if you are into rougher, more vigorous scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a great job of distributing shampoo throughout your hair and thoroughly clean your scalp.</li>
            <li>and they love it even more than my own nails, which gives me a break!</li>
            <li>Amazing. :)</li>
            <li>Again, it feels nice on my scalp, but I think it&#x27;d feel even better with just a bit of give.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use this one until I can find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway... I use this brush in the shower when I have the Just Natural psoriasis shampoo in my hair and the results are simply amazing!!!</li>
            <li>perfect for scrubbing off old skin</li>
            <li>It is a bit flimsy but still the best one we found so far.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Goody&#x27;s brand better.  </li>
            <li>It really gives your scalp a good cleanse!</li>
            <li>Very effective at revitalizing the scalp and really making shampoo effective.</li>
            <li>Works great for doing exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>This guy is great - really gets my scalp goin!</li>
            <li>We have searched every chain drug store, every dollar store, and never found the right length of bristles, the perfect finger loop, and the right stiffness of the bristles.</li>
            <li>It may be okay if you have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I cant find these where I live and this is the kind I have been searching for ,was so happy to find this scalp brush on Amazon .</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more nubbed endings.</li>
            <li>helps with dandruff more than any shampoo can, and it feels like someone is scratching your head.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and bought several because I&#x27;ll use one on my dog, my kid, gave one to my best friend...etc.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just short of being perfect.  </li>
            <li>They seem to love it.</li>
            <li>I think this might work better for people with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I love them because they scrub my scalp</li>
            <li>On some days it feels ok, but on most its like washing your hair with construction nails.</li>
            <li>Bristles need more flex.</li>
            <li>I always used this brush to comb my hair, and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on line.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love these scalp brushes.  </li>
            <li>Was expecting the bristles to be a bit softer, more like a silicone massage type thing.</li>
            <li>It does the job but Is more flimsy than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Brush works better than my fingers.  </li>
            <li>Well, it actually worked beautifully and I am very pleased with this shampoo brush.</li>
            <li>I  think it should be made in a softer format for those that prefer or need a more massage like effect.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I get the more</li>
            <li>I bought this for my parents who love the feel of these on their scalp.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my scalp feel, should have been named massage therapy because it wakes the scalp up.</li>
            <li>I am working on a design with more pliable bristles.</li>
            <li>Sure am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>love this shower brush.</li>
            <li>Buying more to give to my sister because I love these</li>
            <li>/&gt;MY LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>Brushing my hair also scraped off more skin.</li>
            <li>it does its job :)</li>
            <li>It feels awesome on the scalp, the only thing I wish it was longer bristles/teeth.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I have short hair, but it is still excellent and time saving.</li>
            <li>you shouldn&#x27;t be paying more than a dollar for a plastic brush</li>
            <li>Simply awesome brush for short hairs..</li>
            <li>and really makes your head feel great.</li>
            <li>It works OK</li>
            <li>Its been great and stays on the window sill ready for tomorrow&#x27;s use :)</li>
            <li>Better off not using anything at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, you&#x27;re hitting more surface area of your scalp, so you&#x27;ll reach more than just your fingers.</li>
            <li>Within one or two uses, I could feel my scalp producing oil much more efficiently, that was what sold me.</li>
            <li>This one has the finger hole on top.</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>just make sure you label them with a permanent marker.  </li>
            <li>This product was okay but after using it for a couple of months, the handle on it broke.  </li>
            <li>everything arrive ok and was as described.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if the ends were rounded, it would have been better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wash or rinse my hair</li>
            <li>Tried others, but they were incredibly rigid or too soft...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>forth).&lt;br /&gt;Helps break up psoriasis plaque better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Too many words required.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m set for years :)</li>
            <li>So glad that you have them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic deal, too!</li>
            <li>I know this is a shampoo brush, but it is also an excellent back scratcher or massager, body exfoliator, and self-defense weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo brush.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>my son and I like to use these brushes when we shampoo to keep the scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo brush.</li>
            <li>Since I Have cut two feet off my hair I still love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be better for the scalp since it is made for that.  </li>
            <li>This scalp scrubber worked great when it was shorter than 1&amp;#34;, but any longer, and you really need to work at getting the nubs to touch the scalp.</li>
            <li>I would love to see a product with longer teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good back scratcher :P</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t the most pleasant scrubbing feeling ever but it did the trick.</li>
            <li>Oddly the ones I liked the best came in a five pack.</li>
            <li>Makes the scalp fell fresh!!</li>
            <li>Wonderful scalp massage if short hair that helps shampoos clean  better.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin &amp; this is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I really wanted something to give it a good scrub.</li>
            <li>A must have for Nizoral or other dandruff shampoo, works it in perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This product is well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Stimulating the follicles regularly is also the best prevention against balding, and that&#x27;s definitely worth $3.25.</li>
            <li>Easily to handle because of the loop on its exterior through which you put a couple fingers.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are strong and flexible, so I feel them</li>
            <li>great if you have an itchy scalp, or just like to itch in general.</li>
            <li>liked using this brush so much on my daughter that I bought one for myself!</li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair at age 81, and I feel that stimulating the blood circulation in my scalp with a shampoo brush has contributed to my healthy hair</li>
            <li>it was fine.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.  </li>
            <li>This little brush is wonderful in the shower.</li>
            <li>This little brush is Great!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy, it has held up many months and gives my scalp a more fresh, clean feel after I shower.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>another thing is it&#x27;s so cheap of plastic it cracked</li>
            <li>My scalp is dandruff free ever since I started using this</li>
            <li>Works great on my husbands short hair.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic shampoo brush</li>
            <li>For it being so cheap and comfortable to use, I don&#x27;t mind having to buy it again if I use it to the point of being broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle on my scalp but effective in removing dandruff.</li>
            <li>Great for distributing scalp oils and reducing flakiness (which is actually caused by oil buildup, I discovered).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Thought they no longer were available.</li>
            <li>and I give them away for free for the price.</li>
            <li>For a male with medium length hair this is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simple, cheap solution for kids hair problems.</li>
            <li>So I think this is probably a good brush, but may be better for people with short hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, very reasonably priced, and so comfortable for my scalp when using it. :)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better tool to use right before you hop into the shower to loosen things up.</li>
            <li>I will be looking to replace it as soon as I find one that can stand up to the original Goody brush.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more at first glance.</li>
            <li>I love these things so much!</li>
            <li>Had problems with itchy flaky scalp - used it in the shower with dandruff shampoo and conditioner, this helped eliminate it significantly.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it in hopes of eliminating my dandruff.</li>
            <li>T&#x27;would be even better if the Mfr marketed these handy brushes in multiple packs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my scalp is clean unless I use these, so I was grateful to find on Amazon after I looked everywhere to no avail.</li>
            <li>and this has done wonders to clean my scalp.  </li>
            <li>helps stimulate the scalp and gives your hair a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>not well made teeth to close together good color not worth 4.00 get this at own risk worth about 2.00</li>
            <li>We have bought other brushes in our quest for the perfect shower brush, and were very dissapointed by their performance.  </li>
            <li>I love how these things really make your scalp feel clean and tingly.</li>
            <li>and I think my middle finger is a good 8.5-9 ring</li>
            <li>a 30 second workout feels sooo good.  </li>
            <li>Another feature that this brush has that I really like is the ring on the top.  </li>
            <li>Good back scratcher too</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable and offers a nice sensation when used in scalp massage.</li>
            <li>they love it so much</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal for the price</li>
            <li>Otherwise, not bad..</li>
            <li>It will irritate sensitive skin and most scalps very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and deliverytime fantastic.</li>
            <li>Quick turnaround.</li>
            <li>and I would always have to shampoo my hair multiple times to get my scalp clean, but now since I have this, it saves me time and money in the long run and it also feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>but I love it so far!!</li>
            <li>Then I showered with it and it makes my scalp feel the same kind of clean</li>
            <li>Great product does what it says it does,scalp feels clean every time and not to harsh either, recommend A+</li>
            <li>online and am pleased with the new brush.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great none the less.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>This brush looks pretty cheap worth max 1$.</li>
            <li>Works great for getting shampoo right down to the roots.</li>
            <li>Great little product.</li>
            <li>If they were just a little bit softer this would be great, but if you apply any pressure at all it hurts.</li>
            <li>This little brush is great for cleaning your scalp while shampooing your hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect scalp massage - soft yet firm - keep one in the shower and one on the dresser.  </li>
            <li>Item is worth 25 cents.</li>
            <li>Gently using the Scalpmaster on my cradle cap riddled infants really helped getting rid of the problem, and keeping their scalps healthy.</li>
            <li>But, this brush is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But honestly nothing is enough until you do it with this scalpmaster!</li>
            <li>They make my scalp feel good and really increase the circulation of my entire head.</li>
            <li>It would be better for someone who does not have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I do not find it that useful because the bristles are too flimsy.  </li>
            <li>This out-performs and is worth every cent!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found it quite useful.</li>
            <li>Useful tool for hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is a useful item for scalp massaging and cleaning in a shower.  </li>
            <li>I think I have a more sensitive scalp than some people, or something.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived promptly and is better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find these in stores and they&#x27;re so useful for people that have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I looked in stores for a replacement without any success.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the soft bristles, after buying this product</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the bristles to be more on the soft side.</li>
            <li>an aside, perfect for applying manic panic or other similar hair colors.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something like this for a long time, and boy is it worth more than what I paid!</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of stiffness and makes my scalp tingle.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>The right handle.</li>
            <li>the bristles are just right.</li>
            <li>I have short hair, and it is very easy to scrub my scalp with this brush while I am shampooing.</li>
            <li>I have only used this once so far, but it not only felt good, but it seems effective.</li>
            <li>After a months use, one of the fingers is bent but it still works great on my super thick hair.</li>
            <li>We were afraid that this product was not being manufactured any more, so we were so delighted to see that we&#x27;re able to find one to replace the one he had.  </li>
            <li>in any case prior to finding it on amazon which is my best friend and worst enemy combined-PRIME-it is way to quick for my own good.</li>
            <li>Nice, light, little palm sized scalp scrubber for the shower.  </li>
            <li>More gentle than the average handled hairbrush and easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It provides just the right level of head scratching/massaging with very little effort, covers more territory than fingers, and I&#x27;m happy not to worry about my hair getting caught in winter-dry hangnails and such.</li>
            <li>Regular combs &amp; brushes just can&#x27;t compete with this product, as it gently but effectively removes flakes.  </li>
            <li>You might have to go easy with it if you have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Good little brush to massage your scalp.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 3.5 years old and has pretty fine hair</li>
            <li>The exact length was not specified in the description.  </li>
            <li>It looks like it would fit in a 10 yr old child&#x27;s hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying more brushes.</li>
            <li>the brush that it replaced (purchased over ten years ago) was significantly more sturdy.</li>
            <li>I love how this helps to get those extra skin cells off my scalp</li>
            <li>I wash my hair and it only seems to make the &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; more noticeable, because it releases the scaly skin off my scalp.</li>
            <li>Exactly What I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I had higher hopes for this brush.</li>
            <li>all of the bristles are still straight and intact!</li>
            <li>My thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a daily sufferer of dandruff for many years.  </li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>, it reminds me of my Daddy who used one way back in the day :-)</li>
            <li>My head actually feels better now that I have used this scrubber compared to</li>
            <li>From the first use, my scalp was a world happier.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my husband was looking for</li>
            <li>I think it only comes in purple, but thats okay-</li>
            <li>I would try this first before I bought anything else.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s the first time I buy a product like this</li>
            <li>Rather than helping, it seems to actually cause more damage.</li>
            <li>Product is okay, but the picture is purple and the product I was sent is yellow.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Great for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li>It does the job designed to do, can rub the shampoo in pretty well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm but have a good plastic give.</li>
            <li>This shampoo brush has very strong yet soft bristled and a nice loop on the back to slip your finger through so that you don&#x27;t loose it while your brushing your hair in the bath</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a great rough back rub.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has the finger hole on the back, it makes using it much easier.</li>
            <li>It is only good for those with short hair.</li>
            <li>This coupled with a few good washings with TGEL really seems to help.</li>
            <li>It is not sharp on your scalp but gives a fantastic scratch/massage as you shampoo.</li>
            <li>it works great, but even for relatively short hair, it&#x27;s not worth the extra effort of trying to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li>It seemed strange to buy 24 when I just wanted 2 at the most.</li>
            <li>I love the concept of this scalp brush, but not for those with long hair.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and love this for scrubbing my scalp.  </li>
            <li>inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for, everyone in my house wants one now.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for... something I liked about it is that the little bristles won&#x27;t fall out (Or rather haven&#x27;t fallen out).</li>
            <li>Now, it is not a miracle, I still get build up and have to make sure to really scrub my scalp in the shower, but this brush has had a lot to due with the success.</li>
            <li>bristles are soft/flexible enough and the finger hole makes it easy to hold while using.</li>
            <li>Easy for child to use when washing hair and scalp (assuming short hair).  </li>
            <li>Not sure why that is, but glad that you have them available.</li>
            <li>However, does an excellent job of exfoliating without tangling your hair (and I have thick, long hair) and hangs from a hook.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but a few improvements would make it better.</li>
            <li>It certainly would not be my go to scalp washer massager.</li>
            <li>I hands and fingers aere rather large</li>
            <li>At a sub 5 dollar price you&#x27;ll scare the lice  and be left with your new favorite shower time head brush.  </li>
            <li>love this little brush for my scalp when shampooing - even gave one to my son who is in the Navy and he commented on how much it&#x27;s helped with his dandruff!!</li>
            <li>Pretty good. &amp;#34;Bristles&amp;#34; are a little stiff and widely spaced, but for the price, it functions great for travel or occassional use</li>
            <li>Nice little product.</li>
            <li>this was a good hard scalp brush.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it feel totally awesome, but you can actually see the buildup coming off on the little bristles.</li>
            <li>Child reported the feel of the bristles is better than previous scalp brush (the rectangular kind with sponge on one side, bristles on other).  </li>
            <li>I am very upset.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>And I want my hair shampooed very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I feel my hair is much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like much and didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>and I expected a more rubber like feel, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really rolls the flaky stuff out, and feels good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much cleaner and healthier after using it as does my daughters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bristles are sturdy yet gentle on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>We now have a lifetime supply, for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is very close to what the drug stores used to carry for 99 cents (except the teeth in these are a bit shorter).</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>It works very well, and seems to me, it does its work.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much pressure.</li>
            <li>My middle finger fit in it with room to spare</li>
            <li>Not much to write about, but it is notably a bit flimsy...</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t need to be very robust, but,</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll still tangle up a bit, but it&#x27;s much easier than trying to wrangle it through your bedhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really cleans your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li>Very helpful when washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>so this is very helpful for shampooing them.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to massage their scalp while shampooing.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t end up using it as much as I thought.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for getting too much hair off of my cat, but it does help loosen it up, and he LOVES it</li>
            <li>Really does the job of scrubbing my scalp as I shampoo my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be making my purchase very soon.  </li>
            <li>We could not find them in Stores, so I found them on here and ordered they came in a fast fashion.</li>
            <li>Even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>This is a very flimsy and inexpensively made item.  </li>
            <li>This scrubber really broke up the dandruff in my head.</li>
            <li>It goes through your hair gently, while spreading shampoo evenly.  </li>
            <li>For four bucks, this absolutely gets five stars from me.</li>
            <li>Way too flimsy to be of any real use.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast from here in North America.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need 25, but it&#x27;s a lifetime supply</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>Not for those accustomed to gentle scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>haha, don&#x27;t even try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to do a number on their scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well.</li>
            <li>Much kinder to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Not that good for really thick hair.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold, and I suspect it will last long enough to be more than worth the money I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo brush that I have ever bought, as a matter of fact, I bought four different ones, thinking that it would give me a good comparison, but I like this little brush so much that I never even tried the others.</li>
            <li>Was able to purchase a whole box for the price of two in comparison to other vendors.</li>
            <li>This one does the job admirably, and better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried in terms of comfort and feel.</li>
            <li>but this definitely keeps my scalp massaged and hair clean.  </li>
            <li>so it was not worth much any more.  </li>
            <li>I recently found out I have dandruff and along with my prescription shampoo, I use this brush to stimulate my scalp and clean some of the dandruff out of my hair, when washing and using my cream rinse.</li>
            <li>One note, the bristles are pretty stiff which is what I wanted but just make sure thats something you want.</li>
            <li>I have a dry, itchy scalp, and I love using this to put oil directly on my problem spots.</li>
            <li>Besides, it is very cheaply made and should sell for less than a dollar.</li>
            <li>Mine has held up nicely the past couple of months, but I do wish I bought another to have on hand or to bring with me when I travel.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like the looks of this shampoo brush, but when I used it I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It was exactly like the old brush I used for years but&lt;</li>
            <li>Cheap, thin plastic, very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Good flexibility not stiff or hard on the scalp...</li>
            <li>thank god for this having no fingers washing my hair was a real chore but now with a little duct tape and my nub my hair feels so much better</li>
            <li>and i live it!  </li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>But it works decently for my puppy?</li>
            <li>When ordering the description states &amp;#34;Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush (Pack of 12)&amp;#34;, so I, being able to read American English, took that as there is a pack of 12.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any particular benefit to my scalp in the areas where I could use it.</li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to but to be honest it is a really basic product (like a hair brush you can get wet).  </li>
            <li>such a low price I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For womenI who have longer hair than most men,  I would recommend 2 such shampoo brushes, so you can wash your hair on both sides of the head at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li>I thought it would be big enough to massage shampoo into my hair better than just using my hands, but it did not do that at all.</li>
            <li>I only recently realized these things even exist, but I&#x27;m so glad I got</li>
            <li>Its a decent item.</li>
            <li>But maybe that&#x27;s why the price was so decent.</li>
            <li>Great scalpmaster for thick hair!!</li>
            <li>Was skeptical at first, but this little booger is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>My scalp has never been cleaner in my whole natural life!</li>
            <li>They were plenty stiff to do the job, gave a good massage and the softer material conformed to my head as it went from one curve to the next.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend givin&#x27; it a try..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this thing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this little brush.</li>
            <li>It would be better if they made it a little sturdier.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a little more space between the tines</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute little brush</li>
            <li>I am Irish/Welch, so I have large &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; curls not tight</li>
            <li>I did see where the $14.99 was marked through and the 3.95, or how much it is now for one.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels so much cleaner and stays clear looking longer.</li>
            <li>and I use Head and Shoulders everyday, and I love scalp rubs.</li>
            <li>I need a few more.</li>
            <li>My shopping experience proves once again that Amazon wipes the floor with big box stores</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a complex piece of technology.</li>
            <li>, I do it all the time when I sell stuff on Amazon, its not hard.</li>
            <li>The holder is just right for your middle finger to hold it on your scalp while shampooing.</li>
            <li>This one has too many bristles and they are too stiff.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>It found a new home in the trash bin.</li>
            <li>These have a mild scratching feel on the scalp similar to a hard plastic comb, but with better coverage on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have a shampoo scalp brush (different brand than this one) that I bought years ago and still use that has nice, firm bristles.  </li>
            <li>However the quality is cheap and I would think you could probably find something similar at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li>I would bathe every day, but my old shower-shampoo-condition routine took too much energy some days, so I developed some buildup on my scalp from hair products.</li>
            <li>works ok got to rub easy a little stiff</li>
            <li>They came promptly, almost instantly, were well packed,  and were exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s to put a finger through for better leverage, but it&#x27;s convenient to hang it up on a double hook which is where I keep my other shower tools.  </li>
            <li>The ring on top needs to be smaller and the edges of the ring are too sharp.</li>
            <li>but after a solid month of use, they&#x27;ve held up pretty well.</li>
            <li>This brush isn&#x27;t quite as well made as my previous brushes, but it is adequate and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I was using a nail brush to clean my scalp, but that only worked while my hair was short.</li>
            <li>Does what it says it does, but the bristles are VERY stiff, and the product is very cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t give such a high review to a cheap little piece of imported plastic, but it really does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Being a swimmer, I never had a problem with buildup on my scalp—until I came down with a chronic illness that kept me essentially apartment-bound for the better part of the year.</li>
            <li>I noticed after the major drug stores merged, it is hard to find many products that were useful staples such as this item.</li>
            <li>I use it before i shampoo, during, and after to get as much of the dry skin off as possible and its made my dry scalp much much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It really helps remove build up, and is easy to pull through my thick head of hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tines are flexible, which makes it far more comfortable to use, but I noticed if I pushed down too hard the tines started to bend.</li>
            <li>but after a few uses they soften up and are fine.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll notice I always missed spots that I was sure I scrubbed hard.</li>
            <li>Even the ones that are effective, I have a hard time massaging them into all areas of my scalp thoroughly enough.</li>
            <li>Now I know why he liked it so much and why the cat is addicted to his grooming now!  </li>
            <li>Instead I got the soft plastic wannabe.  </li>
            <li>I get when I get my hair professionally washed and cut.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>My scalp is VERY itchy, and when I wash my hair, I like getting every last flake of dead skin off, and this does the job, if not as comfortably as I&#x27;d like, it gets it done.</li>
            <li>The photo makes it seem like a soft malleable rubber scalp comb.</li>
            <li>Soft like it should be for use in the scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old Goody shampoo brush that is no longer produced.  </li>
            <li>When my old one wore out.</li>
            <li>I had an old shampoo brush that was loosing the teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these to replace my old Goody shampoo brush.</li>
            <li>Soft but thorough brushing through hair.  </li>
            <li>I do like that it is rounded to fit the shape of the scalp and that the bristles are firm.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nicely soft and flexible, yet still do the job.</li>
            <li>I use this brush to fix my three year old&#x27;s knotted hair in the morning and rub off my infant son&#x27;s cradle cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE BRUSH IS GENTLE ENOUGH FOR THE SCALP.  </li>
            <li>It was a total waste of money and probably caused more damage.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotta tell you that it&#x27;s worth the $4 I spent on it.</li>
            <li>I also love that the bristles do not get tangled up in my shoulder length, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick relaxed African American, and I loved using this as a scalp massager.</li>
            <li>I bought it to scrub my scalp where I have psoriasis; the bristles are sharp and a bit painful when scrubbing on the psoriatic patches, but feel good on the healthy parts of my scalp.</li>
            <li>When I first got it I tried it on my dry head and it felt soothing on my scalp.</li>
            <li>nice long bristles that arent too soft or too hard</li>
            <li>It is easy on the scalp, does not tangle the hair, and you actually use less</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first at how effective such a brush would be.</li>
            <li>just wish the bristles were a little longer and sturdier but again, I do have very thick hair so its probably fine for most people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are just long enough to hit the scalp without being so long that they easily tangle hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe you have a significant other that likes you to scratch their back ALL THE TIME!</li>
            <li>got this for my finnicky summer scalp, works well; a little sharper than expected,but not bad.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to those who have the same case as mine.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that is short and the bristles just are not firm enough to be effective at cleaning the scalp through the hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for little kids with thick curly hair!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re long enough and do the right amount of tingling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the problem is that I have too long of hair for these to work really well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work well with long hairs.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and it is long, so I have to section it off to get to my whole scalp.it</li>
            <li>The bristles are also pretty rough.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to brush with too much pressure or you&#x27;ll hurt yourself!</li>
            <li>My hair is straight at about 5-7 inches long, and I can not use it without pulling my hair ou!t!</li>
            <li>(Thanks dry shampoo--NOT)</li>
            <li>This thing really helps with dry skin on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I would have dry patches that eventually led to dandruff and the whole imbalanced oil production was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter</li>
            <li>Wow, I was surprised that this thing actually works.  </li>
            <li>Gets right down to the scalp area.</li>
            <li>Gets right down to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Helps to clear it up fast when you are using it in combination with Tea Tree or some other dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>Small bristles clean the hair well.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, with four people using them (some of us daily), I have never seen a single broken tine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little tough to get to the scalp overall a great product.</li>
            <li>No one has dandruff, we weren&#x27;t buying it for that purpose - its just for general build-up for us, so</li>
            <li>But 24 hours later I am still dander free and usually I&#x27;m already flaky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not harsh if you use it moderately, and you should.&lt;br /&gt;neat</li>
            <li>As well, the handle is far too flimsy, I expect it will break sooner rather than later.  </li>
            <li>I just have to be careful not to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li>When I was young, barbers used brushes like this one to shampoo and to brush back men who wore Evils/James Dean sorts of hair styles.</li>
            <li>the bristles are not strong enough to give my scalp a good scrubbing because of my hair is so thick.</li>
            <li>I noticed much less residual flaking after this first use alone.</li>
            <li>The finger loop on the back is a little small for my large finger, but it would be a good size for a woman or small mans hand.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is pretty stiff, for better or for worse.</li>
            <li>I am natural and have mid back length hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the old Goody shampoo brush, unfortunately, they are no longer being manufactured.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are a little shorter, maybe 1/4 of an inch, but they are adequate for my long hair, and my husband never noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li>A little hard on the scalp but overall great little brush.</li>
            <li>and it really helps to cut down on dandruff issues.</li>
            <li>This brush he can use in the shower and really get down to his scalp</li>
            <li>: The only very tiny demerits of the product are that I wish the single finger loop on the back of the brush were a little bit sturdier or were perhaps a double loop, and I have noticed that it&#x27;s relatively easy for the bristles around the edges to bend back a bit.</li>
            <li>For the past few years though, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a new one and the old one was down to its last teeth.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are pretty stiff.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might be too stiff at first</li>
            <li>This is a small round plastic disc with a loop on top to provide a finger grip.</li>
            <li>so the bristles are not long enough.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle on the scalp, does not tangle the hair, and actually takes less time than using my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t exactly comb hair less than 4&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li>So unless you have thin or baby fine hair</li>
            <li>I was shocked when this arrived, as it seems so flimsy &amp; cheaply made, but it is honestly worth the cost for those with dandruff.  </li>

            <li> So it was great to be able to get them on line!&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> There are so many of these in the package!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> and it makes my scalp cleaner and feeling better!</li>
            <li> So this thing is quite lovely!</li>
            <li> I constantly do manicure so this shampoo brush is excellent in giving a great scalp scrub while keeping my manicure in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Bought 2 for me and the hubby so in love !</li>
            <li> it will get your top in tiptop shape!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this brush is pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> My husband and sons love these!  </li>
            <li> This brush is easy to use, feels great and allowed me to get the product effectively massaged in.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on my scalp</li>
            <li> On the part of the scalp I can get to it is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this thing feels amazing on the head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> nice to use in the shower</li>
            <li> The loop is good for a finger or two (which is better than the nub type handles).    </li>
            <li> the platform could be more flexible for this application, but it gets in there and feels good once you get the knack of it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I would rather use this than my fingers.</li>
            <li> It is compact and effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone should own this scalp-brush...</li>
            <li> Works as described and has a nice lil loop for your finger to go through.</li>
            <li> They love the message, and I love the great cleaning.</li>
            <li> some kind of pet of animal not for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> The bristles are effective without scratching or hurting my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now ain&#x27;t that nice?</li>
            <li> Nice rounded tips.  </li>
            <li> Also use on dogs and horses, works good and they love it.</li>
            <li> Still, it feels good if you are into rougher, more vigorous scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a great job of distributing shampoo throughout your hair and thoroughly clean your scalp.</li>
            <li> and they love it even more than my own nails, which gives me a break!</li>
            <li> Amazing. :)</li>
            <li> Again, it feels nice on my scalp, but I think it&#x27;d feel even better with just a bit of give.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this one until I can find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway... I use this brush in the shower when I have the Just Natural psoriasis shampoo in my hair and the results are simply amazing!!!</li>
            <li> perfect for scrubbing off old skin</li>
            <li> It is a bit flimsy but still the best one we found so far.  </li>
            <li> I liked the Goody&#x27;s brand better.  </li>
            <li> It really gives your scalp a good cleanse!</li>
            <li> Very effective at revitalizing the scalp and really making shampoo effective.</li>
            <li> Works great for doing exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> This guy is great - really gets my scalp goin!</li>
            <li> We have searched every chain drug store, every dollar store, and never found the right length of bristles, the perfect finger loop, and the right stiffness of the bristles.</li>
            <li> It may be okay if you have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I cant find these where I live and this is the kind I have been searching for ,was so happy to find this scalp brush on Amazon .</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be more nubbed endings.</li>
            <li> helps with dandruff more than any shampoo can, and it feels like someone is scratching your head.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought several because I&#x27;ll use one on my dog, my kid, gave one to my best friend...etc.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just short of being perfect.  </li>
            <li> They seem to love it.</li>
            <li> I think this might work better for people with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I love them because they scrub my scalp</li>
            <li> On some days it feels ok, but on most its like washing your hair with construction nails.</li>
            <li> Bristles need more flex.</li>
            <li> I always used this brush to comb my hair, and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on line.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love these scalp brushes.  </li>
            <li> Was expecting the bristles to be a bit softer, more like a silicone massage type thing.</li>
            <li> It does the job but Is more flimsy than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Brush works better than my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Well, it actually worked beautifully and I am very pleased with this shampoo brush.</li>
            <li> I  think it should be made in a softer format for those that prefer or need a more massage like effect.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I get the more</li>
            <li> I bought this for my parents who love the feel of these on their scalp.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my scalp feel, should have been named massage therapy because it wakes the scalp up.</li>
            <li> I am working on a design with more pliable bristles.</li>
            <li> Sure am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> love this shower brush.</li>
            <li> Buying more to give to my sister because I love these</li>
            <li> /&gt;MY LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li> Brushing my hair also scraped off more skin.</li>
            <li> it does its job :)</li>
            <li> It feels awesome on the scalp, the only thing I wish it was longer bristles/teeth.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I have short hair, but it is still excellent and time saving.</li>
            <li> you shouldn&#x27;t be paying more than a dollar for a plastic brush</li>
            <li> Simply awesome brush for short hairs..</li>
            <li> and really makes your head feel great.</li>
            <li> It works OK</li>
            <li> Its been great and stays on the window sill ready for tomorrow&#x27;s use :)</li>
            <li> Better off not using anything at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, you&#x27;re hitting more surface area of your scalp, so you&#x27;ll reach more than just your fingers.</li>
            <li> Within one or two uses, I could feel my scalp producing oil much more efficiently, that was what sold me.</li>
            <li> This one has the finger hole on top.</li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> just make sure you label them with a permanent marker.  </li>
            <li> This product was okay but after using it for a couple of months, the handle on it broke.  </li>
            <li> everything arrive ok and was as described.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if the ends were rounded, it would have been better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wash or rinse my hair</li>
            <li> Tried others, but they were incredibly rigid or too soft...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> forth).&lt;br /&gt;Helps break up psoriasis plaque better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Too many words required.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m set for years :)</li>
            <li> So glad that you have them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic deal, too!</li>
            <li> I know this is a shampoo brush, but it is also an excellent back scratcher or massager, body exfoliator, and self-defense weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo brush.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> my son and I like to use these brushes when we shampoo to keep the scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo brush.</li>
            <li> Since I Have cut two feet off my hair I still love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be better for the scalp since it is made for that.  </li>
            <li> This scalp scrubber worked great when it was shorter than 1&amp;#34;, but any longer, and you really need to work at getting the nubs to touch the scalp.</li>
            <li> I would love to see a product with longer teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good back scratcher :P</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t the most pleasant scrubbing feeling ever but it did the trick.</li>
            <li> Oddly the ones I liked the best came in a five pack.</li>
            <li> Makes the scalp fell fresh!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scalp massage if short hair that helps shampoos clean  better.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin &amp; this is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I really wanted something to give it a good scrub.</li>
            <li> A must have for Nizoral or other dandruff shampoo, works it in perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This product is well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Stimulating the follicles regularly is also the best prevention against balding, and that&#x27;s definitely worth $3.25.</li>
            <li> Easily to handle because of the loop on its exterior through which you put a couple fingers.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are strong and flexible, so I feel them</li>
            <li> great if you have an itchy scalp, or just like to itch in general.</li>
            <li> liked using this brush so much on my daughter that I bought one for myself!</li>
            <li> I have a full head of hair at age 81, and I feel that stimulating the blood circulation in my scalp with a shampoo brush has contributed to my healthy hair</li>
            <li> it was fine.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.  </li>
            <li> This little brush is wonderful in the shower.</li>
            <li> This little brush is Great!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy, it has held up many months and gives my scalp a more fresh, clean feel after I shower.</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> another thing is it&#x27;s so cheap of plastic it cracked</li>
            <li> My scalp is dandruff free ever since I started using this</li>
            <li> Works great on my husbands short hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shampoo brush</li>
            <li> For it being so cheap and comfortable to use, I don&#x27;t mind having to buy it again if I use it to the point of being broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle on my scalp but effective in removing dandruff.</li>
            <li> Great for distributing scalp oils and reducing flakiness (which is actually caused by oil buildup, I discovered).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Thought they no longer were available.</li>
            <li> and I give them away for free for the price.</li>
            <li> For a male with medium length hair this is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple, cheap solution for kids hair problems.</li>
            <li> So I think this is probably a good brush, but may be better for people with short hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very reasonably priced, and so comfortable for my scalp when using it. :)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better tool to use right before you hop into the shower to loosen things up.</li>
            <li> I will be looking to replace it as soon as I find one that can stand up to the original Goody brush.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more at first glance.</li>
            <li> I love these things so much!</li>
            <li> Had problems with itchy flaky scalp - used it in the shower with dandruff shampoo and conditioner, this helped eliminate it significantly.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it in hopes of eliminating my dandruff.</li>
            <li> T&#x27;would be even better if the Mfr marketed these handy brushes in multiple packs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like my scalp is clean unless I use these, so I was grateful to find on Amazon after I looked everywhere to no avail.</li>
            <li> and this has done wonders to clean my scalp.  </li>
            <li> helps stimulate the scalp and gives your hair a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> not well made teeth to close together good color not worth 4.00 get this at own risk worth about 2.00</li>
            <li> We have bought other brushes in our quest for the perfect shower brush, and were very dissapointed by their performance.  </li>
            <li> I love how these things really make your scalp feel clean and tingly.</li>
            <li> and I think my middle finger is a good 8.5-9 ring</li>
            <li> a 30 second workout feels sooo good.  </li>
            <li> Another feature that this brush has that I really like is the ring on the top.  </li>
            <li> Good back scratcher too</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable and offers a nice sensation when used in scalp massage.</li>
            <li> they love it so much</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal for the price</li>
            <li> Otherwise, not bad..</li>
            <li> It will irritate sensitive skin and most scalps very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and deliverytime fantastic.</li>
            <li> Quick turnaround.</li>
            <li> and I would always have to shampoo my hair multiple times to get my scalp clean, but now since I have this, it saves me time and money in the long run and it also feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> but I love it so far!!</li>
            <li> Then I showered with it and it makes my scalp feel the same kind of clean</li>
            <li> Great product does what it says it does,scalp feels clean every time and not to harsh either, recommend A+</li>
            <li> online and am pleased with the new brush.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great none the less.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This brush looks pretty cheap worth max 1$.</li>
            <li> Works great for getting shampoo right down to the roots.</li>
            <li> Great little product.</li>
            <li> If they were just a little bit softer this would be great, but if you apply any pressure at all it hurts.</li>
            <li> This little brush is great for cleaning your scalp while shampooing your hair.  </li>
            <li> Perfect scalp massage - soft yet firm - keep one in the shower and one on the dresser.  </li>
            <li> Item is worth 25 cents.</li>
            <li> Gently using the Scalpmaster on my cradle cap riddled infants really helped getting rid of the problem, and keeping their scalps healthy.</li>
            <li> But, this brush is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> But honestly nothing is enough until you do it with this scalpmaster!</li>
            <li> They make my scalp feel good and really increase the circulation of my entire head.</li>
            <li> It would be better for someone who does not have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I do not find it that useful because the bristles are too flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This out-performs and is worth every cent!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found it quite useful.</li>
            <li> Useful tool for hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a useful item for scalp massaging and cleaning in a shower.  </li>
            <li> I think I have a more sensitive scalp than some people, or something.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and is better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in stores and they&#x27;re so useful for people that have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I looked in stores for a replacement without any success.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the soft bristles, after buying this product</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the bristles to be more on the soft side.</li>
            <li> an aside, perfect for applying manic panic or other similar hair colors.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something like this for a long time, and boy is it worth more than what I paid!</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of stiffness and makes my scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> The right handle.</li>
            <li> the bristles are just right.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, and it is very easy to scrub my scalp with this brush while I am shampooing.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, but it not only felt good, but it seems effective.</li>
            <li> After a months use, one of the fingers is bent but it still works great on my super thick hair.</li>
            <li> We were afraid that this product was not being manufactured any more, so we were so delighted to see that we&#x27;re able to find one to replace the one he had.  </li>
            <li> in any case prior to finding it on amazon which is my best friend and worst enemy combined-PRIME-it is way to quick for my own good.</li>
            <li> Nice, light, little palm sized scalp scrubber for the shower.  </li>
            <li> More gentle than the average handled hairbrush and easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It provides just the right level of head scratching/massaging with very little effort, covers more territory than fingers, and I&#x27;m happy not to worry about my hair getting caught in winter-dry hangnails and such.</li>
            <li> Regular combs &amp; brushes just can&#x27;t compete with this product, as it gently but effectively removes flakes.  </li>
            <li> You might have to go easy with it if you have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Good little brush to massage your scalp.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3.5 years old and has pretty fine hair</li>
            <li> The exact length was not specified in the description.  </li>
            <li> It looks like it would fit in a 10 yr old child&#x27;s hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying more brushes.</li>
            <li> the brush that it replaced (purchased over ten years ago) was significantly more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love how this helps to get those extra skin cells off my scalp</li>
            <li> I wash my hair and it only seems to make the &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; more noticeable, because it releases the scaly skin off my scalp.</li>
            <li> Exactly What I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this brush.</li>
            <li> all of the bristles are still straight and intact!</li>
            <li> My thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a daily sufferer of dandruff for many years.  </li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> , it reminds me of my Daddy who used one way back in the day :-)</li>
            <li> My head actually feels better now that I have used this scrubber compared to</li>
            <li> From the first use, my scalp was a world happier.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my husband was looking for</li>
            <li> I think it only comes in purple, but thats okay-</li>
            <li> I would try this first before I bought anything else.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the first time I buy a product like this</li>
            <li> Rather than helping, it seems to actually cause more damage.</li>
            <li> Product is okay, but the picture is purple and the product I was sent is yellow.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> It does the job designed to do, can rub the shampoo in pretty well.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm but have a good plastic give.</li>
            <li> This shampoo brush has very strong yet soft bristled and a nice loop on the back to slip your finger through so that you don&#x27;t loose it while your brushing your hair in the bath</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a great rough back rub.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has the finger hole on the back, it makes using it much easier.</li>
            <li> It is only good for those with short hair.</li>
            <li> This coupled with a few good washings with TGEL really seems to help.</li>
            <li> It is not sharp on your scalp but gives a fantastic scratch/massage as you shampoo.</li>
            <li> it works great, but even for relatively short hair, it&#x27;s not worth the extra effort of trying to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> It seemed strange to buy 24 when I just wanted 2 at the most.</li>
            <li> I love the concept of this scalp brush, but not for those with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and love this for scrubbing my scalp.  </li>
            <li> inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for, everyone in my house wants one now.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for... something I liked about it is that the little bristles won&#x27;t fall out (Or rather haven&#x27;t fallen out).</li>
            <li> Now, it is not a miracle, I still get build up and have to make sure to really scrub my scalp in the shower, but this brush has had a lot to due with the success.</li>
            <li> bristles are soft/flexible enough and the finger hole makes it easy to hold while using.</li>
            <li> Easy for child to use when washing hair and scalp (assuming short hair).  </li>
            <li> Not sure why that is, but glad that you have them available.</li>
            <li> However, does an excellent job of exfoliating without tangling your hair (and I have thick, long hair) and hangs from a hook.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but a few improvements would make it better.</li>
            <li> It certainly would not be my go to scalp washer massager.</li>
            <li> I hands and fingers aere rather large</li>
            <li> At a sub 5 dollar price you&#x27;ll scare the lice  and be left with your new favorite shower time head brush.  </li>
            <li> love this little brush for my scalp when shampooing - even gave one to my son who is in the Navy and he commented on how much it&#x27;s helped with his dandruff!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. &amp;#34;Bristles&amp;#34; are a little stiff and widely spaced, but for the price, it functions great for travel or occassional use</li>
            <li> Nice little product.</li>
            <li> this was a good hard scalp brush.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it feel totally awesome, but you can actually see the buildup coming off on the little bristles.</li>
            <li> Child reported the feel of the bristles is better than previous scalp brush (the rectangular kind with sponge on one side, bristles on other).  </li>
            <li> I am very upset.</li>
            <li> Very versatile.</li>
            <li> And I want my hair shampooed very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I feel my hair is much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like much and didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> and I expected a more rubber like feel, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really rolls the flaky stuff out, and feels good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much cleaner and healthier after using it as does my daughters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bristles are sturdy yet gentle on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> We now have a lifetime supply, for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is very close to what the drug stores used to carry for 99 cents (except the teeth in these are a bit shorter).</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> It works very well, and seems to me, it does its work.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much pressure.</li>
            <li> My middle finger fit in it with room to spare</li>
            <li> Not much to write about, but it is notably a bit flimsy...</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t need to be very robust, but,</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll still tangle up a bit, but it&#x27;s much easier than trying to wrangle it through your bedhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really cleans your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li> Very helpful when washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> so this is very helpful for shampooing them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to massage their scalp while shampooing.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t end up using it as much as I thought.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for getting too much hair off of my cat, but it does help loosen it up, and he LOVES it</li>
            <li> Really does the job of scrubbing my scalp as I shampoo my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be making my purchase very soon.  </li>
            <li> We could not find them in Stores, so I found them on here and ordered they came in a fast fashion.</li>
            <li> Even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a very flimsy and inexpensively made item.  </li>
            <li> This scrubber really broke up the dandruff in my head.</li>
            <li> It goes through your hair gently, while spreading shampoo evenly.  </li>
            <li> For four bucks, this absolutely gets five stars from me.</li>
            <li> Way too flimsy to be of any real use.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast from here in North America.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need 25, but it&#x27;s a lifetime supply</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Not for those accustomed to gentle scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> haha, don&#x27;t even try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to do a number on their scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well.</li>
            <li> Much kinder to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Not that good for really thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, and I suspect it will last long enough to be more than worth the money I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo brush that I have ever bought, as a matter of fact, I bought four different ones, thinking that it would give me a good comparison, but I like this little brush so much that I never even tried the others.</li>
            <li> Was able to purchase a whole box for the price of two in comparison to other vendors.</li>
            <li> This one does the job admirably, and better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried in terms of comfort and feel.</li>
            <li> but this definitely keeps my scalp massaged and hair clean.  </li>
            <li> so it was not worth much any more.  </li>
            <li> I recently found out I have dandruff and along with my prescription shampoo, I use this brush to stimulate my scalp and clean some of the dandruff out of my hair, when washing and using my cream rinse.</li>
            <li> One note, the bristles are pretty stiff which is what I wanted but just make sure thats something you want.</li>
            <li> I have a dry, itchy scalp, and I love using this to put oil directly on my problem spots.</li>
            <li> Besides, it is very cheaply made and should sell for less than a dollar.</li>
            <li> Mine has held up nicely the past couple of months, but I do wish I bought another to have on hand or to bring with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like the looks of this shampoo brush, but when I used it I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It was exactly like the old brush I used for years but&lt;</li>
            <li> Cheap, thin plastic, very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Good flexibility not stiff or hard on the scalp...</li>
            <li> thank god for this having no fingers washing my hair was a real chore but now with a little duct tape and my nub my hair feels so much better</li>
            <li> and i live it!  </li>
            <li> The older</li>
            <li> But it works decently for my puppy?</li>
            <li> When ordering the description states &amp;#34;Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush (Pack of 12)&amp;#34;, so I, being able to read American English, took that as there is a pack of 12.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any particular benefit to my scalp in the areas where I could use it.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to but to be honest it is a really basic product (like a hair brush you can get wet).  </li>
            <li> such a low price I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For womenI who have longer hair than most men,  I would recommend 2 such shampoo brushes, so you can wash your hair on both sides of the head at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> I thought it would be big enough to massage shampoo into my hair better than just using my hands, but it did not do that at all.</li>
            <li> I only recently realized these things even exist, but I&#x27;m so glad I got</li>
            <li> Its a decent item.</li>
            <li> But maybe that&#x27;s why the price was so decent.</li>
            <li> Great scalpmaster for thick hair!!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first, but this little booger is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> My scalp has never been cleaner in my whole natural life!</li>
            <li> They were plenty stiff to do the job, gave a good massage and the softer material conformed to my head as it went from one curve to the next.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend givin&#x27; it a try..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this thing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little brush.</li>
            <li> It would be better if they made it a little sturdier.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a little more space between the tines</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute little brush</li>
            <li> I am Irish/Welch, so I have large &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; curls not tight</li>
            <li> I did see where the $14.99 was marked through and the 3.95, or how much it is now for one.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels so much cleaner and stays clear looking longer.</li>
            <li> and I use Head and Shoulders everyday, and I love scalp rubs.</li>
            <li> I need a few more.</li>
            <li> My shopping experience proves once again that Amazon wipes the floor with big box stores</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a complex piece of technology.</li>
            <li> , I do it all the time when I sell stuff on Amazon, its not hard.</li>
            <li> The holder is just right for your middle finger to hold it on your scalp while shampooing.</li>
            <li> This one has too many bristles and they are too stiff.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> It found a new home in the trash bin.</li>
            <li> These have a mild scratching feel on the scalp similar to a hard plastic comb, but with better coverage on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have a shampoo scalp brush (different brand than this one) that I bought years ago and still use that has nice, firm bristles.  </li>
            <li> However the quality is cheap and I would think you could probably find something similar at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li> I would bathe every day, but my old shower-shampoo-condition routine took too much energy some days, so I developed some buildup on my scalp from hair products.</li>
            <li> works ok got to rub easy a little stiff</li>
            <li> They came promptly, almost instantly, were well packed,  and were exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s to put a finger through for better leverage, but it&#x27;s convenient to hang it up on a double hook which is where I keep my other shower tools.  </li>
            <li> The ring on top needs to be smaller and the edges of the ring are too sharp.</li>
            <li> but after a solid month of use, they&#x27;ve held up pretty well.</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t quite as well made as my previous brushes, but it is adequate and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I was using a nail brush to clean my scalp, but that only worked while my hair was short.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, but the bristles are VERY stiff, and the product is very cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t give such a high review to a cheap little piece of imported plastic, but it really does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Being a swimmer, I never had a problem with buildup on my scalp—until I came down with a chronic illness that kept me essentially apartment-bound for the better part of the year.</li>
            <li> I noticed after the major drug stores merged, it is hard to find many products that were useful staples such as this item.</li>
            <li> I use it before i shampoo, during, and after to get as much of the dry skin off as possible and its made my dry scalp much much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> It really helps remove build up, and is easy to pull through my thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tines are flexible, which makes it far more comfortable to use, but I noticed if I pushed down too hard the tines started to bend.</li>
            <li> but after a few uses they soften up and are fine.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll notice I always missed spots that I was sure I scrubbed hard.</li>
            <li> Even the ones that are effective, I have a hard time massaging them into all areas of my scalp thoroughly enough.</li>
            <li> Now I know why he liked it so much and why the cat is addicted to his grooming now!  </li>
            <li> Instead I got the soft plastic wannabe.  </li>
            <li> I get when I get my hair professionally washed and cut.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> My scalp is VERY itchy, and when I wash my hair, I like getting every last flake of dead skin off, and this does the job, if not as comfortably as I&#x27;d like, it gets it done.</li>
            <li> The photo makes it seem like a soft malleable rubber scalp comb.</li>
            <li> Soft like it should be for use in the scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Goody shampoo brush that is no longer produced.  </li>
            <li> When my old one wore out.</li>
            <li> I had an old shampoo brush that was loosing the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these to replace my old Goody shampoo brush.</li>
            <li> Soft but thorough brushing through hair.  </li>
            <li> I do like that it is rounded to fit the shape of the scalp and that the bristles are firm.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nicely soft and flexible, yet still do the job.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to fix my three year old&#x27;s knotted hair in the morning and rub off my infant son&#x27;s cradle cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE BRUSH IS GENTLE ENOUGH FOR THE SCALP.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money and probably caused more damage.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotta tell you that it&#x27;s worth the $4 I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I also love that the bristles do not get tangled up in my shoulder length, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick relaxed African American, and I loved using this as a scalp massager.</li>
            <li> I bought it to scrub my scalp where I have psoriasis; the bristles are sharp and a bit painful when scrubbing on the psoriatic patches, but feel good on the healthy parts of my scalp.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I tried it on my dry head and it felt soothing on my scalp.</li>
            <li> nice long bristles that arent too soft or too hard</li>
            <li> It is easy on the scalp, does not tangle the hair, and you actually use less</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first at how effective such a brush would be.</li>
            <li> just wish the bristles were a little longer and sturdier but again, I do have very thick hair so its probably fine for most people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are just long enough to hit the scalp without being so long that they easily tangle hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe you have a significant other that likes you to scratch their back ALL THE TIME!</li>
            <li> got this for my finnicky summer scalp, works well; a little sharper than expected,but not bad.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to those who have the same case as mine.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is short and the bristles just are not firm enough to be effective at cleaning the scalp through the hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for little kids with thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long enough and do the right amount of tingling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the problem is that I have too long of hair for these to work really well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work well with long hairs.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it is long, so I have to section it off to get to my whole scalp.it</li>
            <li> The bristles are also pretty rough.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to brush with too much pressure or you&#x27;ll hurt yourself!</li>
            <li> My hair is straight at about 5-7 inches long, and I can not use it without pulling my hair ou!t!</li>
            <li> (Thanks dry shampoo--NOT)</li>
            <li> This thing really helps with dry skin on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I would have dry patches that eventually led to dandruff and the whole imbalanced oil production was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter</li>
            <li> Wow, I was surprised that this thing actually works.  </li>
            <li> Gets right down to the scalp area.</li>
            <li> Gets right down to the scalp.</li>
            <li> Helps to clear it up fast when you are using it in combination with Tea Tree or some other dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Small bristles clean the hair well.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, with four people using them (some of us daily), I have never seen a single broken tine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little tough to get to the scalp overall a great product.</li>
            <li> No one has dandruff, we weren&#x27;t buying it for that purpose - its just for general build-up for us, so</li>
            <li> But 24 hours later I am still dander free and usually I&#x27;m already flaky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not harsh if you use it moderately, and you should.&lt;br /&gt;neat</li>
            <li> As well, the handle is far too flimsy, I expect it will break sooner rather than later.  </li>
            <li> I just have to be careful not to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li> When I was young, barbers used brushes like this one to shampoo and to brush back men who wore Evils/James Dean sorts of hair styles.</li>
            <li> the bristles are not strong enough to give my scalp a good scrubbing because of my hair is so thick.</li>
            <li> I noticed much less residual flaking after this first use alone.</li>
            <li> The finger loop on the back is a little small for my large finger, but it would be a good size for a woman or small mans hand.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is pretty stiff, for better or for worse.</li>
            <li> I am natural and have mid back length hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the old Goody shampoo brush, unfortunately, they are no longer being manufactured.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a little shorter, maybe 1/4 of an inch, but they are adequate for my long hair, and my husband never noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li> A little hard on the scalp but overall great little brush.</li>
            <li> and it really helps to cut down on dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> This brush he can use in the shower and really get down to his scalp</li>
            <li> : The only very tiny demerits of the product are that I wish the single finger loop on the back of the brush were a little bit sturdier or were perhaps a double loop, and I have noticed that it&#x27;s relatively easy for the bristles around the edges to bend back a bit.</li>
            <li> For the past few years though, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a new one and the old one was down to its last teeth.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are pretty stiff.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might be too stiff at first</li>
            <li> This is a small round plastic disc with a loop on top to provide a finger grip.</li>
            <li> so the bristles are not long enough.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle on the scalp, does not tangle the hair, and actually takes less time than using my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t exactly comb hair less than 4&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> So unless you have thin or baby fine hair</li>
            <li> I was shocked when this arrived, as it seems so flimsy &amp; cheaply made, but it is honestly worth the cost for those with dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It feels durable as well and will probably last a long time, which means you should only order multiple if you have several family members--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scalp brush a few times while shampooing, and I guess it&#x27;s ok for massaging your scalp, but with my long hair, it&#x27;s hard to move around and get all the benefits.</li>
            <li> This on the hand is a harder material, no flex, no conforming and pretty harsh overall.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff enough to massage the scalp but flex enough ride over the bumps that are normal in the human skull and without causing discomfort.    </li>
            <li> I get dandruff pretty bad sometimes and this helps to keep me flake free.</li>
            <li> I used it once in the shower, but since I do not claim to have long hair, or need to use this product to assist when I applied shampoo I will rate it only on the function mentioned above.</li>
            <li> This little brush has really helped with dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little harsh on the head but does the job for the price and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I have rather long hair for a guy, and this helps me keep it from being a giant puffy nightmare.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with scalp plaque psoriasis for a long time (since I was a teen) and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they will last</li>
            <li> Obviously, it still works but for how long?  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the other brush I bought on Amazon called &amp;#34;Shampoo Scalp Massage Brush&amp;#34; is identical to this one, only that brand happens to be a tad more expensive.</li>
            <li> What I especially like is that it helps get the flakes off my dry / dandruffy scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not something you actually want to use on wet hair, unless you want to create breakage.</li>
            <li> Much preferred the double-hook style on the good &#x27;ole (discontinued :() Goody model!!!</li>
            <li> They are just stiff enough to scrub well without being so stiff that they break easily or don&#x27;t give a little with pressure.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be not very firm for scrubbing and the points a little more shallow than usual.</li>
            <li> The plastic is too hard to really massage your head.</li>
            <li> do wish it came a little big bigger to cover a larger surface</li>
            <li> When the box showed up I received one and an empty package where the second one should have been.</li>
            <li> smaller than i had expected</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace an old Goody Shampoo Brush that I have owned for probably 20 years but that has  lost a few &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair it will just get stuck in it.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair you can forget about getting this thing through your hair</li>
            <li> He has searched every store in town, only to come home empty handed.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly long hair, but this still tended to tangle in it when I tried to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, I had almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve lookng for, for a long time.</li>
            <li> guess we&#x27;ll see how long until that happens here.  </li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Unless your hair is 1/4 to 1&amp;#34; long, this brush is not for you.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively long hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this cleans my scalp very well.</li>
            <li> Bristles were a little stiff at first</li>
            <li> Its very useful if you&#x27;re using expensive dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li> Sort of like Goldilocks, too hard, too soft, to long, too short, too \\&quot;ow</li>
            <li> Read some other reviews and same thing.  </li>
            <li> i ordered several other ones and returned b/c</li>
            <li> The tines that are supposed to &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; your scalp are like sharp knives and only scratch and damage your head.  </li>
            <li> I have bouts of dry scalp</li>
            <li> I read that this would help with dandruff and dry skin by brushing my scalp with shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for dry flaky scalp issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also helps a ton for dry scalp and my boys both insist on one.</li>
            <li> But at that point, I had already been fed up with my unusually dry and variable scalp.</li>
            <li> It stimulates your oil glands to help with dry hair.  </li>
            <li> so I had dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Loosens up dry scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li> There is a stiff plastic loop in the middle of the back to slip your finger through for rubbing over your scalp.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to coconut oil to keep my hair soft and shiny and discovered that after applying coconut oil on my hair this little hand comb really helps to get the oil distributed evenly into my hair.</li>
            <li> Harder using with curly long hair</li>
            <li> Buy a couple in case you loose it.</li>
            <li> initially bought this because I thought that it would help with my dandruff, and I had hoped that it would cut down the time it takes me to wash my scalp.</li>
            <li> For hair less than a half inch or so (the back of my head is that short at the moment)</li>
            <li> The plastic loop is big, too big for my small fingers, but I probably won&#x27;t be using the brush anymore anyway.</li>
            <li> Great scrubbing power, but hate the finger hole that is the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34;, as my finger is too small.</li>
            <li> The hole for your finger is oddly shaped and what too big.</li>
            <li> My head doesn&#x27;t have that, but I have mild dandruffy weird thing going on.  </li>
            <li> After I suds up, I take this brush and make little circular motions throughout my entire head, and then starting at the crown work down the nape of my neck...</li>
            <li> The reason why I give this one star is because of how tiring it is to use, especially since I have such long thick</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this would be a stupid purchase, but decided to try it because my scalp gets really dry.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, so I have to be very careful not to pull my hair when I use it.  </li>
            <li> and it is naturally curly and really thick, which makes it hard to get all of the &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; out without completely separating the curls and creating an afro!</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not in a rush, I repeat the massage with my conditioner on, which gives a little extra time for the conditioner to soak in.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a little larger and had the knob that you grasp between two fingers.  </li>
            <li> i saw one of these in an old barbershop and looked hard to find one..</li>
            <li> 2; its pretty small so hard to control &amp; get everywhere</li>
            <li> A few smashes from this sucker, and he&#x27;ll need to use a gentle apricot scrub for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, just a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like scratching your arm with your nails; all you&#x27;re doing is scraping off skin roughly.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I placed the order, and received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I am on my third brush since two of them have gone missing.</li>
            <li> NEVER HURTS TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA AROUND.</li>
            <li> I am a disabled army veteran who muat wash my hair leaning into the shower &amp; using  one hand.</li>
            <li> fact, as a shampoo brush, this thing is a bit rough on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and when I shampoo my customers hair they always ask me to scratch harder, which results in messing up my manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> My scalp was visibly better within just 2 washings, the red bloody sores started to heal and the scaly skin started to sluff off.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is tender on scalp, certainly not to mine.</li>
            <li> It has stiff, loosely spaced bristles about a centimeter long.</li>
            <li> I admit that my thick hair is very short, and that this may not work well for those people with long hair.  </li>
            <li> This is made of a harder plastic (What you would find on a conventional comb) and there is a ring style finger grip on the reverse.</li>
            <li> what to sharp and pointy.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it actually does anything.</li>
            <li> my judgement, the tines are too sharp and too close together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to an error on my part, I ordered 5 instead of 1.  </li>
            <li> use it on dried long hair and scalp like a comb.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this seems like a sturdy brush, and mine is purple, like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Easier to hold than some other brushes.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure that another product will be different.</li>
            <li> Other shampoo brushes are made well, however, they don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> All I can find in the drug stores and pharmacy sections of major general merchandise stores have the short, hard bumps that do not conform to the contour of the skull, and they are uncomfortable and hurt.</li>
            <li> Brush is stiff enough to comb hair, but not too harsh.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s tough on sensitive</li>
            <li> Recommended for those who used to be held down and scrubbed with a very stiff brush in their childhood years, and look back on it fondly.  </li>
            <li> Not too stiff, not too loose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female and this sits in my palm looking a little small.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s hard plastic and quite a bit smaller than I imagined.</li>
            <li> The problems are that one; its hard to hold on to it (The ring size is one size- big)</li>
            <li> The last has lasted at least a year without signs of wear.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning and relegated to the trash.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t even come close, the teeth are short and if you have thick hair, they will not reach your scalp.  </li>
            <li> Prior to buying the Scalpmater Shampoo Brush I was forced to wash my hair with just my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Only problem that I see is if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> It gets down to the scalp for the desired massaging</li>
            <li> , usually I&#x27;m itchy in these dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually hurt a little when I tried massaging my scalp because of the hard plastic.</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard but long enough to reach the scalp for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Apparently not available at any other drug stores that I&#x27;ve checked.</li>
            <li> I can only scrub a very small area of scalp at a time.</li>
            <li> If the tines were just slightly longer...</li>
            <li> I notice that my scalp is less itchy and flakes are reduced by about 75%.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it takes less rinses to get my hair soapy as well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been less than a week.</li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> I wanted something to help make washing my head easier (and less work) and this is it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and wish the bristles were slightly longer.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this are sharper and the &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; of the brush is less rigid.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my son gets this odd buildup in his hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the scalp if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> Does the job-a little prickly.</li>
            <li> Oh well~ a life-time supply as well as little token gifts.</li>
            <li> do wish it was a little softer/more flexible.</li>
            <li> A little breaking in (sandpaper)</li>
            <li> so the hole for the finger is a little snug.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enter this little thing.</li>
            <li> And one has to be careful not to brush too hard</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to get the hang of, but it does minimize the flakes.  </li>
            <li> they just killed the order I think I paid about $15 for them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a lot of items perched on the side of the tub because they leave a messy sticky residue.</li>
            <li> It was ubiquitous a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> they were too firm</li>
            <li> I even use them when shampooing my hair and have brought extras to pass out to friends whose hair is starting to thin.  </li>
            <li> I am a 71 year old lady with arthric hands and shoulders, making washing my hair difficult.  </li>
            <li> Hair gets trapped in it.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased a few of these</li>
            <li> I was concern it might prove too harsh for me &amp; scratch my scalp</li>
            <li> Secret of brush is to go from front of scalp to back of head.</li>
            <li> Feels a little too stiff.</li>
            <li> It was too harsh and stiff for her sore scalp.  </li>
            <li> It is a stiff plastic</li>
            <li> Stiff plastic.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are too stiff for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the bristles too stiff.</li>
            <li> If you just need a little something to do the job then grab it up at this price!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a year now (at least once a day) and it shows no sign of wear-</li>
            <li> The times could be a little longer for really thick hair, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick very thick</li>
            <li> But, if I&#x27;m gentle with it, it&#x27;s not TOO bad, but my tea tree oil shampoo still burns in the scratches after using this thing.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find them in my local barber stores.</li>
            <li> He had one in the past and was loosing the teeth in it</li>
            <li> This is soooooo small (about 1/4 size of my hand).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really stiff, hard plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan though, it&#x27;s difficult to use in long hair even just moving in small circles.</li>
            <li> Had I known that this was false advertising, I would have purchased from a different seller because there were less expensive options than this one.</li>
            <li> the finger loop is a little sharp and uncomfortable though.</li>
            <li> The brushes I have used in the past would slowly shrink (in usable area) as tines broke.</li>
            <li> Product has very stiff plastic bristles.  </li>
            <li> When one got lost or broken, I just picked up another at the drugstore for 99 cents or less.  </li>
            <li> The tines are too small and shallow to get through the hair and into the scalp.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for this brush, and It was hard to find.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to not to pull my hair while I used it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking in stores for awhile for a comb like this to use in the shower, they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use to too often as it seems it can be hard on your scalp</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too flimsy and yet, not too hard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat hard to hold.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.  </li>
            <li> After 15 years of constant itchy scalp and annoying flakes (not responsive to dandruff shampoo or treatment) I decided to try this little $3.00 doodad and figured at worse I would waste a few dollars and call it a day.  </li>
            <li> Firm enough to get dandruff and build up off the scalp, but still flexible to not be painful and ineffective.</li>
            <li> My hair is only jaw length and this tangles it like crazy.</li>
            <li> sucks.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too thick.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I would prefer longer bristles now that my hair is getting longer and it is really thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few months and none of the bristles have broken</li>
            <li> but my hair may be too thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this helps me distribute and rinse out shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> point is that this tool is sturdy, tough, and stiff.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong - trying to drag this thing through my long hair was difficult and tired me out.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Eventually the tines break off and they seem to be impossible to find in local stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I have weak edges</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed and very thick</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dense, hair.</li>
            <li> became totally useless</li>
            <li> a sad thing.....  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to find these at any beauty stores</li>
            <li> my husband loves it and when i ordered it I got him two in case they became difficult to find again.</li>
            <li> Buy the Scalpmaster, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> (Even when sick, my thick curls needed taming!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable in any areas of hair loss.  </li>
            <li> but now it is almost impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> and now they were impossible to find in the sections of baby products.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not so painful that I can&#x27;t use it on the patches.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate combs.</li>
            <li> my fingers never have to touch my filthy scalp ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this at medium pressure, and it scraped the CRAP out of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am not saying it is terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have bouts of dry scalp but this definitely keeps my scalp massaged and hair clean.  Highly recommend. Great value for price.</li>
            <li> what to sharp and pointy.  I thought it was going to be more nubbed endings.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these. When the box showed up I received one and an empty package where the second one should have been. I am very upset. There was supposed to be one for myself and one for my wife.</li>
            <li> Great scalp brush for shampooing hair!</li>
            <li> helps with dandruff more than any shampoo can, and it feels like someone is scratching your head.</li>
            <li> Gave this 5 stars I cant find these where I live and this is the kind I have been searching for ,was so happy to find this scalp brush on Amazon . This brush works great on my scalp good for circulation and leaves my scalp feeling very clean I added another to my wish list so I don&#x27;t need to look any further when I need another holds up well also.</li>
            <li> Great to use if you have dandruff. Helps to clear it up fast when you are using it in combination with Tea Tree or some other dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the shower for over 40 years for use when I shampooed my hair. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Cheap........don&#x27;t like it, it only works if you have very short hair. I tried to use it on my medium length hair and it did not work out so well</li>
            <li> Perfect scalp massage - soft yet firm - keep one in the shower and one on the dresser.  Just have to keep it away from the dog.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking this was a good hard scalp brush.  Instead I got the soft plastic wannabe.  I contacted the seller and he was supposed to send me a return label, but as of yet, I have not received the label.  This is brush is not what it appears.  This picture should be changed.</li>
            <li> This thing can make conditioned lather. My only regret was just buying one. I went ahead and bought several because I&#x27;ll use one on my dog, my kid, gave one to my best friend...etc. It feels amazing and my head feels very good, usually I&#x27;m itchy in these dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, perfect for applying manic panic or other similar hair colors. You&#x27;ll get amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> Would never purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love the old Goody shampoo brush, unfortunately, they are no longer being manufactured.  So I ordered this one.  The bristles are a little shorter, maybe 1/4 of an inch, but they are adequate for my long hair, and my husband never noticed the difference.  They came promptly, almost instantly, were well packed,  and were exactly as advertised.  The exact length was not specified in the description.  We have bought other brushes in our quest for the perfect shower brush, and were very dissapointed by their performance.  Sort of like Goldilocks, too hard, too soft, to long, too short, too \\&quot;ow my head\\&quot;.  This one feels good and works well, it&#x27;s just short of being perfect.  If the tines were just slightly longer...</li>
            <li> It fits in your purse or your pocket.  Never be short of a shampoo brush, a hair brush or a comb.  Very versatile.</li>
            <li> This shampoo brush is a must-have for me because I almost always wear acrylic nails (if not, I do have my nails polished) and I do not want to ruin them just because of shampooing my hair. And I want my hair shampooed very well. This brush does a great job doing that and I have no complaints. I highly recommend this to those who have the same case as mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these things all my life.  When one got lost or broken, I just picked up another at the drugstore for 99 cents or less.  For the past few years though, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a new one and the old one was down to its last teeth.  Thanks Amazon.  I now have enough to share them with my friends and pets.</li>
            <li> I actually use this as a non-frightening cat grooming brush. They seem to love it.</li>
            <li> Great on scalp.  Also good on the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am feeling quite beardly this morning.</li>
            <li> Does the job-a little prickly.</li>
            <li> Zero stars. Item is worth 25 cents. Seriously. Cheap, thin plastic, very cheaply made. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Gently using the Scalpmaster on my cradle cap riddled infants really helped getting rid of the problem, and keeping their scalps healthy. Would recommend for short hair only.</li>
            <li> T&#x27;would be even better if the Mfr marketed these handy brushes in multiple packs.  Y&#x27;know... double yur pleasure ....!!</li>
            <li> After a months use, one of the fingers is bent but it still works great on my super thick hair.</li>
            <li> These are so great to use in the shower. I like the finger hold on the back --makes it easier to run through my hair.</li>
            <li> The reason why I give this one star is because of how tiring it is to use, especially since I have such long thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought this because I thought that it would help with my dandruff, and I had hoped that it would cut down the time it takes me to wash my scalp. I was wrong - trying to drag this thing through my long hair was difficult and tired me out. It also didn&#x27;t make it any cleaner than if I had simply used my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I just ended up throwing this out. I think this might work better for people with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Really good. I have weak edges and I use it all the time.I also use it has a hair brush as well.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on my scalp but I&#x27;m not sure it actually does anything.</li>
            <li> This brush is great.  It gets down to the scalp for the desired massaging you are looking for.</li>
            <li> After 15 years of constant itchy scalp and annoying flakes (not responsive to dandruff shampoo or treatment) I decided to try this little $3.00 doodad and figured at worse I would waste a few dollars and call it a day.  Wow, I was surprised that this thing actually works.  It takes a few minutes to get the hang of, but it does minimize the flakes.  I just plop my shampoo in, rinse, plop on conditioner and while it is percolating on my hair, I massage my scalp with the bristles.  I notice that my scalp is less itchy and flakes are reduced by about 75%.  I don&#x27;t use it daily, just a few times a week.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for... something I liked about it is that the little bristles won&#x27;t fall out (Or rather haven&#x27;t fallen out). It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This is made of a harder plastic (What you would find on a conventional comb) and there is a ring style finger grip on the reverse.</li>
            <li> A little hard on the scalp but overall great little brush.</li>
            <li> Never knew I needed it until I got one. Its very useful if you&#x27;re using expensive dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find one in a store and could not, so I had to order one.  I love them because they scrub my scalp and I feel my hair is much cleaner.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have psoriasis. I bought this along with treatment and let me just say, it feels like I never miss a spot with this thing and I also noticed that my scalp build up went from 2 days to about every 4 days. I wash my hair twice a week now using this and it feels like there&#x27;s nothing on my scalp whenever it&#x27;s time to wash my hair now. I noticed it takes less rinses to get my hair soapy as well. I went from about 3 rinses to 1. I tried treatment before while using my fingers to scrub but I&#x27;ll notice I always missed spots that I was sure I scrubbed hard. This eliminated all of that. I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> Its a great brush. I am unable to find them in my local barber stores. So, I have to come online to get them. It helps with spiking up my hair and its great for the scalp. I absolutely hate combs. But, this brush is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> smaller than i had expected but it&#x27;s great none the less.  I&#x27;m a female and this sits in my palm looking a little small.  It looks like it would fit in a 10 yr old child&#x27;s hand.  I wish it was a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> The company ripped me off  for the money and sent I ordered a bag of 24 and they sent me 1 piece I went to my bank and I showed them the one thing that they sent and I immediately gave me my money back they just killed the order I think I paid about $15 for them another thing is it&#x27;s so cheap of plastic it cracked became totally useless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with dandruff for a loooong while.  Tried everything! But honestly nothing is enough until you do it with this scalpmaster! My scalp is dandruff free ever since I started using this and it&#x27;s been less than a week. Amazing. :)</li>
            <li> I read that this would help with dandruff and dry skin by brushing my scalp with shampoo.  It didn&#x27;t feel like much and didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Maybe my hair is too thick.  I am not too upset about it because the price was low.</li>
            <li> Works great on my husbands short hair. Not so great on my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> nice to use in the shower</li>
            <li> Small bristles clean the hair well.  The finger loop on the back is a little small for my large finger, but it would be a good size for a woman or small mans hand.  It is a stiff plastic and I expected a more rubber like feel, so it gets only 3*.</li>
            <li> perfect shower brush for scalp and shampoo. nice long bristles that arent too soft or too hard</li>
            <li> I have been using this for dry flaky scalp issues.&lt;br /&gt;It really rolls the flaky stuff out, and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not harsh if you use it moderately, and you should.&lt;br /&gt;neat product, works well for me!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, it said a pack of 12, but I only received a pack of 1. When I notified the seller, this was the response: &amp;#34;In Amazon, sellers only offer their price on a per-existing product page. All Amazon seller and Amazon themselves, share the same product listing and sellers do not have any control to change any product details from it. This is why even though the title and description says 12 pack, even though it is priced as 1 pack. To avoid confusion, we try to write this information on the &amp;#34;comment&amp;#34; section of the product page, which is shown when you are selecting which seller you want to buy it from.&amp;#34; I did not see what was in the comment section and since then, the product listing has changed to the correct description. Had I known that this was false advertising, I would have purchased from a different seller because there were less expensive options than this one.</li>
            <li> There are so many of these in the package! But the problem is that I have too long of hair for these to work really well. I would suggest someone who has shorter hair to use these, but for someone who has longer hair use one that has the teeth spaced further apart.</li>
            <li> Everything is great. THANK YOU.😃</li>
            <li> My hair is straight at about 5-7 inches long, and I can not use it without pulling my hair ou!t! So I may use it to scratch my cat</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3.5 years old and has pretty fine hair so I am always looking for ways to help stimulate her hair growth. This shampoo brush has very strong yet soft bristled and a nice loop on the back to slip your finger through so that you don&#x27;t loose it while your brushing your hair in the bath/shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked using this brush so much on my daughter that I bought one for myself! I now can not wash and rinse my hair without it. My hair feels so much cleaner and healthier after using it as does my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to anyone that likes to use a comb in the shower!</li>
            <li> On some days it feels ok, but on most its like washing your hair with construction nails. Bristles need more flex. Get what you pay for here. Gave it two stars cause the dog loves it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Bristles are sturdy yet gentle on the scalp.  This is a fantastic shampoo brush</li>
            <li> Get a more expensive and larger brush if you have long/thick hair because this is made somewhat flimsy. It does it&#x27;s job for my purposes though.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not as soft and pliable as I expected.</li>
            <li> Both my father and I have used these since we were teenagers, respectively. We have searched every chain drug store, every dollar store, and never found the right length of bristles, the perfect finger loop, and the right stiffness of the bristles. These are somewhat rubbery, and the bristles are close together. The loop is good for a finger or two (which is better than the nub type handles).    Plus, these came individually wrapped in the factory plastic retail wrappers.    We now have a lifetime supply, for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like my scalp is clean unless I use these, so I was grateful to find on Amazon after I looked everywhere to no avail. I have used these since childhood and just one would always last a couple years.    I noticed after the major drug stores merged, it is hard to find many products that were useful staples such as this item. It is very close to what the drug stores used to carry for 99 cents (except the teeth in these are a bit shorter). It does the job!  .    It seemed strange to buy 24 when I just wanted 2 at the most. Oh well~ a life-time supply as well as little token gifts.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product!!  We are so grateful that we found it on the net.  We have been looking for something like this for quite a while.  He had one in the past and was loosing the teeth in it so it was not worth much any more.  We were afraid that this product was not being manufactured any more, so we were so delighted to see that we&#x27;re able to find one to replace the one he had.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever!!</li>
            <li> Great scalp scrubber while you&#x27;re shampooing</li>
            <li> Love this! It really gives your scalp a good cleanse!</li>
            <li> I always used this brush to comb my hair, and still love it.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on line.</li>
            <li> I use this to help exfoliate my scalp while in the shower. It works very well and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great Value and it makes my scalp cleaner and feeling better!</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace an old Goody Shampoo Brush that I have owned for probably 20 years but that has  lost a few &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;.  This doesn&#x27;t even come close, the teeth are short and if you have thick hair, they will not reach your scalp.  As well, the handle is far too flimsy, I expect it will break sooner rather than later.  I will be looking to replace it as soon as I find one that can stand up to the original Goody brush.</li>
            <li> Helps scratch the itchy head.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin &amp; this is perfect. I also find it to be prefect for back scratching.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush as a gift for my dad, the title of the product says Pack of 12, but you only get 1!!! So don&#x27;t be deceived by their lies!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these scalp brushes.  They make my scalp feel good and really increase the circulation of my entire head.</li>
            <li> got this for my finnicky summer scalp, works well; a little sharper than expected,but not bad. as an added bonus, it works well for scrubbing my face through a mid length beard from time to time. the platform could be more flexible for this application, but it gets in there and feels good once you get the knack of it.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for this brush, and It was hard to find. It works very well, and seems to me, it does its work.</li>
            <li> Was expecting the bristles to be a bit softer, more like a silicone massage type thing. However, does an excellent job of exfoliating without tangling your hair (and I have thick, long hair) and hangs from a hook. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all of my life? When I first got it I tried it on my dry head and it felt soothing on my scalp. Then I showered with it and it makes my scalp feel the same kind of clean I get when I get my hair professionally washed and cut. It&#x27;s made of plastic, so I suggest buying a couple just in case. Mine has held up nicely the past couple of months, but I do wish I bought another to have on hand or to bring with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great scalpmaster for thick hair!!</li>
            <li> It does the job but Is more flimsy than I thought it would be.  If you&#x27;re looking for something substantial don&#x27;t buy it.  If you just need a little something to do the job then grab it up at this price!</li>
            <li> I have to get another one for myself as my cat has commandeered this one for his own grooming sessions!  But I did try it before using it on the kitty, and I am hooked.  My father always used one of these whenever he shampooed.  Now I know why he liked it so much and why the cat is addicted to his grooming now!  This feels so very good on the scalp.  You don&#x27;t need much pressure. Just brush it over your scalp while shampooing to help distribute the product you are using then keep using it to spread the lather around.  You will not want to stop washing your hair!  I admit that my thick hair is very short, and that this may not work well for those people with long hair.  But for those of us with pixies, crews, flattops, whatever, this is a great tool and a must have in the shower.</li>
            <li> Brush works better than my fingers.  I use brushing motion instead of scrubbing motion, this way my hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled.  And one has to be careful not to brush too hard otherwise hair will fall out.</li>
            <li> I wear braids, and I did use this on my scalp. I tried really hard to not to pull my hair while I used it. All I did was separate my braids and massaged my scalp. Honestly, I would rather use this than my fingers. I&#x27;m definitely buying more brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles seemed flimsy to the touch, but I decided to use it even though I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work so great. Well, it actually worked beautifully and I am very pleased with this shampoo brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has Psoriasis hoping it would help loosen flakes while in the shower.  It was too harsh and stiff for her sore scalp.  It would be better for someone who does not have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> A little harsh on the head but does the job for the price and shipped quickly. The bristles are hard but long enough to reach the scalp for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Product has very stiff plastic bristles.  It is very uncomfortable in any areas of hair loss.  I  think it should be made in a softer format for those that prefer or need a more massage like effect.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I have natural hair and I actually message my scalp with this during my conditioning process.  This has my recommendation.</li>
            <li> I noticed I was getting a lot of product build-up in my bangs (Thanks dry shampoo--NOT) so I purchased this. I love that it has the finger hole on the back, it makes using it much easier. My middle finger fit in it with room to spare and I think my middle finger is a good 8.5-9 ring size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tines are flexible, which makes it far more comfortable to use, but I noticed if I pushed down too hard the tines started to bend. For it being so cheap and comfortable to use, I don&#x27;t mind having to buy it again if I use it to the point of being broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it to be very effective at removing product build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your time, let me know if you have any questions!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s perfect.  My scalp is VERY itchy, and when I wash my hair, I like getting every last flake of dead skin off, and this does the job, if not as comfortably as I&#x27;d like, it gets it done.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The older I get the more my scalp dies I guess....This made the blood flow better and felt so good!  I think it will get flimsy as time goes on - no one takes pride in the quality of their products anymore....a sad thing.....  I did see where the $14.99 was marked through and the 3.95, or how much it is now for one. was there.  I guess they should get rid of that &#x27;pack of 12&#x27;.  But honesty in advertising has never been  very good.....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help for me, I don&#x27;t like it. But it works decently for my puppy? Not what I wanted it for, but I&#x27;ll keep it.&lt;br /&gt;I just saw it said pack of 12... I only got one...</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Christmas stocking stuffer after I heard one of the kiddos planning to take mine home with them</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work well with long hairs.</li>
            <li> Not much to write about, but it is notably a bit flimsy... Not a bad deal for the price and it doesn&#x27;t need to be very robust, but, the brush that it replaced (purchased over ten years ago) was significantly more sturdy. Still...it does what it is supposed to do, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this thing does a great job of getting in-between my hairs and cleaning them.</li>
            <li> I have a shampoo scalp brush (different brand than this one) that I bought years ago and still use that has nice, firm bristles.  I wanted another one to put in my travel bag, so I purchased this one along with another one from another seller on this site for comparison .  I do not find it that useful because the bristles are too flimsy.  I have thick hair that is short and the bristles just are not firm enough to be effective at cleaning the scalp through the hair.  It may be okay if you have very fine hair. Additionally, the other brush I bought on Amazon called &amp;#34;Shampoo Scalp Massage Brush&amp;#34; is identical to this one, only that brand happens to be a tad more expensive.</li>
            <li> This is soooooo small (about 1/4 size of my hand). It is only good for those with short hair. If you have long hair it will just get stuck in it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate very well. It&#x27;s like scratching your arm with your nails; all you&#x27;re doing is scraping off skin roughly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my parents who love the feel of these on their scalp. They are very pleased with the brushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. My hair is relaxed and very thick and I would always have to shampoo my hair multiple times to get my scalp clean, but now since I have this, it saves me time and money in the long run and it also feels wonderful. I definitely recommend this to anyone, no matter what your hair texture is.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It feels great to run it through my hair in the shower. For ladies and gents with long-ish hair (mine is medium length): brush your hair before you get in the shower. It makes it so much easier. It&#x27;ll still tangle up a bit, but it&#x27;s much easier than trying to wrangle it through your bedhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was a little softer/more flexible. It&#x27;s really stiff, hard plastic. Again, it feels nice on my scalp, but I think it&#x27;d feel even better with just a bit of give. For short-haired people, this will be awesome. My husband likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> It is compact and effective. I have rather long hair for a guy, and this helps me keep it from being a giant puffy nightmare.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all unless you have a short boy hair cut.  If you have long hair you can forget about getting this thing through your hair</li>
            <li> I was expecting more at first glance. The photo makes it seem like a soft malleable rubber scalp comb. But it&#x27;s hard plastic and quite a bit smaller than I imagined. But with that said, I put it to use. This product does work quite well! It certainly isn&#x27;t the most pleasant scrubbing feeling ever but it did the trick. I applied shampoo and then started scrubbing in a circular motion and while this did knot my hair up a bit, once it came time for conditioner it was fine. But 24 hours later I am still dander free and usually I&#x27;m already flaky. So this thing is quite lovely!</li>
            <li> This gets up all the dandruff. I use it weekly before getting in the shower. Has helped to reduce the dandruff problem and itchy scalp problem. Wish I knew about this 10 years ago. Going to purchase a spare. Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> The man of the house loves this shampoo brush! He has searched every store in town, only to come home empty handed.&lt;br /&gt;What a great wife I am, to find just what he wanted! Great price too!</li>
            <li> Very effective on beards...</li>
            <li> works ok got to rub easy a little stiff</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find these at any beauty stores so I bought it as an add on item online. I found it to be not very firm for scrubbing and the points a little more shallow than usual.</li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled up and pulls.</li>
            <li> I would prefer longer bristles now that my hair is getting longer and it is really thick. Otherwise, it works.</li>
            <li> I would imagine as a shampoo brush and to do some scalp brushing it will work. The purpose I purchased this item was to perform as a hand brush. I used it once in the shower, but since I do not claim to have long hair, or need to use this product to assist when I applied shampoo I will rate it only on the function mentioned above. Soft like it should be for use in the scalp. 3.5 Stars.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my scalp feel, should have been named massage therapy because it wakes the scalp up.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. It was about 1/3rd the thickness of the plastic brush I was replacing. Didn&#x27;t expect it to be this flimsy.</li>
            <li> This product lets you actually reach your scalp when washing and rinsing your hair. Great little product. I keep one at home in the shower and one in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I love how this helps to get those extra skin cells off my scalp</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo brush that I have ever bought, as a matter of fact, I bought four different ones, thinking that it would give me a good comparison, but I like this little brush so much that I never even tried the others. The bristles are strong and flexible, so I feel them but they don&#x27;t hurt, scratch or scrape. I also love that the bristles do not get tangled up in my shoulder length, thick hair.  After I suds up, I take this brush and make little circular motions throughout my entire head, and then starting at the crown work down the nape of my neck...a 30 second workout feels sooo good.  If I&#x27;m not in a rush, I repeat the massage with my conditioner on, which gives a little extra time for the conditioner to soak in. Clean-up is a snap, just rinse under water. Another feature that this brush has that I really like is the ring on the top.  I guess it&#x27;s to put a finger through for better leverage, but it&#x27;s convenient to hang it up on a double hook which is where I keep my other shower tools.  I don&#x27;t like a lot of items perched on the side of the tub because they leave a messy sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Stiff plastic.  It hurts, but that is what you deserve.  Recommended for those who used to be held down and scrubbed with a very stiff brush in their childhood years, and look back on it fondly.  I am working on a design with more pliable bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these things for years. Eventually the tines break off and they seem to be impossible to find in local stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;In my judgement, the tines are too sharp and too close together.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this one until I can find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and as I  remember from days past with brushes I have had.... Sure am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has psoriasis to help break up the patches. He seems to like it and it&#x27;s worked well. I&#x27;m not a fan though, it&#x27;s difficult to use in long hair even just moving in small circles. The bristles are also pretty rough.</li>
            <li> This little brush is wonderful in the shower. It&#x27;s like a mini scalp massage each time! It really helps remove build up, and is easy to pull through my thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> This thing really helps with dry skin on my scalp. It does its job well. I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few months and none of the bristles have broken and it&#x27;s kept its stiffness. I use it before i shampoo, during, and after to get as much of the dry skin off as possible and its made my dry scalp much much more manageable.  The holder is just right for your middle finger to hold it on your scalp while shampooing. The bristles are just long enough to hit the scalp without being so long that they easily tangle hair. They are just stiff enough to scrub well without being so stiff that they break easily or don&#x27;t give a little with pressure.  I normally wouldn&#x27;t give such a high review to a cheap little piece of imported plastic, but it really does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I love these things so much! I cannot wash my hair without using one. It removes all of my flakes and it just feels good on my scalp. I just have to be careful not to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li> It functions but its flimsy to me</li>
            <li> feels so good when washing hair with this. really cleans your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Prior to buying the Scalpmater Shampoo Brush I was forced to wash my hair with just my fingers.  Oftentimes I would find myself fumbling for where on my head I should place each of my ten digits, and don&#x27;t even get me started with all the complexities of coordinating shampoo throughout the entire surface of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I regularly use the Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush my fingers never have to touch my filthy scalp ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Scalpmaster!</li>
            <li> Works great, feels good.  I use it in conjunction with T-Sal shampoo with great results.</li>
            <li> Works great for doing exactly what I want it to do. I use it to help get rid of hairspray/gel products and some dandruff on my scalp when washing my hair.</li>
            <li> love this shower brush. My hair and scalp feel so much cleaner and it really helps to cut down on dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> When ordering the description states &amp;#34;Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush (Pack of 12)&amp;#34;, so I, being able to read American English, took that as there is a pack of 12.  You only get one.  Read some other reviews and same thing.  If you are going to put &amp;#34;Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush (Pack of 12)&amp;#34; then please send 12, or change your description, I do it all the time when I sell stuff on Amazon, its not hard.</li>
            <li> This out-performs and is worth every cent!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should own this scalp-brush... I highly recommend givin&#x27; it a try..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Ryan Reid~</li>
            <li> I ordered this to stimulate my scalp because I was experiencing some hair loss.  Well, instead, my hair would get all tangled up in it, and it scratched my scalp.  It was a total waste of money and probably caused more damage.  It found a new home in the trash bin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Goody shampoo brush that is no longer produced.  In fact, Walgreen did not even stock a replacement.  This brush isn&#x27;t quite as well made as my previous brushes, but it is adequate and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have used a shampoo brush for years.  When my old one wore out. I decided to order another.  Due to an error on my part, I ordered 5 instead of 1.  Soooooo, I gave the extras away to good friends that wold like to keep what hair they have.  I have a full head of hair at age 81, and I feel that stimulating the blood circulation in my scalp with a shampoo brush has contributed to my healthy hair</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but a few improvements would make it better. 1) bristles need to be longer, especially for those with longer hair. 2) The ring on top needs to be smaller and the edges of the ring are too sharp. Edges need to be smoothed out.Otherwise, not bad..</li>
            <li> For some reason retail stores seem to have stopped carrying this design.  It was ubiquitous a few years ago.  The bristles are stiff enough to massage the scalp but flex enough ride over the bumps that are normal in the human skull and without causing discomfort.    All I can find in the drug stores and pharmacy sections of major general merchandise stores have the short, hard bumps that do not conform to the contour of the skull, and they are uncomfortable and hurt.</li>
            <li> Ugh. This feels so good on my scalp! It&#x27;s also a good back scratcher :P</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly long hair, but this still tended to tangle in it when I tried to use in the shower. For hair less than a half inch or so (the back of my head is that short at the moment) it works great, but even for relatively short hair, it&#x27;s not worth the extra effort of trying to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get tangled. Didn&#x27;t notice any particular benefit to my scalp in the areas where I could use it.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy, it has held up many months and gives my scalp a more fresh, clean feel after I shower.</li>
            <li> I constantly do manicure so this shampoo brush is excellent in giving a great scalp scrub while keeping my manicure in good condition.  But I find the ring too big fora woman&#x27;s finger.</li>
            <li> Very helpful when washing my hair.  It does a better job massaging my scalp than my fingers and feels very good.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 for me and the hubby so in love ! My scalp feels so much cleaner and stays clear looking longer. Also helps a ton for dry scalp and my boys both insist on one. Buying more to give to my sister because I love these</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shower comb for my tangle prone hair, and stumbled across this. At a buck or two, of course I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides just the right level of head scratching/massaging with very little effort, covers more territory than fingers, and I&#x27;m happy not to worry about my hair getting caught in winter-dry hangnails and such.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to coconut oil to keep my hair soft and shiny and discovered that after applying coconut oil on my hair this little hand comb really helps to get the oil distributed evenly into my hair. I comb 100 strokes with the oil in my hair and then wash and my hair is in great condition!</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with scalp plaque psoriasis for a long time (since I was a teen) and if you have ever had to deal with it, you know what I have been through.  I wash my hair and it only seems to make the &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; more noticeable, because it releases the scaly skin off my scalp. I have black hair and it is naturally curly and really thick, which makes it hard to get all of the &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; out without completely separating the curls and creating an afro! Brushing my hair also scraped off more skin. I am Irish/Welch, so I have large &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; curls not tight curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... I use this brush in the shower when I have the Just Natural psoriasis shampoo in my hair and the results are simply amazing!!! I also use the conditioner. My scalp was visibly better within just 2 washings, the red bloody sores started to heal and the scaly skin started to sluff off.  Within a few weeks, I had almost completely healed. Now, it is not a miracle, I still get build up and have to make sure to really scrub my scalp in the shower, but this brush has had a lot to due with the success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for years for shampooing.  The Scalpmaster Brush works as well as any I have used, and feels great on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little brush. Gentle on my scalp but effective in removing dandruff. I have Locs so this is very helpful for shampooing them.</li>
            <li> The Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush is excellent.It has just the right amount of stiffness and makes my scalp tingle.I recommend it without reservations.</li>
            <li> works great to remove all the scalp the scalp that I have.</li>
            <li> love this little brush for my scalp when shampooing - even gave one to my son who is in the Navy and he commented on how much it&#x27;s helped with his dandruff!!</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this would be a stupid purchase, but decided to try it because my scalp gets really dry. I use this when I wash my hair and oh my word! Amazing!!! Buy this, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I went on a quest for a great scalp washerer upperer. This was not my Nirvana. Oddly the ones I liked the best came in a five pack. They were plenty stiff to do the job, gave a good massage and the softer material conformed to my head as it went from one curve to the next. This on the hand is a harder material, no flex, no conforming and pretty harsh overall. I am not saying it is terrible and I actually still use it. It certainly would not be my go to scalp washer massager.</li>
            <li> I have been looking in stores for awhile for a comb like this to use in the shower, they are hard to find. I went onto Amazon and found this comb for a very good price. I placed the order, and received sooner than expected. It&#x27;s very durable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> bristles are soft/flexible enough and the finger hole makes it easy to hold while using. i ordered several other ones and returned b/c they were too firm</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t yank my hair out and I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Well i assumed this was for all types of hair. Especially for scalps w heavey dandruff. My hair is long and thick very thick (race white/euro) the bristles are not strong enough to give my scalp a good scrubbing because of my hair is so thick. So unless you have thin or baby fine hair this isnt for you.</li>
            <li> This product is well made and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to massage their scalp while shampooing.</li>
            <li> Very effective at revitalizing the scalp and really making shampoo effective.</li>
            <li> Cheaper version and it does its job :)</li>
            <li> Brush is as described. I bought it to scrub my scalp where I have psoriasis; the bristles are sharp and a bit painful when scrubbing on the psoriatic patches, but feel good on the healthy parts of my scalp. However, it&#x27;s not so painful that I can&#x27;t use it on the patches. We&#x27;ll see if it helps; I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the 3-4 days I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Exactly What I was looking for.  I use it when I shower.  Or even to scratch my beard.  Good back scratcher too</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like at all.  I was looking for a brush with softer bristles.  This one has too many bristles and they are too stiff.</li>
            <li> Perfect. The bristles are perfect for someone like me with short-medium hair. they penetrate to the scalp and do a good job. This little brush has really helped with dry skin. The &#x27;finger hole&#x27; is perfect, you won&#x27;t drop it when slippery.</li>
            <li> It works great!! I can easily untangle my hair with this brush!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very reasonably priced, and so comfortable for my scalp when using it. :)&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it came a little big bigger to cover a larger surface but I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on dried long hair and scalp like a comb.</li>
            <li> I have thick relaxed African American, and I loved using this as a scalp massager. It feels awesome on the scalp, the only thing I wish it was longer bristles/teeth. Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold these brushes in stores.  They are great for the scalp and in helping to keep your hair healthy.  I even use them when shampooing my hair and have brought extras to pass out to friends whose hair is starting to thin.  M. Cooper</li>
            <li> This guy is great - really gets my scalp goin! Works as described and has a nice lil loop for your finger to go through.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for one of these for ever, none of our local store&#x27;s carry these, so online I went, and it works soooooo good, very good scalp massage!</li>
            <li> The tines are too small and shallow to get through the hair and into the scalp.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Can also be used outside the shower.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, Need hair to comb.</li>
            <li> Using to bathe my 3 short haired dogs. They love the message, and I love the great cleaning.</li>
            <li> I like it. not scratchy, not tangles hair. perfect for scrubbing off old skin</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this brush. Its okay but I don&#x27;t end up using it as much as I thought. It gets a good lather going and feels good but my hair may be too thick.</li>
            <li> I love the concept of this scalp brush, but not for those with long hair. On the part of the scalp I can get to it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Very handy and works well as a portable brush.</li>
            <li> It does as it is purchased to do.  Because I have short hair it does reaches the scalp without hurting or adding extra pressure (you control the amount of pressure) and that feel wonderful.  An added + is that it also helps release discomfort headaches bring. I think you should try it. This only my opinion</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to but to be honest it is a really basic product (like a hair brush you can get wet).  I don&#x27;t use to too often as it seems it can be hard on your scalp but if used periodically it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something like this for a long time, and boy is it worth more than what I paid! I don&#x27;t even know how to take a shower anymore without one of these. I have short hair, but it is still excellent and time saving.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a scalp brush because I have dandruff and I use Head and Shoulders everyday, and I love scalp rubs. I&#x27;ve used this scalp brush a few times while shampooing, and I guess it&#x27;s ok for massaging your scalp, but with my long hair, it&#x27;s hard to move around and get all the benefits. So I think this is probably a good brush, but may be better for people with short hair. I may end up giving it to my dad who also has dandruff. Other than that, this seems like a sturdy brush, and mine is purple, like the picture shows. There is a stiff plastic loop in the middle of the back to slip your finger through for rubbing over your scalp. The plastic loop is big, too big for my small fingers, but I probably won&#x27;t be using the brush anymore anyway. After I give the brush to my dad, if I hear anything else about it from him, I&#x27;ll come on and update this review. Thanks for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.</li>
            <li> Makes the scalp fell fresh!!</li>
            <li> I was shocked when this arrived, as it seems so flimsy &amp; cheaply made, but it is honestly worth the cost for those with dandruff.  Regular combs &amp; brushes just can&#x27;t compete with this product, as it gently but effectively removes flakes.  I wish we&#x27;d discovered this years ago...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for getting too much hair off of my cat, but it does help loosen it up, and he LOVES it</li>
            <li> This brush looks pretty cheap worth max 1$.</li>
            <li> Just right. Not too stiff, not too loose.  (not the best quality, but for the price its a great value.)</li>
            <li> I have long hair and love this for scrubbing my scalp.  It feels great and doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair at all!</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve lookng for, for a long time. Apparently not available at any other drug stores that I&#x27;ve checked.</li>
            <li> Easy for child to use when washing hair and scalp (assuming short hair).  Easier to hold than some other brushes.  Another reviewer mentioned that finger ring broke off ... guess we&#x27;ll see how long until that happens here.  Child reported the feel of the bristles is better than previous scalp brush (the rectangular kind with sponge on one side, bristles on other).  Bristles are pretty stiff.  We&#x27;ll order this again.</li>
            <li> This is for &amp;#34;DOG&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;CAT&amp;#34;. some kind of pet of animal not for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Love it, makes my scalp feel great when I take a shower!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, so I have to be very careful not to pull my hair when I use it.  It does feel good when I use it.</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well- I never shampoo without it.  For the low price I didn&#x27;t expect it to last.  But I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a year now (at least once a day) and it shows no sign of wear- all of the bristles are still straight and intact!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. &amp;#34;Bristles&amp;#34; are a little stiff and widely spaced, but for the price, it functions great for travel or occassional use</li>
            <li> thank god for this having no fingers washing my hair was a real chore but now with a little duct tape and my nub my hair feels so much better</li>
            <li> Really does the job of scrubbing my scalp as I shampoo my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Ordered these before and got ones with the standard finger-loop on them. Second time, I used the &amp;#34;order again&amp;#34; option and got ones with a t-handle on them. HEY AMAZON: knock off the switcheroo&#x27;s! We don&#x27;t appreciate it when we try to re-order and get a significantly different item!</li>
            <li> My beautician uses this and i live it!  I&#x27;ll be making my purchase very soon.  I am natural and have mid back length hair.  It helps with detangling. Great product</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning scalp.  Shipping prompt.</li>
            <li> Harder using with curly long hair</li>
            <li> you shouldn&#x27;t be paying more than a dollar for a plastic brush</li>
            <li> This may not seem like a necessary product but I&#x27;ve found it quite useful. I have thick hair and this helps me distribute and rinse out shampoo. What I especially like is that it helps get the flakes off my dry / dandruffy scalp. The bristles are effective without scratching or hurting my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the bristles were a little longer and sturdier but again, I do have very thick hair so its probably fine for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such a low price I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price. I am very satisfied. My thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought these for My Husband and Son,My Husband has used this type for Years. We could not find them in Stores, so I found them on here and ordered they came in a fast fashion. My Husband and Son were quite happy with them and I recommend this site with 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased 24 of these for 14 dollars 2 1/2 years ago, so part of my rating comes from the great deal. These are not the wimpy rubber-tine brushes. These have a mild scratching feel on the scalp similar to a hard plastic comb, but with better coverage on the scalp. Surprisingly, with four people using them (some of us daily), I have never seen a single broken tine. The brushes I have used in the past would slowly shrink (in usable area) as tines broke. I am on my third brush since two of them have gone missing. The last has lasted at least a year without signs of wear.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Quick turnaround.</li>
            <li> Even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Simply awesome brush for short hairs..you can use it to massage your scalp or comb you hair...i saw one of these in an old barbershop and looked hard to find one..Amazon and eBay are the only sellers online....must have for those who like to comb their hair...</li>
            <li> Great head scratcher for someone with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Good material and feels great on the scalp!</li>
            <li> Good little brush to massage your scalp. Only problem that I see is if you have thick hair it&#x27;s a little tough to get to the scalp overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for little kids with thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> The right handle. A little breaking in (sandpaper) and this is a great shower brush.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush when shampooing hair. helps in the shampoo seeping through my hair and to the scalp.</li>
            <li> Great brush and really makes your head feel great.</li>
            <li> It works OK but I wish it was a little larger and had the knob that you grasp between two fingers.  I hands and fingers aere rather large so the hole for the finger is a little snug.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t exactly comb hair less than 4&amp;#34; long. This thing is great, both with shampoo and just as a scalp massage. Great for distributing scalp oils and reducing flakiness (which is actually caused by oil buildup, I discovered). Stimulating the follicles regularly is also the best prevention against balding, and that&#x27;s definitely worth $3.25. Mine seems to be lasting forever too. Highly recommend this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a daily sufferer of dandruff for many years.  I have to shampoo daily with Nizoral (1%) and scrub with a bristle brush like this.  I use it daily ~ I have yet to have any tabs bend or break.  Its been great and stays on the window sill ready for tomorrow&#x27;s use :)</li>
            <li> Works great for getting shampoo right down to the roots. I have thick hair and this cleans my scalp very well. However the quality is cheap and I would think you could probably find something similar at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li> Its a head scratcher! great if you have an itchy scalp, or just like to itch in general. Maybe you have a significant other that likes you to scratch their back ALL THE TIME! the finger loop is a little sharp and uncomfortable though. definitely easier to use on short hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very flimsy and inexpensively made item.  The tines that are supposed to &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; your scalp are like sharp knives and only scratch and damage your head.  Better off not using anything at all.</li>
            <li> Brush works well. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first at how effective such a brush would be. But at that point, I had already been fed up with my unusually dry and variable scalp. I would have dry patches that eventually led to dandruff and the whole imbalanced oil production was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Scalpmaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this thing feels amazing on the head. The bristles are firm but have a good plastic give. I don&#x27;t know how long they will last but after a solid month of use, they&#x27;ve held up pretty well. They&#x27;re long enough and do the right amount of tingling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you&#x27;re hitting more surface area of your scalp, so you&#x27;ll reach more than just your fingers. Within one or two uses, I could feel my scalp producing oil much more efficiently, that was what sold me.</li>
            <li> Great scrubbing power, but hate the finger hole that is the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34;, as my finger is too small. Much preferred the double-hook style on the good &#x27;ole (discontinued :() Goody model!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I needed.  My scalp has never felt cleaner.  I have very thick hair and this has done wonders to clean my scalp.  It was also perfect for getting conditioner in.  I highly recommend it.  One note, the bristles are pretty stiff which is what I wanted but just make sure thats something you want.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this because often my hair gets caught in my nails.  This way...I dont have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too, it reminds me of my Daddy who used one way back in the day :-)</li>
            <li> This scrubber really broke up the dandruff in my head. My head actually feels better now that I have used this scrubber compared to if I had just used my nails to scratch the dandruff. Great buy! I wanted something to help make washing my head easier (and less work) and this is it.</li>
            <li> not well made teeth to close together good color not worth 4.00 get this at own risk worth about 2.00</li>
            <li> 3/17/2015-Going on two years and the brush is still working great. Bought item to replace one I had over 10 years.  Could not find them in any store in my area. This one has the finger hole on top. I prefer the T handle but the finger hole works well. Bent one of the prongs when opening the package. Just have to wait and see how it holds up over time. The brush does the job. I would use this seller again. 3/25/2016-Bought a pack of 4. NEVER HURTS TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA AROUND.</li>
            <li> Not that good for really thick hair.</li>
            <li> I had an old shampoo brush that was loosing the teeth. I love how these things really make your scalp feel clean and tingly. For the price, buy one for you and several for friends and family. I even use one on my pet. He loves the massage!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a brush no longer made by Goody&#x27;s. The times could be a little longer for really thick hair, but it works for me. Durability can&#x27;t be rated yet.</li>
            <li> When you have an itchy scalp  and can&#x27;t reach it with your palp  grab the [purple] Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush  it will get your top in tiptop shape!  But don&#x27;t make me give you a push.  check the videotape for proof, you goof :P  At a sub 5 dollar price you&#x27;ll scare the lice  and be left with your new favorite shower time head brush.  Now ain&#x27;t that nice? :)    (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/palp)</li>
            <li> several years ago i purchased 10 dozen at 25 cents a brush. obviously should have bought 20 dozen.. cant find that suppier!! great for dandruff control.</li>
            <li> It hurt my scalp, can&#x27;t use it.  I bought it because some reviewer said&lt;br /&gt;it is tender on scalp, certainly not to mine.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo brush!  It does not get tangled with your hair like a regular brush(Ouch!)  It goes through your hair gently, while spreading shampoo evenly.  It feels durable as well and will probably last a long time, which means you should only order multiple if you have several family members--just make sure you label them with a permanent marker.  Great value for those who need to brush with their shampoo.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this shampoo brush!  I am a 71 year old lady with arthric hands and shoulders, making washing my hair difficult.  This product is gentle on the scalp, does not tangle the hair, and actually takes less time than using my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both men and women would benefit from using this brush to shampoo hair.  It is easy on the scalp, does not tangle the hair, and you actually use less shampo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For womenI who have longer hair than most men,  I would recommend 2 such shampoo brushes, so you can wash your hair on both sides of the head at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> Being a swimmer, I never had a problem with buildup on my scalp—until I came down with a chronic illness that kept me essentially apartment-bound for the better part of the year. I would bathe every day, but my old shower-shampoo-condition routine took too much energy some days, so I developed some buildup on my scalp from hair products. (Even when sick, my thick curls needed taming!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this little thing. It&#x27;s plastic. It&#x27;s cheap. It&#x27;s amazing. From the first use, my scalp was a world happier. Now, once a week or so, I massage in my shampoo and detangle the curls, and then I run this guy over all parts of my scalp. Not only does it feel totally awesome, but you can actually see the buildup coming off on the little bristles. I rinse the brush and repeat until my head is a happy camper, and then condition as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To nitpick: The only very tiny demerits of the product are that I wish the single finger loop on the back of the brush were a little bit sturdier or were perhaps a double loop, and I have noticed that it&#x27;s relatively easy for the bristles around the edges to bend back a bit. But that is all. For four bucks, this absolutely gets five stars from me.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and wish the bristles were slightly longer.  Otherwise this brush is pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li> Hair gets trapped in it.  Nice rounded tips.  Feels a little too stiff.</li>
            <li> This product was okay but after using it for a couple of months, the handle on it broke.  Obviously, it still works but for how long?  It is a bit flimsy but still the best one we found so far.  It would be better if they made it a little sturdier.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my husband was looking for so I was so happy when Santa tucked it into his Christmas stocking!</li>
            <li> This was everything I hoped it would be.  I just received stares when I went to the drugstore to get something like this.  Now I have a supply which should last years.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased a few of these and this is what my husband uses in the shower for his hair.  He loves it. The bristles aren&#x27;t too flimsy and yet, not too hard.  The finger ring on the top side fits perfect for him to hold it.  He keeps one in his business travel bag and one at home.  If you&#x27;ve used these before, you will like this one.  I think it only comes in purple, but thats okay- it&#x27;s a nice color!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first, but this little booger is pretty awesome. I get dandruff pretty bad sometimes and this helps to keep me flake free. 10/10 would scrub again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item.  Iten not found in the stores.  Would tell friends where to get one. Will shop with you again.</li>
            <li> My scalp has never been cleaner in my whole natural life! This brush got every single&lt;br /&gt;Trace of buildup and dirt from my hair anf I love it!</li>
            <li> Good ite. I need a few more.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be. The plastic is too hard to really massage your head. It&#x27;s really small, too. I thought it would be big enough to massage shampoo into my hair better than just using my hands, but it did not do that at all. It actually hurt a little when I tried massaging my scalp because of the hard plastic. I used it once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I had been searching in stores for years for one of these even walmart did not have it.  in any case prior to finding it on amazon which is my best friend and worst enemy combined-PRIME-it is way to quick for my own good. my husband loves it and when i ordered it I got him two in case they became difficult to find again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these to replace my old Goody shampoo brush. This one does the job admirably, and better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried in terms of comfort and feel.</li>
            <li> I like this scalp brush a lot! Firm enough to get dandruff and build up off the scalp, but still flexible to not be painful and ineffective. The finger holes take some getting used to but I love it so far!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic hair brush/shampooer.  What you see is what you get.  It works just fine.  Buy a couple in case you loose it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shampoo Brush Scalpmaster removed me itching and hair grease the leather is what I recommend to all itching their heads</li>
            <li> Soft but thorough brushing through hair.  At first I didn&#x27;t like the looks of this shampoo brush, but when I used it I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought such a brush 25 years ago, but could not find any since then. Thought they no longer were available. When I discovered these on the Internet I ordered 4 of them. My daughters absconded with two, my wife took one, but that still leaves one for me. Very good for massaging the scalp during shampooing.</li>
            <li> works great. i use it in the shower when i shampoo my hair. helps stimulate the scalp and gives your hair a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Useful tool for hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I have short hair, and it is very easy to scrub my scalp with this brush while I am shampooing. I have dry/flaky scalp, and this brush helps to control my flakiness.</li>
            <li> Presents for my peeps, they mentioned in passing they wanted this and they said they could not find one anywhere.  They are happily using this product.  Good flexibility not stiff or hard on the scalp...</li>
            <li> inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for, everyone in my house wants one now.  No one has dandruff, we weren&#x27;t buying it for that purpose - its just for general build-up for us, so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s effectiveness in that regard.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too stiff for my liking.  If they were just a little bit softer this would be great, but if you apply any pressure at all it hurts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this all winter and it has taken care of my dandruff problem. I would try this first before I bought anything else.</li>
            <li> This is a useful item for scalp massaging and cleaning in a shower.  It&#x27;s durable and offers a nice sensation when used in scalp massage.</li>
            <li> This feels like a massage you give yourself.  It stimulates your oil glands to help with dry hair.  It also feels really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat hard to hold. The hole for your finger is oddly shaped and what too big. I do like that it is rounded to fit the shape of the scalp and that the bristles are firm. I have a lot of hair and it is long, so I have to section it off to get to my whole scalp.it&#x27;s the first time I buy a product like this so I&#x27;m not sure that another product will be different.</li>
            <li> good price and very good quality</li>
            <li> The plastic is pretty stiff, for better or for worse. You might have to go easy with it if you have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Scrubs my scalp the way I like it.</li>
            <li> feels so good to scrub my scalp with this!</li>
            <li> Way too flimsy to be of any real use.</li>
            <li> everything arrive ok and was as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it would help with my dandruff problem. Rather than helping, it seems to actually cause more damage. Perhaps if the ends were rounded, it would have been better.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is get shampoo to your scalp. I didn&#x27;t find the bristles too stiff. Nice little product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Had problems with itchy flaky scalp - used it in the shower with dandruff shampoo and conditioner, this helped eliminate it significantly.</li>
            <li> This little brush is great for cleaning your scalp while shampooing your hair.  It will even work on your pets.</li>
            <li> This might be good for a plaque psoriasis head that has chunks of flakey stuff to get off.  My head doesn&#x27;t have that, but I have mild dandruffy weird thing going on.  I used this at medium pressure, and it scraped the CRAP out of my scalp.  It left red marks, and scratches.  I think I have a more sensitive scalp than some people, or something.  But, if I&#x27;m gentle with it, it&#x27;s not TOO bad, but my tea tree oil shampoo still burns in the scratches after using this thing.</li>
            <li> Product is okay, but the picture is purple and the product I was sent is yellow. I could have bought one locally if the color was not what I had been looking for (purple).</li>
            <li> Have used these for years but now it is almost impossible to find in stores. Not sure why that is, but glad that you have them available. Thank you. I know have enough to last me the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Where have these things been all my life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great for rubbing shampoo and conditioner into the scalp. It helps exfoliate to remove dandruff, and probably also stimulates blood flow to your hair follicles.</li>
            <li> I am a disabled army veteran who muat wash my hair leaning into the shower &amp; using  one hand. I haven&#x27;t been able to wash or rinse my hair well so I had dry scalp. When I was young, barbers used brushes like this one to shampoo and to brush back men who wore Evils/James Dean sorts of hair styles. I figured the simple brush would help me but found stores do not carry them, not even supply stores. I found this one @ Amazon, read the buyer comments &amp; decided to give it  try. The price is very low. Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it solves my problem! I was concern it might prove too harsh for me &amp; scratch my scalp but it does not. My shopping experience proves once again that Amazon wipes the floor with big box stores Walmart, Kmart, BestBuy, Office Depot not&lt;br /&gt;because of sales tax but because of superior service &amp; superior inventory. Reccomend this brush. It does not drift from China by canoe. It arrived fast from here in North America.</li>
            <li> Has the perfect stiffness and shape. Tried others, but they were incredibly rigid or too soft... This was perfect. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a small round plastic disc with a loop on top to provide a finger grip. It has multiple since barbershops no longer seem to have a card of them on display, I hoped that Amazon could come through.  Product arrived promptly and is better than my old one.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works great in the shower to keep drandruff at bay.  Also use on dogs and horses, works good and they love it. I didn&#x27;t really need 25, but it&#x27;s a lifetime supply and I give them away for free for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect size for my hand. Secret of brush is to go from front of scalp to back of head. (Not back and forth).&lt;br /&gt;Helps break up psoriasis plaque better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My hair is only jaw length and this tangles it like crazy. It&#x27;s a shame because I really wanted something to give it a good scrub.</li>
            <li> A must have for Nizoral or other dandruff shampoo, works it in perfectly.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  Love it. The price was right and deliverytime fantastic.Too many words required.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, but it not only felt good, but it seems effective. I have an itchy, flaky scalp and have tried all sorts of OTC and prescription products. Even the ones that are effective, I have a hard time massaging them into all areas of my scalp thoroughly enough. This brush is easy to use, feels great and allowed me to get the product effectively massaged in. I noticed much less residual flaking after this first use alone. I preference using it in one direction and then moving it to a different spot as opposed to a back and fort motion, so as not to tangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected. Gets right down to the scalp area. Does a good job.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Bristles were a little stiff at first but after a few uses they soften up and are fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in stores and they&#x27;re so useful for people that have a lot of hair. More gentle than the average handled hairbrush and easy to clean too. I bought 6 and now I&#x27;m set for years :)</li>
            <li> Could not find this anywhere. So glad that you have them.</li>
            <li> Great for using in the shower for hair shampooing. Loosens up dry scalp and dandruff. I would order these again.</li>
            <li> This little brush is Great! The bristles are soft so it isn&#x27;t too rough on your scalp. It does a great job of distributing shampoo throughout your hair and thoroughly clean your scalp. It&#x27;s a fantastic deal, too! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Scalpmaster is great for getting rid of flaky skin on the scalp-- it&#x27;s just what I was looking for.  It feels good too.</li>
            <li> I recently found out I have dandruff and along with my prescription shampoo, I use this brush to stimulate my scalp and clean some of the dandruff out of my hair, when washing and using my cream rinse. I do recommend this - very basic and does the trick.</li>
            <li> The scalp master was flemsier than I thought it would be and didn&#x27;t comb through my hair as good as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Great product does what it says it does,scalp feels clean every time and not to harsh either, recommend A+</li>
            <li> For a male with medium length hair this is great. I thought it might be too stiff at first but it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It it smaller than you would think by the picture.</li>
            <li> sucks. It hurts the head....</li>
            <li> I have a dry, itchy scalp, and I love using this to put oil directly on my problem spots.</li>
            <li> Works well if you have short hair. Hard to get the scalp if you have long hair. Wonderful scalp massage if short hair that helps shampoos clean  better. I use it with sulfur shampoo for the occasional dandruff i get once an a while.</li>
            <li> I know this is a shampoo brush, but it is also an excellent back scratcher or massager, body exfoliator, and self-defense weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, as a shampoo brush, this thing is a bit rough on the scalp.  So beware.  It is of a medium stiffness.  Easily to handle because of the loop on its exterior through which you put a couple fingers.  But it&#x27;s tough on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a great rough back rub.  It can exfoliate as well.  Not as well as those exfoliating towels you can buy, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a weapon, man, you can grab this out of your purse and exfoliate a mugger&#x27;s face.  A few smashes from this sucker, and he&#x27;ll need to use a gentle apricot scrub for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is that this tool is sturdy, tough, and stiff.  Not for those accustomed to gentle scrubbing.  It will irritate sensitive skin and most scalps very quickly.  Still, it feels good if you are into rougher, more vigorous scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.  If you dare.</li>
            <li> works well and I&#x27;m very pleased with the service provided. Would recom,mend this itewm to all myu family members. Thankyou.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick wavy hair and I didn&#x27;t even touch my scalp haha, don&#x27;t even try it. Maybe if you had thinner hair it might work.</li>
            <li> Feels awesome on your scalp! I use mine every shower. I originally bought it in hopes of eliminating my dandruff. Although it hasn&#x27;t eliminated it, I think it has helped.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a little more space between the tines though - doesn&#x27;t have the massage like feeling like I was hoping</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great Price.  Hard to find.  Was able to purchase a whole box for the price of two in comparison to other vendors.</li>
            <li> Nice, light, little palm sized scalp scrubber for the shower.  The bristles are nicely soft and flexible, yet still do the job.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It&#x27;s awesome. I use it with the coal tar shampoo and I&#x27;ve gotta tell you that it&#x27;s worth the $4 I spent on it. Just be careful not to brush with too much pressure or you&#x27;ll hurt yourself!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo brush. I plan on buying more. Other shampoo brushes are made well, however, they don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> These are just like the ones I used 50 years ago - except 10 cents at the Woolworth store then.  They are great for massaging the scalp when shampooing.</li>
            <li> Unless your hair is 1/4 to 1&amp;#34; long, this brush is not for you.  I have relatively long hair and it only got tangled and I felt nothing.  Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and when I shampoo my customers hair they always ask me to scratch harder, which results in messing up my manicure. So I bought this brush and they love it even more than my own nails, which gives me a break!</li>
            <li> Veyy good product.  Serves me well.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for. I had one of those when my kids were babies, 30+ years ago and now they were impossible to find in the sections of baby products. So it was great to be able to get them on line!&lt;br /&gt;Both my son and I like to use these brushes when we shampoo to keep the scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo brush. When I had loooong hair I could actually get though all that piled up on my head. Since I Have cut two feet off my hair I still love it. The brush is curved to the contour of the scalp. It is not sharp on your scalp but gives a fantastic scratch/massage as you shampoo. I use it to come conditioner though my hair as well.  A shower must have!! And hey... its purple!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I was using a nail brush to clean my scalp, but that only worked while my hair was short. I only recently realized these things even exist, but I&#x27;m so glad I got one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a complex piece of technology. It has stiff, loosely spaced bristles about a centimeter long. It is easy to hold, and I suspect it will last long enough to be more than worth the money I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to do a number on their scalp.</li>
            <li> Had a Goody for years and years. It broke and I&#x27;ve been on the hunt ever since. Eureka!!! This brush rocks. Gets to the scalp and cleans, cleans, cleans. Buy the Scalpmaster, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Works great! Shipment was on time</li>
            <li> I use this brush to fix my three year old&#x27;s knotted hair in the morning and rub off my infant son&#x27;s cradle cap.&lt;br /&gt;It works very well. My daughter no longer cries for the pain of combing and my son&#x27;s dandruff is loosened off.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, cheap solution for kids hair problems.</li>
            <li> I liked the Goody&#x27;s brand better.  The bristles on this are sharper and the &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; of the brush is less rigid.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, but the bristles are VERY stiff, and the product is very cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> The Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush is great.  It was exactly like the old brush I used for years but&lt;br /&gt;then broke.  I looked in stores for a replacement without any success.  I am glad I found the ideal&lt;br /&gt;replacement online and am pleased with the new brush.</li>
            <li> Gets right down to the scalp. Great for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> It gets tangled in my hair before it can scrub my scalp. I can only scrub a very small area of scalp at a time.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning and relegated to the trash.  Way too scratchy!  Those tines are practically sharks teeth.  I had been and will continue to use a cuticle brush.  Much kinder to the scalp.  I bought this thinking it would be better for the scalp since it is made for that.  NOT.  Besides, it is very cheaply made and should sell for less than a dollar.</li>
            <li> Its a decent item. It does the job designed to do, can rub the shampoo in pretty well. The problems are that one; its hard to hold on to it (The ring size is one size- big) 2; its pretty small so hard to control &amp; get everywhere done with out pain.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> works as intended I wish it was softer</li>
            <li> This is for people with short hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dense, hair. This scalp scrubber worked great when it was shorter than 1&amp;#34;, but any longer, and you really need to work at getting the nubs to touch the scalp. Brush is stiff enough to comb hair, but not too harsh. I would love to see a product with longer teeth.</li>
            <li> THE SHAMPOO BRUSH HELPED MY WASHING OF HAIR A LOT EASIER SINCE I INJURED MY FINGER.  THE BRUSH IS GENTLE ENOUGH FOR THE SCALP.  IT SAVES ME TIME AND EFFORT TO WASH MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my son gets this odd buildup in his hair. This coupled with a few good washings with TGEL really seems to help. This brush he can use in the shower and really get down to his scalp but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so the bristles are not long enough.</li>
            <li> My father used these when I was growing up.  I enjoyed the soft bristles, after buying this product the bristles are just right.</li>
            <li> Great delivery service and good scalp massager</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> It was definitely a lot smaller than I was expecting and a lot firmer. But maybe that&#x27;s why the price was so decent. I was hoping for the bristles to be more on the soft side. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. It&#x27;s definitely not something you actually want to use on wet hair, unless you want to create breakage. It&#x27;s a better tool to use right before you hop into the shower to loosen things up. It&#x27;s a cute little brush but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets tender because of my seborrehic dermatitus which makes using this slightly painful on occasion, but when my scalp is not sore, it feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li> My husband and sons love these!  We have one in every car and every bathroom! they love it so much</li>
