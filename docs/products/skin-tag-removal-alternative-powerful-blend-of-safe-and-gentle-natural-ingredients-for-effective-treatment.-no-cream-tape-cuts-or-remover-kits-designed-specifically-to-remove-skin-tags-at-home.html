    <ol>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>I am not a review person but felt obliged to share my review after this product worked wonderfully on me.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not happy with results.......</li>
            <li>This worked great on my son&#x27;s skin tag.  </li>
            <li>The reason I am writing is to make sure that someone there with authority knows about this case!</li>
            <li>Truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic treatment method, however it costs an arm and a leg for each liquid nitrogen treatment even with great health insurance, which is where Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Freeze Away product comes into play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it would have been nice to squeeze a tube to apply instead of using a bottle to get drops out.</li>
            <li>I did not find this product to be effective in any way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It had a nice aroma and the tingle suggests it might work for some people</li>
            <li>I honestly would have given up</li>
            <li>Thank you kindly,    </li>
            <li>Kind regards  Dina \\&quot;    </li>
            <li>Pretty incredible.</li>
            <li>Pretty incredible product.     </li>
            <li>Thus, the Freeze Away product is more effective, takes two weeks, and costs close to nothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very safe when used in this manner and evaporates very quickly.</li>
            <li>They are shriveling up more every day.  </li>
            <li>So I started to apply 3 times a day and made sure to not miss an application.</li>
            <li>For sure it did not remove anything, not even the smallest tags there are.  </li>
            <li>but anyway I am satisfied of the way this product made my two tags disappear with no pain, no scar, no effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read these reviews.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews for this product and thought, sure why not try it.  </li>
            <li>Read that it was safe to use on eyes</li>
            <li>i wished it was alot more to use</li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews on this product, and thought that this would be a good alternitive.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived  ontime and so far products does work, it takes time but amvery happy with the product, thank you for helping to solve one of lifes problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been nearly three weeks and the product has not (yet)&lt;br /&gt;been successful.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I am fair, I took it down , but you want me to say a good review, make a product that works.</li>
            <li>I definatley want to make sure the owner of this company sees exactly what this product has done to me!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely for six weeks.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Very powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>It is better to consult with a professional to know exactly what your dealing with health wise.  </li>
            <li>One time, a bit got in my eye and it burned mildly, but I immediately flushed with eye drops and the eye was fine within minutes.     </li>
            <li>H-Skin Tags is worth every one of the 5 stars I am giving it!</li>
            <li>It feels like normal bee sting to be honest.</li>
            <li>We have credited you in full.</li>
            <li>I bought this only because I read good reviews here on amazon</li>
            <li>It has a pretty strong odor, so prepare yourself.</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly...</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly because of articles and reviews stating that it had been used, or was safe to use, on eye area or on eyelids.</li>
            <li>My wife got rid of her skin tags quickly</li>
            <li>I found them quick to respond and canceled my order with out</li>
            <li>By the way, be prepared for a STRONG odor when applying these, it is really STRONG.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; you see immediately after treatment and for 1-2 weeks are completely fine and are very temporary.</li>
            <li>I am extremely delighted and will definitely order more of this product in the future, and can recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li>In my opinion , not a product or company worth taking a chance on...</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong takes too long to take effet don&#x27;t like the fact of using it more than once a day and smelling all day</li>
            <li>I bought the Heal Skin Tags formula about 17 days ago and got it pretty quick in the mail.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if there was a way to suggest you get enough for the whole time frame.  </li>
            <li>I simply stopped eating sugar and bread, and lost quite a bit of weight in the process to where I&#x27;m now very comfortable in my appearance as well as healthier than ever.</li>
            <li>I should have made in the first place.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic, but willing to try it.  </li>
            <li>At first, I saw no change in any of the skin tags.  </li>
            <li>I faithfully applied 3 times a day (sometimes 4 times) and it was GONE in 4 days after the first application.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the tags are now gone!</li>
            <li>Sure, the freezing hurts for a couple minutes, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal.</li>
            <li>REAL!  </li>
            <li>but this product does really work!</li>
            <li>Used this product exactly as it says and got no results.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions EXACTLY and went through two bottles without seeing any results at all.  </li>
            <li>Smelled exactly like others tried.  </li>
            <li>to soon to judge ,but for $30.00 I belevied I was getting the large bottlte there will be no reorders.</li>
            <li>another thing i can say is by it being made from natural products, i was surprised the smell was as strong as it was.</li>
            <li>i have a little product left but havent used after i experienced irritation.</li>
            <li>I always wiped the surrounding area with a wet Q-Tip after applying the oil on the tag, to make sure the oil was not affecting the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>I figure if I use up the whole bottle and still&lt;br /</li>
            <li>So, really cannot tell you if it would have worked or not.</li>
            <li>straight before i stopped use because my skin around the tags became irritated with puffiness, redness, darkening, and itching.</li>
            <li>I think others are also using too much.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>You must apply it every three hours and it has a very pungent odor.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful after reading the reviews on this product that it would work.  </li>
            <li>Went through the whole bottle in a month.</li>
            <li>This is probably why I went through the whole bottle to fast.</li>
            <li>My experience with Healing Natural Oils was quite different than portrayed in many reviews.</li>
            <li>I am happy I only  bought a small  bottle</li>
            <li>Apply as per the instructions and you will get rid of your tags naturally, with no scarring and nobody will ever know you had them in the first place.    </li>
            <li>I should have just gone to the dermatologist in the first place and not wasted my time.</li>
            <li>to top it off I put a review on amazon before saying I hoped this product worked and the company sent me an email asking me to take it down.</li>
            <li>I spent a fair amount of money on this product and got absolutely NO results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing against the company, but if you want to remove skin tags within two weeks I highly recommend using Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Freeze Away product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommed this to others that need to get rid of tags.</li>
            <li>highly advise against this product.</li>
            <li>have been applying this to my skin for several months and did not work!&lt;br /&gt;also have a really strong smell which lingers for several hours</li>
            <li>Eventually a scab forms and falls off in 1-2 weeks and your damaged skin cells are replaced with new normal skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tags are nearly gone after 4 weeks and still have more than half a bottle left.</li>
            <li>Now the large one on my neck is just starting to turn color.     </li>
            <li>Not so much with the product, but with how often and that I didn&#x27;t have enough to even complete the process for the required time.  </li>
            <li>My eleven year old had a skin tag on her arm pit.</li>
            <li>I did find out how to naturally rid myself of these unsightly things (I had them under my eyes)...</li>
            <li>I bought this product directly from the company.  </li>
            <li>First off, this is a long, thorough review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Freeze Away product completely destroys H-Skin Tags.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money and time.</li>
            <li>Healing Natural Oils must not understand what a scar is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did nothing (so far) to the tags with hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>But within 5 days I started seeing very visible results on the tags having same color as the skin.</li>
            <li>but I think those might have roots just like moles do, so it is probably a different type of skin blemish, or it might just take much longer to see a change.</li>
            <li>The smell was very offensive and it burned as if salt had been poured in an open wound.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li>Hoping would work but tried on just on one skin tag for nearly 5 weeks now with zero change.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet...too early.</li>
            <li>So far this isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though the manual says that it might take upto 6 weeks, so let&#x27;s wait and watch, but one thing is for sure, this product works really slow.</li>
            <li>I used this oil EXACTLY as directed for a month and a half, and it did absolutely NOTHING</li>
            <li>but im not sure if i would finish the product or spend more in the future to have them professionally removed.</li>
            <li>but I want to make sure this is taken seriously.</li>
            <li>the skin surrounding the tags are back to normal</li>
            <li>The black color (dead skin cells caused by freezing) changes into a scab that eventually falls off, leaving perfectly healthy new skin cells in its place, not a scar.</li>
            <li>Moral of the story, the product absolutely works and only user error is to blame if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>none of the other reviews before me buying it stated that, but that was the first thing i noticed about the product.</li>
            <li>I personally like the smell of it and that its completely natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Funny how nearly all of the rave reviews here come from people who have only one review in their record -- this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on this experience I may reorder the product in the near future.</li>
            <li>called the company for a refund and explained I only had the last of the two bottles, as I anticipated it to work and didn&#x27;t pay attention that I needed to send BOTH bottles back for a full refund (minus shipping/tax).  </li>
            <li>During the last week, the surrounding area began to dry out a bit, so I also used an extremely small dab of antibiotic ointment each time as well, which kept the surrounding skin healthy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products in the past, but this product was the only product for skin tags that I have used that worked on my skin tags and helped me completely get rid of the skin tags on my neck and eyelids.    </li>
            <li>The one that was growing fast was 2 millimeter diameter when I started the treatment and now its already completely gone, after less than two weeks.</li>
            <li>Diethyl ether is not as scary as it may sound to the general public or pure holistic people.</li>
            <li>This was a pure waste of money.</li>

            <li> Tags are nearly gone after 4 weeks and still have more than half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> Now the large one on my neck is just starting to turn color.     </li>
            <li> Not so much with the product, but with how often and that I didn&#x27;t have enough to even complete the process for the required time.  </li>
            <li> My eleven year old had a skin tag on her arm pit.</li>
            <li> I did find out how to naturally rid myself of these unsightly things (I had them under my eyes)...</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from the company.  </li>
            <li> First off, this is a long, thorough review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Freeze Away product completely destroys H-Skin Tags.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> Healing Natural Oils must not understand what a scar is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did nothing (so far) to the tags with hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> But within 5 days I started seeing very visible results on the tags having same color as the skin.</li>
            <li> but I think those might have roots just like moles do, so it is probably a different type of skin blemish, or it might just take much longer to see a change.</li>
            <li> The smell was very offensive and it burned as if salt had been poured in an open wound.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> Hoping would work but tried on just on one skin tag for nearly 5 weeks now with zero change.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet...too early.</li>
            <li> So far this isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though the manual says that it might take upto 6 weeks, so let&#x27;s wait and watch, but one thing is for sure, this product works really slow.</li>
            <li> I used this oil EXACTLY as directed for a month and a half, and it did absolutely NOTHING</li>
            <li> but im not sure if i would finish the product or spend more in the future to have them professionally removed.</li>
            <li> but I want to make sure this is taken seriously.</li>
            <li> the skin surrounding the tags are back to normal</li>
            <li> The black color (dead skin cells caused by freezing) changes into a scab that eventually falls off, leaving perfectly healthy new skin cells in its place, not a scar.</li>
            <li> Moral of the story, the product absolutely works and only user error is to blame if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> none of the other reviews before me buying it stated that, but that was the first thing i noticed about the product.</li>
            <li> I personally like the smell of it and that its completely natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Funny how nearly all of the rave reviews here come from people who have only one review in their record -- this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on this experience I may reorder the product in the near future.</li>
            <li> called the company for a refund and explained I only had the last of the two bottles, as I anticipated it to work and didn&#x27;t pay attention that I needed to send BOTH bottles back for a full refund (minus shipping/tax).  </li>
            <li> During the last week, the surrounding area began to dry out a bit, so I also used an extremely small dab of antibiotic ointment each time as well, which kept the surrounding skin healthy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products in the past, but this product was the only product for skin tags that I have used that worked on my skin tags and helped me completely get rid of the skin tags on my neck and eyelids.    </li>
            <li> The one that was growing fast was 2 millimeter diameter when I started the treatment and now its already completely gone, after less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Diethyl ether is not as scary as it may sound to the general public or pure holistic people.</li>
            <li> This was a pure waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its a pity such a great product has a few bad reviews which are completely unwarranted.    </li>
            <li> were four skin tags, 1 small - 2 med - 1 large in the test.  </li>
            <li> It comes with 7 treatments, though you really only need one treatment for most cases, and costs a measly $10.</li>
            <li> For the first 4-5 days I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin tags and was concerned, but the instructions told me to wait at least a week to two to see changes, so I was patient.    </li>
            <li> Im not sure if i was all out allergic to the chemicals or got too much of the chemical on the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> Only minor effect on the tag.</li>
            <li> Again, simply following the instructions goes a long way.</li>
            <li> 3 weeks and so far no results, used at least twice a day, though recommended 3 times everyday for month.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the $.</li>
            <li> The skin tag removal medicine seemed to feel really uncomfortable and burns when applied, but also has a really strong odor.  </li>
            <li> The bottle makes it hard to control how much goes onto the q-tip.</li>
            <li> Three weeks ago I received my oil and began using it *six times a day on a small unsightly growth near the outer corner of my left eye.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see results but am a skeptical person.    </li>
            <li> they refunded me the one bottle and refused to refund the other since it wasn&#x27;t shipped back to them.  </li>
            <li> It work for short time.i was told that it might work on other people due to different chemistry.</li>
            <li> Bottle was tiny and didn&#x27;t last but a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It got a little hard and numb (but not numb enough to pull off) but the entire bottle later there was no progress justifying buying a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is empty now after 4 weeks and it did not work.  </li>
            <li> Made absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th week and the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> Applied as directed, absolutely no change whatsoever using each product,</li>
            <li> It arrived on time but it seems it takes a long time before you start to see a slight change with the skin tags.</li>
            <li> so I only threw out 20 something dollars and not more.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> active ingredient is melaleuca alternifolia, that is tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I had 4 skin tags and after 3 times daily application, they all dried up and went away after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am not sure one would get the same result just applying tea tree (which of course would cost way less than this product),</li>
            <li> i havent called the company that sponsers the product with a complaint because i realize all products dont work the same on all people.</li>
            <li> Total Scam at least from my perspective.</li>
            <li> product, as described, takes about three months on average before you see any results.</li>
            <li> Everyday, 3 times until the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> They recommended using it only three times per day, but I used a very small drop on the end of a Q-Tip six times a day without any problem.</li>
            <li> Away from Rite Aid for half the cost.</li>
            <li> Did not work,  I previously used it and it worked.</li>
            <li> Minimal results after going though a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have been using almost everyday, Did not work and the skin around the skin tag became black and looks like burnt.</li>
            <li> the skintags shrunk a little but they are still there.</li>
            <li> and I was desperate with a tag that was growing really fast.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of time, and money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It basically shrank and dried out</li>
            <li> I guess I will see in a few weeks if this works fully or not.</li>
            <li> Waste money and effort.</li>
            <li> I ordered the small bottle and still have half a bottle remaining.    </li>
            <li> Prior to finding this product, I had recently received estimates from a plastic surgeon, dermatologist, and ophthalmologist - all who quoted approximately $500.00 for the removal(!!)</li>
            <li> I usually have to visit the Doctor every two years to get some removed and was hoping to save the time,</li>
            <li> I have not tried it yet, and not sure if I will.</li>
            <li> Bottle was small.</li>
            <li> this helped alot but the bottle is to small</li>
            <li> This was disappointing since the productwas pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small price to pay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly a completely ridiculous claim that perhaps the company does not even realize.</li>
            <li> not a good smell.</li>
            <li> Not only was removal painful, they were also expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not only did this outragously priced small amount of nothing not work, but the smell was just horrific.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed, especially considering how expensive this oil was.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Freezing does not leave scars as this company wrongly claims.</li>
            <li> I used the product for weeks as recommended but it failed to remove or even reduce the tags.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for non working item.  </li>
            <li> It had become painful and irritated because of the location so that&#x27;s what prompted me to seek a remedy.</li>
            <li> The product burned my neck and produced a painful sore.</li>
            <li> Horrible customer care, useless product.</li>
            <li> Well, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> this oil is crap</li>
            <li> I probably would have given the product a bad review too!    </li>
            <li> I would like an email address to send a photo of the painful sores and swollen blotches all over my neck!</li>
            <li> This product smelled so awful</li>
            <li> (since my miserable student health insurance does not include any dermatology</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Save your money, this product does not work and the customer service is AWFUL!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I attempted to remove four skin tags.  I set it up as were thier were four skin tags, 1 small - 2 med - 1 large in the test.  One month three times a day and no progress.  I have labeled this product \\&quot;Failed\\&quot;  I usually have to visit the Doctor every two years to get some removed and was hoping to save the time, oh well it&#x27;s time for the next appointment.</li>
            <li> Three weeks ago I received my oil and began using it *six times a day on a small unsightly growth near the outer corner of my left eye. This morning, the entire growth fell off! Prior to finding this product, I had recently received estimates from a plastic surgeon, dermatologist, and ophthalmologist - all who quoted approximately $500.00 for the removal(!!) I am extremely delighted and will definitely order more of this product in the future, and can recommend it wholeheartedly. One time, a bit got in my eye and it burned mildly, but I immediately flushed with eye drops and the eye was fine within minutes.     I ordered the small bottle and still have half a bottle remaining.    GREAT PRODUCT.  Truly amazing.  What a bargain, especially when compared with the medical treatment costs that I would have been facing.    * They recommended using it only three times per day, but I used a very small drop on the end of a Q-Tip six times a day without any problem. I always wiped the surrounding area with a wet Q-Tip after applying the oil on the tag, to make sure the oil was not affecting the surrounding skin. During the last week, the surrounding area began to dry out a bit, so I also used an extremely small dab of antibiotic ointment each time as well, which kept the surrounding skin healthy.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly...just simply didn&#x27;t work well for me. I followed instructions as close to written as possible. Only minor effect on the tag. Have requested credit as offered by the company guarantee...will follow-up with resolution from company.    Update : Received a refund for this product...they deducted the shipping...which if listed in the 100 % refund guarantee that they would not refund shipping I missed it. In my opinion , not a product or company worth taking a chance on...</li>
            <li> Burned my skin. Very powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought the Heal Skin Tags formula about 17 days ago and got it pretty quick in the mail. I was excited to see results but am a skeptical person.    For the first 4-5 days I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin tags and was concerned, but the instructions told me to wait at least a week to two to see changes, so I was patient.    I am now on day 13 and some of the smaller tags are already gone! The biggest tags look as though they are drying up and I don&#x27;t want to pull at them, I will just let this treatment take care of those too.</li>
            <li> It has been over 3 weeks now, And this doesn;t seem to impact the skin tags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the manual says that it might take upto 6 weeks, so let&#x27;s wait and watch, but one thing is for sure, this product works really slow.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products in the past, but this product was the only product for skin tags that I have used that worked on my skin tags and helped me completely get rid of the skin tags on my neck and eyelids.    The only downside was that its a bottle and not a tube and it would have been nice to squeeze a tube to apply instead of using a bottle to get drops out.</li>
            <li> My eleven year old had a skin tag on her arm pit. She was scared to have it frozen, or cut off at the doctor. I read the positive reviews on this product, and thought that this would be a good alternitive.  Not only did this outragously priced small amount of nothing not work, but the smell was just horrific. This product is a waste of time, and money. It&#x27;s easier to just go to the doctor and have it numbed and cut off.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product to be effective in any way. This was disappointing since the productwas pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because of articles and reviews stating that it had been used, or was safe to use, on eye area or on eyelids. Nowhere on the company&#x27;s website does it state otherwise. However, when I received the product, the instructions accompanying the product state that they do not recommend using it on eyelids or eye area. Very disappointing. I have not tried it yet, and not sure if I will.</li>
            <li> I spent a fair amount of money on this product and got absolutely NO results. Don&#x27;t believe the 5-star reviews this product got. ZERO RESULTS after weeks of dedicated use.</li>
            <li> The tag never shrivelled up and died. It got a little hard and numb (but not numb enough to pull off) but the entire bottle later there was no progress justifying buying a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had a nice aroma and the tingle suggests it might work for some people but it didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been nearly three weeks and the product has not (yet)&lt;br /&gt;been successful. I figure if I use up the whole bottle and still&lt;br /&gt; hav the skin tags I&#x27;ll be making the trip to the dermatologist&lt;br /&gt;that I should have made in the first place.</li>
            <li> This product smelled so awful I used it twice then decided to just have the skin tag frozen off.  Maybe if it wasn&#x27;t so overbearing I may have tried it longer.  So, really cannot tell you if it would have worked or not.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic, but willing to try it.  At first, I saw no change in any of the skin tags.  Then after about 7 - 10 days, the 2 smallest ones on my neck were changing color. They are shriveling up more every day.  Now the large one on my neck is just starting to turn color.     For the people who say it didn&#x27;t work, I can only think that they didn&#x27;t apply it 3 times a day.  I think that is the key.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how good this stuff worked on my skin tag. It had become painful and irritated because of the location so that&#x27;s what prompted me to seek a remedy. The manufacturer claims that it can take 2-6 weeks for the skin tag to fall off. My skin tag came off in 4 DAYS!! I&#x27;m not kidding. The directions say to apply 3 times a day and DO NOT skip applications. I faithfully applied 3 times a day (sometimes 4 times) and it was GONE in 4 days after the first application. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> i had five skintags i wanted to remove and used for 3 to 4wks straight before i stopped use because my skin around the tags became irritated with puffiness, redness, darkening, and itching. Im not sure if i was all out allergic to the chemicals or got too much of the chemical on the surrounding skin. the skintags shrunk a little but they are still there. i have a little product left but havent used after i experienced irritation. i havent called the company that sponsers the product with a complaint because i realize all products dont work the same on all people. the skin surrounding the tags are back to normal but im not sure if i would finish the product or spend more in the future to have them professionally removed. Im not knocking the product or praising it. the use of this product is a judgement call on a case by case basis. another thing i can say is by it being made from natural products, i was surprised the smell was as strong as it was. not a good smell. none of the other reviews before me buying it stated that, but that was the first thing i noticed about the product. i rated it two stars because of the smell, i still have the tags, and the skin irritation but it may do wonders on someone else.</li>
            <li> They key to getting this product to work is to follow the instructions. I read through all the reviews before buying and I can see that people are not using it as they are supposed to! You have to apply 3 times per day and not miss applications.     I proved this theory because my wife and I both had skin tags on our neck and we both got a bottle of H-Skin Tags. I was only applying once a day and my wife applied 3 times per day. Her skin tags were gone in no time but I could see no change in mine. I honestly would have given up had I not seen the results my wife had. I probably would have given the product a bad review too!    My wife got rid of her skin tags quickly and it literally looks like they were never there. Pretty incredible. So I started to apply 3 times a day and made sure to not miss an application. Sure enough, the tags are now gone! Pretty incredible product.     I personally like the smell of it and that its completely natural. I think others are also using too much. Again, simply following the instructions goes a long way. You literally need to dab a tiny amount on each tag and if you do that you don&#x27;t smell a thing.    Moral of the story, the product absolutely works and only user error is to blame if it doesn&#x27;t work for you. Its a pity such a great product has a few bad reviews which are completely unwarranted.    Apply as per the instructions and you will get rid of your tags naturally, with no scarring and nobody will ever know you had them in the first place.    H-Skin Tags is worth every one of the 5 stars I am giving it! I hope people read this and follow this advice........This is a great product!</li>
            <li> The skin tag removal medicine seemed to feel really uncomfortable and burns when applied, but also has a really strong odor.  I would probably go to a dermatologist or a dr to see if they could prescribe something before purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I followed ALL the directions to a T -- and no change to the tags whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny how nearly all of the rave reviews here come from people who have only one review in their record -- this one. My guess is that they&#x27;re employees or family members affiliated with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I did find out how to naturally rid myself of these unsightly things (I had them under my eyes)...I simply stopped eating sugar and bread, and lost quite a bit of weight in the process to where I&#x27;m now very comfortable in my appearance as well as healthier than ever. The skin tags simply disappeared.</li>
            <li> I used the bottle as described. Everyday, 3 times until the bottle was empty. I did not see any change whatsoever. This thing did basically nothing at all. For sure it did not remove anything, not even the smallest tags there are.  Total Scam at least from my perspective. I am happy I only  bought a small  bottle so I only threw out 20 something dollars and not more.</li>
            <li> I had gone to dermatologists and plastic surgeons for my skin tags.  Not only was removal painful, they were also expensive.  I pinned my hopes on this product and followed directions to the letter.  The bottle is empty now after 4 weeks and it did not work.  Have to go back and search for something else.</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from the company.  The product burned my neck and produced a painful sore. When I wrote the company and asked to send them this photo, they didnt care one bit. My customer photo speaks for itself. See the photo I added to the product page under the product photo.  An excerpt of my email to the  company said:   \\&quot; The reason I am writing is to make sure that someone there with authority knows about this case! I would like an email address to send a photo of the painful sores and swollen blotches all over my neck! I definatley want to make sure the owner of this company sees exactly what this product has done to me! I would like to thank the customer service for handling this issue but I want to make sure this is taken seriously. Thank you kindly,    The reply I got back from the company said   \\&quot;Hi  Thank you for your email. We have credited you in full. Please return the bottle to us.  Kind regards  Dina \\&quot;    My final thought... If it was my company, I would definately care if someone was injured.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely for six weeks. It did absolutely nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I tried the product on a skin tag on my neck.  I used it as directed for three weeks until I could no longer stand the smell of it.  My personal biochemistry proved resistant as it had no effect whatsoever.  The skin tag was the victor in the struggle.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time but it seems it takes a long time before you start to see a slight change with the skin tags.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a long, thorough review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing against the company, but if you want to remove skin tags within two weeks I highly recommend using Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Freeze Away product. It comes with 7 treatments, though you really only need one treatment for most cases, and costs a measly $10. Thus, the Freeze Away product is more effective, takes two weeks, and costs close to nothing. The Freeze Away product completely destroys H-Skin Tags. Do not waste your money and time. Below I discuss the details of freezing and eventually discuss H-Skin Tags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freezing does not leave scars as this company wrongly claims. It&#x27;s honestly a completely ridiculous claim that perhaps the company does not even realize. The &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; you see immediately after treatment and for 1-2 weeks are completely fine and are very temporary. The black color (dead skin cells caused by freezing) changes into a scab that eventually falls off, leaving perfectly healthy new skin cells in its place, not a scar. Healing Natural Oils must not understand what a scar is. Anyway, my dermatologist uses liquid nitrogen to remove warts, skin tags, etc. It&#x27;s a fantastic treatment method, however it costs an arm and a leg for each liquid nitrogen treatment even with great health insurance, which is where Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Freeze Away product comes into play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Freeze Away product uses diethyl ether, with propane as the propellant. The temperature is not as low as liquid nitrogen, but it gets the job done. Diethyl ether is not as scary as it may sound to the general public or pure holistic people. It&#x27;s very safe when used in this manner and evaporates very quickly. It touches the skin and immediately evaporates as the boiling point of this ether is very low. Ascorbic acid is the chemical name for vitamin C. Sure, the freezing hurts for a couple minutes, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal. It feels like normal bee sting to be honest. It&#x27;s a very small price to pay. The afflicted skincells die within seconds and your body does the rest of the work. Eventually a scab forms and falls off in 1-2 weeks and your damaged skin cells are replaced with new normal skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, as described, takes about three months on average before you see any results. You must apply it every three hours and it has a very pungent odor. Not something you want others to smell on you.</li>
            <li> Minimal results after going though a small bottle.  Will try something else that has quicker results.  I would not purchase again</li>
            <li> hasnt worked yet and this is my second bottle</li>
            <li> I should be known this wouldn&#x27;t work but decided to try.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this oil is crap and so is there phony 90 day money back guarantee Do not get taken like I did</li>
            <li> I bought this only because I read good reviews here on amazon and I was desperate with a tag that was growing really fast. I even pondered chopping it off with scissors at home (since my miserable student health insurance does not include any dermatology services).&lt;br /&gt;So I had 2 tags having same color as the skin and 3 tags with hyperpigmentation (that is mole-like color).&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing (so far) to the tags with hyperpigmentation. But within 5 days I started seeing very visible results on the tags having same color as the skin. The one that was growing fast was 2 millimeter diameter when I started the treatment and now its already completely gone, after less than two weeks. It basically shrank and dried out, you could see the size decreasing each day, with just 3 applications a day.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the same would happen with hyperpigmented tags but I think those might have roots just like moles do, so it is probably a different type of skin blemish, or it might just take much longer to see a change. If I see a change in my hyperpigmented tags I will post an update here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient is melaleuca alternifolia, that is tea tree oil. I am not sure one would get the same result just applying tea tree (which of course would cost way less than this product), but anyway I am satisfied of the way this product made my two tags disappear with no pain, no scar, no effort.</li>
            <li> I used the bottle as directed. not one of my skin tags fell off. not even the smallest ones. to top it off I put a review on amazon before saying I hoped this product worked and the company sent me an email asking me to take it down. I am fair, I took it down , but you want me to say a good review, make a product that works. at 30 a bottle I&#x27;m going to bitch. if it were like 10, just chalk it up to wasting money. save your money folks and freeze your skin tags off at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I used this oil EXACTLY as directed for a month and a half, and it did absolutely NOTHING AT ALL to change the condition of my skin tags. I&#x27;m really disappointed, especially considering how expensive this oil was. I should have just gone to the dermatologist in the first place and not wasted my time. I will not be purchasing any items from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> Did not work.  Used it as directed on several different areas and no change.  Money I will never get back.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work as well as stated</li>
            <li> Made absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> You should read all the 1 and 2 star reviews... REAL!  I bought this product and used on my skin tags on my neck. Did not work. I share the sentiment with all the 1 and 2 star people. I posted this in the 5 star category so that you would save yourself the money and wishful thinking about this product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived  ontime and so far products does work, it takes time but amvery happy with the product, thank you for helping to solve one of lifes problems. Highly recommed this to others that need to get rid of tags.Thank you .</li>
            <li> I am not a review person but felt obliged to share my review after this product worked wonderfully on me. I had 4 skin tags and after 3 times daily application, they all dried up and went away after a few weeks. I was skeptical at first but this product does really work! You just have to be patient and keep applying it daily. [[ASIN:B003IN1QHC Skin Tag Removal 11ml - H-Skin Tags]]</li>
            <li> I rated this a five thought it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Upon seeing a doctor I have a different problem, these oils would not have helped.  It is better to consult with a professional to know exactly what your dealing with health wise.  My error.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me . I used two bottles on one tag for over 3months .</li>
            <li> Used this product exactly as it says and got no results. Bottle was tiny and didn&#x27;t last but a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 5 weeks and all it has done is make them bigger.  I have been using 3 times a day like the instructions say.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with results.......</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles, and 2 bottles later nothing happened. I still had the skin tags, they weren&#x27;t effected at all.&lt;br /&gt;I highly advise against this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th week and the bottle is almost empty. I followed directions to the letter but I see no changes to my skin tags. I&#x27;m glad I read these reviews. Now I know it isn&#x27;t just me that got duped.</li>
            <li> This product was totally ineffective- I would not recommend it to anyone. After using as directed, there was no difference on the skin tags. I will be asking for a refund.</li>
            <li> The smell was very offensive and it burned as if salt had been poured in an open wound.  Had to wash off after about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful after reading the reviews on this product that it would work.  I followed the instructions EXACTLY and went through two bottles without seeing any results at all.  By the way, be prepared for a STRONG odor when applying these, it is really STRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the company for a refund and explained I only had the last of the two bottles, as I anticipated it to work and didn&#x27;t pay attention that I needed to send BOTH bottles back for a full refund (minus shipping/tax).  Customer Care told me this would be no problem, just send the one bottle back and write a note to that effect.  Since they had record that I bought two bottles they would take care of the refund for both bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the rest of the story...they refunded me the one bottle and refused to refund the other since it wasn&#x27;t shipped back to them.  They stated I should have called in and asked for a stronger dose to be mixed up.  What????  Horrible customer care, useless product.</li>
            <li> Applied as directed, absolutely no change whatsoever using each product, \\&quot;H-Moles\\&quot; and \\&quot;H-Skin Tags\\&quot;. Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It work for short time.i was told that it might work on other people due to different chemistry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It seems to work fine. I guess I will see in a few weeks if this works fully or not.</li>
            <li> This does not work on anal skin tags aka sentinel piles</li>
            <li> I used the product for weeks as recommended but it failed to remove or even reduce the tags. It ultimately caused skin irritation, redness, swelling, and peeling of the surrounding skin. After use of the product was discontinued and all peeling, swelling, redness, and irritation subsided, the tags remained undiminished. Do not waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions did not work</li>
            <li> to soon to judge ,but for $30.00 I belevied I was getting the large bottlte there will be no reorders.</li>
            <li> Hoping would work but tried on just on one skin tag for nearly 5 weeks now with zero change.  Used 3 times a day.  Smelled exactly like others tried.  Very expensive for non working item.  Very Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I used this on two tags. One on eyelid and one under arm. Went through the whole bottle in a month. I followed instructions to a tee. The tags did shrink but didn&#x27;t go away. The bottle makes it hard to control how much goes onto the q-tip. This is probably why I went through the whole bottle to fast. Subsequently I started to use a product calle Tag Away from Rite Aid for half the cost. Has the same feel as H-Skin Tags. Comes with built-in applicator brush. Tags are nearly gone after 4 weeks and still have more than half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> Save your money, this product does not work and the customer service is AWFUL!! This was a pure waste of money.</li>
            <li> Did not work,  I previously used it and it worked.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product and thought, sure why not try it.  Well, I was disappointed.  Not so much with the product, but with how often and that I didn&#x27;t have enough to even complete the process for the required time.  It would be nice if there was a way to suggest you get enough for the whole time frame.  Bottle was small.</li>
            <li> Read that it was safe to use on eyes but when I got it found out that it isn&#x27;t.  Have been trying it on a tag on my arm (three times a day religiously) and haven&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> this helped alot but the bottle is to small i wished it was alot more to use</li>
            <li> Been using it for over 5 weeks - twice a day but no visible change or improvement. Will not recommend</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet...too early.</li>
            <li> have been applying this to my skin for several months and did not work!&lt;br /&gt;also have a really strong smell which lingers for several hours</li>
            <li> We had ordered this product and then after reading the reviews, decided to cancel it. My experience with Healing Natural Oils was quite different than portrayed in many reviews. I found them quick to respond and canceled my order with out difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on this experience I may reorder the product in the near future.</li>
            <li> So far this isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong takes too long to take effet don&#x27;t like the fact of using it more than once a day and smelling all day</li>
            <li> I have been using almost everyday, Did not work and the skin around the skin tag became black and looks like burnt.</li>
            <li> 3 weeks and so far no results, used at least twice a day, though recommended 3 times everyday for month.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the $.</li>
            <li> This worked great on my son&#x27;s skin tag.  His skin tag was on his eyelid.  It has a pretty strong odor, so prepare yourself.</li>
            <li> Did not work for at all. I contacted with the company. They sent the stronger formula to me. It still did not work at all. Waste money and effort.</li>
