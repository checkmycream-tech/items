            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Pleasant not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent is beautiful and conjures up warm images and fond memories of the Emerald Isle.</li>
            <li>I loved that about it.</li>

            <li>it was a timely delivery and good price.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent of the Inis family collection!  </li>
            <li>Love this scent!</li>
            <li>Reminds me of Ireland when I have it on, which is my favorite part!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>A nice addition to my perfume assortment.</li>
            <li>This is not the knock-your-socks-off, old-lady rose smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice floral notes.</li>
            <li>I love this scent - very light and airy!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and this is a huge size at a great value?</li>
            <li>Its a nice scent that is not to overwhelming</li>
            <li>The Inis Arose is a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I love inis of Ireland but didn&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li>Inis Arose is more citrusy than floral.  </li>
            <li>, I just wish it had more of a floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Received many compliments.</li>
            <li>This is a fragrance I have used for many years</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Inis:</li>
            <li>There is nothing better than having a man stop you to ask you what it is you&#x27;re wearing because they want to get it for their spouse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>No chemical odor like you get in many perfumes.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can order it here,</li>
            <li>It is very worth it to own it.</li>
            <li>The Inis Rose isn&#x27;t all that unique.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and has a very true rose smell.</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful fresh rose scent, very natural.</li>
            <li>It can easily be worn most of the year (maybe not winter).  </li>
            <li>i love all the Ireland fragrances;  I just ordered the body lotion in this fragrance;  I wish it stayed with me a little longer, otherwise it is the perfect fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I smelled this for the first time in Ireland - I was in love with it!  </li>
            <li>Received item quickly and my mom loves the scent!</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase it as it is a lovely light scent for this &amp;#34;non perfume lover&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>I read such great reviews on Inis</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wish there were a shower gel available.</li>
            <li>fit the bill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice perfume at a nice price.  </li>
            <li>Inis Arose is very clean and fresh</li>
            <li>Love this new fragrance, loved the regular Inis and this is just as nice</li>
            <li>I also like these scents because they are animal friendly and as in the case of &amp;#34;Energy of the Sea&amp;#34; a portion of the money goes to help Whales and Dolphins.</li>
            <li>I  used original Inis for years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but I have other perfumes I enjoy much more.  </li>
            <li>Arose is so light but yet so bold that it makes it a pleasure to wear.</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much nothing I have</li>
            <li>and I have many perfumes it reminds so much of my childhood at my grandmother house</li>
            <li>Not too sweet or spicy.</li>
            <li>so I can use it more frequently but would be willing to pay more for something that lasted longer.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly so I would recommend the buyer as well.</li>
            <li>Very soft and lovely, feminine scent.  </li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for several years now - nice mild scent - pleasing, not over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one who likes heavy floral scents, but this formula is light, crisp and clean... a very refreshing spring scent.  </li>
            <li>next favorite was the INIS Moonlight</li>
            <li>but wish the scent would last more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I first became aquainted with this perfume on a trip to Ireland in 1999 and have used it exclusively ever since.</li>
            <li>and then I wanted to get a good price for the larger size that I would be using almost daily this deal</li>
            <li>I bought this scent because I loved &amp;#34;Energy of the Sea&amp;#34; and almost all of the other scents developed by this company.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the product listing</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the perfume Flirt by Prescriptives, which I wore in high school.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again and highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Long lasting, fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the normal Inis and thought I&#x27;d try another version.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty, the  fragrance is light but also  the aroma is heavy with  flowers  </li>
            <li>So very feminine, long lasting, and light.</li>
            <li>Nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>There is never a time when I feel &amp;#34;over scented&amp;#34; and the zero presence of white flower makes wearing my first truly floral based perfume in years a thrill.</li>
            <li>Arose is no exception to my experience with Fo&#x27;I scents so far.</li>
            <li>Complete lack of fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft fragrance, nothing overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I was trepidatious at first about trying it but was so surprised that I decided to give other scents from the line a try.</li>
            <li>But the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about Arose was that my other Inis was such a unique scent.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this scent so much nothing I have comes close to it and I have many perfumes it reminds so much of my childhood at my grandmother house thanks so very much great seller too</li>
            <li> I ran out of the normal Inis and thought I&#x27;d try another version. The Inis Arose is a lovely scent. It&#x27;s light and has a very true rose smell. It can easily be worn most of the year (maybe not winter).  But the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about Arose was that my other Inis was such a unique scent.  I loved that about it. The Inis Rose isn&#x27;t all that unique. I feel like it&#x27;s really similar to a Victoria Secret perfume I used to have.</li>
            <li> Its hard to purchase a fragrance without trying it first. I love inis of Ireland but didn&#x27;t like this one. I gave it away</li>
            <li> I read such great reviews on Inis Arose, so I decided to blindly purchase some without a prior sniff.  It&#x27;s good, but I have other perfumes I enjoy much more.  Inis Arose is more citrusy than floral.  It reminds me of the perfume Flirt by Prescriptives, which I wore in high school.  Inis Arose is very clean and fresh, I just wish it had more of a floral fragrance.  It&#x27;s nice.  I&#x27;m wearing it today, but have not received compliments like I do when I wear other perfumes.  My boyfriend seems to like it, but he enjoys others I wear.  Overall, it&#x27;s a nice perfume at a nice price.  I will continue to wear it here and there, but prefer my other perfumes.  A nice addition to my perfume assortment.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance. Pleasant not overpowering. Received many compliments.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly and my mom loves the scent!</li>
            <li> Everytime when I apply this perfume, everyone around me will ask what perfume is it? smell so good. So make me very happy too. It is very worth it to own it.</li>
            <li> Love this new fragrance, loved the regular Inis and this is just as nice</li>
            <li> Very soft and lovely, feminine scent.  This is not the knock-your-socks-off, old-lady rose smell.  I wish there were a shower gel available.</li>

            <li> This is a fragrance I have used for many years and I love it.</li>
            <li> One day a patient came into my office weareing this sent.  I just had to ask what it was, and ordered it for myself.  One of my coworkers said I smelled like spring.  Its a nice scent that is not to overwhelming</li>
            <li> I bought this scent because I loved &amp;#34;Energy of the Sea&amp;#34; and almost all of the other scents developed by this company.  Picture a nosegay of rosebuds, ferns and clover and sprinkle a few dewdrops over it and there you have it!  I also like these scents because they are animal friendly and as in the case of &amp;#34;Energy of the Sea&amp;#34; a portion of the money goes to help Whales and Dolphins.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty, the  fragrance is light but also  the aroma is heavy with  flowers  that bloom in the evening..</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Inis: Arose Eau de Parfum but wish the scent would last more than an hour or so. Being a Parfum I thought it would. The price base is great so I can use it more frequently but would be willing to pay more for something that lasted longer. I will continue to purchase it as it is a lovely light scent for this &amp;#34;non perfume lover&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> Due to my body chemistry and a total aversion to white flower (gives me a migraine) I have always avoided predominantly floral based scents. But a few years ago a client brought me back a bottle of Inis Or from her trip to Ireland. I was trepidatious at first about trying it but was so surprised that I decided to give other scents from the line a try. Never once in any of the scents that I have gotten from Fragrances of Ireland have they given me a headache or been so overpowering that I didn&#x27;t want to wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inis Arose is no exception to my experience with Fo&#x27;I scents so far. Arose is so light but yet so bold that it makes it a pleasure to wear. There is never a time when I feel &amp;#34;over scented&amp;#34; and the zero presence of white flower makes wearing my first truly floral based perfume in years a thrill. There is nothing better than having a man stop you to ask you what it is you&#x27;re wearing because they want to get it for their spouse.</li>
            <li> Complete lack of fragrance.  I  used original Inis for years.  This is one and done.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and this is a huge size at a great value? Awesome! Thanks so much for the product listing</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent.  Reminds me of trip to Ireland.  Will buy again and highly recommend .</li>
            <li> My favorite scent of the Inis family collection!  I&#x27;m not one who likes heavy floral scents, but this formula is light, crisp and clean... a very refreshing spring scent.  I receive compliments on it regularly.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! So very feminine, long lasting, and light. Nice floral notes. Reminds me of Ireland when I have it on, which is my favorite part!</li>
            <li> i love all the Ireland fragrances;  I just ordered the body lotion in this fragrance;  I wish it stayed with me a little longer, otherwise it is the perfect fragrance.  Not too sweet or spicy.</li>
            <li> I first became aquainted with this perfume on a trip to Ireland in 1999 and have used it exclusively ever since. The scent is beautiful and conjures up warm images and fond memories of the Emerald Isle. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> I buy a bottle of this for my lady every year. She loves it and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;Not an overpowering scent. Nice and subtle. My lady can&#x27;t handle over powering smells&lt;br /&gt;but she says this one is the best and makes her feel like a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to any lady needing a great perfume or a gift.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife who was introduced to this brand in Ireland.She loves the scent and so do I. It is subtle and not overpowering. The product came quickly so I would recommend the buyer as well.</li>
            <li> My wife is of Irish descent. I purchased this perfume for her to suppliment her other gifts from me, and she loves it! It is now the only perfume she will wear. It has a beautiful fresh rose scent, very natural. No chemical odor like you get in many perfumes. She is very pleased.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, so it makes the perfect gift.  What more can I say.  It has a soft fragrance, nothing overpowering.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I love this scent - very light and airy!</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for several years now - nice mild scent - pleasing, not over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy online.</li>
            <li> Ever since I smelled this for the first time in Ireland - I was in love with it!  I love that I can order it here,</li>
