            <li> Was very disappointed but, aside from that the product itself was great!</li>
            <li> It left my hair hydrated, silky, soft and shinier than the other ones.  </li>
            <li> , it detangled my extra long hair so I could comb it through.</li>
            <li> I used it as a deep conditioner i put it on dry hair that i parted in sections and just worked it in..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and a natural 4B/C.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes later I rinsed it out and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> her hair is long and shiny and glossy.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair dry and there is no shine to my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Every winter my waist length hair gets dry and I always just dealt with it.</li>
            <li> I applied the Kanechom Gloss to my wet hair and put a shower cap on.</li>
            <li> Left out a star due to the poor packaging for shipping.</li>
            <li> It should be noted I have dyed and chemically straightened hair, so it tends to get dry and dull.</li>
            <li> The contents had frozen the lid had broken open.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that there was a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Ill admit it, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> So skeptical I didn&#x27;t use for a month.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair hard. :(</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed at all.</li>

            <li> Ill admit it, I was skeptical.  So skeptical I didn&#x27;t use for a month.  Finally thought I would try it.  Love it so much Ive shared with 3 friends a small sample, and they also ordered.</li>
            <li> my friend used this product at her hair salon. when i saw her i asked her what did she do at the hair salon to her hair. she told me she gets her hair glossed every 2-weeks her hair stylist used KANECHOM GLOSS on her hair. she is a brunette. her hair is long and shiny and glossy. no split ends just unbelievable beautiful hair. Her hair looks like Kim Kardashian&#x27;s hair. However, I tried  to purchase it onAMAZON. ITS UNAVAILABLE.ITS BEEN UNAVAILABLE FOREVER. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. I really would love to try this great product. AMAZON PLEASE STOCK UP KANECHOM GLOSS ITS VERY POPULAR. Its the best stuff ever. It makes the hair fantastic. It works on all types of hair. This product is on my wish list forever.</li>
            <li> This is the best gloss conditioner on the market.  Not only does it leave hair soft and shiny, it smells clean and fresh.  You are supposed to leave it in for five minutes, but in a pinch I&#x27;ve rinsed sooner and still had great results.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not noticing a wow factor as I heard about this product. It&#x27;s a regular conditioner to me</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and maybe I used to much...&lt;br /&gt;It did make my hair very shiny and a dream to flat iron though within the course of an hour my hair frizz up like nobody business.. it feels like some residue of it is still in my hair.. so though I don&#x27;t want to I will go ahead and re shampoo and condition my hair then I will probably roller set then wrap it. If it still feels the way it feels now it will be going back Unfourtanely!!!! Either way I will update!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. My hair didn&#x27;t look that different when it came to shine but this stuff will leave your hair feeling so soft. It came on time, and for the price it&#x27;s a lot of conditioner so I was very happy about that. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I loved how hair looked. Only 4 stars because it did not keep frizz away...will buy again</li>
            <li> Worked wonderfully on my 4C hair, just to let you know there is hope with this product..I used it as a deep conditioner i put it on dry hair that i parted in sections and just worked it in..did a twist out after rinsing it out... it came out really good &#x3D;) actually saw a difference in my hair..I think I&#x27;m ready to see what my hair will look like after continued use..Wish me luck !!!</li>
            <li> My first time trying this conditioner, after listening to many reviews, and I must say my here loves it, my hair is in its natural state, my curls were soft manageable , this stuff is excellent</li>
            <li> The trick is to not wash it out all of the way when you wash it out. It&#x27;s best if you leave the tiniest bit in.</li>
            <li> Great great great. Love all of their products !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and a natural 4B/C. I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair but this still works for me. It smells great and I can get my curls to do whatever I want them to do with this product. No build up. Excellent!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. Leaves hair soft, and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Great light weight conditioner. It detangle curly hair very well.</li>
            <li> This just could be my favorite Kanechom conditioner.  It left my hair hydrated, silky, soft and shinier than the other ones.  The fragrance is very pleasant.  I always use these conditioners with a hair steamer treatment to enhance their benefits.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells Good Too!</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t live up to what it claims to be. It makes my hair dry and there is no shine to my hair at all. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love it on my hair, it does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner beyond words to explain it!!!! Every winter my waist length hair gets dry and I always just dealt with it. I saw the reviews for Kanechom products and Youtube videos and decided to try it. I applied the Kanechom Gloss to my wet hair and put a shower cap on. 30 minutes later I rinsed it out and let it air dry. It&#x27;s beyond shiny and soft!!!! I am of mixed ethnicities white,filipino, and native american so my hair type is different. I want to tell everyone of every hair type that this is PLATINUM hair conditioner.....the BEST!!!!!! I plan on trying more types of conditioners that the Kanechom has available. You will not be disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Fantastic and Transformative - My hair has that Jennifer Hudson gloss and shine!</li>
            <li> Next I will try some of the Shae Butter once it&#x27;s back in stock. It&#x27;s obviously very popular...can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> Made my hair hard. :(</li>
            <li> Product was awesome,  great smelling and made my hair so silky. Left out a star due to the poor packaging for shipping. Received the product in a soggy envelope. The contents had frozen the lid had broken open. The seller might want considered bubble wrapping an putting in a box. Was very disappointed but, aside from that the product itself was great!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I mixed it with silicon mix conditioner it worked great on my hair</li>
            <li> Used it a couple of times dont see much of a difference but it smelly good and the container is huge. I use it as a detangler in the shower.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the other conditioners.. This is a gloss, but no gloss came through!! I got more gloss using their other conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> I was shocked that there was a lot of positive reviews.  I did not see any difference after using it 3 times.  I use Dove Damage Daily shampoo and conditioner so maybe that is why I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> For starters, lets address the shipping condition. It came in its own shrink wrapped plastic, so no leaks or spills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a gel kind of consistency, and a little seems to go a long way. I love it, it detangled my extra long hair so I could comb it through. Most conditioners don&#x27;t so yay! I let my hair dry naturally (so I wasn&#x27;t adding any other product) and my hair is super silky and shiny. It should be noted I have dyed and chemically straightened hair, so it tends to get dry and dull. This is WELL worth the price, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
