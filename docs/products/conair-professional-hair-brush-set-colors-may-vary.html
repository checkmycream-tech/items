            <li>My favorite brush!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy it unless you have real fine hair that doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>They work great and are cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice brush set that doesn&#x27;t yank out my hair or scrape my scalp</li>
            <li>Great brush set and cost friendly.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush set and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very glad to be able to find these brushes again.  </li>
            <li>did try the ion detangling brushes and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with them personally.</li>
            <li>For two reasons I found they caused me to have much more static electricity in my hair.</li>
            <li>smaller one is the perfect size for travel.</li>
            <li>This brush didnt have as many \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; as my Goodie brand brush from walmart...</li>
            <li>Glad I found it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Use it every day and love it.  </li>
            <li>it goes through my hair and makes me look better...</li>
            <li>lol really amazon</li>
            <li>I like this twin set because the smaller brush is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>After using two more uses....</li>
            <li>OK for combing.</li>
            <li>What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better suited for longer hair.</li>
            <li>Replacement for one that lasted many years.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>My favorite brush...</li>
            <li>Nice wide bristles are great for blow drying hair!</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a full size brush for home and one to keep in my dopp kit for travel.</li>
            <li>very nice brushes I needed some new ones and didn&#x27;t see these in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great brush set for women with naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sturdy and of good quality.</li>
            <li>Still, decent product for a good price.</li>
            <li>The set is fine.  </li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>fine for what I needed - no problems receiving promptly.</li>
            <li>They are also easy to clean</li>
            <li>The set is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Comfy hand grip easy to keep clean as well.</li>
            <li>light, larger, padded handle is good for my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean, but the best for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>I loved these brushes back then because of 2 things.</li>
            <li>Great little hairbrush set for the price.</li>
            <li>These are great and functional everyday hairbrushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes were popular back several years ago, before ion brushes became so popular.</li>
            <li>I can get the hair out of the brush to clean it more easily with this style than any other.  </li>
            <li>These are great brushes and well worth the money I used a small one on my dog</li>
            <li>I have very dense hair and a lot, it brushes fairly easy and doesn&#x27;t pull too much, even when I don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li>bristles too few and very cheaply made and the tips catch in my hair and my grand daughter&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li>But still, product is high quality and true to it&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li>First review posted was 1 star.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two others which I love, a very short time ago, and now these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The first week I used this brush..</li>
            <li>Gave it to my grand daughter and she has the same problems.</li>
            <li>The larger brush is great for long hair.</li>
            <li>how much can you say about a brush - its plastic and it works</li>
            <li>I purchased them for my weekender bag to have ready at a moments notice.  </li>
            <li>Both are very durable.</li>
            <li>Was really looking for softer bristles with this density.  </li>
            <li>I  expected more from Conair - really surprised -</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Throughout the day the smaller brush is sufficient to give the already styled hair a fresh look.</li>
            <li>These are good brushes for long, extremely thick hair.  </li>
            <li>the large brush is way too big for me.</li>
            <li>A large brush for the bathroom, and smaller one for my purse.</li>
            <li>These brushes usually last me about a whole year or 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>obviously If you like durable open hard bristled brushes this set is great especially if you have a daughter that can use the smaller one.</li>
            <li>They last a  long while and as  you can see the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Nice &amp; sturdy - have been using for several months on thick, long hair.</li>
            <li>Enter this brush...no longer hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>They do exactly what they say they will detangle wet or dry hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Enter this brush...no longer hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> They do exactly what they say they will detangle wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> My short bristle brush is too short for my hair, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m quite long enough for this brush (on my way though).</li>
            <li> and they last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Like any brush you have to remove your hair from time to time but the open back spacing keeps it from molding/smelling if you brush your hair while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Not great for styling very straight and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The tips of bristles do come off over long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I have had a love/hate relationship with this type of hairbrush for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It has open-air slits so you can brush your hair while it is wet and also makes drying a lot easier from the back as well.</li>
            <li> have thick long normal hair!  </li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and they were as expected.</li>
            <li> To wide between bristles- but an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Is as expected</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll due.</li>
            <li> the brush broke in half..  </li>
            <li> These brushes are way too stiff</li>
            <li> They were also not easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> simply can;t go wrong with this set.</li>
            <li> Purchased this set just to get the small one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had another one just like it for years and can&#x27;t seem to find the small one in any of the stores.  </li>
            <li> This is the first thing I ever bought something from Amazon that I was disappointed in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to review this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how badly I needed new brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush; hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> These brushes work well in my thin and easily-tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  </li>
            <li> was disappointed but still usable</li>
            <li> I hate it when the bristles&#x27; tips get removed one by one.</li>

            <li> These brushes work well in my thin and easily-tangled hair. They were a great deal and I keep one at home and one in my briefcase for on the go.</li>
            <li> These brushes were popular back several years ago, before ion brushes became so popular. I loved these brushes back then because of 2 things. They do exactly what they say they will detangle wet or dry hair and they last a really long time. They are also easy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try the ion detangling brushes and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with them personally. For two reasons I found they caused me to have much more static electricity in my hair. They were also not easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very glad to be able to find these brushes again.  In the set of two  I like to keep one in my bathroom and one in my bag I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome value for 2 brushes. I use both brushes. The big one stays at home and smaller one is the perfect size for travel. These brushes usually last me about a whole year or 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in between long/short, and it is great for blow drying and hair straightening.</li>
            <li> great price and good quality</li>
            <li> great deal - good grip on handle which is what I needed</li>
            <li> Nice to have a full size brush for home and one to keep in my dopp kit for travel.</li>
            <li> First review posted was 1 star.  That was a mistake.  This product is definitely 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This brush didnt have as many \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; as my Goodie brand brush from walmart...was disappointed but still usable...will stick to Wally next time...</li>
            <li> The set is fantastic. Great deal too.</li>
            <li> bristles too few and very cheaply made and the tips catch in my hair and my grand daughter&#x27;s hair...I  expected more from Conair - really surprised -</li>
            <li> You simply can;t go wrong with this set. It&#x27;s so affordable and of very good quality. I hate it when the bristles&#x27; tips get removed one by one. I&#x27;ve never had that problem with these brushes. It&#x27;s a good deal, what can I say?!</li>
            <li> Purchased this set just to get the small one.  I&#x27;ve had another one just like it for years and can&#x27;t seem to find the small one in any of the stores.  Glad I found it here on Amazon.  Use it every day and love it.  Works well on my super-fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush; hard plastic.  It&#x27;ll due.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
            <li> Its a brush.. its a multipack... it goes through my hair and makes me look better... four more words! lol really amazon how much can you say about a brush - its plastic and it works</li>
            <li> These are good brushes however I lost them both within a week. Thats on me not conair obviously If you like durable open hard bristled brushes this set is great especially if you have a daughter that can use the smaller one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Conair brushes for years. They work great and are cheap. I like this twin set because the smaller brush is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Using these every day.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and they were as expected. They&#x27;re very sturdy and of good quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are way too stiff so I had to buy different ones.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes for long, extremely thick hair.  The tips of bristles do come off over long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful combo product- excellent quality and a great price</li>
            <li> Just what my husband wanted. Good price for two brushes.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush! Wish they didn&#x27;t sell it as a 2-pack... the large brush is way too big for me.</li>
            <li> To wide between bristles- but an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> These are perfect! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great sizes. I purchased them for my weekender bag to have ready at a moments notice.  They are sturdy and wash up well.  And not to mention a great buy.</li>
            <li> Nice brush set that doesn&#x27;t yank out my hair or scrape my scalp I guess. Comfy hand grip easy to keep clean as well.</li>
            <li> I am a CONAIR person.  I ordered two others which I love, a very short time ago, and now these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMNED CONAIR TO EVERYONE.</li>
            <li> Both size brushes are great for on the go and home. I have very dense hair and a lot, it brushes fairly easy and doesn&#x27;t pull too much, even when I don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush set and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> corresponde a lo comprado muy bueno, excelente producto</li>
            <li> Bought these for my nephews who&#x27;ve discovered the Afro.  Great brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. Good price.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed. A large brush for the bathroom, and smaller one for my purse. Both are very durable.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing I ever bought something from Amazon that I was disappointed in.  I bought the brush because it stated that it was a de-tangler. The first week I used this brush.. the middle pieces broke out.  After using two more uses.... the brush broke in half..  It&#x27;s garbage.. don&#x27;t buy it unless you have real fine hair that doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li> Great brush set for women with naturally curly hair.  Larger brush gets you straighter hair when using blow dryer.  Conair quality is also great.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. Good Job!!</li>
            <li> Not great for styling very straight and coarse hair. OK for combing.</li>
            <li> Great set. Just what I wanted? Amazon did it again!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  Can&#x27;t seem to remember to buy stuff like this when I am out shopping.  Was really looking for softer bristles with this density.  But still, product is high quality and true to it&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and great price.  No issues.</li>
            <li> I can not use this brush......puts static through my hair!!!  Gave it to my grand daughter and she has the same problems.</li>
            <li> What can I say. It&#x27;s a brush and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Great brush set and cost friendly.</li>
            <li> I have had a love/hate relationship with this type of hairbrush for a long time.  Hard to clean, but the best for my purposes.  Enter this brush...no longer hard to clean.  I can get the hair out of the brush to clean it more easily with this style than any other.  These are great!</li>
            <li> Two hairbrushes. You... brush your hair with them? I&#x27;m not really sure how to review this. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes.  My husband grabbed the smaller one and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> Great value and I love Conair products very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great little hairbrush set for the price. It has open-air slits so you can brush your hair while it is wet and also makes drying a lot easier from the back as well. Like any brush you have to remove your hair from time to time but the open back spacing keeps it from molding/smelling if you brush your hair while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Its a brush.  What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li> The set is fine.  Is as expected</li>
            <li> These are great brushes and well worth the money I used a small one on my dog and he loves it too.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Fine. Good.</li>
            <li> Two good quality hairbrushes. One is perfect for travel size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hairbrush. I think it&#x27;s better suited for longer hair. My short bristle brush is too short for my hair, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m quite long enough for this brush (on my way though). Still, decent product for a good price.</li>
            <li> Replacement for one that lasted many years.  Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> THE BEST I HAVE ALWAYS USED THESE BRUSHES SO I TRY TO STOCK UP ON THEM WHEN I FIND THEM COS U CANT FIND THEM IN STORES ANY MORE SUPERB PRICE TOO.</li>
            <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> Good quality brush. Same design as my Conair brush of 15 years that it replaced. Can&#x27;t beat the price and durability.</li>
            <li> These are great and functional everyday hairbrushes.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush...light, larger, padded handle is good for my arthritic hands. Have several.</li>
            <li> Perfect sizes. Sturdy!</li>
            <li> Nice wide bristles are great for blow drying hair!</li>
            <li> fine for what I needed - no problems receiving promptly.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these brushes for ages, they used to be called Scrunchies and I have used them for years. They last a  long while and as  you can see the price is right.  Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> We like the Conair hair brush.  This is a brand that our family uses because it is an attractive brush, doesnt hara perfect size and shape and is easy to wash.</li>
            <li> very nice brushes I needed some new ones and didn&#x27;t see these in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick long normal hair!  Great for backbrushing to add volume.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how badly I needed new brushes. These worked out great.</li>
            <li> Bristles have almost all fallen out!  Crappy brush!</li>
            <li> The two sizes of hair brushes will take care styling needs all day. The larger brush is great for long hair. Throughout the day the smaller brush is sufficient to give the already styled hair a fresh look.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; sturdy - have been using for several months on thick, long hair.</li>
