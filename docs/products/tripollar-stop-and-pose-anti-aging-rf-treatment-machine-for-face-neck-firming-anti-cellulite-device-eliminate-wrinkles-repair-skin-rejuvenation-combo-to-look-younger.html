            <li>Way cheaper and really good product.</li>
            <li>The salesman done a good job.  </li>
            <li>I have good muscle tone in my legs</li>
            <li>A very good deal with special discount on this value kit.</li>
            <li>The products were packed nicely too.</li>
            <li>service from TOP Beauty was good.  </li>
            <li>The time factor for a lot of people to do this effectively would be prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I find both tools very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate!</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have more energy, I am more productive ..</li>
            <li>so it is a better designed tool from that aspect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it:)</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with the purchase, the items received and the speed of shipment and communication of the vendor.</li>
            <li>and I know that most things out there are &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The POSE is more challenging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this at home</li>
            <li>I have recommended this set to my friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>I am expecting more visible effect after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>and they are safe and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The results are amazing, right front the start.</li>
            <li>I am 44 and in pretty good shape, workout almost every day and eat a fairly clean diet.  </li>
            <li>Very quick delivery and packing is good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use with visible effect.</li>
            <li>Both shipped from Israel via registered mail (had to sign for them) and in fine condition.</li>
            <li>Fine...</li>
            <li>I would have loved to return it to get my money back, but it came from Isreal...seemed like more of a hassle than anything else.</li>
            <li>Firming effect is obvious, very amazing.</li>
            <li>but as I am getting older the skin is getting lax which makes them look not as tone and kind of \\&quot;cellulitey\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It is worth the $$ and time investment if the these tools help me stop the clock!</li>
            <li>advice is, if you&#x27;re going to buy, first make sure you will have the time to devote to it.  </li>
            <li>The vendor sent me an email to confirm delivery address since I don&#x27;t live in the US and the package arrived nicely packed and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, more practice is useful.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, the shipment is very fast, it only took 4 days from the factory at Israel  to china, the package is on good condition and the shipment fee is resonable.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>so I can be more efficient to focus on one area each time and not tired myself</li>
            <li>The change is subtle but already impressive.  </li>
            <li>First, the company I bought this from was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The stop is really amazing, just used 2 times, the result is obvious.</li>
            <li>Second, if you are the kind of person that has to see drastic differences immediately, you won&#x27;t be happy, so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>i bought it before couple of weeks and now i found it worth to buy.</li>
            <li>so I thought this was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>The other day, someone asked me what I was doing to my face because it looked so good.</li>
            <li>Shipment is much faster than originally stated.</li>
            <li>You will not see a drastic difference right away, because your body can&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle in terms of something that actually works, though, these are pretty amazing devices.  </li>
            <li>The delivery is very smooth and it only took 9 days to arrive at China.</li>
            <li>The unit is pretty but it does not come on.  </li>
            <li>think this product really works!</li>
            <li>I have just completed my first week of Tripollar STOP and POSE treatments</li>
            <li>It definitely provides a more immediate effect than the fancy creams</li>
            <li>I could tell after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>My friends who don;t know I am using this product are wondering why I look younger and more robust these days.</li>
            <li>but I do feel like my eyes look more open and lifted and my face is overall more plump.  </li>
            <li>I also think that the concept of deep heating the tissues to help them produce more collagen is valid and, so, I use this as part of my \\&quot;aging with grace\\&quot; preventative routine.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Pose first.  </li>
            <li>delivery is super smooth and it took only 5 days to arrive HongKong.</li>
            <li>For pose, not as obvious as stop but still fine with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see my face and hands become white and have smooth tough day by day.&lt;br /&gt;This device that requires skill for proper use, it must pay more attention to the gel and move way, in fact, it&#x27;s not a comfort experience, but it really have the good effects</li>
            <li>This tool really compliments my skin and helped me out with a lot of wrinkles and sagging spots.</li>
            <li>Much faster than the estimated time given when I ordered.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles in my face have really smoothed out.</li>
            <li>Much faster than the estimated time given when I ordered.</li>
            <li>This set of product is very value for money.</li>
            <li>This chord fitting on both the Pose and Stop is not very secure so the chord pulls loose during operation pretty easily and the power turns off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The downside, as many other reviewers have noted, is the time involved.</li>
            <li>I highly encourage anyone with this problem to invest in this.</li>
            <li>If you are a curvier person or have a lot of excess skin it might take a little more time.</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars rating but deduct one star due to the nuissance of the POSE connector easily coming off</li>
            <li>I am a little worried that this may become a bigger problem and the units may stop working, but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Tripollar Pose 5 times so far on my abdominal area (lax skin from pregnancy) and I think this product really works.</li>
            <li>The products are meticulously packagedand came very fast, especially considering they are from Israel.  </li>
            <li>The visual improvement motivates me to be consistent and patient with the routine because it does take time to do all the desired treatment areas.  </li>
            <li>I ordered both on a Friday and received the first shipment just 5 business days later!</li>
            <li>it is much less and my jeans fit again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>major problem is the plug connected to the pose, easy to get loose, hence i give 4 stars only, hope the supplier can improve this problem.</li>
            <li>and I can clearly see some signs of ageing around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>I have 30 year old</li>
            <li>That surprised me a lot!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>However, I have gone ahead and ordered a second tube of the gel because I used way too much when I started treatments and have used up about 1/3 of my tube.</li>
            <li>Even though this item is shipping internationally, it arrives fast and is a trustworthy seller.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to spend so much money on facial treatments at beauty salon.</li>
            <li>SO FAR, IT APPEARS TO HAVE STARTED DISSOLVING SOME CELLULITE DEPOSITS.</li>
            <li>This literally might mean an hour or more, depending on where you want to target.</li>
            <li>, I felt my face so firm and tight, so far I have been very pleased with the resultsI</li>
            <li>It has cause a major depression because I went from looking youthful, to being old, with hallows in my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 and despite living a healthy lifestyle, I&#x27;ve had lumpy legs and butt for years and it only gets worse as I get older.  </li>
            <li>Having purchased many anti-aging products over the years I was reluctant to spend this much money to have mediocre results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is still too early to conclude on the overall effectiveness of the treatment since I just started</li>
            <li>TOO EARLY TO TELL ABOUT THE POSE WHICH IS FOR THE BODY, BUT THE STOP FOR THE FACE SHOWS INSTANT RESULTS</li>
            <li>I am about as skeptical as they get - I&#x27;ve had my own skincare product business for some time</li>
            <li>am hoping to see even more improvement few weeks down the road.  </li>
            <li>The heat sensation (on high) can be a little intense at first, but once the area warms up, you don&#x27;t feel anything other than a relaxing warming sensation, as long as you are constantly moving the device.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works differently on certain skin types, but believe me, it is not worth the risk on the face.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind I am an active smaller framed person that did not need much work, but I saw immediate results with tighten of the skin and reduced the fat areas that I could not seem to work off at the gym.</li>
            <li>The gel you use is sticky, but a small amount goes a long way and it liquefies as it heats up, so you can spread it to other areas easily.</li>

            <li> TOO EARLY TO TELL ABOUT THE POSE WHICH IS FOR THE BODY, BUT THE STOP FOR THE FACE SHOWS INSTANT RESULTS</li>
            <li> I am about as skeptical as they get - I&#x27;ve had my own skincare product business for some time</li>
            <li> am hoping to see even more improvement few weeks down the road.  </li>
            <li> The heat sensation (on high) can be a little intense at first, but once the area warms up, you don&#x27;t feel anything other than a relaxing warming sensation, as long as you are constantly moving the device.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works differently on certain skin types, but believe me, it is not worth the risk on the face.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind I am an active smaller framed person that did not need much work, but I saw immediate results with tighten of the skin and reduced the fat areas that I could not seem to work off at the gym.</li>
            <li> The gel you use is sticky, but a small amount goes a long way and it liquefies as it heats up, so you can spread it to other areas easily.</li>
            <li> but I can already see that my smile lines and frown lines are less obvious and the buttlock areas are smoother and tighter with less visible cellulite.  </li>
            <li> Overall, if you are looking for subtle skin tightening, toning and a reduction in the appearance of cellulite, I think it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> After using Tripollar Stop for two times, I can see my eye bags are smaller, pores near my nose are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It is less rough, the collagen over time is forming, and the skin is tightening, such that I really don&#x27;t think I will use Botox or a filler again for a long time, if ever.  </li>
            <li> The product was arrived on my hand much earlier than I expected, only took  4 days on delivery.  </li>
            <li> I think to really see results you have to be dedicated and use these devices at least every other day.</li>
            <li> The lines on my face and neck have become much less noticeable and my pores have got much smaller.</li>
            <li> I should work harder on them</li>
            <li> Power goes off constantly because the cord connection is not secure.</li>
            <li> I have never really had cellulite, but it looks like this is another one of those joys of aging.  </li>
            <li> I have a &amp;#34;pooch&amp;#34; on my belly that I&#x27;ve had forever, even when I was young (I&#x27;ve never been seriously overweight)</li>
            <li> but it really was bad after a pregnancy and a c-section that left the pooch even bigger than before, and super-stubborn.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it every other day!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I work in a couple of small areas, heat those up and then go back over the small areas as part of a larger pattern and repeat that pattern.  </li>
            <li> The Stop on the other hand, has been a nightmare for me.  </li>
            <li> , I felt my face so firm and tight, look a  bit younger.</li>
            <li> Bad design as it is so easy to disconnect the power.  </li>
            <li> I have had several Accent treatments with my dermatologist over the past couple of years and find they definitely help with subtle skin tone improvements.  </li>
            <li> MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS</li>
            <li> Tighter skin and definitely less bumpy looking.  </li>
            <li> and I have just 1 little line in my forehead and after couple of months I haven&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I JUST BOUGHT PLAIN GLYCERIN OIL TO USE INSTEAD.</li>
            <li> I am not sure the effect yet.</li>
            <li> My thighs take the longest and I usually watch about an hour of tv while doing them.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I used this on my face once, ONCE, and it has melted away the fat on my face and left me looking gaunt.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the plug/chord comes as a separate unit that you have to plug into the Tripollar.  </li>
            <li> I am not really sure!...</li>
            <li> You have to keep going back which can get very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Seriously- get this.</li>
            <li> Bothe of them are broken and defective.  </li>
            <li> Have no idea if these devices do what they say because they are so frustrating to use I am returning them.</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic</li>
            <li> I have continued to use it twice per week and feel i am maintaining those results and maybe making some additional very subtle improvements.  </li>
            <li> I feel refreshed, but its annoying to use at the beginning until I followed the directions.</li>
            <li> It is annoying</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have only been using these products for three weeks, but I can see a difference already. The other day, someone asked me what I was doing to my face because it looked so good. I will post again after six weeks.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working after about one week. The adapter that came with it was faulty. I had to hold the cord while using it which made it a pain to use. After using it for a month I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I would have loved to return it to get my money back, but it came from Isreal...seemed like more of a hassle than anything else. If I had it to do over again I would not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure!... the seller, shipment and all that is good. The product it self is not like Oh god! I have 30 year old and I have just 1 little line in my forehead and after couple of months I haven&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I purchase the Tripollar Pose and Stop. So far I have been very pleased with the results. Keep in mind I am an active smaller framed person that did not need much work, but I saw immediate results with tighten of the skin and reduced the fat areas that I could not seem to work off at the gym. This is a great product. Keep in mind to be realist about your results. If you are a curvier person or have a lot of excess skin it might take a little more time.</li>
            <li> The unit is pretty but it does not come on.  Bothe of them are broken and defective.  I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I have more energy, I am more productive .. My tendinitis seems to be going away. Great deal..</li>
            <li> Got it from here: https://goo.gl/TTlZbE! Way cheaper and really good product. This tool really compliments my skin and helped me out with a lot of wrinkles and sagging spots. I feel refreshed, but its annoying to use at the beginning until I followed the directions. After that it was really great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy because I bought a good products of Tripollar Stop and Tripollar Pose.  I used 3 time and feel firming.</li>
            <li> My 1st order fm Amazon! Totally amazed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery is super smooth and it took only 5 days to arrive HongKong. Much faster than the estimated time given when I ordered. That surprised me a lot!&lt;br /&gt;I am 2x sth and can see some signs of ageing around my mouth and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been tried tripollar stop four times, I felt my face so firm and tight, so far I have been very pleased with the resultsI think this product really works!</li>
            <li> very nice product, I tried twice after receiving it.  My face looks firmer now.  The products were packed nicely too.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on Sunday and received on Wednesday. Very quick delivery and packing is good.&lt;br /&gt;I tried tripollar stop three times. Skin texture improve a lot. Firming effect is obvious, very amazing. My face looks tighter. My face is always oedema in the morning. After I use it, oedema does not occur anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the tripollar pose, I use once to tummy and four limbs only. I am not sure the effect yet. I should work harder on them</li>
            <li> Excellent for firming .... Tried on face and tummy, it&#x27;s great and effective.&lt;br /&gt;This is pefect for me and my mom.</li>
            <li> Bad design as it is so easy to disconnect the power.  I have to press 5-6 times the button in 15 minutes treatment.</li>
            <li> I have just completed my first week of Tripollar STOP and POSE treatments and I find both tools very easy to use.  I would have given 5 stars rating but deduct one star due to the nuissance of the POSE connector easily coming off so I taped it to keep it in tact.  Problems solved but it could be improved.  I don&#x27;t have the same problem with STOP so it is a better designed tool from that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still too early to conclude on the overall effectiveness of the treatment since I just started but I can already see that my smile lines and frown lines are less obvious and the buttlock areas are smoother and tighter with less visible cellulite.  The change is subtle but already impressive.  It definitely provides a more immediate effect than the fancy creams so I like it so far.  The visual improvement motivates me to be consistent and patient with the routine because it does take time to do all the desired treatment areas.  I alternate days to do body vs. face so I can be more efficient to focus on one area each time and not tired myself out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service from TOP Beauty was good.  The vendor sent me an email to confirm delivery address since I don&#x27;t live in the US and the package arrived nicely packed and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping to see even more improvement few weeks down the road.  It is worth the $$ and time investment if the these tools help me stop the clock!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 and despite living a healthy lifestyle, I&#x27;ve had lumpy legs and butt for years and it only gets worse as I get older.  All I can say is POSE WORKS!  I could tell after the first treatment. Not only on my legs and bum, but my stomach and arms as well.  I highly encourage anyone with this problem to invest in this. Same goes for Stop for the face. The wrinkles in my face have really smoothed out. Seriously- get this. You won&#x27;t regret it:)</li>
            <li> I ordered Tripollar Pose and Tripollar Stop \\&quot;best value\\&quot; combination. I ordered both on a Friday and received the first shipment just 5 business days later! Much faster than the estimated time given when I ordered. The second item arrived 2 days later. Both shipped from Israel via registered mail (had to sign for them) and in fine condition. I have used the Tripollar Pose 5 times so far on my abdominal area (lax skin from pregnancy) and I think this product really works. The heat sensation (on high) can be a little intense at first, but once the area warms up, you don&#x27;t feel anything other than a relaxing warming sensation, as long as you are constantly moving the device. If you stop it, ouch. It will make you jump. The gel you use is sticky, but a small amount goes a long way and it liquefies as it heats up, so you can spread it to other areas easily. The set also comes with a \\&quot;spatula\\&quot; that you can use to remove product from one area and put it on another, so you&#x27;re not wasting any. However, I have gone ahead and ordered a second tube of the gel because I used way too much when I started treatments and have used up about 1/3 of my tube. Overall I am very happy with the purchase, the items received and the speed of shipment and communication of the vendor. Even though this item is shipping internationally, it arrives fast and is a trustworthy seller.</li>
            <li> The product was arrived on my hand much earlier than I expected, only took  4 days on delivery.  The salesman done a good job.  I&#x27;ve been tried tripollar stop only two times, I felt my face so firm and tight, look a  bit younger. I believe if I keep using tripollar stop once a week, the result should be wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; as in overnight, forget it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle in terms of something that actually works, though, these are pretty amazing devices.  I am about as skeptical as they get - I&#x27;ve had my own skincare product business for some time and I know that most things out there are &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34; - but the STOP produces a difference in my skin, period.  It is less rough, the collagen over time is forming, and the skin is tightening, such that I really don&#x27;t think I will use Botox or a filler again for a long time, if ever.  The POSE is more challenging.  I have a &amp;#34;pooch&amp;#34; on my belly that I&#x27;ve had forever, even when I was young (I&#x27;ve never been seriously overweight) but it really was bad after a pregnancy and a c-section that left the pooch even bigger than before, and super-stubborn.  Regular use of the POSE has lessened it - I feel like it gave it the &amp;#34;kickstart&amp;#34; to start dissolving - and even though it is not gone (I need to diet, that&#x27;s the bottom line) it is much less and my jeans fit again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside, as many other reviewers have noted, is the time involved. I think to really see results you have to be dedicated and use these devices at least every other day. This literally might mean an hour or more, depending on where you want to target. The time factor for a lot of people to do this effectively would be prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is, if you&#x27;re going to buy, first make sure you will have the time to devote to it.  Be patient.  You will not see a drastic difference right away, because your body can&#x27;t do it.  That being said, if you do devote the time to do it properly, you will see a difference that doesn&#x27;t involve fillers, botox or surgery.  Second, if you are the kind of person that has to see drastic differences immediately, you won&#x27;t be happy, so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Nice products! Easy to operate! Shipment is much faster than originally stated. After using Tripollar Stop for two times, I can see my eye bags are smaller, pores near my nose are less noticeable. I will keep using it every other day!&lt;br /&gt;As for Tripollar Pose, I only used it once and can&#x27;t see the result yet! And it takes some time to do one part!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and I can clearly see some signs of ageing around my mouth and eyes. I have been using Tripollar pose and stop for 3 weeks and am totally amazed by the result. The lines on my face and neck have become much less noticeable and my pores have got much smaller. My friends who don;t know I am using this product are wondering why I look younger and more robust these days. I&#x27;m so glad I got this at home so I don&#x27;t have to spend so much money on facial treatments at beauty salon.</li>
            <li> Have no idea if these devices do what they say because they are so frustrating to use I am returning them. Power goes off constantly because the cord connection is not secure. Because of the constant need to jiggle, reposition, turn on again, etc. the time requirement is multiplied!  Suggest waiting until manufacturer addresses this problem!</li>
            <li> Stop is very nice n I find my eye bags smaller than before...&lt;br /&gt;Pose is... Fine... I am still trying it</li>
            <li> TOO EARLY TO TELL ABOUT THE POSE WHICH IS FOR THE BODY, BUT THE STOP FOR THE FACE SHOWS INSTANT RESULTS AND I LOOK LIKE I&#x27;VE HAD A FACE LIFT. THE LINES ARE STILL THERE BUT I&#x27;VE ONLY USED THE MACHINE ABOUT 4 OR 5 TIMES.&lt;br /&gt;I WANTED THE POSE FOR THE WRINKLES ON THE INSIDE OF MY ARMS. SO FAR, IT APPEARS TO HAVE STARTED DISSOLVING SOME CELLULITE DEPOSITS. STILL TO BE DETERMINED ABOUT HOW THE WRINKLY SKIN WILL DO. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE GEL IS SO PERFUMED THAT I SNEEZE IMMEDIATELY EACH TIME. I JUST BOUGHT PLAIN GLYCERIN OIL TO USE INSTEAD.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with visible effect. A very good deal with special discount on this value kit. I have recommended this set to my friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> This set of product is very value for money. The delivery is very smooth and it only took 9 days to arrive at China. I used both devices once and they are safe and easy to use.  I am expecting more visible effect after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> i bought it before couple of weeks and now i found it worth to buy. I can see my face and hands become white and have smooth tough day by day.&lt;br /&gt;This device that requires skill for proper use, it must pay more attention to the gel and move way, in fact, it&#x27;s not a comfort experience, but it really have the good effects, more practice is useful.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, the shipment is very fast, it only took 4 days from the factory at Israel  to china, the package is on good condition and the shipment fee is resonable.&lt;br /&gt;Very recommand this 2 devices!</li>
            <li> Having purchased many anti-aging products over the years I was reluctant to spend this much money to have mediocre results.  The results are amazing, right front the start.</li>
            <li> The stop is really amazing, just used 2 times, the result is obvious. For pose, not as obvious as stop but still fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;The major problem is the plug connected to the pose, easy to get loose, hence i give 4 stars only, hope the supplier can improve this problem.</li>
            <li> I have had several Accent treatments with my dermatologist over the past couple of years and find they definitely help with subtle skin tone improvements.  The problem is that those improvements don&#x27;t last.  You have to keep going back which can get very expensive.  Accent uses similar RF technology to Tripollar so I thought this was worth a try.  I am 44 and in pretty good shape, workout almost every day and eat a fairly clean diet.  I have good muscle tone in my legs but as I am getting older the skin is getting lax which makes them look not as tone and kind of \\&quot;cellulitey\\&quot;.  I have never really had cellulite, but it looks like this is another one of those joys of aging.  I used the Tripollar Pose just once and got compliments on my legs that day.  I have continued to use it twice per week and feel i am maintaining those results and maybe making some additional very subtle improvements.  Tighter skin and definitely less bumpy looking.  The Stop unit is much smaller than the Pose and I would say the effects are similar for the face.  Nothing dramatic but I do feel like my eyes look more open and lifted and my face is overall more plump.  It takes maybe 15 - 20 minutes to do my entire face and neck and I have been doing this twice per week.  My thighs take the longest and I usually watch about an hour of tv while doing them.  I also do my stomach and backs of my arms (tricep area) and those two areas take about 30 - 45 minutes.  I do each of these areas twice per week, as well.  I work in a couple of small areas, heat those up and then go back over the small areas as part of a larger pattern and repeat that pattern.  You cannot expect that this will totally change your body and just melt the fat away, but I do think it helps tone and tighten the skin.  I also think that the concept of deep heating the tissues to help them produce more collagen is valid and, so, I use this as part of my \\&quot;aging with grace\\&quot; preventative routine.  The products are meticulously packagedand came very fast, especially considering they are from Israel.  My one complaint is that the plug/chord comes as a separate unit that you have to plug into the Tripollar.  This chord fitting on both the Pose and Stop is not very secure so the chord pulls loose during operation pretty easily and the power turns off.  It is annoying but I just re-tighten the chord, turn it back on and continue working.  I am a little worried that this may become a bigger problem and the units may stop working, but so far, so good.  Overall, if you are looking for subtle skin tightening, toning and a reduction in the appearance of cellulite, I think it is worth the money.  I do not feel that I have to go back for any Accent treatments which cost anywhere from $150 - $200 per body area,  not to mention drive time and time off from work.  This makes the Tripollar a very good value!!</li>
            <li> i have tried tripollar pose on my arms for totally 5 times,,it did reduce my arms&#x27; circumference and make my arms firmer than before,,i will continue to use it for 8 weeks!!cant wait for the result.</li>
            <li> First, the company I bought this from was fantastic.  Great, responsive customer service.  The product arrived within a week.  I tried the Pose first.  I have only used it twice, but it has already firmed the skin on my stomach, and got rid of some excess weight.  The Stop on the other hand, has been a nightmare for me.  Unfortunately, I used this on my face once, ONCE, and it has melted away the fat on my face and left me looking gaunt.  The next morning I woke up and I could literally feel the skin sagging.  I have never been so freaked out in my life.  It has cause a major depression because I went from looking youthful, to being old, with hallows in my face.  DO NOT USE STOP ON FACE!  My face has sunken and is melting off!  I should have left well enough alone.  Perhaps it works differently on certain skin types, but believe me, it is not worth the risk on the face.</li>
