    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent consistency, scent etc.  </li>
            <li>This is excellent because it also contains an SPF 15!</li>
            <li>Great value through Amazon compared to retail stores!</li>
            <li>Im very happy with this Product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good!    </li>
            <li>The product has a very pleasant smell and my wife always tells me I smell good.   </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>the product was a great price for a pack of three.  </li>
            <li>I wound up with great results and</li>
            <li>and it was great:</li>
            <li>Eventually, stores would not carry it anymore, and I was happy to see it listed on Amazon (July 2010).     </li>
            <li>It feels great, soothes my skin after shaving, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and \\&quot;tighter\\&quot;, I guess.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>but I think that it smells very nice not overpowering at all</li>
            <li>I have more than 6 months using this product and the results have been very good.</li>
            <li>This is a good face care lotion for men.</li>
            <li>Fine, but who cares!?!</li>
            <li>I had purchased Nivea for Men Q-10 at WalMart a couple years ago - mostly on a whim - because I was spending a fair amount of time outdoors.  </li>
            <li>both my wife &amp; I liked the smell of it - it doesn&#x27;t smell like lotions or like sun protection products.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not an oily product and is definitely a nice product.</li>
            <li>the kind of reaction I&#x27;d expect if I were dousing myself with Brut cologne.  </li>
            <li>As someone else has said, it also does a good job as a hair-dressing after a shower, so it is easy to apply to my balding scalp.    </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t see me spending the kind of $ often needed to purchase most anti-aging/anti-wrinkle creams -</li>
            <li>This lotion does a great job after showering to keep your face fresh, and I use it in connection with the Nivea scrub to keep my seborrheic dermatitis under control.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m happy with the results I get and the price is right</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find it available through amazon, where I bought this 3-pack of the lotion.    </li>
            <li>Hit 50 and started searching for a nice easy to use cream that would help with wrinkles....</li>
            <li>shoot, that would be more appropriately \\&quot;for</li>
            <li>If Nivea is going to explicitly label a product \\&quot;for men,\\&quot; then I would expect it to leave me smelling like a man, or even better, like nothing at all...</li>
            <li>Make sure you are getting the SPF 15 and not SPF 12.</li>
            <li>My perception was that I like the Revitalizing lotion better.</li>
            <li>I kept using it for close to 10 years now, and now people who meet me for the first time tells me I have good skin.  </li>
            <li>The lotion gets into the skin quickly and it has a nice and not at all intrusive smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>But at a far lower price, this Nivea lotion is great.</li>
            <li>Then I realized good skin is attractive and beneficial in making a positive social impression in anything from job interviews to dates.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and does the job.  </li>
            <li>but my primary use is for the sunscreen and added bonus of controlling my skin condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some things online that sound like Nivea may have stopped - or will stop - making it.  </li>
            <li>I use it primarily as an after shave lotion.</li>
            <li>, it seems to be lightly scented</li>
            <li>That could be; it does has a light fragrance that I hope doesn&#x27;t make me &amp;#34;smell like my grandmother&amp;#34; as one reviewer put it.</li>
            <li>It feels very fresh feeling skin and remains all day.</li>
            <li>Originally I thought that it did not contain sunscreen as it was not on the front of the box.  </li>
            <li>It soothes after shave, has a mild, pleasant smell, and provides a pretty decent sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It feels good all day and has definitely improved the suppleness of my 58-years-old skin.</li>
            <li>this cream does it all and actually feels good, Im</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smoothly, but ends up with a bit of an opaque/whitish appearance, I presume because of the SPF ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a pretty distinct fragrance, not that appealing, and not as good as some other Nivea</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, great stuff, been using it for a few years now and it keeps my face from getting oily.</li>
            <li>But fantastic product and when you buy, buy two or three, one will go fast.</li>
            <li>I have seborrheic dermatitis and since I&#x27;ve started using this product it has completely controlled the redness, roughness and inflammation much better than the over-the-counter cortizone cream I was using.   </li>
            <li>Use it right after shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say that it is doing anything more for appearance than a more generic, and far cheaper moisturizer/suntan lotion would do.  </li>
            <li>And price on Amazon is much better than local stores.</li>
            <li>Some other reviews say this Energy product has more fragrance than the original.</li>
            <li>really surprised to say that I&#x27;m excited about face cream...</li>
            <li>A bit like an after-shave, but less astringent, more floral/musky, and with far more staying power.</li>
            <li>It is so much stronger</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned in the title, it has done a good job of giving me a bit of a tan over the course of a harsh Texas summer, but keeping my skin supple and soft.</li>
            <li>but, as reported by another reviewer, the new lotion now contains large (unbearable, for me and my family) amounts of fragrance (unlike the [discontinued?]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 46 year old married father of 4.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been moisturizing far longer than it was cool for men to admit to such a thing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the new name and packaging  </li>
            <li>Revitalizing Lotion Q10\\&quot; in the product description) and comes in a silver packaging (not blue as pictured)--the same product that has replaced the original product in stores.     </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do any other special skin care</li>
            <li>I have been using this face cream for a few years now and it has kept my face free of wrinkles and young looking, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The only drawback I find is that still feels very greasy.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that would cover UV-protection and skin-care at the same time, and picked this product up off CVS without much thought and research.  </li>
            <li>Synthetic, not matching any natural scent I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
            <li>Where can I find a reasonably priced, no-nonsense moisturizing lotion with moderate sunblock?</li>
            <li>You might want to put it on your face after dressing as I do most of the time, because you can rub the residue on your hands after using it, and it has really improved the quality of the thin skin on the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li>I love this product in the blue less fragranced form, but now, for me it is unusable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big enough deal to go to the hassle of getting something else, but I very much dislike the seller switching products and not being up front about</li>
            <li>I also use it as a hair dressing (for what little I have left), a small amount on wet hands works great.  </li>
            <li>To that latter point, I spend a lot of time in Mexico City, a place that rarely has a UV index of less than 8 (a very high number, there due to a combination of altitude, ~7,000</li>
            <li>I dilute it with a little bit of water (by using wet hands to apply) every time I use it so that it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It helps a lot with general moturizing and to a lesser degree with wrinkle abatement.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any other anti-wrinkle products - and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a main claim of</li>
            <li>I used to use very expensive department store brands, mostly stuff designed for women since there really wasn&#x27;t stuff for men.</li>
            <li>Good lotion, Here in Wisconsin my face gets dry when the weather gets cold.  </li>
            <li>When this 3pack is done, I think I&#x27;ll stick with moisturizers and when planning on being in the sun, suntan lotion--the combination of the high cost [per oz] and iffy fragrance make it not worth it to me.</li>

            <li> not sure if I&#x27;m not vain enough or simply too much of a cheapskate...).    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a very subtle smell, not like some other mens facial creams which seem to have ultra strong cologne added to them.</li>
            <li> product in the description, which hardly contained any)--the new one gets 1 star... and is on its way back to Amazon!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that they only give you a little bit of the product, but you use only a little so it does last 1-2 months with daily use.  </li>
            <li> By the way, sun is the absolute worst thing for your skin, so staying in the shade and wearing a moisturizer with sunscreen is key to staying handsome as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Nivea revitalizing lotion here because the picture shown was the old blue container, unfortunately I got the new silver container lotion.</li>
            <li> never use anything else, greatly subtle smell and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single sunburn.</li>
            <li> not like a boy who just discovered cologne, not like my grandmother, not like that retired friend of my mother-in-law who always wears polyester and tries kiss me on the cheeks and grab my bum when she gets a hug.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment about the alleged wrinkle-reducing properties of Q10, but that&#x27;s not what I use this product for anyway.</li>
            <li> For a product that is supposedly \\&quot;lightly fragranced\\&quot; (according to the back of the bottle and print on the box), this lotion stinks!  </li>
            <li> I buy the product at Walmart or Rite-Aid and usually buy 2 bottles at the same time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to take it w/ you anywhere including carry-on bags.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even stand myself in the car with the windows down.</li>
            <li> After I applied the lotion, 30 seconds later, my wife walked past (not in!)</li>
            <li> Smell is not overwhelming like the other reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea&#x27;s Q10 Lotion for a few years.   </li>
            <li> I used to have trouble finding this stuff at stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for few months now and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do in this cold/dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> (it is missing the \\&quot;Face Care\\&quot; of \\&quot;Nivea for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use this everyday for shaving, been on the sun all day, before bed, etc.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 10 years.  Excellent consistency, scent etc.  And price on Amazon is much better than local stores.</li>
            <li> This is excellent because it also contains an SPF 15! It nourishes the skin and protects it from the sun. Great value through Amazon compared to retail stores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea&#x27;s Q10 Lotion for a few years.   I&#x27;m a 46 year old married father of 4.  This stuff is great.  It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and does the job.  I have seborrheic dermatitis and since I&#x27;ve started using this product it has completely controlled the redness, roughness and inflammation much better than the over-the-counter cortizone cream I was using.   I also use it on my ears and it controls the flaky skin there as well.  I also use it as a hair dressing (for what little I have left), a small amount on wet hands works great.  I basically use the automatically measured amount and apply over my entire head (again, I don&#x27;t have thinning hair/receding hairline and I do need the sun protection).  The product has a very pleasant smell and my wife always tells me I smell good.   I buy the product at Walmart or Rite-Aid and usually buy 2 bottles at the same time so I don&#x27;t run out.  The only downside is that they only give you a little bit of the product, but you use only a little so it does last 1-2 months with daily use.  Not sure about the wrinkles but I think it does help but my primary use is for the sunscreen and added bonus of controlling my skin condition.</li>
            <li> I used to have trouble finding this stuff at stores but then I realized stores are a thing of the past so I started ordering this on Amazon for a fraction of the price. The stuff is a little thick but is the cheapest stuff that works on my skin.</li>
            <li> the product was a great price for a pack of three.  Prompt delivery .. no problems.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Nivea for Men Q-10 at WalMart a couple years ago - mostly on a whim - because I was spending a fair amount of time outdoors.  After initially using it for its combined UV protection and mosturizing, I began using it at bedtime.  I wound up with great results and both my wife &amp; I liked the smell of it - it doesn&#x27;t smell like lotions or like sun protection products.    But I&#x27;ve found Q-10 increasingly more difficult to buy at local stores.  WalMart &amp; Walgreen&#x27;s have stopped carrying it.  I&#x27;ve read some things online that sound like Nivea may have stopped - or will stop - making it.  I was very pleased to find it available through amazon, where I bought this 3-pack of the lotion.    It helps a lot with general moturizing and to a lesser degree with wrinkle abatement.  I haven&#x27;t used any other anti-wrinkle products - and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a main claim of Q-10 - so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else.  But I&#x27;m happy with the results I get and the price is right (I can&#x27;t see me spending the kind of $ often needed to purchase most anti-aging/anti-wrinkle creams - not sure if I&#x27;m not vain enough or simply too much of a cheapskate...).    I recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> I have more than 6 months using this product and the results have been very good. It feels very fresh feeling skin and remains all day. The only drawback I find is that still feels very greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion does a great job after showering to keep your face fresh, and I use it in connection with the Nivea scrub to keep my seborrheic dermatitis under control. It feels good all day and has definitely improved the suppleness of my 58-years-old skin. As someone else has said, it also does a good job as a hair-dressing after a shower, so it is easy to apply to my balding scalp.    I keep a container at the office, in my luggage, and of course by the shower. It&#x27;s that good!    As I mentioned in the title, it has done a good job of giving me a bit of a tan over the course of a harsh Texas summer, but keeping my skin supple and soft. I have not had a single sunburn. You might want to put it on your face after dressing as I do most of the time, because you can rub the residue on your hands after using it, and it has really improved the quality of the thin skin on the backs of my hands. In the five months since I began using it, my wife says the skin on my face looks 20 years younger!</li>
            <li> I get comments on my youthful appearance. I am 64 and believe it is , because the SPF15 blocks the UV. and the skin stays moist.&lt;br /&gt;This is not an oily product and is definitely a nice product.</li>
            <li> I never used moisturizers and had pretty bad skin until college thinking skin care was un-cool.  Then I realized good skin is attractive and beneficial in making a positive social impression in anything from job interviews to dates.    I wanted a product that would cover UV-protection and skin-care at the same time, and picked this product up off CVS without much thought and research.  I kept using it for close to 10 years now, and now people who meet me for the first time tells me I have good skin.  I don&#x27;t do any other special skin care so it must be working!  I dilute it with a little bit of water (by using wet hands to apply) every time I use it so that it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Nivea revitalizing lotion here because the picture shown was the old blue container, unfortunately I got the new silver container lotion. I have found that with the change in pachaging they changed the amount of fragrance. It is so much stronger I couldn&#x27;t even stand myself in the car with the windows down. I love this product in the blue less fragranced form, but now, for me it is unusable! I will be returning this order!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for few months now and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do in this cold/dry winter months.  Smell is not overwhelming like the other reviewer mentioned.  It&#x27;s small enough to take it w/ you anywhere including carry-on bags.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty smoothly, but ends up with a bit of an opaque/whitish appearance, I presume because of the SPF ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a pretty distinct fragrance, not that appealing, and not as good as some other Nivea products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say that it is doing anything more for appearance than a more generic, and far cheaper moisturizer/suntan lotion would do.  When this 3pack is done, I think I&#x27;ll stick with moisturizers and when planning on being in the sun, suntan lotion--the combination of the high cost [per oz] and iffy fragrance make it not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase the pictured  \\&quot;Nivea for Men Face Care Revitalizing Lotion Q10\\&quot; at my local supermarket until about a year ago and it was great: SP15, fragrance-free, non-oily--would have given it 5 stars. Eventually, stores would not carry it anymore, and I was happy to see it listed on Amazon (July 2010).     However, this is not the product that Amazon is shipping, which reads \\&quot;Nivea for Men Revitalizing Lotion Q10\\&quot; (it is missing the \\&quot;Face Care\\&quot; of \\&quot;Nivea for Men FACE CARE Revitalizing Lotion Q10\\&quot; in the product description) and comes in a silver packaging (not blue as pictured)--the same product that has replaced the original product in stores.     I don&#x27;t mind the new name and packaging  but, as reported by another reviewer, the new lotion now contains large (unbearable, for me and my family) amounts of fragrance (unlike the [discontinued?] product in the description, which hardly contained any)--the new one gets 1 star... and is on its way back to Amazon!</li>
            <li> For a product that is supposedly \\&quot;lightly fragranced\\&quot; (according to the back of the bottle and print on the box), this lotion stinks!  Yes, literally.  After I applied the lotion, 30 seconds later, my wife walked past (not in!) the bathroom and wrinkled her nose...the kind of reaction I&#x27;d expect if I were dousing myself with Brut cologne.  I washed my face because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell infusing my nostrils.    What is the smell like?  Synthetic, not matching any natural scent I&#x27;ve encountered.  A bit like an after-shave, but less astringent, more floral/musky, and with far more staying power. It&#x27;s like perfume for the face.    How is the product, aside from the smell?  Fine, but who cares!?! Aside from the smell, you might use feces for a facial mask...shoot, that would be more appropriately \\&quot;for men\\&quot; than this lotion. I feel especially betrayed by the marketing.  If Nivea is going to explicitly label a product \\&quot;for men,\\&quot; then I would expect it to leave me smelling like a man, or even better, like nothing at all...not like a boy who just discovered cologne, not like my grandmother, not like that retired friend of my mother-in-law who always wears polyester and tries kiss me on the cheeks and grab my bum when she gets a hug.  Maybe \\&quot;for boys\\&quot; or \\&quot;for teens\\&quot; or \\&quot;for butterflies\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t sell as well as \\&quot;for men\\&quot;...go figure.  Where can I find a reasonably priced, no-nonsense moisturizing lotion with moderate sunblock?</li>
            <li> Good lotion, Here in Wisconsin my face gets dry when the weather gets cold.  This lotion is soothing and not greasey. Some reviews complain about the smell of this lotion but I think that it smells very nice not overpowering at all My wife likes the smell also Im very happy with this Product.  HIGHLY RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been moisturizing far longer than it was cool for men to admit to such a thing. I used to use very expensive department store brands, mostly stuff designed for women since there really wasn&#x27;t stuff for men. But at a far lower price, this Nivea lotion is great. It soothes after shave, has a mild, pleasant smell, and provides a pretty decent sunscreen. To that latter point, I spend a lot of time in Mexico City, a place that rarely has a UV index of less than 8 (a very high number, there due to a combination of altitude, ~7,000 ft ASL, and latitude in the tropics), and this stuff keeps me from getting a casual sunburn from wandering around town. That said, it&#x27;s only a 15 SPF, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to protect me on something like a ski vacation. By the way, sun is the absolute worst thing for your skin, so staying in the shade and wearing a moisturizer with sunscreen is key to staying handsome as long as possible. I&#x27;d highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for a few years now and it has kept my face free of wrinkles and young looking, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hit 50 and started searching for a nice easy to use cream that would help with wrinkles....this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never use anything else, greatly subtle smell and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Makes my face feel refreshed and I get compliments on how it smells all the time. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> They have changed the description to &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; from &amp;#34;revitalizing&amp;#34; but it is the same thing.  Originally I thought that it did not contain sunscreen as it was not on the front of the box.  It has 15 SPF on the side. My husband uses this all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim years ago at a local drug store, and I haven&#x27;t been without it since. I use it primarily as an after shave lotion. It feels great, soothes my skin after shaving, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and \\&quot;tighter\\&quot;, I guess. I also like the smell, it seems to be lightly scented but it&#x27;s a very subtle smell, not like some other mens facial creams which seem to have ultra strong cologne added to them. I can&#x27;t comment about the alleged wrinkle-reducing properties of Q10, but that&#x27;s not what I use this product for anyway.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are getting the SPF 15 and not SPF 12. I guess SPF 12 does not guard against UVA/UVB...Who knew SPF didn&#x27;t?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, great stuff, been using it for a few years now and it keeps my face from getting oily. A+</li>
            <li> Great product. Not too shiny, and no build up on face. Use it right after shaving. It&#x27;s my go to cream.</li>
            <li> This is a good face care lotion for men. The lotion gets into the skin quickly and it has a nice and not at all intrusive smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use this everyday for shaving, been on the sun all day, before bed, etc. this cream does it all and actually feels good, Im really surprised to say that I&#x27;m excited about face cream...Im a MAN. But fantastic product and when you buy, buy two or three, one will go fast.</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;Energy&amp;#34; lotion, not the &amp;#34;Revitalizing&amp;#34; lotion. I purchased the Revitalizing lotion locally until it was no longer in local stores, at which time I purchased the Energy lotion. My perception was that I like the Revitalizing lotion better. So I looked online and found what supposedly was the product I was looking for. Not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you what the differences are. Some other reviews say this Energy product has more fragrance than the original. That could be; it does has a light fragrance that I hope doesn&#x27;t make me &amp;#34;smell like my grandmother&amp;#34; as one reviewer put it. I&#x27;ll keep the product but I won&#x27;t purchase again. It&#x27;s not a big enough deal to go to the hassle of getting something else, but I very much dislike the seller switching products and not being up front about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star for the seller for &amp;#34;bait and switch&amp;#34; or at least out of date product information!</li>
