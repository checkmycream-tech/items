            <li>Wonderful for relaxed or color treated hair</li>
            <li>think is probably best for anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner that goes along with this</li>
            <li>is equally impressive.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo and condition I have ever used</li>
            <li>Oh, and the price is great too!</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S GOOD!).</li>

            <li>And the smell is great too.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve read just about all the reviews on this product and decided to try it out and for me it was Great.</li>
            <li>and it smells great and not over whelming...</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Good news, I needed shampoo and conditioner anyway.</li>
            <li>... good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, inexpensive shampoo for a while</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the Ultra Shea conditioner, and my hair feels really good.</li>
            <li>does a good job for me and smells good.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for those of us hyper-sensitive to perfume scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been really good</li>
            <li>The good news is this</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will repurchase for sure!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for like a month and my hair was looking amazing and everyone would always complement me</li>
            <li>it makes your hair look amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>But I  do recommend that you use the whole product line for best results.</li>
            <li>and I have been thrilled.</li>
            <li>The nice scent of shea was relaxing and nice, and it lasted too.</li>
            <li>This is an extremely nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This product is good, I like I&#x27;m going to buy some more of this product and keep it on  my self as I run out.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s just thrilled with the shampoo and conditioner, she likes the scent and the shape of the bottles.</li>
            <li>and the end result was really nice, after drying and styling</li>
            <li>Your hair is super smooth and it looks awesome</li>
            <li>These ingredients promote a great clean feeling and a nice refreshing smell once the product is washed out of one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>My hair tangles very easily even when it&#x27;s shorter.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is working just fine for me, and at around five bucks, it&#x27;s a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clear scalp is the best shampoo I have used in years.</li>
            <li>she commented on how nice and healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li>It does lather up nicely, but it&#x27;s a denser lather most shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write another review if anything changes but for right now I will continue to use and the price is great to.</li>
            <li>From the feel, I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t clean as well, but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Nice lather, and rinses out easily, leaving no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>My scalp immediately felt better after using this.</li>
            <li>Thankfully hubby is home now and feeling much better</li>
            <li>hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not regretting it now. :)</li>
            <li>My hair has more body and is easier to control, too.  </li>
            <li>Mine, however, will continue to be served by the cheap but effective</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>I love how my hair is when i use it</li>
            <li>LOVE THE PRODUCT, BUT WHEN RECEIVED, IT WAS NOT PACKAGED</li>
            <li>Washing it will sometimes make it better for a day or two, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels good on my scalp, leaves my hair soft, and it smells good, too.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both love how it smells, too.</li>
            <li>It has more sunflower seed oil than it has coconut oil.</li>
            <li>and I really love the smell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it is that great.</li>
            <li>one thing I do love about it is the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, I feel like I am on a tropical holiday (reminds me of tanning lotion).</li>
            <li>Because of Vine sometimes releasing products to us sooner, this may change as retailers carry more of the line.</li>
            <li>The outcome might (and probably would have) been better if I had both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I wasnt sure if it was a product for my hair type.</li>
            <li>We do love this product.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many shampoo just to find one that does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>The problem I ran into was getting more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it opens at the top and the conditioner opens at the bottom,</li>
            <li>I love Aveda products, but they are so costly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the idea that it has the vitamin E and Shea butter in it</li>
            <li>Shipping was okay.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I found this shampoo to be okay</li>
            <li>I really like it because it works great for my 4a/b hair texture.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent of Shea butter (I note some others don&#x27;t agree).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily or greasy feel to my hair and rinses very cleanly from the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been impressed with this shampoo in terms of helping relieve my dry scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect balance between not being too harsh and being effective in removing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had a nice lather to it and washed out of my hair easily, leaving it feeling clean but not squeaky.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, smells nice &amp; clean, not overpowering, washes well and leaves hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I usually do not use a shampoo and conditioner set, but the results were very nice.  </li>
            <li>Scalp\\&quot; might prove, for many, not merely an eye-catching brand name but an apt description of this product&#x27;s cleansing properties.  </li>
            <li>It would need to be unscented or lightly scented with a more tenable smell before I would use it again.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky, the slip is great</li>
            <li>I also noted that it was quite easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>Easily foam-able&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells good, lathers nicely, and rinses well with no residue, BUT it left my hair feeling like straw and almost crunchy.</li>
            <li>My  scalp stays flake free up to 2weeks when used with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I got the Shea Cleanse and Nourish so that not only did my scalp feel happy, so did my hair.</li>
            <li>You want a happy scalp and hair at the same time, get this.</li>
            <li>(Since it&#x27;s still available at the corner drug chain for under a buck, I&#x27;m not holding my breath.)</li>
            <li>My hair feels light weight and airy which never happens</li>
            <li>Made my hair silky, manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li>has a light shea butter smell to it but not over powering.</li>
            <li>Heaps of conditioner were needed for it to feel smooth again.</li>
            <li>Even on the second day, my hair still looked great.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the fragrance, while pleasant, is a bit strong and persistent to me.</li>
            <li>Their motto is &#x27;starting at the right end of the hair and nourishing the scalp for beautiful hair&#x27;..</li>
            <li>So this was my first experience with a better bran shampoo</li>
            <li>(I wash my hair every other day) and a co-worker grabbed me and said \\&quot;Why do you smell sooooooo good?!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited about using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Rich texture&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I first discovered this product in my favorite &amp;#34;big box store&amp;#34; but they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>Familiar with this product.</li>
            <li>and it got my hair clean</li>
            <li>Our hair is clean and keeps and flakes away.</li>
            <li>Love it better than professional lines that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>and  infuse the hair with moisturizer and clean the the skill as it moisturizes and clean the hair at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out really clean, unlike the Aussie I had been using for two weeks, which leaves a coating on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a pearly creamy liquid and smells wonderful, I was hoping to be able to use it since it did make my hair feel soft when washing it, but cant explain why the end result was so bland.</li>
            <li>This has been great for the family members whose hair tends to be very dry.  </li>
            <li>I was using this shampoo and conditioner for months and months pretty much since it came out, I actually really liked it</li>
            <li>even though I use the Suave Keratin Serum as well, this made it go from bleh to SWEET ZOMBIE JESUS</li>
            <li>Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo is a nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>or PEG-9M, or \\&quot;Methylisothiozolinone.\\&quot; I do feel favorably toward shea butter and Sweet Almond</li>
            <li>Being a smoker also, the smell is still good on the 2nd day.</li>
            <li>This product cleanses just as good as WEN and gives my hair back its strength.</li>
            <li>So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer, and even better, my scalp isn&#x27;t as prone to cracking.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t rinse well with cool water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a shampoo you need to use daily to get good results.</li>
            <li>This means there isn&#x27;t as much \\&quot;movement\\&quot; of my hair as is normal and sometimes that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I would imagine on naturally oily hair it would make your hair feel gross and maybe sticky, but on my hair it makes it soft and gives it just the perfect amount of moisture I need to get through the week :)</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised after using CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, my hair was soft and shiney and my scalp was itch free.</li>
            <li>But what precious strands remain I, like the first 3 letters of my namesake, zealously guard against damage from the likes of not merely Delilah but dust, grime and grease.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect as my last wash because I can easily comb through my hair when applying conditioner or other treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I noticed first of all that while scented it was with a very mild scent which shouldn&#x27;t be bothersome to anyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo is thick, lathers easily and abundantly, cleans my hair without drying it - what more could I want?  </li>
            <li>I only use a hair straightener (with a heat protection spray) on the lowest heat setting and my hair still feels and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>After one use-I could not be more surprised of the color depth, shine, feel and smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft to touch and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>so far- better than Pantene.</li>
            <li>The price is just right.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was pleasant smelling, and left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This shampoo &amp; the conditioner makes my scalp feel clean and my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>I am giving it 3 stars because I think it has potential of working on a different kind of hair (I have very fine, straight hair), and it has a non-offensive scent.</li>
            <li>It did a good job with having soft hair, but I was having snow storms of dandruff and lots of hair breakage to a point I pick off ten plus hairs off my when I got out of the shower and throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have used the \\&quot;total care\\&quot; from Clear and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I think the [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] makes a good clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell very much, although if you don&#x27;t like coconut and vanilla, that may be an issue for</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s reference to \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot; and natural hair, but take it from me this formula works beautifully on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It can tend to get a little bit fly-away if I don&#x27;t use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>(The only downfall of this product, but better than getting $25 salon stuff).</li>
            <li>until something better and equally cost-effective comes along.</li>
            <li>I use a clarifying shampoo first since I work out</li>
            <li>This smells great and lathers thick and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I was amazed from the first use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more results from this in the future like if it helps reduce breakage like it says -</li>
            <li>The product shipped very quickly, individually bagged, no spills and I love the product itself</li>
            <li>My hair comes out clean, soft, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, on the whole, I like it and will most likely continue using it.</li>
            <li>they used hacking spam software on some people&#x27;s Facebooks to leave positive comments/reviews on the brands Facebook page to promote their product, and they test this product on animals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to stop using those in favor of this more economical shampoo due to the presence of sodium laureth sulfate.  </li>
            <li>After use, my hair was clean, soft, and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders somewhat did the job, but my hair gets dry and brittle and did an okay job on the dandruff.</li>
            <li>Some organic/natural products are not irritating then it will not be strong enough to remove oil</li>
            <li>I really hope my hair will improve with time after discontinuing using this.</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous about sampling this shampoo as I have been using the same cheap shampoo for years since it doesn&#x27;t upset my allergies</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>It could also be that I am rinsing so much that I am drying out my scalp.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li>but then it gets really greasy</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s really gross&lt;</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it on my hair (doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is smooth on application and only requires the tiniest amount.</li>
            <li>and I really like the results it gave me..</li>
            <li>However, it seems to leave a film on my hair and a layer on my scalp no matter how much I try to rinse it</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo and it really works.</li>
            <li>It really moisturized my hair.</li>
            <li>What I really didn&#x27;t like about it was the smell.</li>
            <li>and I really felt the difference.</li>
            <li>Very creamy.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I have not been too satisfied with the Clear line of products.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizing shampoo I tried previously had a perfumey very strong odor.  </li>
            <li>This has a professional shampoo feel, but the price tag is right.</li>
            <li>75% of the flakes were gone, my scalp showed major improvements, and my hair was shiny, smooth, and soft (</li>
            <li>I wash it every other day, and focus on the scalp a wee bit more so that I know it&#x27;s doing its job.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair did look better the first few times I used it.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels more clean and moisturized after using and have definitely seen less breakage.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo, I was really surprised how my hair felt when I rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li>Then touching my hair calmed me down.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I was given a very big bottle to try it out since it will last me awhile!</li>

            <li>CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]] .</li>
            <li>I love the total care and will go back to it.</li>
            <li>CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]]  </li>
            <li>B007RTR9E2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid</li>
            <li>this product does really make my hair feel very soft and smell sooo</li>
            <li>Just the right fit for my hand, self-closing, narrow so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has sodium laureth sulfate, but when I used it with its accompanying Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, my hair emerged silky (though still frizzy since the beauty industry has yet to invent a flat iron in a bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WISH IT HAD BEEN PACKAGED A LITTLE BETTER.</li>
            <li>It is so soft!!</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair twice a week and this shampoo keeps my hair soft and clean during all the days in between.  </li>
            <li>The Clear Scalp Ultra Shea shampoo really cleans without drying my hair out.</li>
            <li>While it is relatively difficult to review a hair product for me because I am not as creative about hair products, I can write more about the Clear line of products because they cause my hair and scalp to do funky things.  </li>
            <li>THE OTHER PRODUCTS WERE FINE</li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s pretty refreshing.</li>
            <li>product looks and smells \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; and is no doubt the right tonic for numerous scalps.</li>
            <li>yeah, new shampoo\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>So, told her it was my new shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer the golden Shea type over the other purple-ish &#x27;Clear&#x27; shampoos but only available online, not in stores for some reason.</li>
            <li>It has a nice blend of ingredients such as shea butter sunflower, coconut and almond, to list a few.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They might as well slap a Nair sticker on the front of it, the product is Clear alright, CLEARS your scalp of hair!</li>
            <li>I went to get my haircut last month and my Hair Dresser seemed pretty worried about the condition of my hair</li>
            <li>but last week I started noticing it was getting really greasy!</li>
            <li>a different one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do see a difference!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended for a luxurious, soft feeling!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a Shampoo that was cheap but didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>You will get your money&#x27;s worth and won&#x27;t have a dry frisly hair which needs to be conditioned after washing this out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo along with the conditioner of the same kind and found them to be very heavy for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It also made my hair look lifeless, which was pretty strange because my hair did feel very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I typed \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo..\\&quot; into Google and up popped \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li>I then stumbled upon Clear.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo for about 1 1/2 years now.  </li>
            <li>I use this before the Clear Conditioner and my hair is just transformed.</li>
            <li>This review is for Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ Shampoo]] &amp; [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I find Clear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clear for almost a month now and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>After trying two types of this CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY shampoos I have to change my thoughts.  </li>
            <li>I saw that Clear scalp had a shea brand</li>
            <li>and I thought that it made my hair soft and manageable at the time.</li>
            <li>Every time I touched my hair, I was amazed at how soft and silky it felt</li>
            <li>While this one lathers up well, it feels sticky to me and it seems as if I cannot get it completely washed off.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get the hair too soft that the hair feels stringy either.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my 6 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I was fixing her hair after washing it with this at how soft it made it.</li>
            <li>It was so soft and silky without any frizz.</li>
            <li>It feels like a light conditioner, and leaves my hair feeling heavy and drab.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleans and leaves my hair soft and manageable for days.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t like to use the same shampoo very often, this is one that I will use a lot.</li>
            <li>After using, my hair is soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Both these shampoos leave my hair feeling soft and silkier and cleaner than the the cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li>I find myself running my fingers through my hair because it&#x27;s so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li>My stylist has been doing my hair since I was really young</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and being shoulder length it flows better than any one of those \\&quot;wind-blown commercials for shining hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>thing I especially like, because I tried the [[ASIN:B007RTR8A2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]], is that the Ultra Shea shampoo has a very mild, almost vanilly scent to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is first shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out AND gets rid of dandruff.</li>
            <li>A male friend of mine also has the exact same problem as me and he will be getting some today to help him out</li>
            <li>If you like a lasting and smellable fragrance, then I would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It lathers like no other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I shed throughout using it, and it seemed like my normal hair shed, but I didn&#x27;t realize how drastic it actually was.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley, I had a feeling my test results and blood panel would come back as normal, and they were.</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that it does not rinse off easily.</li>
            <li>few bonuses: this product smells fantastic and the bottle design that dispenses shampoo from the bottom is terrific!</li>
            <li>But the conditioner-additive leaves behind a kind of moisture which, \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; or not, is not the result desired by those of us with hyperactive sebum-secretors--i.e., one individual&#x27;s \\&quot;residual reward\\&quot; is another&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wash my hair and suddenly think \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>I have dry, fine, slightly wavy, shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is very tricky, because you&#x27;ll think that your hair is just shedding normal, but one day you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of hair you used to have is SIGNIFICANTLY less after continued use of this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and my scalp is very prone to dandruff.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo 2 to 3 times a week and have truly noted my hair appears a lot less dry and brittle--more importantly others have as well.</li>
            <li>I generally take a shower and wash my hair at the gym.</li>
            <li>I generally owe it to her</li>
            <li>and my hair gets sweaty and then my last shampoo is with the Clear Ultra Shea Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>( in my opinion) because I&#x27;ve also seen on the shelf at store just Clear product in a white and purple bottle.  </li>
            <li>CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading that this one in particular is for dry scalp</li>
            <li>I feel as though I have gone back to my old products by using this combo</li>
            <li>Last year I was transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.</li>
            <li>The packaging leaves a little to be desired since the top popped off during shipping, but it was tight in plastic bag</li>
            <li>If I decide not to wash for one day, I wet my hair, blow it dry and can still smell the fragrance as though it were freshly washed.  </li>
            <li>Normally the shampoos I use on her hair make it so dry.</li>
            <li>is the third of the clear scalp and hair beauty products that I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m starting to wonder if there&#x27;s any difference between them.</li>
            <li>I been suffering from a very sensitive and dry scalp  since childhood and nothing seemed to work until I tried this.  </li>
            <li>I mean I was really excited to use this.</li>
            <li>Normal &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner combinations leave my hair greasy and gross but my hair will still feel dry and in despite need of help.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that my hair felt different comparing to other hair products, but then again that&#x27;s very rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And for what it is worth a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, and most shampoos leave my hair feeling dry and stringy.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think they studied the long term effects of this product and even though the ingredients list has the same as a lot of other shampoos, I&#x27;m now convinced that something else is in this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This may be an issue (only) for those with thin, fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I am a recovering breast cancer patient and this is recommended by the ACA, so am giving it a try; however, I am having a problem with my scalp breaking out with little watery &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; occasionally, so am alternating this with another &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; shampoo, which seems to work very well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> don&#x27;t want to stop using it because it made my hair look awesome</li>
            <li> Best shampoo out there</li>

            <li> Wonderful for relaxed or color treated hair</li>
            <li> think is probably best for anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner that goes along with this</li>
            <li> is equally impressive.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and condition I have ever used</li>

            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Good news, I needed shampoo and conditioner anyway.</li>
            <li> ... good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, inexpensive shampoo for a while</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the Ultra Shea conditioner, and my hair feels really good.</li>
            <li> does a good job for me and smells good.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good scent&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for those of us hyper-sensitive to perfume scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really good</li>
            <li> The good news is this</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will repurchase for sure!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for like a month and my hair was looking amazing and everyone would always complement me</li>
            <li> it makes your hair look amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> But I  do recommend that you use the whole product line for best results.</li>
            <li> and I have been thrilled.</li>
            <li> The nice scent of shea was relaxing and nice, and it lasted too.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This product is good, I like I&#x27;m going to buy some more of this product and keep it on  my self as I run out.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s just thrilled with the shampoo and conditioner, she likes the scent and the shape of the bottles.</li>
            <li> and the end result was really nice, after drying and styling</li>
            <li> Your hair is super smooth and it looks awesome</li>
            <li> These ingredients promote a great clean feeling and a nice refreshing smell once the product is washed out of one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> My hair tangles very easily even when it&#x27;s shorter.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is working just fine for me, and at around five bucks, it&#x27;s a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clear scalp is the best shampoo I have used in years.</li>
            <li> she commented on how nice and healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li> It does lather up nicely, but it&#x27;s a denser lather most shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write another review if anything changes but for right now I will continue to use and the price is great to.</li>
            <li> From the feel, I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t clean as well, but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Nice lather, and rinses out easily, leaving no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> My scalp immediately felt better after using this.</li>
            <li> Thankfully hubby is home now and feeling much better</li>
            <li> hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not regretting it now. :)</li>
            <li> My hair has more body and is easier to control, too.  </li>
            <li> Mine, however, will continue to be served by the cheap but effective</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> I love how my hair is when i use it</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT, BUT WHEN RECEIVED, IT WAS NOT PACKAGED</li>
            <li> Washing it will sometimes make it better for a day or two, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels good on my scalp, leaves my hair soft, and it smells good, too.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love how it smells, too.</li>
            <li> It has more sunflower seed oil than it has coconut oil.</li>
            <li> and I really love the smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it is that great.</li>
            <li> one thing I do love about it is the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I feel like I am on a tropical holiday (reminds me of tanning lotion).</li>
            <li> Because of Vine sometimes releasing products to us sooner, this may change as retailers carry more of the line.</li>
            <li> The outcome might (and probably would have) been better if I had both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I wasnt sure if it was a product for my hair type.</li>
            <li> We do love this product.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many shampoo just to find one that does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> The problem I ran into was getting more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it opens at the top and the conditioner opens at the bottom,</li>
            <li> I love Aveda products, but they are so costly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the idea that it has the vitamin E and Shea butter in it</li>
            <li> Shipping was okay.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo to be okay</li>
            <li> I really like it because it works great for my 4a/b hair texture.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent of Shea butter (I note some others don&#x27;t agree).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily or greasy feel to my hair and rinses very cleanly from the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been impressed with this shampoo in terms of helping relieve my dry scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect balance between not being too harsh and being effective in removing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had a nice lather to it and washed out of my hair easily, leaving it feeling clean but not squeaky.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, smells nice &amp; clean, not overpowering, washes well and leaves hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I usually do not use a shampoo and conditioner set, but the results were very nice.  </li>
            <li> Scalp\\&quot; might prove, for many, not merely an eye-catching brand name but an apt description of this product&#x27;s cleansing properties.  </li>
            <li> It would need to be unscented or lightly scented with a more tenable smell before I would use it again.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky, the slip is great</li>
            <li> I also noted that it was quite easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> Easily foam-able&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good, lathers nicely, and rinses well with no residue, BUT it left my hair feeling like straw and almost crunchy.</li>
            <li> My  scalp stays flake free up to 2weeks when used with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got the Shea Cleanse and Nourish so that not only did my scalp feel happy, so did my hair.</li>
            <li> You want a happy scalp and hair at the same time, get this.</li>
            <li> (Since it&#x27;s still available at the corner drug chain for under a buck, I&#x27;m not holding my breath.)</li>
            <li> My hair feels light weight and airy which never happens</li>
            <li> Made my hair silky, manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li> has a light shea butter smell to it but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Heaps of conditioner were needed for it to feel smooth again.</li>
            <li> Even on the second day, my hair still looked great.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the fragrance, while pleasant, is a bit strong and persistent to me.</li>
            <li> Their motto is &#x27;starting at the right end of the hair and nourishing the scalp for beautiful hair&#x27;..</li>
            <li> So this was my first experience with a better bran shampoo</li>
            <li> (I wash my hair every other day) and a co-worker grabbed me and said \\&quot;Why do you smell sooooooo good?!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited about using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Rich texture&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product in my favorite &amp;#34;big box store&amp;#34; but they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> Familiar with this product.</li>
            <li> and it got my hair clean</li>
            <li> Our hair is clean and keeps and flakes away.</li>
            <li> Love it better than professional lines that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> and  infuse the hair with moisturizer and clean the the skill as it moisturizes and clean the hair at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It rinsed out really clean, unlike the Aussie I had been using for two weeks, which leaves a coating on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a pearly creamy liquid and smells wonderful, I was hoping to be able to use it since it did make my hair feel soft when washing it, but cant explain why the end result was so bland.</li>
            <li> This has been great for the family members whose hair tends to be very dry.  </li>
            <li> I was using this shampoo and conditioner for months and months pretty much since it came out, I actually really liked it</li>
            <li> even though I use the Suave Keratin Serum as well, this made it go from bleh to SWEET ZOMBIE JESUS</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo is a nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li> or PEG-9M, or \\&quot;Methylisothiozolinone.\\&quot; I do feel favorably toward shea butter and Sweet Almond</li>
            <li> Being a smoker also, the smell is still good on the 2nd day.</li>
            <li> This product cleanses just as good as WEN and gives my hair back its strength.</li>
            <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer, and even better, my scalp isn&#x27;t as prone to cracking.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t rinse well with cool water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a shampoo you need to use daily to get good results.</li>
            <li> This means there isn&#x27;t as much \\&quot;movement\\&quot; of my hair as is normal and sometimes that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I would imagine on naturally oily hair it would make your hair feel gross and maybe sticky, but on my hair it makes it soft and gives it just the perfect amount of moisture I need to get through the week :)</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised after using CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, my hair was soft and shiney and my scalp was itch free.</li>
            <li> But what precious strands remain I, like the first 3 letters of my namesake, zealously guard against damage from the likes of not merely Delilah but dust, grime and grease.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect as my last wash because I can easily comb through my hair when applying conditioner or other treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I noticed first of all that while scented it was with a very mild scent which shouldn&#x27;t be bothersome to anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo is thick, lathers easily and abundantly, cleans my hair without drying it - what more could I want?  </li>
            <li> I only use a hair straightener (with a heat protection spray) on the lowest heat setting and my hair still feels and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> After one use-I could not be more surprised of the color depth, shine, feel and smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft to touch and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> so far- better than Pantene.</li>
            <li> The price is just right.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was pleasant smelling, and left my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; the conditioner makes my scalp feel clean and my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> I am giving it 3 stars because I think it has potential of working on a different kind of hair (I have very fine, straight hair), and it has a non-offensive scent.</li>
            <li> It did a good job with having soft hair, but I was having snow storms of dandruff and lots of hair breakage to a point I pick off ten plus hairs off my when I got out of the shower and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have used the \\&quot;total care\\&quot; from Clear and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I think the [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] makes a good clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell very much, although if you don&#x27;t like coconut and vanilla, that may be an issue for</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s reference to \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot; and natural hair, but take it from me this formula works beautifully on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It can tend to get a little bit fly-away if I don&#x27;t use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> (The only downfall of this product, but better than getting $25 salon stuff).</li>
            <li> until something better and equally cost-effective comes along.</li>
            <li> I use a clarifying shampoo first since I work out</li>
            <li> This smells great and lathers thick and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I was amazed from the first use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more results from this in the future like if it helps reduce breakage like it says -</li>
            <li> The product shipped very quickly, individually bagged, no spills and I love the product itself</li>
            <li> My hair comes out clean, soft, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, on the whole, I like it and will most likely continue using it.</li>
            <li> they used hacking spam software on some people&#x27;s Facebooks to leave positive comments/reviews on the brands Facebook page to promote their product, and they test this product on animals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to stop using those in favor of this more economical shampoo due to the presence of sodium laureth sulfate.  </li>
            <li> After use, my hair was clean, soft, and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders somewhat did the job, but my hair gets dry and brittle and did an okay job on the dandruff.</li>
            <li> Some organic/natural products are not irritating then it will not be strong enough to remove oil</li>
            <li> I really hope my hair will improve with time after discontinuing using this.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about sampling this shampoo as I have been using the same cheap shampoo for years since it doesn&#x27;t upset my allergies</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> It could also be that I am rinsing so much that I am drying out my scalp.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li> but then it gets really greasy</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s really gross&lt;</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on my hair (doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is smooth on application and only requires the tiniest amount.</li>
            <li> and I really like the results it gave me..</li>
            <li> However, it seems to leave a film on my hair and a layer on my scalp no matter how much I try to rinse it</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo and it really works.</li>
            <li> It really moisturized my hair.</li>
            <li> What I really didn&#x27;t like about it was the smell.</li>
            <li> and I really felt the difference.</li>
            <li> Very creamy.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I have not been too satisfied with the Clear line of products.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizing shampoo I tried previously had a perfumey very strong odor.  </li>
            <li> This has a professional shampoo feel, but the price tag is right.</li>
            <li> 75% of the flakes were gone, my scalp showed major improvements, and my hair was shiny, smooth, and soft (</li>
            <li> I wash it every other day, and focus on the scalp a wee bit more so that I know it&#x27;s doing its job.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair did look better the first few times I used it.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels more clean and moisturized after using and have definitely seen less breakage.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo, I was really surprised how my hair felt when I rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li> Then touching my hair calmed me down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I was given a very big bottle to try it out since it will last me awhile!</li>

            <li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]] .</li>
            <li> I love the total care and will go back to it.</li>
            <li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]]  </li>
            <li> B007RTR9E2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid</li>
            <li> this product does really make my hair feel very soft and smell sooo</li>
            <li> Just the right fit for my hand, self-closing, narrow so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has sodium laureth sulfate, but when I used it with its accompanying Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, my hair emerged silky (though still frizzy since the beauty industry has yet to invent a flat iron in a bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WISH IT HAD BEEN PACKAGED A LITTLE BETTER.</li>
            <li> It is so soft!!</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair twice a week and this shampoo keeps my hair soft and clean during all the days in between.  </li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp Ultra Shea shampoo really cleans without drying my hair out.</li>
            <li> While it is relatively difficult to review a hair product for me because I am not as creative about hair products, I can write more about the Clear line of products because they cause my hair and scalp to do funky things.  </li>
            <li> THE OTHER PRODUCTS WERE FINE</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s pretty refreshing.</li>
            <li> product looks and smells \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; and is no doubt the right tonic for numerous scalps.</li>
            <li> yeah, new shampoo\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So, told her it was my new shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the golden Shea type over the other purple-ish &#x27;Clear&#x27; shampoos but only available online, not in stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> It has a nice blend of ingredients such as shea butter sunflower, coconut and almond, to list a few.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They might as well slap a Nair sticker on the front of it, the product is Clear alright, CLEARS your scalp of hair!</li>
            <li> I went to get my haircut last month and my Hair Dresser seemed pretty worried about the condition of my hair</li>
            <li> but last week I started noticing it was getting really greasy!</li>
            <li> a different one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do see a difference!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended for a luxurious, soft feeling!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Shampoo that was cheap but didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> You will get your money&#x27;s worth and won&#x27;t have a dry frisly hair which needs to be conditioned after washing this out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo along with the conditioner of the same kind and found them to be very heavy for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair look lifeless, which was pretty strange because my hair did feel very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I typed \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo..\\&quot; into Google and up popped \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li> I then stumbled upon Clear.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo for about 1 1/2 years now.  </li>
            <li> I use this before the Clear Conditioner and my hair is just transformed.</li>
            <li> This review is for Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ Shampoo]] &amp; [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I find Clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clear for almost a month now and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> After trying two types of this CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY shampoos I have to change my thoughts.  </li>
            <li> I saw that Clear scalp had a shea brand</li>
            <li> and I thought that it made my hair soft and manageable at the time.</li>
            <li> Every time I touched my hair, I was amazed at how soft and silky it felt</li>
            <li> While this one lathers up well, it feels sticky to me and it seems as if I cannot get it completely washed off.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the hair too soft that the hair feels stringy either.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my 6 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I was fixing her hair after washing it with this at how soft it made it.</li>
            <li> It was so soft and silky without any frizz.</li>
            <li> It feels like a light conditioner, and leaves my hair feeling heavy and drab.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans and leaves my hair soft and manageable for days.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t like to use the same shampoo very often, this is one that I will use a lot.</li>
            <li> After using, my hair is soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Both these shampoos leave my hair feeling soft and silkier and cleaner than the the cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li> I find myself running my fingers through my hair because it&#x27;s so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> My stylist has been doing my hair since I was really young</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and being shoulder length it flows better than any one of those \\&quot;wind-blown commercials for shining hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> thing I especially like, because I tried the [[ASIN:B007RTR8A2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]], is that the Ultra Shea shampoo has a very mild, almost vanilly scent to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is first shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out AND gets rid of dandruff.</li>
            <li> A male friend of mine also has the exact same problem as me and he will be getting some today to help him out</li>
            <li> If you like a lasting and smellable fragrance, then I would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It lathers like no other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I shed throughout using it, and it seemed like my normal hair shed, but I didn&#x27;t realize how drastic it actually was.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley, I had a feeling my test results and blood panel would come back as normal, and they were.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it does not rinse off easily.</li>
            <li> few bonuses: this product smells fantastic and the bottle design that dispenses shampoo from the bottom is terrific!</li>
            <li> But the conditioner-additive leaves behind a kind of moisture which, \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; or not, is not the result desired by those of us with hyperactive sebum-secretors--i.e., one individual&#x27;s \\&quot;residual reward\\&quot; is another&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wash my hair and suddenly think \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> I have dry, fine, slightly wavy, shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is very tricky, because you&#x27;ll think that your hair is just shedding normal, but one day you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of hair you used to have is SIGNIFICANTLY less after continued use of this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and my scalp is very prone to dandruff.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo 2 to 3 times a week and have truly noted my hair appears a lot less dry and brittle--more importantly others have as well.</li>
            <li> I generally take a shower and wash my hair at the gym.</li>
            <li> I generally owe it to her</li>
            <li> and my hair gets sweaty and then my last shampoo is with the Clear Ultra Shea Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> ( in my opinion) because I&#x27;ve also seen on the shelf at store just Clear product in a white and purple bottle.  </li>
            <li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading that this one in particular is for dry scalp</li>
            <li> I feel as though I have gone back to my old products by using this combo</li>
            <li> Last year I was transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.</li>
            <li> The packaging leaves a little to be desired since the top popped off during shipping, but it was tight in plastic bag</li>
            <li> If I decide not to wash for one day, I wet my hair, blow it dry and can still smell the fragrance as though it were freshly washed.  </li>
            <li> Normally the shampoos I use on her hair make it so dry.</li>
            <li> is the third of the clear scalp and hair beauty products that I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m starting to wonder if there&#x27;s any difference between them.</li>
            <li> I been suffering from a very sensitive and dry scalp  since childhood and nothing seemed to work until I tried this.  </li>
            <li> I mean I was really excited to use this.</li>
            <li> Normal &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner combinations leave my hair greasy and gross but my hair will still feel dry and in despite need of help.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that my hair felt different comparing to other hair products, but then again that&#x27;s very rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for what it is worth a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, and most shampoos leave my hair feeling dry and stringy.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think they studied the long term effects of this product and even though the ingredients list has the same as a lot of other shampoos, I&#x27;m now convinced that something else is in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This may be an issue (only) for those with thin, fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I am a recovering breast cancer patient and this is recommended by the ACA, so am giving it a try; however, I am having a problem with my scalp breaking out with little watery &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; occasionally, so am alternating this with another &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; shampoo, which seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> She has long, curly, super thick hair that tends to get flyaways and frizzes</li>
            <li> They all carry the other CLEAR products.</li>
            <li> hair has been very shiny, and her scalp isn&#x27;t itching like it tends to do usually just following shampooing.</li>
            <li> notice a bit of residue with this shampoo, but that&#x27;s pretty common with moisturizing shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Toward the scalp my hair is greasy looking and flat and never used to be that way if I could rate this \\&quot;0</li>
            <li> And being that I recently had a cut I&#x27;m looking forward to see how long it&#x27;s going to grow.</li>
            <li> I would hate to rate it low, because the trust I gained by using Total Care makes me feel as if the Ultra Shea could be as good if I used the conditioner along with it.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten extremely thinned out, so much to the point that I don&#x27;t even want to wear my hair down anymore.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair, fairly short, and also dry.  </li>
            <li> Grey hair tends to get coarse and dry.  </li>
            <li> Also, with the dandruff, after the owner of my workplace (who can be very picky on appearance, down to one flake of dandruff) walked in and seeing the amount of dandruff on my black uniform</li>
            <li> Anyone with this problem knows full well how frustrating it can be--and if your like me you&#x27;ve most likely tried a lot of different shampoos which claim to help only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> &quot; The list of ingredients on the label is two inches long.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair - intentionally.  </li>
            <li> I am now switched to a different shampoo and using It&#x27;s A 10 and some other hair repair products and hoping and praying my hair will recover and grow to how it was before.</li>
            <li> whatever is in here wrecks the scalp if you use this on a long term basis!</li>
            <li> The next thing that came up was driving my husband into the hospital due to a heart problem.</li>
            <li> But then, the shampoo seemed little different than the others I used, and my hair didn&#x27;t look any different.  </li>
            <li> or so I saw the commercial on TV the other day for this product and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;That&#x27;s it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked into Walmart and looked at the dry scalp/dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> This may be what is causing the itching and dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing my hair, it no longer feels dry and stringy.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be for a dry scalp, which I have.</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned, scalp dry, hair brittle and color not lustrous but this all comes with hitting 50 as I am told.</li>
            <li> My daughter is prone to dry hair.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about this particular product is the scent.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and made a Doctors appointment and in the meantime I was trying to think of the reasons this could be happening.</li>
            <li> AMAZON, NEXT TIME YOU NEED TO WRAP THIS PRODUCT IN PLASTIC AND TAPE DOWN THE OPENING TO THE BOTTLE.  </li>
            <li> So moisturizing for my dry pregnancy hair!</li>
            <li> Finally after using it about a month, I realized my hair is half gone.</li>
            <li> as for my black work uniform, I have not had to brush off flakes or pluck ten plus hairs off</li>
            <li> I am white and her dad is black.</li>
            <li> I know the implication is that it&#x27;s for black hair only with</li>
            <li> This comes at the expense of less body though which is the only reason I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> The packaging on the inside was a mess, the shampoo came open.</li>
            <li> It works well with coarse, gray hair, leaving it manageable with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li> Unlike those two, the Clear Scalp does have a slight perfume smell, but it&#x27;s not a strong scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> Usually without an extensive dandruff treatment that leaves my hair really really dry, my dandruff never goes away.</li>
            <li> Tried other shampoos for sensitive scalp and got negative results.  </li>
            <li> I had thin hair, but a decent amount of it.</li>
            <li> Not good when you are sensitive to scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> usually use $20 per bottle shampoo and matching conditioner from my local salon in attempts to make my hair behave.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I just started alternating it with my other shampoos--[[ASIN:B001F51PWG Aussie Moist Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]] and</li>
            <li> I have salt and pepper middle aged hair, and it always feels a little stiff.</li>
            <li> It makes my thick, coarse, dry hair and scalp feel silky and buttery!  </li>
            <li> I stopped using WEN and started using this product because when made my hair too soft and weak.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time with doing my hair because of the mixed textures.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Well they had the conditioners and other stuff bit NO SHAMPOO!</li>
            <li> My hair felt so raw and rough.</li>
            <li> After a month or two I&#x27;ve started noticing some odd smell in my bathroom, I think this shampoo does not age well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very, very dry and frizzy hair, so I usually avoid products with sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually wash my hair myself-i&#x27;m no good at it.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> WELL AND HAD LEAKED OUT APPROXIMATELY 1/2 OF THE SHAMPOO ALL OVER THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WERE SENT IN THE SAME BOX.  </li>
            <li> Espcially since I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> As a few other people have mentioned on makeupalley.com, it seems to shrink the follicles of the hair or something!</li>
            <li> I have wave and tight curls along with burn damage.</li>
            <li> From time to time my hair gets dry and dull and my scalp itches from washing it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, even though it was a little pricey for me</li>
            <li> Every little bit helps in budgeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little or no tangles</li>
            <li> texture of the shampoo took a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I have fine thin, dirty blond hair.</li>
            <li> and as I continue with the use of this shampoo I find it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or limp like some shampoos with conditioner</li>
            <li> It worked so well that I was worried it might over-condition my hair and make it greasy after a few washes.  </li>
            <li> a few times a month to remove residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it, but the scent seems a little chemical to me.</li>
            <li> Of course I checked my favorite online store and without fail, Amazon had it!!!  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every 7 to 10 days.</li>
            <li> Anyway after using Pantene for the past 5 years</li>
            <li> I have thick curly wave hair and this helps tame it.</li>
            <li> All you have to lose is dull hair and an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I find is that the \\&quot;gold\\&quot; bottles are hard to find at stores.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s hard to find</li>
            <li> It was still hard to detangle even after the conditioner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and thick, almost lotion-y.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m going to add this one in about once a month for a little variety and as a way to stretch my expensive shampoo out.  </li>
            <li> As wives tend to do when they are waiting through the ER and finally admission routines, you rub your face and hair wondering how bad this was all going to be.</li>
            <li> product isn&#x27;t so bad that I won&#x27;t eventually finish the bottle, but it&#x27;s not something I plan on purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> to play-doh, which is not a pleasant scent in my book.</li>
            <li> I realized that even some salon products are sometimes irritating.</li>
            <li> SO UNABLE TO RATE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just read review after review of hair loss and thinning hair from this shampoo on this site as well as Makeupalley.com- reviews of people who also went to the doctor and had blood work done to see if anything was wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My scalp immediately felt better after using this. However, I noticed I was losing a lot of hair. Finally after using it about a month, I realized my hair is half gone. It&#x27;s been coming out in gobs every time I wash or brush it. It&#x27;s also changed the texture of my hair. Toward the scalp my hair is greasy looking and flat and never used to be that way if I could rate this \\&quot;0 stars\\&quot; I would!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that my hair&amp;scalp likes!  They took it off the markets in my area And my hair has been going through withdrawal since.  I been suffering from a very sensitive and dry scalp  since childhood and nothing seemed to work until I tried this.  My  scalp stays flake free up to 2weeks when used with the conditioner. But I  do recommend that you use the whole product line for best results.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT LEAKED OUT. SO UNABLE TO RATE THE PRODUCT. WISH IT HAD BEEN PACKAGED A LITTLE BETTER. THE OTHER PRODUCTS WERE FINE THOUGH</li>
            <li> I was using this shampoo and conditioner for months and months pretty much since it came out, I actually really liked it and I thought that it made my hair soft and manageable at the time. I went to get my haircut last month and my Hair Dresser seemed pretty worried about the condition of my hair, it was breaking. I was worried that maybe I had a health issue or maybe it was the generic birth control that I switched to recently instead of name brand. I finally broke down and made a Doctors appointment and in the meantime I was trying to think of the reasons this could be happening. I typed \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo..\\&quot; into Google and up popped \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo Hair Loss\\&quot; in the suggestions box.. Panic immediately set in. I&#x27;ve just read review after review of hair loss and thinning hair from this shampoo on this site as well as Makeupalley.com- reviews of people who also went to the doctor and had blood work done to see if anything was wrong. I had thin hair, but a decent amount of it. My hair has gotten extremely thinned out, so much to the point that I don&#x27;t even want to wear my hair down anymore. I shed throughout using it, and it seemed like my normal hair shed, but I didn&#x27;t realize how drastic it actually was. They might as well slap a Nair sticker on the front of it, the product is Clear alright, CLEARS your scalp of hair! I really don&#x27;t think they studied the long term effects of this product and even though the ingredients list has the same as a lot of other shampoos, I&#x27;m now convinced that something else is in this shampoo. As a few other people have mentioned on makeupalley.com, it seems to shrink the follicles of the hair or something! I really hope my hair will improve with time after discontinuing using this. I am now switched to a different shampoo and using It&#x27;s A 10 and some other hair repair products and hoping and praying my hair will recover and grow to how it was before. This shampoo and conditioner is very tricky, because you&#x27;ll think that your hair is just shedding normal, but one day you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of hair you used to have is SIGNIFICANTLY less after continued use of this product. Don&#x27;t let it fool you! Upon further investigation- they used hacking spam software on some people&#x27;s Facebooks to leave positive comments/reviews on the brands Facebook page to promote their product, and they test this product on animals. Their motto is &#x27;starting at the right end of the hair and nourishing the scalp for beautiful hair&#x27;.. whatever is in here wrecks the scalp if you use this on a long term basis! This shampoo and conditioner is scary. I think something is horribly wrong with this product. After reading all the reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley, I had a feeling my test results and blood panel would come back as normal, and they were. Please write your review here and on makeupalley.com if you&#x27;ve had a similar experience! Hopefully it will help others before they have to suffer from a stupid mistake of using this product. I wish I would have found out sooner!</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about sampling this shampoo as I have been using the same cheap shampoo for years since it doesn&#x27;t upset my allergies and it got my hair clean which is what shampoo is supposed to do isn&#x27;t it? So this was my first experience with a better bran shampoo and I have been thrilled. The first day I used it, I noticed first of all that while scented it was with a very mild scent which shouldn&#x27;t be bothersome to anyone. The next thing that came up was driving my husband into the hospital due to a heart problem. As wives tend to do when they are waiting through the ER and finally admission routines, you rub your face and hair wondering how bad this was all going to be. Every time I touched my hair, I was amazed at how soft and silky it felt and then I remembered, \\&quot;Oh yeah, new shampoo\\&quot;. Then touching my hair calmed me down. Thankfully hubby is home now and feeling much better and as I continue with the use of this shampoo I find it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or limp like some shampoos with conditioner tend to do. I really like it and I&#x27;m glad I was given a very big bottle to try it out since it will last me awhile!</li>
            <li> I was using Dove&#x27;s Moisturizing Shampoo/Conditioner. It did a good job with having soft hair, but I was having snow storms of dandruff and lots of hair breakage to a point I pick off ten plus hairs off my when I got out of the shower and throughout the day. Also, with the dandruff, after the owner of my workplace (who can be very picky on appearance, down to one flake of dandruff) walked in and seeing the amount of dandruff on my black uniform, I said \\&quot;That&#x27;s it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked into Walmart and looked at the dry scalp/dandruff shampoos. Head and Shoulders somewhat did the job, but my hair gets dry and brittle and did an okay job on the dandruff. I then stumbled upon Clear. I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, even though it was a little pricey for me (The only downfall of this product, but better than getting $25 salon stuff). I got the Shea Cleanse and Nourish so that not only did my scalp feel happy, so did my hair. Good news, I needed shampoo and conditioner anyway. I ran out of the Dove anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went home and used it that night. The results were immediate on the spot. 75% of the flakes were gone, my scalp showed major improvements, and my hair was shiny, smooth, and soft (even though I use the Suave Keratin Serum as well, this made it go from bleh to SWEET ZOMBIE JESUS THAT&#x27;S GOOD!). The nice scent of shea was relaxing and nice, and it lasted too. I walked into work the next day (I wash my hair every other day) and a co-worker grabbed me and said \\&quot;Why do you smell sooooooo good?! I want that!\\&quot; So, told her it was my new shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for my black work uniform, I have not had to brush off flakes or pluck ten plus hairs off me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never felt better. I wash it every other day, and focus on the scalp a wee bit more so that I know it&#x27;s doing its job. I only use a hair straightener (with a heat protection spray) on the lowest heat setting and my hair still feels and smells amazing. A male friend of mine also has the exact same problem as me and he will be getting some today to help him out (I told him they had a mens line he can look into).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it! Trust me, you won&#x27;t be sorry. You want a happy scalp and hair at the same time, get this. I&#x27;m not regretting it now. :)</li>
            <li> I took this shampoo (and the conditioner) to the beauty salon with me.  The products meet the approval of my stylist and the owner of the salon. The shampoo was pleasant smelling, and left my hair soft. I also noted that it was quite easy to wash out. In the days since my wash, I haven&#x27;t seen any flakes, or experienced anu itching.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair, fairly short, and also dry.  This Ultra Shea shampoo works wonders on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I especially like, because I tried the [[ASIN:B007RTR8A2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]], is that the Ultra Shea shampoo has a very mild, almost vanilly scent to it.  The moisturizing shampoo I tried previously had a perfumey very strong odor.  Not good when you are sensitive to scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is thick, lathers easily and abundantly, cleans my hair without drying it - what more could I want?  My hair has more body and is easier to control, too.  I will continue to use this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the container, too.  Just the right fit for my hand, self-closing, narrow so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.</li>
            <li> I generally take a shower and wash my hair at the gym. From time to time my hair gets dry and dull and my scalp itches from washing it almost everyday.  I was pleasantly suprised after using CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, my hair was soft and shiney and my scalp was itch free. I highly recommend trying this product. All you have to lose is dull hair and an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a specimen of hirsute loveliness--or, for that matter, manliness.  But what precious strands remain I, like the first 3 letters of my namesake, zealously guard against damage from the likes of not merely Delilah but dust, grime and grease. \\&quot;Clear Scalp\\&quot; might prove, for many, not merely an eye-catching brand name but an apt description of this product&#x27;s cleansing properties.  But the conditioner-additive leaves behind a kind of moisture which, \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; or not, is not the result desired by those of us with hyperactive sebum-secretors--i.e., one individual&#x27;s \\&quot;residual reward\\&quot; is another&#x27;s \\&quot;residue.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product looks and smells \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; and is no doubt the right tonic for numerous scalps. Mine, however, will continue to be served by the cheap but effective [[ASIN:B001V9HQ0Q SUAVE SHAMPOO DAILY CLARIFYING]] until something better and equally cost-effective comes along. (Since it&#x27;s still available at the corner drug chain for under a buck, I&#x27;m not holding my breath.)</li>
            <li> Overall, I have not been too satisfied with the Clear line of products.  This is my third product and I still have another one to review.  While it is relatively difficult to review a hair product for me because I am not as creative about hair products, I can write more about the Clear line of products because they cause my hair and scalp to do funky things.  While this one lathers up well, it feels sticky to me and it seems as if I cannot get it completely washed off.  This may be what is causing the itching and dry scalp.  It could also be that I am rinsing so much that I am drying out my scalp.  I would not recommend this product and probably will only use this again as a last resort when I am out of my Herbal Essence.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li> this product does really make my hair feel very soft and smell sooo... good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for like a month and my hair was looking amazing and everyone would always complement me but last week I started noticing it was getting really greasy! I thought it was because of some treatment I used but I stopped using the treatment and my hair is the same! So I went from the skip a hair wash thing to take a shower every night and that&#x27;s not good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes it makes your hair look amazing but then it gets really greasy&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to stop using it because it made my hair look awesome but I don&#x27;t like the greasy hair thing&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s really gross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading that this one in particular is for dry scalp so maybe I need to use a different one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do see a difference! Your hair is super smooth and it looks awesome&lt;br /&gt;But you do have to wash it all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo for about 1 1/2 years now.  I use a clarifying shampoo first since I work out and my hair gets sweaty and then my last shampoo is with the Clear Ultra Shea Shampoo.  It makes my thick, coarse, dry hair and scalp feel silky and buttery!  As soon as I put it on my hair (doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot) I can feel it transform my hair from straw-like to silk-like.  It&#x27;s perfect as my last wash because I can easily comb through my hair when applying conditioner or other treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily or greasy feel to my hair and rinses very cleanly from the hair.  In fact, it feels stronger like it actually has something in it to help fortify the hair strands.  It doesn&#x27;t get the hair too soft that the hair feels stringy either.  I love this shampoo and I would definitely recommend it anyone to with a dryer-type scalp and hair condition.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo out there</li>
            <li> I use this before the Clear Conditioner and my hair is just transformed. Absolutely amazing and the best shampoo in the world.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair. From the reviews i thought this might make my hair too oily but it doesn&#x27;t! I love how my hair is when i use it It is so soft!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT, BUT WHEN RECEIVED, IT WAS NOT PACKAGED WELL AND HAD LEAKED OUT APPROXIMATELY 1/2 OF THE SHAMPOO ALL OVER THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WERE SENT IN THE SAME BOX.  AMAZON, NEXT TIME YOU NEED TO WRAP THIS PRODUCT IN PLASTIC AND TAPE DOWN THE OPENING TO THE BOTTLE.  I HAVE NOW LOST MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT  --  MAYBE YOU COULD SEND ME ANOTHER BOTTLE TO COVER THE LOSS THAT WAS CAUSED BY YOUR POOR PACKAGING!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this on my 6 year old daughters hair. I am white and her dad is black. This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have found for her hair. This smells great and lathers thick and luxurious. I was pleasantly surprised when I was fixing her hair after washing it with this at how soft it made it. Normally the shampoos I use on her hair make it so dry. This did not. It was so soft and silky without any frizz. I am hooked! This is the only shampoo I will use on her hair from now on.</li>
            <li> Helps my hair.  I have wave and tight curls along with burn damage. This shampoo in combination with the conditioner works great for my hair. Yes, I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every kind of shampoo in the store and this is best one I have ever found. Me, my wife and son all use it. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Our hair is clean and keeps and flakes away.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for relaxed or color treated hair</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo is a nice shampoo.  I&#x27;ve got very, very dry and frizzy hair, so I usually avoid products with sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate.  This shampoo has sodium laureth sulfate, but when I used it with its accompanying Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, my hair emerged silky (though still frizzy since the beauty industry has yet to invent a flat iron in a bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use $20 per bottle shampoo and matching conditioner from my local salon in attempts to make my hair behave.  I&#x27;m not going to stop using those in favor of this more economical shampoo due to the presence of sodium laureth sulfate.  But I&#x27;m going to add this one in about once a month for a little variety and as a way to stretch my expensive shampoo out.  Every little bit helps in budgeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few bonuses: this product smells fantastic and the bottle design that dispenses shampoo from the bottom is terrific!</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and my scalp is very prone to dandruff. Usually without an extensive dandruff treatment that leaves my hair really really dry, my dandruff never goes away. Washing it will sometimes make it better for a day or two, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is first shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out AND gets rid of dandruff. I usually wash my hair every 7 to 10 days. I haven&#x27;t had a dandruff problem between shampoos since I&#x27;ve been using it, which has been about a month. It feels good on my scalp, leaves my hair soft, and it smells good, too. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think is probably best for anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner that goes along with this is equally impressive.</li>
            <li> This review is for Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ Shampoo]] &amp; [[ASIN:B007RTR9E2 Conditioner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third of the clear scalp and hair beauty products that I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m starting to wonder if there&#x27;s any difference between them. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair and suddenly think \\&quot;Wow! This product brings out all of the potential my hair has ever had!\\&quot; but it wasn&#x27;t bad. My biggest complaint about this particular product is the scent. I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it, but the scent seems a little chemical to me. It reminds me of a very faint version of the way your hair smells after a perm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t so bad that I won&#x27;t eventually finish the bottle, but it&#x27;s not something I plan on purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both used this shampoo for a 2-week period in order to give it time to \\&quot;work\\&quot;. The shampoo did nothing for my hair. It feels like a light conditioner, and leaves my hair feeling heavy and drab. I am giving it 3 stars because I think it has potential of working on a different kind of hair (I have very fine, straight hair), and it has a non-offensive scent.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans and leaves my hair soft and manageable for days. Nice lather, and rinses out easily, leaving no greasy residue. I only wash my hair twice a week and this shampoo keeps my hair soft and clean during all the days in between.  It also smells great.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, inexpensive shampoo for a while and I think I finally found it!</li>
            <li> This is a creamy, shea butter based shampoo. It works well with coarse, gray hair, leaving it manageable with little to no frizz. Does not require a conditioner to compliment it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is smooth on application and only requires the tiniest amount. You will get your money&#x27;s worth and won&#x27;t have a dry frisly hair which needs to be conditioned after washing this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mailman left this on a porch in the sun and some of it oosed out, so do not leave this in heat.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo along with the conditioner of the same kind and found them to be very heavy for my curly hair. It also made my hair look lifeless, which was pretty strange because my hair did feel very soft to the touch. It is a pearly creamy liquid and smells wonderful, I was hoping to be able to use it since it did make my hair feel soft when washing it, but cant explain why the end result was so bland. Anyway, I have a feeling that it is not for curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, and most shampoos leave my hair feeling dry and stringy. The Clear Scalp Ultra Shea shampoo really cleans without drying my hair out. After rinsing my hair, it no longer feels dry and stringy. I use it in combination with the Ultra Shea conditioner, and my hair feels really good. My wife uses both the shampoo and conditioner and also likes them. My one complaint is that it does not rinse off easily. I have to rinse a lot to get it out of my hair, and my hair is short. While I don&#x27;t like to use the same shampoo very often, this is one that I will use a lot. My wife and I both love how it smells, too. Try it, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I am not a scientist. Therefore I don&#x27;t know how to speak about \\&quot;moisture lock\\&quot; (is that even possible?) or PEG-9M, or \\&quot;Methylisothiozolinone.\\&quot; I do feel favorably toward shea butter and Sweet Almond Oil.\\&quot; The list of ingredients on the label is two inches long. It has more sunflower seed oil than it has coconut oil. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have dye in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an older woman with \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hair I find Clear does a good job for me and smells good. The shampoo is creamy and makes my hair super-soft. This means there isn&#x27;t as much \\&quot;movement\\&quot; of my hair as is normal and sometimes that&#x27;s good. Since I do worry about product build up, I have always switched off shampoos, never using just one brand. This shampoo works well with that schedule. I&#x27;ve used Clear for almost a month now and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair - intentionally.  I decided to stop coloring my hair a couple years ago.  I knew it would take upkeep before making that choice.  Grey hair tends to get coarse and dry.  I saw the word \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; and decided to give it a shot instead of continuing to buy really expensive salon brands.  I was amazed from the first use.  It worked so well that I was worried it might over-condition my hair and make it greasy after a few washes.  But I worried for no reason.  My hair is like silk.  It&#x27;s thick and being shoulder length it flows better than any one of those \\&quot;wind-blown commercials for shining hair\\&quot;.  This stuff is amazing.  I know the implication is that it&#x27;s for black hair only with it&#x27;s reference to \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot; and natural hair, but take it from me this formula works beautifully on my fine hair.  And the smell is great too.  If I decide not to wash for one day, I wet my hair, blow it dry and can still smell the fragrance as though it were freshly washed.  Best shampoo and condition I have ever used - bar none.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve read just about all the reviews on this product and decided to try it out and for me it was Great. I&#x27;m African American and I have the thickest coarsest hair ever. I used the shampoo with the Ultra Shea conditioner and I really like the results it gave me.. Im in the process of trying to grow my hair so I&#x27;m excited about using this product. My hair feels light weight and airy which never happens and I really love the smell. I think Ultra Shea is for ethnic hair ( in my opinion) because I&#x27;ve also seen on the shelf at store just Clear product in a white and purple bottle.  I&#x27;ll write another review if anything changes but for right now I will continue to use and the price is great to.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for two weeks now. I can&#x27;t really say it is that great. It is supposed to be for a dry scalp, which I have. However, it seems to leave a film on my hair and a layer on my scalp no matter how much I try to rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I do love about it is the smell. It smells like coconuts. However, I would not buy this again for cleaning my hair. I will finish the bottle but after that, no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it with [[ASIN:B007RTR9E2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]] . The conditioner works well but not the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This has been great for the family members whose hair tends to be very dry.  The packaging leaves a little to be desired since the top popped off during shipping, but it was tight in plastic bag so no product lost.  Otherwise, smells nice &amp; clean, not overpowering, washes well and leaves hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used the \\&quot;total care\\&quot; from Clear and LOVED it. Made my hair silky, manageable and smooth. Did not leave my hair greasy or flaky. I love the total care and will go back to it. Love it better than professional lines that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Now to talk about Shea Cleanse. I love the smell, I feel like I am on a tropical holiday (reminds me of tanning lotion). It seems as though it will work as well as the total care. But I only got the shampoo and using Pantene conditioner with it. I feel as though I have gone back to my old products by using this combo (the flaky scalp came back). I would hate to rate it low, because the trust I gained by using Total Care makes me feel as if the Ultra Shea could be as good if I used the conditioner along with it. I find is that the \\&quot;gold\\&quot; bottles are hard to find at stores. Because of Vine sometimes releasing products to us sooner, this may change as retailers carry more of the line. I am only saying this because I used the 2 different products together. The outcome might (and probably would have) been better if I had both the shampoo and conditioner. I have found the Total care, but no gold bottles. So that alone, and my overall satisifaction with the total care makes me want to stick with it. I totally recommend this line. Espcially since I have long thick hair. I think It all depends on your hair style. Oh, and the price is great too!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good scent&lt;br /&gt;- Rich texture&lt;br /&gt;- Easily foam-able&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- After a month or two I&#x27;ve started noticing some odd smell in my bathroom, I think this shampoo does not age well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t say that my hair felt different comparing to other hair products, but then again that&#x27;s very rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Nice product as a refresher, but you&#x27;ll probably won&#x27;t stick with it.</li>
            <li> I recieved a sample in the mail and I wasnt sure if it was a product for my hair type.My hair has thinned, scalp dry, hair brittle and color not lustrous but this all comes with hitting 50 as I am told. After one use-I could not be more surprised of the color depth, shine, feel and smell. Being a smoker also, the smell is still good on the 2nd day. I plan on changing to this product as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Unless you are African American, and look moisture in your hair daily, I wouldn&#x27;t use this because it basically punches your hair in the face with Moisture for the week. I would imagine on naturally oily hair it would make your hair feel gross and maybe sticky, but on my hair it makes it soft and gives it just the perfect amount of moisture I need to get through the week :) (African American/Dominican relaxed hair). It&#x27;s SHEA butter, so before complaining about how it leaves your hair feeling greasy..maybe you should do some research on your hair type and Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> We do love this product. However, when I got it. The packaging on the inside was a mess, the shampoo came open.</li>
            <li> I have a lifelong battle with sensitive scalp and I have tried so many shampoo just to find one that does not irritate my scalp. I realized that even some salon products are sometimes irritating. Some organic/natural products are not irritating then it will not be strong enough to remove oil enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this shampoo and it really works. It is a perfect balance between not being too harsh and being effective in removing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase for sure!</li>
            <li> I am a recovering breast cancer patient and this is recommended by the ACA, so am giving it a try; however, I am having a problem with my scalp breaking out with little watery &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; occasionally, so am alternating this with another &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; shampoo, which seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with hair issues for some time.  I first discovered this product in my favorite &amp;#34;big box store&amp;#34; but they stopped carrying it.  Of course I checked my favorite online store and without fail, Amazon had it!!!  This product makes my problem hair grow.  After using, my hair is soft and hydrated. I pair with the conditioner.  I will never stop using this shampoo/conditioner.  I just hope Amazon continues to carry it.</li>
            <li> I tried this Shea shampoo because I was looking for help with an ongoing irritation on my scalp. Tried other shampoos for sensitive scalp and got negative results.  One use of this made a vast improvement.  The problem I ran into was getting more. None of the markets in my area carry this item. They all carry the other CLEAR products. Why not the ULTRA SHEA?  I found it on line at TARGET and will see if they have in one closest to me next week.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin, dirty blond hair. Normal &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner combinations leave my hair greasy and gross but my hair will still feel dry and in despite need of help. After I found this shampoo/conditioner, I have never used anything else. Moisturizes without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy. My hair is soft to touch and feels healthy. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t give me any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also has a light shea butter smell to it but not over powering. Very nice.</li>
            <li> This has been my fave shampoo for about a year. Now it&#x27;s hard to find and I had ran out. Love it. So moisturizing for my dry pregnancy hair! It lathers like no other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! Love it! I have thick curly wave hair and this helps tame it.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely nice shampoo.  It has a nice blend of ingredients such as shea butter sunflower, coconut and almond, to list a few.  These ingredients promote a great clean feeling and a nice refreshing smell once the product is washed out of one&#x27;s hair.  I also felt like my hair was lighter after using this product.  I did accompany this shampoo with its counterpart;[[ASIN:B007RTR9E2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]]  I usually do not use a shampoo and conditioner set, but the results were very nice.  And for what it is worth a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am a user of inexpensive shampoos thinking they do as well as the more expensive brands.  After trying two types of this CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY shampoos I have to change my thoughts.  Both these shampoos leave my hair feeling soft and silkier and cleaner than the the cheaper brands.  I find myself running my fingers through my hair because it&#x27;s so soft and silky.  It has a light pleasant scent. It did not leak in transit and I like the fact that it opens at the top and the conditioner opens at the bottom, so when I&#x27;m in the shower and without my glasses I know which one is which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for a luxurious, soft feeling!</li>
            <li> I stopped using WEN and started using this product because when made my hair too soft and weak. This product cleanses just as good as WEN and gives my hair back its strength. I still use my WEN deep conditioner twice a week. I prefer the golden Shea type over the other purple-ish &#x27;Clear&#x27; shampoos but only available online, not in stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> My hair tangles very easily even when it&#x27;s shorter.  This shampoo &amp; the conditioner makes my scalp feel clean and my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Shampoo that was cheap but didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I love Aveda products, but they are so costly. This has a professional shampoo feel, but the price tag is right. I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> Last year I was transitioning from relaxed hair to natural. I was having a hard time with doing my hair because of the mixed textures.  I saw that Clear scalp had a shea brand so I ran out to get it. Well they had the conditioners and other stuff bit NO SHAMPOO! I was baffled. So I had to buy it from Amazon and I&#x27;m glad I did. It really moisturized my hair. Now it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Clear scalp is the best shampoo I have used in years. I love the idea that it has the vitamin E and Shea butter in it and  infuse the hair with moisturizer and clean the the skill as it moisturizes and clean the hair at the end of the day. This product is good, I like I&#x27;m going to buy some more of this product and keep it on  my self as I run out. The price is just right.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo, I was really surprised how my hair felt when I rinsed it out.  It rinsed out really clean, unlike the Aussie I had been using for two weeks, which leaves a coating on my hair.  I think the [[ASIN:B007RTR9FQ CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] makes a good clarifying shampoo.  Also, my hair did look better the first few times I used it.  (I wash my hair every night.)  But then, the shampoo seemed little different than the others I used, and my hair didn&#x27;t look any different.  Thus, I just started alternating it with my other shampoos--[[ASIN:B001F51PWG Aussie Moist Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]] and [[ASIN:B005GQ6GLK Garnier Shampoo Daily Care, 13 Fluid Ounce]].  Unlike those two, the Clear Scalp does have a slight perfume smell, but it&#x27;s not a strong scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  Good for those of us hyper-sensitive to perfume scents.</li>
            <li> My daughter is prone to dry hair. She has long, curly, super thick hair that tends to get flyaways and frizzes easily.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s been using this shampoo with the matching conditioner for the last week, following the instructions on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Her hair has been very shiny, and her scalp isn&#x27;t itching like it tends to do usually just following shampooing. She&#x27;s just thrilled with the shampoo and conditioner, she likes the scent and the shape of the bottles.</li>
            <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse &amp; Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce. Shipping was okay. I love the smell. Price is similar to what they have in stores.  I would recommend this product. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo to be okay but not anything I would buy again without some improvement. It had a nice lather to it and washed out of my hair easily, leaving it feeling clean but not squeaky. What I really didn&#x27;t like about it was the smell. To me the odor was similar to play-doh, which is not a pleasant scent in my book. It would need to be unscented or lightly scented with a more tenable smell before I would use it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good, lathers nicely, and rinses well with no residue, BUT it left my hair feeling like straw and almost crunchy. This was immediately after rinsing it out of my hair, before applying conditioner. My hair felt so raw and rough. I did not like it at all. Heaps of conditioner were needed for it to feel smooth again. It was still hard to detangle even after the conditioner and I always comb my hair while in the shower with conditioner in it too. It may work well for someone out there, but definitely not me.</li>
            <li> After use, my hair was clean, soft, and very manageable.  Even on the second day, my hair still looked great.  But I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the fragrance, while pleasant, is a bit strong and persistent to me. If you like a lasting and smellable fragrance, then I would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I mean I was really excited to use this. I don&#x27;t actually wash my hair myself-i&#x27;m no good at it. So I took both the shampoo and the [[ASIN:B007RTR9E2 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]]to my salon and I really felt the difference. I mean it&#x27;s pretty refreshing. and the end result was really nice, after drying and styling she commented on how nice and healthy my hair was. My stylist has been doing my hair since I was really young and she&#x27;s never said that before. I generally owe it to her but I think I have this to thank for that as well. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more results from this in the future like if it helps reduce breakage like it says - I hope so. And being that I recently had a cut I&#x27;m looking forward to see how long it&#x27;s going to grow.</li>
            <li> Very creamy.  Lathers well.</li>
            <li> The product shipped very quickly, individually bagged, no spills and I love the product itself so I would buy again</li>
            <li> As African American (Jamaican) it just seems like there&#x27;s no product out there for my texture hair. Anyway after using Pantene for the past 5 years or so I saw the commercial on TV the other day for this product and decided to try it. It&#x27;s been really good so far- better than Pantene. My hair feels more clean and moisturized after using and have definitely seen less breakage. I bought the entire set.</li>
            <li> Familiar with this product. I really like it because it works great for my 4a/b hair texture. It leaves my hair soft and silky, the slip is great and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Little or no tangles and it smells great and not over whelming... Works well with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have dry, fine, slightly wavy, shoulder length hair.  It can tend to get a little bit fly-away if I don&#x27;t use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  This shampoo is working just fine for me, and at around five bucks, it&#x27;s a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the shampoo took a little getting used to.  It&#x27;s creamy and thick, almost lotion-y.  It does lather up nicely, but it&#x27;s a denser lather most shampoos.  From the feel, I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t clean as well, but it does a good job.  My hair comes out clean, soft, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice a bit of residue with this shampoo, but that&#x27;s pretty common with moisturizing shampoos.  I use a clarifying shampoo (like Neutrogena) a few times a month to remove residue.</li>
            <li> I have salt and pepper middle aged hair, and it always feels a little stiff. Also, my scalp tends to crack and bleed if I wash my hair as often as I think it needs. This shampoo made a big difference. My hair is much softer, and even better, my scalp isn&#x27;t as prone to cracking. I like the smell very much, although if you don&#x27;t like coconut and vanilla, that may be an issue for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback to it is that it takes a lot of time to rinse out thoroughly. It also doesn&#x27;t rinse well with cool water. This means I have to take longer showers, which I do find to be a noticeable drawback. Still, on the whole, I like it and will most likely continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with this shampoo in terms of helping relieve my dry scalp and hair. Anyone with this problem knows full well how frustrating it can be--and if your like me you&#x27;ve most likely tried a lot of different shampoos which claim to help only to be disappointed. This shampoo has such a luxurious feel to it and I love the scent of Shea butter (I note some others don&#x27;t agree). I use this shampoo 2 to 3 times a week and have truly noted my hair appears a lot less dry and brittle--more importantly others have as well. This comes at the expense of less body though which is the only reason I don&#x27;t use it every day. This may be an issue (only) for those with thin, fine hair like mine. The good news is this it&#x27;s a shampoo you need to use daily to get good results. I will defiantly be getting another bottle when this runs out.</li>
