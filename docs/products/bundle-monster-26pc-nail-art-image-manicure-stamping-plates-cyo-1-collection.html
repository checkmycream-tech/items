            <li>Great purchase!</li>
            <li>I am very happy I stumbled upon it.</li>
            <li>Use acetone for best results.</li>
            <li>They are etched well &amp; the images are superb</li>
            <li>Best purchase ever!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful designs, but hit or miss on the engraving/etching/</li>
            <li>Always packed well, and always awesome images.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>Otherwise the images stamp flawlessly and I haven&#x27;t had an issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess if you know you&#x27;re distributing inferior products, the best way to maximize profits is to disallow your consumers time to determine if the product works!</li>
            <li>Using a thicker polish and a marshmallow stamper works best.</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Not the best quality etching.  </li>

            <li>Lovethe stamp is easy to use</li>
            <li>I find going easy on the scraping help picks up the image.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their collection or looking for a good starter set.  </li>
            <li>Images are nice and crisp.</li>
            <li>This mostly pertains to the full nail images.</li>
            <li>I wont be able to use the largest ones and get the full effect.</li>
            <li>These are super cute.</li>

            <li>I am overall very satisfied, thank you!</li>
            <li>huge expenditure of time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of all the Bundle Monster stamping plates and this set did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Well etched, transfer precisely, every intricate detail shows up.</li>
            <li>I am by no means an expert on stamping, and as I said I use a cheap stamper - but I have had almost zero issues with using these.</li>
            <li>I tested them all on paper with a cheap nail polish and a credit card.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy stamping with these.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great stamp set</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how well the images show up, and so detailed.</li>
            <li>but this collection has such a great variety that I went ahead and bought it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK if some polish is left on top and it wasn&#x27;t all scraped off because it actually isnt picked up by the stamp which i was happy to find!</li>
            <li>Thank You sooo much !!!</li>
            <li>They stamp work very well!!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and very versatile.</li>
            <li>Many more new images that have not been seen before.</li>
            <li>These are so much fun, and super cute.</li>
            <li>These are top quality and work exactly as they should.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for my English. :p</li>
            <li>So much fun!</li>
            <li>The images are really unique, and I feel like I didn&#x27;t just get one plate I like.</li>
            <li>So fun!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get these and see the detail and variety of the designs.</li>
            <li>Then, I find that I have to paint it, scrape it, and clean it with acetone again.</li>
            <li>It comes with many different designs and all of them are great!&lt;br /&gt;Functionally wise not so much!</li>
            <li>Some designs aren&#x27;t etched quite right, but it&#x27;ll be easy to fix on the stamper.</li>
            <li>is that they didn&#x27;t fit on my nail, but other than that theybare great</li>
            <li>Even the most delicate images printed beautifully.  </li>
            <li>but most were of a normal size and will be very useful</li>
            <li>These are some of my favorite plates.&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive super fast.</li>
            <li>Like the other plates, these also have the paper on the back to prevent you from cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain, great job! :)</li>
            <li>The best ones arent deep enough some worked</li>
            <li>I love these stamps so much designs to choose from worth the money</li>
            <li>so many cute designs and such a variety too!</li>
            <li>These are super easy to use and they look really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clear and easy to stamp!</li>
            <li>these are the first plates i&#x27;ve ever tried and for the most part i really like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been successful with other Bundle Monster sets but this one is a dud.</li>
            <li>I am very please and will purchase from them again!!</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>This is a good set for people who are just starting on stamping and wants variety.</li>
            <li>there are lots of fun designs</li>
            <li>I rarely complain on Amazon</li>
            <li>Be aware though, the \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; sized patterns are ~1.6cm at the tallest...</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m kind of just starting out on this nail stamping thing.</li>
            <li>and I am having so much fun with these manicure plates</li>
            <li>like most of the designs, but still wish for something a little more original and not so girly?&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>so many different designs to have fun with!</li>
            <li>love the designs they look awesome but some of them with fine lines are a little hard to get</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t blame the plates right off.</li>
            <li>I tried everything, using pure acetone, buying the special stamping polish, buffing or kneading the stamper.  </li>
            <li>I did the octopus on the first plate last night and thought I might have similar issues since there&#x27;s so much polish on him, but he came out perfect the first</li>
            <li>Okay first off I loved the images that are listed for the product but when I got them there wasn&#x27;t a single image that was the same that was listed.</li>
            <li>The first time you use a plate, clean it really well.</li>
            <li>Otherwise,  that first stamp never works right.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love having multiple choices when it comes to fun nail designs.</li>
            <li>Most the good ones have a thin card board paper thing on the bottom</li>
            <li>designs are cute and so far have stamped really well.</li>
            <li>I feel these plates would have great potential if they were just manufactured properly.  </li>
            <li>stamp designs are clear and easy to transfer once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>I quickly stamp and transfer without much problem.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend them to any nail art enthusiast !</li>
            <li>but then I figured out there was a blue film on top</li>
            <li>I proceeded to test my favorite images the same evening.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these despite my hesitation after reading a lot of mixed reviews and I&#x27;m really glad that I did.</li>
            <li>so would only be able to use on say</li>
            <li>The items were exactly as described but they don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>this is my first plate set</li>
            <li>&amp; i scratched up the first couple of them when i first used them</li>
            <li>i got this set because of the first plate in the picture.</li>
            <li>Make sure the blue protective coating has been removed!&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>I really look forward to using all of these plates!</li>
            <li>and I often have to do each nail several times to get them looking ok.  </li>
            <li>However I do love the designs so that gives them an extra star from me.</li>
            <li>My first ever set anf</li>
            <li>This is the first set I got after my sister introduced me to nail stamping.</li>
            <li>I definitely need more practice - a couple ended up looking like a Dr. Seuss book.</li>
            <li>I tried 10 different bottles of the most pigmented polish I have (I have over 200 bottles).</li>
            <li>so I tried so many different ways and guess what....</li>
            <li>Since all the designs are clearly visible in the product photos, I will spare you the florid paragraphs I want to write praising the beauty of the motifs, (just this sentence: the designs are, for the most part, really cute/pretty/clever, and this definitely seemed to be the set of motifs best-suited to me of all those available.)</li>
            <li>The best I got was a partial image on a firm stamper from one image out of 6 on a plate.</li>
            <li>It would be better to use these with acrylic paint or cheaper polishes for the stamping rather than wasting your good quality or expensive \\&quot;special\\&quot; stamping polishes.  </li>
            <li>The designs are super cute, and etched deeply enough to put on clear.</li>
            <li>:/ loved the designs though.</li>
            <li>And as always with stamping plates if you&#x27;re new, make sure to peel off the blue plastic first, because otherwise nothing will work.</li>
            <li>The images are plenty large to make the stamping easier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve g otten a few sets of plates from bundle monster, but these are my favorite!  </li>
            <li>- that was my main reason for buying these!</li>
            <li>You really just need to practice a clean quick angle scrap, and quick firm pressure picking up the design.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, fast shipping as described.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had any problems with these plates</li>
            <li>but i had to carve out the designs and the ones i really wanted( anchor,dream catcher, and bird in the cage)</li>
            <li>it is extremely rare, and nearly unheard of for the number of plates you reported to be defective.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I really do like this set.</li>
            <li>I really like a lot of the designs on these stamps.  </li>
            <li>so my plates won&#x27;t be scratched from the metal scrapers, and haven&#x27;t had much trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I worked fast</li>
            <li>so if your nails are longer than that you have to start getting creative about partial nail stamps or somehow repeating the stamped image on the nail.</li>
            <li>but so far I have about a 50/50 success rate using these.  </li>
            <li>I really recommended.</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me pay for a piece of garbage Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li>You have to do them many times to get a full image and that is just a waste of nail polish!</li>
            <li>They are deep and give a super crisp image every time.</li>
            <li>Not sure why everyone says the engravings are too shallow, mine seem to be fine and show up wonderfully, I just had to get a new stamper</li>
            <li>Then why do so many other stamping aficionados have identical issues with identical plates?</li>
            <li>Such a unique collection of designs.</li>
            <li>Some of the designs are ok, but many of them are simply too small and don&#x27;t cover the nail like it should.</li>
            <li>And I was so excited to finally try nail stamping</li>
            <li>I really like this new set!</li>
            <li>Only thing is that you&#x27;ve got to clean them after use, or else nail polish will get stuck in the the patterns.</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast in the mail, and it was even a day earlier</li>
            <li>I was afraid the quality wasn&#x27;t going to be good, but these images stamp more clearly than my name brand ones.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with one not being etched in all the way and contacted the seller and they fixed my problem in a very timly manner!</li>
            <li>My daughter is completely in love with the set, and does anyone&#x27;s nails she can get to sit down.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great set otherwise, aside from the few images that are harder to stamp.</li>
            <li>Many of the plates are not not etched deep enough to allow for the patter to transfer.</li>
            <li>The plates aren&#x27;t etched deep enough, so you won&#x27;t be able to pick up a design.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had trouble with the following images, but always managed to get them on by pushing more polish back on after I scraped and then scraping very lightly and stamping.</li>
            <li>This is only my second set of plates - the first being a really cheap set just to try stamping, that included the stamper I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for these, the images are lightly etched into the plates making it impossible to successfully pick up the images.</li>
            <li>and I do highly recommend these stamping plates.  </li>
            <li>The plates can be a little tricky to use, but the more you use them the easier it is to figure it out.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>I love the variety within this set, even if there are a few images I probably won&#x27;t use for myself.</li>
            <li>I put it out to the stamping community to trouble shoot and within an hour I had 4 more tales of woe about this set of plates.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for bundle monster&#x27;s next plates and fun images to come out.</li>
            <li>plates are high quality and very professional looking.</li>
            <li>so i feel some more negative reviews could have been because of many other factors like drying time, the type of polish, how you scrape the plates, etc.</li>
            <li>Right out of the package I started using these and tried with multiple brands and couldn&#x27;t get them to work.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking at getting new plates.</li>
            <li>I live all the designs and can&#x27;t wait to use them all.</li>
            <li>I am new to stamping and know that practice helps immensely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I needed a new stamper so waited till I had money and purchased one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to stamping</li>
            <li>I suggest using a highly pigmented polish as well-Konad makes polishes specifically for stamping, but Sally Hansen Insta Dry work pretty well too, as well as any chrome polish.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Stamping!</li>
            <li>I owned two sets of BM&#x27;s stamping plates and based on the high ratings I decided to complete my collection with 2013 and 2014 series.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast, only 5 days!  </li>
            <li>, I went through the set and tested about half of the plates - specifically my favorites and they were all fine.</li>
            <li>Some designs will just not come complete!</li>
            <li>I use a squishy stamper and normal polishes, and I haven&#x27;t run into any problems so far.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is that the full nail designs do not cover my entire thumb.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good except u have to do it fast or it will dry and can get a little bit messy</li>
            <li>i do suggest do in your research before buying just any stamping materials also technique can totally make a difference with certain designs</li>
            <li>I do find an image here and there that can be fussy, but I clean it really well with acetone and a q-tip, which usually fixes it.</li>
            <li>However, when I went to use the plates, I had a hard time transferring the images on many of the plates - including the dreamcatcher.</li>
            <li>The images are clear and I have no problem getting the designs to transfer correctly.  </li>
            <li>do have to say that the B day cake plate is really the only one I have issues with.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I use an old gift card to scrape then</li>
            <li>So good service but lousy quality control.</li>
            <li>and I love them, the designs are big enough for my long nails, I&#x27;m always running into images that are too short for me.</li>
            <li>, my major complaint is that the full nail patterns are just not big enough to fit on my thumb nail.</li>
            <li>can only highly recommend this image plate set .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve contacted the seller various times to only be ignored which made me a very dissatisfied customer.</li>
            <li>but they aren&#x27;t etched deep enough so they don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>my other gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to ANYONE who enjoys nail stamping or nail art in general.</li>
            <li>im surprised that some people have mixed reviews about bundle monster because they DO work</li>
            <li>It took a few tries to get the technique down, and I use a credit card instead of the scraper that came with it, but the results are fantastic!!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing would work!!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, at my wits end i decided to try some plates from the other set i ordered and it worked perfectly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Monster is a good one but the other brand was way thin and the images were not deep enough to even get it to work.</li>
            <li>only con I had so far was that some of the designs are so big and opened spaced</li>
            <li>The plates were also a little banged up as many reviewers have said, but none of them were scratched after removing the blue film - so that was not really a huge problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is obsessed with decorating her nails and really wanted something unique</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to do this with MoYou, Pueen, Messy Mansion, MyOnlineShop or Fab Ur Nails plates because they work for me first time, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they come in a zip top plastic bag instead of the little snap close albums Pueen sets usually include..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just sort of disappointed that there are negative reviews which make people hesitant to buy this product because these were the first plates i ever used and the first time i stamped and i had a lot of fun and success with them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never done nail stamping before and it took me a few tries before I figured out just how quickly you have to transfer the polish off the plate and onto your nail, but after that it was a breeze.</li>

            <li> Great quality!</li>
            <li> Great purchase!</li>

            <li> Best purchase ever!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful designs, but hit or miss on the engraving/etching/</li>
            <li> Always packed well, and always awesome images.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> Otherwise the images stamp flawlessly and I haven&#x27;t had an issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess if you know you&#x27;re distributing inferior products, the best way to maximize profits is to disallow your consumers time to determine if the product works!</li>
            <li> Using a thicker polish and a marshmallow stamper works best.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Not the best quality etching.  </li>

            <li> The plates are really nice, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> and it is AMAZING</li>
            <li> I love all the uniqueness of these plates Created By You, They stamp great and the price is fabulous!</li>
            <li> For really stubborn images, a marshmallow stamper has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> These in my opinion, are as good quality as Konad and Cheeky brand plates, and priced way better.</li>
            <li> A nice set and the images transfer well to nails.</li>
            <li> I really, really liked the dreamcatcher image and was looking forward to using it.  </li>

            <li> I bought this SUPER excited to use some of the awesome designs featured in this set (especially with all the great reviews about it)</li>
            <li> and so I have recommended the kit to many people.</li>
            <li> But now I just need to get a better stamper to use them</li>
            <li> These plates are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love that the BM plates have more than just 4 designs to a plate.</li>
            <li> They make sure to take up ALL the space on there, giving you the most for your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plates are sooo much better in person than looking online.</li>
            <li> i love bundle monster.</li>

            <li> Make sure you have cleaned the plates well.  </li>
            <li> what have you onto the plates - most of these you can&#x27;t get a design to come off (and of course, it&#x27;s the ones</li>
            <li> Would probably be much better for kids.</li>

            <li> Most manufacturers of stamping plates do not impose a time limit on their returns.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to get a pigmented stamp...</li>
            <li> They are adorable...</li>
            <li> These are really interesting stamps</li>

            <li> I love the designs in this set.</li>
            <li> Love the variety and ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> and i believe that it&#x27;s more me and the polish i was using rather than the plates.</li>
            <li> The butterfly wings are so cute stamped.</li>
            <li> but if you try more that one time.</li>
            <li> , it offers so many great images to create really nice manicures.  </li>

            <li> There are some nice unique images in this collection.</li>
            <li> Another Bundle Monster set has not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> So much fun!!</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t buy cheap brands on the design disks.  </li>
            <li> These plates have worked great so far.</li>
            <li> Awesome designs, produce crisp, clear images.  </li>
            <li> My first set of stamping plates and will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The plates contain a lot of fun designs, come at a great price and the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> : I was relieved to find these nail stamping plates were as easy as Pueen brand plates to use.</li>
            <li> Lovethe stamp is easy to use</li>
            <li> I find going easy on the scraping help picks up the image.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their collection or looking for a good starter set.  </li>
            <li> Images are nice and crisp.</li>
            <li> This mostly pertains to the full nail images.</li>
            <li> I wont be able to use the largest ones and get the full effect.</li>
            <li> These are super cute.</li>
            <li> Good plates, the etching is very clear.</li>
            <li> Overall I was very pleased with fast delivery, quality and design as well as the great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I am overall very satisfied, thank you!</li>
            <li> huge expenditure of time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of all the Bundle Monster stamping plates and this set did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> Well etched, transfer precisely, every intricate detail shows up.</li>
            <li> I am by no means an expert on stamping, and as I said I use a cheap stamper - but I have had almost zero issues with using these.</li>
            <li> I tested them all on paper with a cheap nail polish and a credit card.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy stamping with these.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great stamp set</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well the images show up, and so detailed.</li>
            <li> but this collection has such a great variety that I went ahead and bought it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK if some polish is left on top and it wasn&#x27;t all scraped off because it actually isnt picked up by the stamp which i was happy to find!</li>
            <li> Thank You sooo much !!!</li>
            <li> They stamp work very well!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and very versatile.</li>
            <li> Many more new images that have not been seen before.</li>
            <li> These are so much fun, and super cute.</li>
            <li> These are top quality and work exactly as they should.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Sorry for my English. :p</li>
            <li> So much fun!</li>
            <li> The images are really unique, and I feel like I didn&#x27;t just get one plate I like.</li>
            <li> So fun!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these and see the detail and variety of the designs.</li>
            <li> Then, I find that I have to paint it, scrape it, and clean it with acetone again.</li>
            <li> It comes with many different designs and all of them are great!&lt;br /&gt;Functionally wise not so much!</li>
            <li> Some designs aren&#x27;t etched quite right, but it&#x27;ll be easy to fix on the stamper.</li>
            <li> is that they didn&#x27;t fit on my nail, but other than that theybare great</li>
            <li> Even the most delicate images printed beautifully.  </li>
            <li> but most were of a normal size and will be very useful</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite plates.&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive super fast.</li>
            <li> Like the other plates, these also have the paper on the back to prevent you from cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain, great job! :)</li>
            <li> The best ones arent deep enough some worked</li>
            <li> I love these stamps so much designs to choose from worth the money</li>
            <li> so many cute designs and such a variety too!</li>
            <li> These are super easy to use and they look really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clear and easy to stamp!</li>
            <li> these are the first plates i&#x27;ve ever tried and for the most part i really like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been successful with other Bundle Monster sets but this one is a dud.</li>
            <li> I am very please and will purchase from them again!!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> This is a good set for people who are just starting on stamping and wants variety.</li>
            <li> there are lots of fun designs</li>
            <li> I rarely complain on Amazon</li>
            <li> Be aware though, the \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; sized patterns are ~1.6cm at the tallest...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m kind of just starting out on this nail stamping thing.</li>
            <li> and I am having so much fun with these manicure plates</li>
            <li> like most of the designs, but still wish for something a little more original and not so girly?&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> so many different designs to have fun with!</li>
            <li> love the designs they look awesome but some of them with fine lines are a little hard to get</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t blame the plates right off.</li>
            <li> I tried everything, using pure acetone, buying the special stamping polish, buffing or kneading the stamper.  </li>
            <li> I did the octopus on the first plate last night and thought I might have similar issues since there&#x27;s so much polish on him, but he came out perfect the first</li>
            <li> Okay first off I loved the images that are listed for the product but when I got them there wasn&#x27;t a single image that was the same that was listed.</li>
            <li> The first time you use a plate, clean it really well.</li>
            <li> Otherwise,  that first stamp never works right.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love having multiple choices when it comes to fun nail designs.</li>
            <li> Most the good ones have a thin card board paper thing on the bottom</li>
            <li> designs are cute and so far have stamped really well.</li>
            <li> I feel these plates would have great potential if they were just manufactured properly.  </li>
            <li> stamp designs are clear and easy to transfer once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> I quickly stamp and transfer without much problem.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend them to any nail art enthusiast !</li>
            <li> but then I figured out there was a blue film on top</li>
            <li> I proceeded to test my favorite images the same evening.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these despite my hesitation after reading a lot of mixed reviews and I&#x27;m really glad that I did.</li>
            <li> so would only be able to use on say</li>
            <li> The items were exactly as described but they don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> this is my first plate set</li>
            <li> &amp; i scratched up the first couple of them when i first used them</li>
            <li> i got this set because of the first plate in the picture.</li>
            <li> Make sure the blue protective coating has been removed!&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> I really look forward to using all of these plates!</li>
            <li> and I often have to do each nail several times to get them looking ok.  </li>
            <li> However I do love the designs so that gives them an extra star from me.</li>
            <li> My first ever set anf</li>
            <li> This is the first set I got after my sister introduced me to nail stamping.</li>
            <li> I definitely need more practice - a couple ended up looking like a Dr. Seuss book.</li>
            <li> I tried 10 different bottles of the most pigmented polish I have (I have over 200 bottles).</li>
            <li> so I tried so many different ways and guess what....</li>
            <li> Since all the designs are clearly visible in the product photos, I will spare you the florid paragraphs I want to write praising the beauty of the motifs, (just this sentence: the designs are, for the most part, really cute/pretty/clever, and this definitely seemed to be the set of motifs best-suited to me of all those available.)</li>
            <li> The best I got was a partial image on a firm stamper from one image out of 6 on a plate.</li>
            <li> It would be better to use these with acrylic paint or cheaper polishes for the stamping rather than wasting your good quality or expensive \\&quot;special\\&quot; stamping polishes.  </li>
            <li> The designs are super cute, and etched deeply enough to put on clear.</li>
            <li> :/ loved the designs though.</li>
            <li> And as always with stamping plates if you&#x27;re new, make sure to peel off the blue plastic first, because otherwise nothing will work.</li>
            <li> The images are plenty large to make the stamping easier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve g otten a few sets of plates from bundle monster, but these are my favorite!  </li>
            <li> - that was my main reason for buying these!</li>
            <li> You really just need to practice a clean quick angle scrap, and quick firm pressure picking up the design.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, fast shipping as described.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had any problems with these plates</li>
            <li> but i had to carve out the designs and the ones i really wanted( anchor,dream catcher, and bird in the cage)</li>
            <li> it is extremely rare, and nearly unheard of for the number of plates you reported to be defective.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> I really do like this set.</li>
            <li> I really like a lot of the designs on these stamps.  </li>
            <li> so my plates won&#x27;t be scratched from the metal scrapers, and haven&#x27;t had much trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I worked fast</li>
            <li> so if your nails are longer than that you have to start getting creative about partial nail stamps or somehow repeating the stamped image on the nail.</li>
            <li> but so far I have about a 50/50 success rate using these.  </li>
            <li> I really recommended.</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me pay for a piece of garbage Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li> You have to do them many times to get a full image and that is just a waste of nail polish!</li>
            <li> They are deep and give a super crisp image every time.</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone says the engravings are too shallow, mine seem to be fine and show up wonderfully, I just had to get a new stamper</li>
            <li> Then why do so many other stamping aficionados have identical issues with identical plates?</li>
            <li> Such a unique collection of designs.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs are ok, but many of them are simply too small and don&#x27;t cover the nail like it should.</li>
            <li> And I was so excited to finally try nail stamping</li>
            <li> I really like this new set!</li>
            <li> Only thing is that you&#x27;ve got to clean them after use, or else nail polish will get stuck in the the patterns.</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast in the mail, and it was even a day earlier</li>
            <li> I was afraid the quality wasn&#x27;t going to be good, but these images stamp more clearly than my name brand ones.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with one not being etched in all the way and contacted the seller and they fixed my problem in a very timly manner!</li>
            <li> My daughter is completely in love with the set, and does anyone&#x27;s nails she can get to sit down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great set otherwise, aside from the few images that are harder to stamp.</li>
            <li> Many of the plates are not not etched deep enough to allow for the patter to transfer.</li>
            <li> The plates aren&#x27;t etched deep enough, so you won&#x27;t be able to pick up a design.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had trouble with the following images, but always managed to get them on by pushing more polish back on after I scraped and then scraping very lightly and stamping.</li>
            <li> This is only my second set of plates - the first being a really cheap set just to try stamping, that included the stamper I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for these, the images are lightly etched into the plates making it impossible to successfully pick up the images.</li>
            <li> and I do highly recommend these stamping plates.  </li>
            <li> The plates can be a little tricky to use, but the more you use them the easier it is to figure it out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love the variety within this set, even if there are a few images I probably won&#x27;t use for myself.</li>
            <li> I put it out to the stamping community to trouble shoot and within an hour I had 4 more tales of woe about this set of plates.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for bundle monster&#x27;s next plates and fun images to come out.</li>
            <li> plates are high quality and very professional looking.</li>
            <li> so i feel some more negative reviews could have been because of many other factors like drying time, the type of polish, how you scrape the plates, etc.</li>
            <li> Right out of the package I started using these and tried with multiple brands and couldn&#x27;t get them to work.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking at getting new plates.</li>
            <li> I live all the designs and can&#x27;t wait to use them all.</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping and know that practice helps immensely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I needed a new stamper so waited till I had money and purchased one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to stamping</li>
            <li> I suggest using a highly pigmented polish as well-Konad makes polishes specifically for stamping, but Sally Hansen Insta Dry work pretty well too, as well as any chrome polish.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Stamping!</li>
            <li> I owned two sets of BM&#x27;s stamping plates and based on the high ratings I decided to complete my collection with 2013 and 2014 series.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast, only 5 days!  </li>
            <li> , I went through the set and tested about half of the plates - specifically my favorites and they were all fine.</li>
            <li> Some designs will just not come complete!</li>
            <li> I use a squishy stamper and normal polishes, and I haven&#x27;t run into any problems so far.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is that the full nail designs do not cover my entire thumb.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good except u have to do it fast or it will dry and can get a little bit messy</li>
            <li> i do suggest do in your research before buying just any stamping materials also technique can totally make a difference with certain designs</li>
            <li> I do find an image here and there that can be fussy, but I clean it really well with acetone and a q-tip, which usually fixes it.</li>
            <li> However, when I went to use the plates, I had a hard time transferring the images on many of the plates - including the dreamcatcher.</li>
            <li> The images are clear and I have no problem getting the designs to transfer correctly.  </li>
            <li> do have to say that the B day cake plate is really the only one I have issues with.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I use an old gift card to scrape then</li>
            <li> So good service but lousy quality control.</li>
            <li> and I love them, the designs are big enough for my long nails, I&#x27;m always running into images that are too short for me.</li>
            <li> , my major complaint is that the full nail patterns are just not big enough to fit on my thumb nail.</li>
            <li> can only highly recommend this image plate set .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve contacted the seller various times to only be ignored which made me a very dissatisfied customer.</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t etched deep enough so they don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> my other gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to ANYONE who enjoys nail stamping or nail art in general.</li>
            <li> im surprised that some people have mixed reviews about bundle monster because they DO work</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the technique down, and I use a credit card instead of the scraper that came with it, but the results are fantastic!!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing would work!!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, at my wits end i decided to try some plates from the other set i ordered and it worked perfectly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Monster is a good one but the other brand was way thin and the images were not deep enough to even get it to work.</li>
            <li> only con I had so far was that some of the designs are so big and opened spaced</li>
            <li> The plates were also a little banged up as many reviewers have said, but none of them were scratched after removing the blue film - so that was not really a huge problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is obsessed with decorating her nails and really wanted something unique</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to do this with MoYou, Pueen, Messy Mansion, MyOnlineShop or Fab Ur Nails plates because they work for me first time, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they come in a zip top plastic bag instead of the little snap close albums Pueen sets usually include..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sort of disappointed that there are negative reviews which make people hesitant to buy this product because these were the first plates i ever used and the first time i stamped and i had a lot of fun and success with them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done nail stamping before and it took me a few tries before I figured out just how quickly you have to transfer the polish off the plate and onto your nail, but after that it was a breeze.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little practice to get decent quality images that will transfer properly.</li>
            <li> eventually so I don&#x27;t think it was that bad, more of me scraping too hard the first time around since there&#x27;s so much polish.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used every plate yet, but I haven&#x27;t had the printing problems other users mentioned on any of the images I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> The only difficulty is finding a nail polish that&#x27;s thick enough to show up well on the first stamp.  </li>
            <li> You can try to use them, but they never really show up very well even with dark polish.</li>
            <li> These are fun and quirky, I recommend trying a few different stampers if you have trouble with any of the images.</li>
            <li> Consumers are NOT quality-control personnel - otherwise, we&#x27;d be getting paid for the time we spend testing every single image with different polishes and stampers, instead of paying for the privilege of essentially being told that we&#x27;re liars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it was disappointing to not have the smaller cute designs work.</li>
            <li> Super frustrating.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because some images are quite large and I have very small nails</li>
            <li> Some of the images were etched a little shallowly, but otherwise it was fantastic</li>
            <li> I saw other comments about the plates designs not being deep enough</li>
            <li> The larger designs were a bit tough to stamp intact, but I have a cheap round stamper</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected when starting out</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy this for so long...</li>
            <li> I see a few other reviews on here saying the plates aren&#x27;t etched well enough to stamp, but if that was ever the case, it has been fixed.  </li>
            <li> Some have minor issues with transfer, but very minor.</li>
            <li> I have used various other brands of nail stamping plates and never had one issue.</li>
            <li> I would have to agree that some of these are not the easiest to use because the plates are not as deeply etched as other brands.</li>
            <li> Those thin ones also dry so fast you have to try several times to get it before it dries out.</li>
            <li> Instead I got these lame little dorky prints that was like dinky little flowers a church had 2-3 plates that were for french tips which I specifically avoided the other ones because I didn&#x27;t want those kind.</li>
            <li> it was all neatly packaged, every single plate had its protective film over it, and so on.</li>
            <li> However when I got down to business and used this with my Konad stamper/scraper set and Konad white stamping polish</li>
            <li> I have used 12 different designs so far (less than 8% of the designs included, so it is a small sample,) and they have all transferred well.</li>
            <li> I have other BM sets that are great, not sure what happened with this one :(</li>
            <li> I have an image for every single occasion imaginable!</li>
            <li> There were a few that look kinda big</li>
            <li> they are really wide</li>
            <li> There are a wide variety of images.</li>
            <li> While their customer service has been cordial, I&#x27;m livid over the fact that buyers are apparently expected to test every image on every plate as soon as they are received in order to get help with faulty plates.</li>
            <li> stars for the fact that a few images don&#x27;t seem to be etched deeply enough.</li>
            <li> Just not very pleased...waste of money and polish.    </li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as I expected and it shipped within the specified time frame.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> And I understand sometimes people have a hard time or dont work quick enough or use the wrong polish.</li>
            <li> I have tried other plates that stamp less reliably, but those plates are not the big name stampers like konad or messy mansion.</li>
            <li> The one single issue I did have was with the birdcage on plate 407, and I did see that someone else made the same complaint.</li>
            <li> one star that I took off was due to shipping - they were &amp;#34;delivered&amp;#34; and never showed up, so I had to re-order after dealing with customer service.</li>
            <li> Usually I stick to buying individual plates</li>
            <li> In case anyone thinks it&#x27;s me, I have no issues with 10 other makers.</li>
            <li> I still have the other plates to try..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what problems the other people had, but I haven&#x27;t had problems with these plates.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it too! :(</li>
            <li> My stamping plate collection has become quite large so it is difficult to find a set that doesn&#x27;t repeat the designs I already have.  </li>
            <li> This is my third set of nail stamping plates and I have been using nail stamps for months now, these are not easy to work with, the designs are not deep enough and they are very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> There are alot of other variables that could mess up the process not just the plates</li>
            <li> Sometime it takes a few tries to pick up the complete image on the stamper depending on the image, how hard you scrape, and how hard you press the stamper to pick up the image.</li>
            <li> the previous edition.</li>
            <li> I wish they were etched deeper and maybe the lines slightly thicker -</li>
            <li> I fully cleaned before each attempt, I used a lot of pressure and less pressure.</li>
            <li> The plates were slightly thinner than Pueen&#x27;s</li>
            <li> it was a mess.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this set much rather</li>
            <li> I would have gave it 5 stars, but there are a few images that I can not get to stamp.</li>
            <li> I would suggest when you receive the set to check all the plates, stamp a few images and if you have an issue contact the seller.</li>
            <li> i have had a few miss happenings but</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this plates, don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used quite a few of the plates</li>
            <li> These were about 25% less expensive than similar Pueen sets</li>
            <li> 95% of the images cannot be stamped due to the poor quality during manufacturing.</li>
            <li> , I worked slow, I used a squishy stamper and a firm stamper, a flexible plastic scraper, a hard plastic scraper and a metal scraper.</li>
            <li> Annoying, but not enough for me to send them back since I can still get an image.&lt;br /&gt;Issues:</li>
            <li> At least I couldn&#x27;t get them to work.</li>
            <li> but I am super disappointed!</li>
            <li> Sometimes stamping plates can be too shallow and the images don&#x27;t transfer, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be an issue with these.  </li>
            <li> some of the designs are too shallow to work.</li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed with this being my first purchase.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was terrible because it smeared and didn&#x27;t pick up</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT JUST SUCKS!</li>
            <li> Waste of freaking money and these 5 star reviews are BS!!!</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it 4 stars but took one off because some are too thin to be functional.</li>
            <li> There were the absolute worst nail stamping plates I have ever used in my history of nail art!</li>
            <li> Thin nail polishes do not work well.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> The others are a thin tin with no backing.</li>
            <li> real hard to work with</li>
            <li> These plates are by far the worst plates I&#x27;ve worked with, they will not pick up the image at all!!</li>
            <li> By far the worst plates ever!</li>
            <li> These plates are way to expensive to be of such terrible quality!!!</li>
            <li> Sadly they are not engraved well.  </li>
            <li> I sent an e-mail to BMC (the seller) about how some of the plates I received were unable to produce stamps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry BM, not sure I&#x27;ll be buying again :(</li>
            <li> ; plates from my collection, my clients and I are sick and tired of crappy results with these plates</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price!</li>
            <li> it made me very sad when it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It may just be a bad design.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything bad about BM.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend this bundle :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed and will buy from elsewhere.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> But I am not an idiot</li>
            <li> Worst plates I have ever used whatever you do, do not purchase these!!!</li>
            <li> These plates are horribly etched and Bundle Monster requires you to inspect and test each and every image within 30 days</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line these plate were terrible for me, and I will not buy from bundle monster again!</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived on time, in pristine condition, and it comes with a carrying baggie. Very nice work. Using this product take practice but it work nicely!</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction, exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was terrible because it smeared and didn&#x27;t pick up but then I figured out there was a blue film on top and u have to take it off to use it. It works pretty good except u have to do it fast or it will dry and can get a little bit messy&lt;br /&gt;And sometimes it doesn&#x27;t pick up some of it. You shouldn&#x27;t use the knock offs or it kinda dries and doesn&#x27;t look so good.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the technique down, and I use a credit card instead of the scraper that came with it, but the results are fantastic!!  It is so quick and easy to get beautiful results!  My daughter is completely in love with the set, and does anyone&#x27;s nails she can get to sit down.  People notice my nails all the time and so I have recommended the kit to many people.</li>
            <li> Love them! But now I just need to get a better stamper to use them (:</li>
            <li> I was afraid the quality wasn&#x27;t going to be good, but these images stamp more clearly than my name brand ones. Some of the plates had scratches  under the protective cover, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a noticeable difference in the end result.</li>
            <li> Another Bundle Monster set has not disappointed!  I owned two sets of BM&#x27;s stamping plates and based on the high ratings I decided to complete my collection with 2013 and 2014 series.  The shipping was very fast, only 5 days!  I proceeded to test my favorite images the same evening.  The reviews are very accurate!  These plates are fantastic!  Well etched, transfer precisely, every intricate detail shows up. I very highly recommend them to any nail art enthusiast !</li>
            <li> I ordered these despite my hesitation after reading a lot of mixed reviews and I&#x27;m really glad that I did. These plates are really nice! This is only my second set of plates - the first being a really cheap set just to try stamping, that included the stamper I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work perfectly, I went through the set and tested about half of the plates - specifically my favorites and they were all fine. The one single issue I did have was with the birdcage on plate 407, and I did see that someone else made the same complaint. It may just be a bad design. I am by no means an expert on stamping, and as I said I use a cheap stamper - but I have had almost zero issues with using these. I tested them all on paper with a cheap nail polish and a credit card. These are super easy to use and they look really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one star that I took off was due to shipping - they were &amp;#34;delivered&amp;#34; and never showed up, so I had to re-order after dealing with customer service. The plates were also a little banged up as many reviewers have said, but none of them were scratched after removing the blue film - so that was not really a huge problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order plates from this company again. The plates are really nice, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These plates are by far the worst plates I&#x27;ve worked with, they will not pick up the image at all!! I&#x27;m going to have to remove all &amp;#34;BUNDLE MONSTER&amp;#34; plates from my collection, my clients and I are sick and tired of crappy results with these plates and then we have to scramble to come up with another design last minute.</li>
            <li> I love the variety within this set, even if there are a few images I probably won&#x27;t use for myself. Although I haven&#x27;t tried all of the plates (yet), the ones I have used have come out great (and I use cheap nail polish).</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SERVICE AS ALWAYS!!  AND REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL PLATES!&lt;br /&gt;CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BUNDLE MONSTER PLATES SET ALREADY!</li>
            <li> These work great! It took quite a bit of practice to get the hang of it, but now I&#x27;m stamping all the time!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, fast shipping as described.</li>
            <li> Great lots of designs for nail art stamping</li>
            <li> So I received these today and like always I&#x27;m. Over joyed with the patterns. There were a few that look kinda big so would only be able to use on say a thumb cause they are really wide but most were of a normal size and will be very useful</li>
            <li> So many designs and a great price. I will be buying another set as a gift for my nieces!</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it 4 stars but took one off because some are too thin to be functional. You can try to use them, but they never really show up very well even with dark polish. Those thin ones also dry so fast you have to try several times to get it before it dries out.</li>
            <li> Once again Bundle Monster hit it out of the park with this collection of nail plates.  Many more new images that have not been seen before. The images are plenty large to make the stamping easier.  I would recommend this to anyone looking at getting new plates.</li>
            <li> These are top quality and work exactly as they should. I use mine with the Konad nail art double ended stamper. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with these plates, even if I had some troubles with shipping, cause it didn&#x27;t arrive on the estimated date, but I contacted the Bundlemonster support, who tried to help me in anyway and who guaranteed for my refund if the order didn&#x27;t arrive in a week.&lt;br /&gt;These plates are great and they have a really good quality, every image stampes very good, even those with the smallest lines come out very well. Like the other plates, these also have the paper on the back to prevent you from cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain, great job! :)&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for my English. :p</li>
            <li> I love these plates! There are a wide variety of images. I love that the BM plates have more than just 4 designs to a plate. They make sure to take up ALL the space on there, giving you the most for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates are high quality and very professional looking. I would recommend these to ANYONE who enjoys nail stamping or nail art in general. Very easy to use and very versatile.</li>
            <li> Great, fun plate designs. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The items were exactly as described but they don&#x27;t work at all. At least I couldn&#x27;t get them to work. Right out of the package I started using these and tried with multiple brands and couldn&#x27;t get them to work. Also the coating on the tiles started peeling and bubbling under the design. I threw these away. I wouldn&#x27;t give them away or sell them to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic came faster than I expected. Only thing is I thought it came with the stamper. Had to order that separately. Quality was excellent product was fantastic exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Many of the plates are not not etched deep enough to allow for the patter to transfer.</li>
            <li> I love all the uniqueness of these plates Created By You, They stamp great and the price is fabulous! I wanted these over the holiday plates! Good Job!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy stamping with these. I would have gave it 5 stars, but there are a few images that I can not get to stamp. Overall this is a great stamp set and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> The plates didn&#x27;t work! So disappointed in this purchase. I was so excited to get it too! :( won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She is obsessed with decorating her nails and really wanted something unique and this fits that requirement. Great gift!</li>
            <li> I really like this new set! the plates are of excellent quality, no defects were find in any of these plates and the design are just awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a good set for people who are just starting on stamping and wants variety. The only thing I would say is that the full nail designs do not cover my entire thumb. I wear my nails short-medium btw</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these and will get tons of use out of them for a very long time, very good quality</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had any problems with these plates and I use them all the time. I do find an image here and there that can be fussy, but I clean it really well with acetone and a q-tip, which usually fixes it. The first time you use a plate, clean it really well. Then, I find that I have to paint it, scrape it, and clean it with acetone again. Otherwise,  that first stamp never works right. I don&#x27;t know why. For the price, I find these to be a good value. I have tried other plates that stamp less reliably, but those plates are not the big name stampers like konad or messy mansion. For really stubborn images, a marshmallow stamper has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> I saw other comments about the plates designs not being deep enough and I should have listened. The best ones arent deep enough some worked but i had to carve out the designs and the ones i really wanted( anchor,dream catcher, and bird in the cage) did not work at all I wouldnt recommend this bundle :(</li>
            <li> Loved the nail plates but some came scratched and that compromised the design.</li>
            <li> I loved a lot of the designs, so I bought this set. Almost three months later, I&#x27;ve gone through a complete set of replacement plates, plus two additional partial replacements. While their customer service has been cordial, I&#x27;m livid over the fact that buyers are apparently expected to test every image on every plate as soon as they are received in order to get help with faulty plates. I don&#x27;t have to do this with MoYou, Pueen, Messy Mansion, MyOnlineShop or Fab Ur Nails plates because they work for me first time, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also told that &amp;#34;Please note it is extremely rare, and nearly unheard of for the number of plates you reported to be defective.&amp;#34; Really? Then why do so many other stamping aficionados have identical issues with identical plates? Consumers are NOT quality-control personnel - otherwise, we&#x27;d be getting paid for the time we spend testing every single image with different polishes and stampers, instead of paying for the privilege of essentially being told that we&#x27;re liars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be spending my money with companies that have tighter controls on their manufacturing QC.</li>
            <li> Okay first off I loved the images that are listed for the product but when I got them there wasn&#x27;t a single image that was the same that was listed. Instead I got these lame little dorky prints that was like dinky little flowers a church had 2-3 plates that were for french tips which I specifically avoided the other ones because I didn&#x27;t want those kind. I&#x27;m really disappointed and will buy from elsewhere.</li>
            <li> These are REALLY great. I was so happy I ran across them, and decided to order. The only difficulty is finding a nail polish that&#x27;s thick enough to show up well on the first stamp.  I was amazed at how well the images show up, and so detailed.</li>
            <li> Just got these in the mail yesterday after ordering them on Monday. Super fast shipping. The plates are sooo much better in person than looking online. Some designs aren&#x27;t etched quite right, but it&#x27;ll be easy to fix on the stamper. I will plan on buying another Bundle Monster plate set soon!</li>
            <li> i love bundle monster. this is my first plate set &amp; i scratched up the first couple of them when i first used them but i learned and just love the images i get. these and gals plates are the best. only thing that keeps it a 4 out of 5 is the lack of marine life or animals. i got this set because of the first plate in the picture. i love octapi and wish there were more and squid as well. most plates print well even though im a naivies.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of images in the stamping kit. The plates are of good quality &amp; I enjoy being able to do my nails at home.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product. My first set of stamping plates and will be buying more! Easy to use and great designs!</li>
            <li> Design wise these stamp plates are great! It comes with many different designs and all of them are great!&lt;br /&gt;Functionally wise not so much! Some designs will just not come complete! You have to do them many times to get a full image and that is just a waste of nail polish!</li>
            <li> There were the absolute worst nail stamping plates I have ever used in my history of nail art! I have used various other brands of nail stamping plates and never had one issue. As for these, the images are lightly etched into the plates making it impossible to successfully pick up the images. since the designs are not etched deep enough the polish is scraped out with any scraping technique used! I&#x27;ve contacted the seller various times to only be ignored which made me a very dissatisfied customer. 95% of the images cannot be stamped due to the poor quality during manufacturing. Worst plates I have ever used whatever you do, do not purchase these!!! These plates are way to expensive to be of such terrible quality!!!</li>
            <li> Out of all of Bundle Monster&#x27;s collections, I think this one is the best. Such a unique collection of designs. Images are nice and crisp.</li>
            <li> So much fun! Lots of usable designs. Great quality! Great deal. Really pleased with this purchase! Easy to be creative with this package!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves your stamping plates! We have ordered almost ALL of your designs! We are VERY pleased with your product! Thank You sooo much !!! Happy New Year!!!</li>
            <li> Great purchase! I love the item and i am very pleased with the product. I am very happy I stumbled upon it.</li>
            <li> I really do like this set. The images are really unique, and I feel like I didn&#x27;t just get one plate I like. It arrived super fast in the mail, and it was even a day earlier then it said it would be. The plates can be a little tricky to use, but the more you use them the easier it is to figure it out. With the skyscrapers, even the tiny antenna came off. You really just need to practice a clean quick angle scrap, and quick firm pressure picking up the design.</li>
            <li> I love these stamping plates.  The plates contain a lot of fun designs, come at a great price and the shipping was fast.  These in my opinion, are as good quality as Konad and Cheeky brand plates, and priced way better. I see a few other reviews on here saying the plates aren&#x27;t etched well enough to stamp, but if that was ever the case, it has been fixed.  The plates I received all work great and I do highly recommend these stamping plates.  If you are having problems stamping I suggest the following solutions to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Make sure the blue protective coating has been removed!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Try using a thicker/nail stamping polish.  Thin nail polishes do not work well.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Make sure you have a good stamper, squishy is best.  If its not squishy then its not going to pick up that well.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Make sure you have cleaned the plates well.  Use acetone for best results.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!! So much fun!! I really look forward to using all of these plates! They are etched well &amp; the images are superb</li>
            <li> Love these plates one the best sets I have.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that the B day cake plate is really the only one I have issues with.</li>
            <li> I really like a lot of the designs on these stamps.  The individual stamps are bigger so they cover larger nails as well.  Sadly they are not engraved well.  This means they basically don&#x27;t work.  Not enough polish stays in the stamp and I often have to do each nail several times to get them looking ok.  I have other BM sets that are great, not sure what happened with this one :(</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife and she loves them.</li>
            <li> A nice set and the images transfer well to nails.</li>
            <li> Love all the great options. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love having multiple choices when it comes to fun nail designs. Very fast shipping and extremely happy with all the plates.</li>
            <li> Best purchase ever!! I have an image for every single occasion imaginable! There are some nice unique images in this collection. I would def recommend it for any stamp lover.</li>
            <li> I live all the designs and can&#x27;t wait to use them all.</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster stamps can be hit and miss for me. Some just don&#x27;t pick-up well while others are a piece of cake. However I do love the designs so that gives them an extra star from me. These are fun and quirky, I recommend trying a few different stampers if you have trouble with any of the images.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful designs, but hit or miss on the engraving/etching/what have you onto the plates - most of these you can&#x27;t get a design to come off (and of course, it&#x27;s the ones I was most excited about!!). Super frustrating. This is my 5th set of plates, second from Bundle Monster, so I&#x27;d like to think I know how to use them - and it just isn&#x27;t happening with these.</li>
            <li> Great selection... so many different designs to have fun with!</li>
            <li> Some of the designs are ok, but many of them are simply too small and don&#x27;t cover the nail like it should. Would probably be much better for kids.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this set much rather the previous edition. Delivery was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t buy cheap brands on the design disks.  Monster is a good one but the other brand was way thin and the images were not deep enough to even get it to work. Even my nail lady said to not buy those again.  Most the good ones have a thin card board paper thing on the bottom that&#x27;s the only way I can tell if they will work. The others are a thin tin with no backing. Don&#x27;t buy those</li>
            <li> My first ever set anf I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are cute and so far have stamped really well. I love the price on thus set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I had so far was that some of the designs are so big and opened spaced is that they didn&#x27;t fit on my nail, but other than that theybare great</li>
            <li> just purchaced this set and another set of bundle monster stamping plates!! very happy with these stamping plates and images are very well etched out to how your image tranferrs very nicely and clear!! images are super nice! love them!!</li>
            <li> LOVE these plates. They are deep and give a super crisp image every time. I would totally recommend them to stamping lovers. I was hesitant to get anything that wasn&#x27;t Konad but I was pleasantly surprised. Love the variety of images too.</li>
            <li> My stamping plate collection has become quite large so it is difficult to find a set that doesn&#x27;t repeat the designs I already have.  Usually I stick to buying individual plates so I don&#x27;t get repeats but this collection has such a great variety that I went ahead and bought it.  I&#x27;m really happy I did...there are lots of fun designs and I can tell I will get lots of use out of this set.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their collection or looking for a good starter set.  I am always happy with the quality of Bundlemonster plates.  The images are clear and I have no problem getting the designs to transfer correctly.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So fun! I love these stamps. They make painting nails so much fun!!!</li>
            <li> But the same thing.....&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything bad about BM. These are some of my favorite plates.&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive super fast. Always packed well, and always awesome images.&lt;br /&gt;Two more sets to go and I will have them all.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you BM</li>
            <li> These plates have worked great so far. I bought a Konad stamper to use with these, and I have tried stamping with both Konad stamping polish and &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; polish from drug stores and cosmetics shops. I have used 12 different designs so far (less than 8% of the designs included, so it is a small sample,) and they have all transferred well. The designs themselves are big enough to cover my thumb nail. Since all the designs are clearly visible in the product photos, I will spare you the florid paragraphs I want to write praising the beauty of the motifs, (just this sentence: the designs are, for the most part, really cute/pretty/clever, and this definitely seemed to be the set of motifs best-suited to me of all those available.)</li>
            <li> I love these plates! This is the first set I got after my sister introduced me to nail stamping. I&#x27;ve still yet to try all the designs (some just aren&#x27;t my style and I probably won&#x27;t ever wear them), but on the majority of the ones I&#x27;ve used I&#x27;ve had no problem. I use a credit card as a scraper so my plates won&#x27;t be scratched from the metal scrapers, and haven&#x27;t had much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for the fact that a few images don&#x27;t seem to be etched deeply enough. This mostly pertains to the full nail images. Otherwise the images stamp flawlessly and I haven&#x27;t had an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had trouble with the following images, but always managed to get them on by pushing more polish back on after I scraped and then scraping very lightly and stamping. Annoying, but not enough for me to send them back since I can still get an image.&lt;br /&gt;Issues: plate 406, the bottom branches. plate 419, the flowers-I couldn&#x27;t get that image to stamp at all. I might have had some issue with the paint drips on plate 405, but I know I got it on there eventually so I don&#x27;t think it was that bad, more of me scraping too hard the first time around since there&#x27;s so much polish. I did the octopus on the first plate last night and thought I might have similar issues since there&#x27;s so much polish on him, but he came out perfect the first time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great set otherwise, aside from the few images that are harder to stamp. And as always with stamping plates if you&#x27;re new, make sure to peel off the blue plastic first, because otherwise nothing will work. I suggest using a highly pigmented polish as well-Konad makes polishes specifically for stamping, but Sally Hansen Insta Dry work pretty well too, as well as any chrome polish.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Stamping!</li>
            <li> Love this collection , everything I needed n more!</li>
            <li> plates are very nice. 4 stars only because some images are quite large and I have very small nails I wont be able to use the largest ones and get the full effect.</li>
            <li> I own many nail stamping plates and decided to give these a try.  I really, really liked the dreamcatcher image and was looking forward to using it.  The package arrived exactly on time, which was great.  However, when I went to use the plates, I had a hard time transferring the images on many of the plates - including the dreamcatcher. :-( I wish they were etched deeper and maybe the lines slightly thicker - I feel these plates would have great potential if they were just manufactured properly.  I rarely complain on Amazon but I am super disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these and see the detail and variety of the designs. But after I removed the blue protective film and got out my trusty tools and stamping polish, I could not lift an image. I worked fast, I worked slow, I used a squishy stamper and a firm stamper, a flexible plastic scraper, a hard plastic scraper and a metal scraper. I fully cleaned before each attempt, I used a lot of pressure and less pressure. The best I got was a partial image on a firm stamper from one image out of 6 on a plate. I put it out to the stamping community to trouble shoot and within an hour I had 4 more tales of woe about this set of plates. I know some people have gotten them replaced and others have gotten them to work, I just think there&#x27;s a run that they did which has quality control issues. I&#x27;m hoping I can get mine replaced with one&#x27;s that actually work.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE....Bundle Monster did replace all my non working plates! Some of the replacements needed replacing too. Five needed a third replacement.  A lot of testing was involved...huge expenditure of time but I finally have a working set. In case anyone thinks it&#x27;s me, I have no issues with 10 other makers. So good service but lousy quality control. I will need to know these issues have been addressed before I would ever buy again.</li>
            <li> I have made many cute designs with these stamping plates.&lt;br /&gt;Made cute designs for valentines day.!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to buy more Bundle Monster Stamping Plates.</li>
            <li> Good plates, the etching is very clear. I still suck at stamping but that&#x27;s not the plates fault.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve g otten a few sets of plates from bundle monster, but these are my favorite!  Even the most delicate images printed beautifully.  I recently used the circuit board plate and got  tons of compliments. The larger designs were a bit tough to stamp intact, but I have a cheap round stamper so I think one of the larger rectangle would fix that easily.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used every plate yet, but I haven&#x27;t had the printing problems other users mentioned on any of the images I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Gave them as a gift. Receiver of gift says she likes them.</li>
            <li> The plates aren&#x27;t etched deep enough, so you won&#x27;t be able to pick up a design. I&#x27;ve been successful with other Bundle Monster sets but this one is a dud. Buyer Beware&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- 2/27/14 I sent an e-mail to BMC (the seller) about how some of the plates I received were unable to produce stamps. They are sending me replacements. I would suggest when you receive the set to check all the plates, stamp a few images and if you have an issue contact the seller.</li>
            <li> Love these plates. Awesome designs, produce crisp, clear images.  No complaints at all :)</li>
            <li> Works really good love them!</li>
            <li> Plates work great and come with a lot of very cute designs.</li>
            <li> These are so much fun, and super cute.</li>
            <li> Great quality for images and designs.</li>
            <li> Very good service would use again</li>
            <li> Love the products. Recommend buying a case for them before they arrive.</li>
            <li> stamp designs are clear and easy to transfer once you get the hang of it.  lots of nice designs.</li>
            <li> Amazing designs. It has something for every season of the year in it and people&#x27;s favorite chevron images .I can only highly recommend this image plate set .</li>
            <li> These plates are horribly etched and Bundle Monster requires you to inspect and test each and every image within 30 days or they will not replace them. Most manufacturers of stamping plates do not impose a time limit on their returns. I guess if you know you&#x27;re distributing inferior products, the best way to maximize profits is to disallow your consumers time to determine if the product works!</li>
            <li> my other gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter i do they&#x27;re nails more than i do my own but still a great product</li>
            <li> I have not been able to get a pigmented stamp...the etching is just not up to par..I still have the other plates to try..but I am very disappointed with this being my first purchase. I had heard so many great things too! Just not very pleased...waste of money and polish.    :/ loved the designs though. They are adorable...just wished I could freaking use them.</li>
            <li> Great quality and image selection</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as I expected and it shipped within the specified time frame. I am very please and will purchase from them again!!</li>
            <li> Love these! Be aware though, the \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; sized patterns are ~1.6cm at the tallest... so if your nails are longer than that you have to start getting creative about partial nail stamps or somehow repeating the stamped image on the nail.</li>
            <li> These are really interesting stamps and I&#x27;ve had good luck with them. I just love the city skyline stamp - that was my main reason for buying these! I definitely need more practice - a couple ended up looking like a Dr. Seuss book.</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone says the engravings are too shallow, mine seem to be fine and show up wonderfully, I just had to get a new stamper but these work great and I love the designs</li>
            <li> I would have to agree that some of these are not the easiest to use because the plates are not as deeply etched as other brands. I found that changing the polish and stamper made it easier. Using a thicker polish and a marshmallow stamper works best. I even got the finest ones to work using that combination. With all that being said, this has the oddest collection of images.</li>
            <li> Love the designs! Clear and easy to stamp!</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!! Sooo many cute plates</li>
            <li> I bought this SUPER excited to use some of the awesome designs featured in this set (especially with all the great reviews about it) When I got the plates everything was in order. it was all neatly packaged, every single plate had its protective film over it, and so on. However when I got down to business and used this with my Konad stamper/scraper set and Konad white stamping polish it was a mess. a majority of the designs I bought this set for did not work at all. the larger designs seemed to work alright. But it was disappointing to not have the smaller cute designs work. I am honestly unsure if I will ever purchase from bundle monster again. Great price, amazing variety, but the quality in mine was just...unacceptable. I honestly wanted to love it and maybe I did get a defective set...but for SO many plates to be defective in my set? I&#x27;m sorry BM, not sure I&#x27;ll be buying again :(</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome product! Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Review for Bundle Monster 2013 CYO collection 26 plates: I was relieved to find these nail stamping plates were as easy as Pueen brand plates to use. I love the designs in this set. The plates were slightly thinner than Pueen&#x27;s but it wasn&#x27;t an issue. They have the paper backing on them too. Overall I was very pleased with fast delivery, quality and design as well as the great value for the price. These were about 25% less expensive than similar Pueen sets but they come in a zip top plastic bag instead of the little snap close albums Pueen sets usually include..</li>
            <li> Love the variety and ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m kind of just starting out on this nail stamping thing. these are the first plates i&#x27;ve ever tried and for the most part i really like them. i have had a few miss happenings but that&#x27;s to be expected when starting out and i believe that it&#x27;s more me and the polish i was using rather than the plates. the variety of plates and themes are really nice and with the nice set of stampers i bought i have been very happy with how things are going. i do suggest do in your research before buying just any stamping materials also technique can totally make a difference with certain designs so don&#x27;t blame the plates right off.</li>
            <li> Wonderful designs and easy to use and clean. I&#x27;ve never done nail stamping before and it took me a few tries before I figured out just how quickly you have to transfer the polish off the plate and onto your nail, but after that it was a breeze. Designs transfer well and look great. Plates came with a couple of very light scratches despite the protective covering, but they didn&#x27;t affect the designs. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought these plates and another set from a different company to I&#x27;ve nail stamping a try.  I had the hardest time getting the image to transfer from these plates!  I tried everything, using pure acetone, buying the special stamping polish, buffing or kneading the stamper.  Absolutely nothing would work!!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, at my wits end i decided to try some plates from the other set i ordered and it worked perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line these plate were terrible for me, and I will not buy from bundle monster again!</li>
            <li> I love these plates, they are a must own. Can&#x27;t wait for bundle monster&#x27;s next plates and fun images to come out. The butterfly wings are so cute stamped.</li>
            <li> real hard to work with but i keep trying</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the stamps but so far I have about a 50/50 success rate using these.  If it&#x27;s user error u will update this post.  The ones that work are very nice and would get a 5 star.  The others look lime ink splats, and would get 1 star.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality etching.  Sometime it takes a few tries to pick up the complete image on the stamper depending on the image, how hard you scrape, and how hard you press the stamper to pick up the image. It would be better to use these with acrylic paint or cheaper polishes for the stamping rather than wasting your good quality or expensive \\&quot;special\\&quot; stamping polishes.  It just takes a little practice to get decent quality images that will transfer properly.</li>
            <li> They stamp work very well!!!</li>
            <li> Some of the images were etched a little shallowly, but otherwise it was fantastic</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this plates, don&#x27;t waste yours. The images doesn&#x27;t get to the stamper. There are some images that does stamp but if you try more that one time. I try with different types of stamper but the problem was the plates. I also tried with different types of nail polish but still didn&#x27;t work. I will not recommend this plates to no one!</li>
            <li> Terrible! I tried 10 different bottles of the most pigmented polish I have (I have over 200 bottles). Couldn&#x27;t get the designs to transfer to the stamp at all - the scraper scraped it all away. I don&#x27;t think the designs were etched deep enough. And I was so excited to finally try nail stamping it made me very sad when it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> love the designs they look awesome but some of them with fine lines are a little hard to get but once you do, they are beautiful!</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy this for so long... so I finally bought it and I am having so much fun with these manicure plates, it offers so many great images to create really nice manicures.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> IS ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING OK, RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> These stamps are wonderful! The designs are super cute, and etched deeply enough to put on clear. Fyi, the sally hansen instadry polish worked great as a stamping polish. Would buy this brand (probably exclusively) again.</li>
            <li> I love them! Only thing is that you&#x27;ve got to clean them after use, or else nail polish will get stuck in the the patterns. Very good deal for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Forget the five stars if you are looking for a great stamping. These are not deep enough to even pick up a image the polish comes all off once you scrape it!! Waste of freaking money and these 5 star reviews are BS!!! Will never ever again buy!!!! I want my money back!!! ðŸ˜¡</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of all the Bundle Monster stamping plates and this set did not disappoint.  There are so many great designs.  I cant wait to try them all.  Sometimes stamping plates can be too shallow and the images don&#x27;t transfer, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be an issue with these.  Very happy :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what problems the other people had, but I haven&#x27;t had problems with these plates. I use an old gift card to scrape then I quickly stamp and transfer without much problem. I am new to stamping and know that practice helps immensely.&lt;br /&gt;I like most of the designs, but still wish for something a little more original and not so girly?&lt;br /&gt;Also, my major complaint is that the full nail patterns are just not big enough to fit on my thumb nail.</li>
            <li> Lots of cute designs but they aren&#x27;t etched deep enough so they don&#x27;t work very well. What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I like these plates. Some have minor issues with transfer, but very minor. Some of them you just have to turn a different way. I am overall very satisfied, thank you!</li>
            <li> Very happy!! I really recommended. Good qualityðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> I love these plates! I had a problem with one not being etched in all the way and contacted the seller and they fixed my problem in a very timly manner! I also went through and checked almost all the plates to make sure they worked as well! I&#x27;m very pleased with how they handled my problem and very satisfied with the product itself!</li>
            <li> By far the worst plates ever!</li>
            <li> Love the designs excellent transfer!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to use these but if you know how than I am sure they are great.</li>
            <li> Lovethe stamp is easy to use</li>
            <li> I have heard nothing but good reviews for this product so when I received mine and they didnt work I was upset. I thought maybe I needed a new stamper so waited till I had money and purchased one. NOPE! THIS PRODUCT JUST SUCKS! I cant get them to work at all. And I understand sometimes people have a hard time or dont work quick enough or use the wrong polish. But I am not an idiot so I tried so many different ways and guess what....THEY STILL SUCK. Thanks for letting me pay for a piece of garbage Bundle Monster. Or rather 26 pieces of garbage!!</li>
            <li> These plates are so nice.</li>
            <li> I just started to stamp and i am in love with doing it! I got this BM set and it is AMAZING im surprised that some people have mixed reviews about bundle monster because they DO work and they are great designs. I&#x27;m new to stamping so i can see how i could have messed up but with PRACTICE you get the hang of it. There are alot of other variables that could mess up the process not just the plates so i feel some more negative reviews could have been because of many other factors like drying time, the type of polish, how you scrape the plates, etc. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with these plates and i absolutely love them! I find going easy on the scraping help picks up the image. It&#x27;s OK if some polish is left on top and it wasn&#x27;t all scraped off because it actually isnt picked up by the stamp which i was happy to find! I&#x27;m just sort of disappointed that there are negative reviews which make people hesitant to buy this product because these were the first plates i ever used and the first time i stamped and i had a lot of fun and success with them!</li>
            <li> These are super cute. A nice variety of design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used quite a few of the plates and I love them, the designs are big enough for my long nails, I&#x27;m always running into images that are too short for me. I use a squishy stamper and normal polishes, and I haven&#x27;t run into any problems so far.</li>
            <li> I love these stamps so much designs to choose from worth the money</li>
            <li> This is my third set of nail stamping plates and I have been using nail stamps for months now, these are not easy to work with, the designs are not deep enough and they are very frustrating.  I would try another brand.  I purchased this set because I liked the designs...they just need to be made better.</li>
            <li> some of the designs are too shallow to work.</li>
            <li> I love Bundle Monster... they have to disappoint yet! Love designs, and quality is great. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Work great love that they came in a case!</li>
            <li> I love all of these stamping plates ðŸ’— so many cute designs and such a variety too!</li>
