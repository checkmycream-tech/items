            <li>, many promise to help with breakage, what I found was</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is nice for colored hair and lathers quickly.</li>
            <li>Great smell, leaves hair clean, strips the brassy color and leaves a bright blonde.</li>
            <li>Cannot seem to find it easily elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos for gray hair and Blondme is far superior to anything out there.  </li>
            <li>Great for getting the yellow out of your highlighted hair !</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother if you are looking to keep hair light</li>
            <li>my hair dresser believes the great silvery tones are directly related to the use of this product.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more hydrating than most purple shampoos and smells great though, wasn&#x27;t too good or too bad, just ok 4me</li>
            <li>I switched to Redken Blonde Idol and I&#x27;m very happy thus far.</li>

            <li>Got the leave-in conditioner too and they keep my hair looking vibrant and healthy.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this shampoo, she has platinum blonde highlights, and this keeps them very bright and stops any yellow tinge creeping into the color.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>Helps maintain a nice ash blonde color with my highlights without washes striping out color and turning brassy.</li>
            <li>I looked like I had 3 different colors of hair and nothing was blending nicely.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product since going gray, so I have nothing for a comparison, but I love the color of my hair and</li>
            <li>I ordered 6 containers last week and see many more in my future.  </li>
            <li>But after using it four times and seeing no results... kind of a let down.</li>
            <li>This shampoo goes really well with the conditioner...is light for daily use.</li>
            <li>Product works very well and does all it claims.  </li>
            <li>It is very intensive even after washing with another shampoo.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much to tone brassy color.  </li>
            <li>I figured I would go through the whole bottle before reviewing.</li>
            <li>and I had so much shine and sheen to my highlights</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use too much of this.  </li>
            <li>After bleaching my hair way too yellowy blonde I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am young but have a lot of white hair.&lt;br /&gt;It blended nicely and brought a lot of brightness without brass to my hair.</li>
            <li>Decent shampoo for blondes</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for all blondes....</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this..</li>

            <li>Gentle on my color treated hair &amp; helps w/ brassiness without leaving my hair blue!</li>
            <li>I use it every shampoo and my hair is soft, hydrated and shiny.  </li>

I looked like I had 3 different colors of hair and nothing was blending nicely. This Cool Ice was the answer to my prayers.  I used it as directed and within 2-3 uses, my gray hair was blended in with the blonde and I had so much shine and sheen to my highlights, it was amazing.  I will never be without this product again!</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my blonde hair. I really wanted to like this product. But after using it four times and seeing no results... kind of a let down. The redken one did a much better job.</li>

            <li> GREAT STUFF I TELL YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many expensive an non expensive but this stuff is miraculous! Have yellowing problems? I highly recomend this..</li>
            <li> I had a few brassy spots in my light blonde hair that I thought this product would tone down, boy was I mistaken. After using this product last night with high hopes, my hair is now brassy all over. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair a bit brassy, mixed feelings about this shampoo. Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase it again..  Ships quick though</li>
