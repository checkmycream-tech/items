            <li>and I love the consistency of the shadow.</li>
            <li>pretty!&amp;#34;,That&#x27;s a quote from one of my favorite Youtube personalities Melissa Autry.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite eyeshadow.</li>

            <li>My favorite color.</li>
            <li>Love this color.  </li>

            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>i also use this as a crease color when i am doing a light smokey eye or if i want to create dimension in my eyes.</li>
            <li>Great basic color needed for any makeup collection!</li>
            <li>I really love this product and used it right away.  </li>
            <li>WOW, so glad i found this in influenster!</li>
            <li>is very smooth and the brush is very helpful for makeup</li>
            <li>anyway a great true dark brown.</li>
            <li>This is a great all around color for the eyes and for people with dark brown hair like mine!</li>
            <li>Nice deep brown shadow.</li>
            <li>Price is right, so I may just try another color.</li>
            <li>Brown makes blue eyes look better.</li>
            <li>If this container falls on the ground, the container will most likely be destroyed.</li>
            <li>eyebrow routine starts with me grooming my brows with an old clean toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Lasts almost all day (more than 8 hours) and has so much product that i wont run out for a long time!</li>
            <li>On top of all of that I still have more than half of the pan left after a year, so I probably won&#x27;t have to buy again for another year.&lt;br /&gt;STRONGLY</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>I utilize this shade as an eyebrow powder and I absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li>Next I lightly brush in the Made for Mocha to fill and shape my eyebrows</li>

            <li>It has amazing pigment and is long lasting even without primer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful dark matte color that can be applied wet or dry, light or dark.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great dark brown with no glittery mess, than this is your shadow, I don&#x27;t know why it seems like every one is making their shadows metallics and glittery!</li>
            <li>The Maybelline New York Eyeshadow in&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>The make up looked brand new except someone had put their finger on it.</li>
            <li>I use this for everything--lightly in my crease alone when I want a more natural look, heavily on my outer v</li>
            <li>NO WAY not for me, maybe sometimes I will use a neutral shiny mineral powder in the corner of my inner eye or a light dusting on my lid, but nothing stupid, It looks great on alot of people, but not so much on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually used this as a substitute for eyeliner on days when I want a little more of a natural look.</li>
            <li>soft to apply.</li>
            <li>No other compares</li>

            <li> &amp;#34;You talking &#x27;bout pretty!&amp;#34;,That&#x27;s a quote from one of my favorite Youtube personalities Melissa Autry. The Maybelline New York Eyeshadow in&lt;br /&gt;Made for Mocha is a color I wear every day. I utilize this shade as an eyebrow powder and I absolutely adore it. In the pan it appears to have some shimmer but on the brow no shimmer can be detected. I get compliments on my eyebrows all time from men, women and children.&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrow routine starts with me grooming my brows with an old clean toothbrush. then I line the bottoms of my brows with the ELF Eyebrow Lifter and Filler eyebrow pencil. Next I lightly brush in the Made for Mocha to fill and shape my eyebrows and then I finish by using a spoolie to blend in the Made for Mocha throughout the brow. This shadow gets my brows perfect every time. Maybelline Expert Wear Eyeshadow is very easy to apply and goes on effortlessly. The Made for Mocha is also a wonderful crease color as it is a matte shadow and blends out beautifully with purples, other browns and its great as a transition color for a smokey eye. This is a must have color and it so incredibly versatile.</li>
            <li> WOW, so glad i found this in influenster! This is my all time favorite eyeshadow. Its so convertible into different looks and can be used on different places of the face not just eyes for eyeshadow! I use this mostly as a brow powder to fill in my brows after shaping them with a brown pencil. This eyeshadow is about 2 shades lighter than my actual hair color (which is how it should be for a brow color) and works perfectly to set them! Lasts almost all day (more than 8 hours) and has so much product that i wont run out for a long time! i also use this as a crease color when i am doing a light smokey eye or if i want to create dimension in my eyes. This is a great all around color for the eyes and for people with dark brown hair like mine! I hope this is a permanent shade! i havent had to buy it in years and havent hit pan yet! i use it 5/7 days a week! if you are low on funds and dont want to buy expensive brow powders, opt for the maybelline eyeshadows! They work just as good and are a fraction of the price! Less than $3 at walmart!</li>
            <li> i use this for contouring and for smokey eyes, it works great, but mine got stolen, and its not available for purchase anymore well at least it said currently :(</li>

            <li> Just dark enough to run above my upper lash and blend. Brown makes blue eyes look better.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brown eyeshadow. It&#x27;s a wonderful dark matte color that can be applied wet or dry, light or dark. You can also use it to set liquid or gel eyeliner if you want. It has amazing pigment and is long lasting even without primer. I&#x27;ve actually used this as a substitute for eyeliner on days when I want a little more of a natural look. It&#x27;s a very smooth consistency and never ever clumps. Absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Good pigment quality, applies smoothly and blends (with or without a brush) easily and evenly.  Great basic color needed for any makeup collection!</li>
            <li> Great tone and its matte! Perfect for smokey eyes.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken and the lid had many hairline scratches like the container is recycled. The make up looked brand new except someone had put their finger on it.</li>
            <li> My favorite color. No other compares</li>
            <li> I use it as a contouring color. I have brown skin...</li>
            <li> I allways look this brand of eyeshadows, The color is also nice, not shining, just the color for the ones likes that way.</li>
            <li> Nice deep brown shadow. Would repurchase</li>
            <li> جميل جدا  وناعم ورائع لقد أحببته فعلا.. إنه أفضل مما توقعته&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and smooth and wonderful I really liked it .. It&#x27;s better than I expected</li>
            <li> Love it!  The items arrived as scheduled.  I really love this product and used it right away.  Will order it again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Let me say I love putting this eye shadow in my crease to make a nice Smokey eye or a neutral eye the only downside to this product is that it has sparkle in in it. I didn&#x27;t want a sparkly brown i wanted i dark matte brown but other than that i don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> Love this color.  I&#x27;m a redhead, so I mostly wear earth tones.  This color is rich and beautiful.  My only complaint is with the container.  If this container falls on the ground, the container will most likely be destroyed.</li>
