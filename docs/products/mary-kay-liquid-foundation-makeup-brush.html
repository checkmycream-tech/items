            <li>The brush is really soft and works just perfect.</li>
            <li>I use most Mary Kay products but honestly have never tried the foundation brush before...</li>
            <li>And luckily found this!!</li>
            <li>A MaryKay vendor tried selling this brush to me for $2 more than what I bought it for on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t hold bacteria or foundation like a sponge can.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay makeup</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d love their brush not so.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I actually use this brush to apply primer to my face before putting on make-up - works great!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some of the credit goes to my foundation too</li>
            <li>I still love Mary Kay though.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t love the bristles or this brush.  </li>
            <li>, it has lived up to the recommendations and more.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>easy to apply liquid foundation with and easy to rinse out!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried using makeup Brush, this brush is great, applies solution smooth.</li>
            <li>I like to get a nice medium to full coverage with my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still good as new!!</li>
            <li>I think that it is a very good brush, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I loved my old one, so I am sure I will love this one, too.</li>
            <li>The brush makes it easy to apply the foundation.</li>
            <li>it will be the same ordeal with make up sponges that are for the perfect face that I wonder why they even need make up on the first place I thought..</li>
            <li>However, for the price, this brush does it&#x27;s job just fine.  </li>
            <li>If you want a cheaper foundation brush that doesn&#x27;t suck, this is a fine choice.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super excited to use it!</li>
            <li>The bristles are smooth are its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but it applies the foundation smoothly, even along lines under the eyes.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, I use shampoo.  </li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t even know you have it on, it is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, buy this brush, it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Always makes the foundation go on smooth and no lines.</li>
            <li>I have always felt like most of it gets absorbed and after using this</li>
            <li>The bristles are smooth and it applies foundation evenly.</li>
            <li>This is so worth it for the price I love this brush..</li>
            <li>It applies the makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft, so that&#x27;s a good start.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it might absorb a bit more of the product than I&#x27;d like, but overall it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new replacements.</li>
            <li>It distributes my foundation evenly and it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Def worth the price!</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Bought another one right after a week of getting it!</li>
            <li>well its TRUE.  </li>
            <li>It feels oh so soft against my face, and is a nice shape for getting into crevices.</li>
            <li>It does such a good job.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend if you are looking for a good brush for a reasonable price:)</li>
            <li>The other brushes I had before did not do as great of a job</li>
            <li>I received the brush quickly and it was just like it said.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;d probably spend a bit more and get a nice soft brush.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Great little foundation brush!  </li>
            <li>First time I ever used a brush to apply foundation, and it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li>MaryKay has high quality makeup and makeup tools!!</li>
            <li>This is my first foundation brush</li>
            <li>It was a relatively inexpensive brush and it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>This was my first foundation brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not completely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I love my new brush, and it was cost effective also my sister paid 35 for this same brush at MAC and they apply foundation the same</li>
            <li>Brush is flat, I like a fluffier one better.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with light acne and the brush really irritated it.</li>
            <li>once u use this product a few times you will love it!</li>
            <li>Absorbs way too much product and doesn&#x27;t hold up well to cleaning and disinfecting.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>if i was suppose to use this brush for foundation application , it would take forever for me to get ready...</li>
            <li>Much quicker than dabbing on with my fingers and the brush gives a nicer finish.  </li>
            <li>and i really like it.</li>
            <li>The brisely are a high quality and it doesn&#x27;t SHED!</li>
            <li>It really works very well spreading out the foundation</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear too much makeup</li>
            <li>It also seems very well made.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>it really works wonders.</li>
            <li>Although, I will not repurchase because the brush pokes at my face too much.</li>
            <li>With a pat/stroke with doing your face at sections at a time its easy, fast, flawless and WOW coverage without the over application I am always afraid of!  </li>
            <li>Kind of small for a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>It blends my liquid foundation in beautifully and allows me to apply it very thin</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(MAC Matchmaster... highly recommend that as well), but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush... and at a fraction of the price of the one I returned.</li>
            <li>and just because its too small for me dont mean it wont be perfect for you...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard like some of them.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>This brush looks professional, and is a must have ladies!</li>
            <li>Even coverage and very soft, on par with professional brushes.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and management.  </li>
            <li>The brush is so soft and it works so well with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks so even and natural.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>its soft on my face.</li>
            <li>no lines, no dark spots, and you dont have to go over and over with the brush to cover your face.</li>
            <li>Much prefer Clinique&#x27;s foundation brush, even though it&#x27;s much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>My mother sells Mary Kay &amp; i needed a new foundation brush &amp; fast, but she didn&#x27;t have any on hand and would have taken at least 7-10 business days (plus pay shipping) if i ordered thru her...</li>

            <li> Absorbs way too much product and doesn&#x27;t hold up well to cleaning and disinfecting.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> if i was suppose to use this brush for foundation application , it would take forever for me to get ready...</li>
            <li> Much quicker than dabbing on with my fingers and the brush gives a nicer finish.  </li>
            <li> and i really like it.</li>
            <li> The brisely are a high quality and it doesn&#x27;t SHED!</li>
            <li> It really works very well spreading out the foundation</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear too much makeup</li>
            <li> It also seems very well made.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> it really works wonders.</li>
            <li> Although, I will not repurchase because the brush pokes at my face too much.</li>
            <li> With a pat/stroke with doing your face at sections at a time its easy, fast, flawless and WOW coverage without the over application I am always afraid of!  </li>
            <li> Kind of small for a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> It blends my liquid foundation in beautifully and allows me to apply it very thin</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> (MAC Matchmaster... highly recommend that as well), but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush... and at a fraction of the price of the one I returned.</li>
            <li> and just because its too small for me dont mean it wont be perfect for you...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard like some of them.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> This brush looks professional, and is a must have ladies!</li>
            <li> Even coverage and very soft, on par with professional brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and management.  </li>
            <li> The brush is so soft and it works so well with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> My makeup looks so even and natural.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> its soft on my face.</li>
            <li> no lines, no dark spots, and you dont have to go over and over with the brush to cover your face.</li>
            <li> Much prefer Clinique&#x27;s foundation brush, even though it&#x27;s much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> My mother sells Mary Kay &amp; i needed a new foundation brush &amp; fast, but she didn&#x27;t have any on hand and would have taken at least 7-10 business days (plus pay shipping) if i ordered thru her...</li>
            <li> Not as soft as other reviews say.</li>
            <li> Well, I thought, ok really, a brush for your makeup with my awful scarred cheek/jaw area and large pore nose skin ? ..</li>
            <li> I felt it was a little rough, and I don&#x27;t find myself using it very often.  </li>
            <li> Gentle to the delicate skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why I put it off for so long.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but still stiff because it is a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> My face during the fall and winter gets dry</li>
            <li> It holds up well, especially since I have to clean it more than the average person due to my horrible skin.  </li>
            <li> I put a little foundation on the back of my hand &amp; brush it onto my face.</li>
            <li> Had this brush for about a month before the bristles started to get rough.</li>
            <li> This brush is flexible, yet firm enough, to apply the foundation.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very rough on the face...Don&#x27;t buy this brush.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a very expensive foundation brush from MAC but returned it because it didn&#x27;t blend my foundation in well.</li>
            <li> the texture is soft enough to use on my face but it is a little bit expensive</li>
            <li> One thing I should note is that the metal part on the brush I received is silver, where the picture of the one here is black.</li>
            <li> lots of wasted expensive foundation, too light of coverage or too heavy on my face making me look worse.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t used to using a brush to apply cover up before and it took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> It felt like it was scratching my skin a little.</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard and choppy making it really rough on your skin.</li>
            <li> I think this is because the brush is too firm.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit stiff &amp; can feel rough on delicate areas.</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t as stiff or dense.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product.  </li>
            <li> but its way too small for a foundation brush...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly stiff and the makeup seems to go on thick.  </li>
            <li> Brush not soft but spikey and uncomfortable to put on make up.</li>
            <li> so when I get to the delicate ares like around my nose and my eyes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t create streaks, and will apply the product as thinly as I please.</li>
            <li> and so the sponge would make it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any bristles falling out or streaking when I apply the foundation.  </li>
            <li> Some makeup brushes are so expensive and this seems to do the trick for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the tips of the bristles are weirdly pointy</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>

            <li> Not what I thought it would be. Brush not soft but spikey and uncomfortable to put on make up.</li>
            <li> Absorbs way too much product and doesn&#x27;t hold up well to cleaning and disinfecting. Had this brush for about a month before the bristles started to get rough.</li>
            <li> Nat😞😞 I use like 6 times and flt at part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m applying [[ASIN:B005OTP57U MARY KAY TimeWise Luminous-Wear Liquid Foundation]] with this brush. I put a little foundation on the back of my hand &amp; brush it onto my face. It almost looks like my foundation has been sprayed on. This brush is flexible, yet firm enough, to apply the foundation. It can be washed (I use shampoo) &amp; comes with a pouch for storage.</li>
            <li> A MaryKay vendor tried selling this brush to me for $2 more than what I bought it for on amazon. The brush is really soft and works just perfect. I think the only problem is that I have to wash it often so it can keep working the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have used MK brushes for years. But as with everything they do wear out. I am very pleased with my new replacements.</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard and choppy making it really rough on your skin. I have sensitive skin with light acne and the brush really irritated it.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter likes it</li>
            <li> Well, I thought, ok really, a brush for your makeup with my awful scarred cheek/jaw area and large pore nose skin ? .. it will be the same ordeal with make up sponges that are for the perfect face that I wonder why they even need make up on the first place I thought.. lots of wasted expensive foundation, too light of coverage or too heavy on my face making me look worse.  WELL was I mistaken!  This brush is the MAGICK BRUSH ladies!  I had read online about women seeking the flawless look and how to apply their foundation with a brush and how and why it works so well beyond your fingers or sponge applicatin, well its TRUE.  With a pat/stroke with doing your face at sections at a time its easy, fast, flawless and WOW coverage without the over application I am always afraid of!  Love this brush, great quality, feel and application is amazing.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t hold bacteria or foundation like a sponge can.  Would definately recommend this to a friend.  Thanks MaryKay love your quality makeup and makeup tools!</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!  This brush is so soft and management.  This  brush is an excellent applier.  I will be ordering more.  This is so great.  Unbelievable product.  I will tell others of this great product.  Amazing brush.</li>
            <li> My mother sells Mary Kay &amp; i needed a new foundation brush &amp; fast, but she didn&#x27;t have any on hand and would have taken at least 7-10 business days (plus pay shipping) if i ordered thru her... I decided to look online and i found this, i got it within 3-4 business days!! I use most Mary Kay products but honestly have never tried the foundation brush before... it is a MUST! won&#x27;t ever buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> Brush is flat, I like a fluffier one better.</li>
            <li> Great price and does the job</li>
            <li> Great little foundation brush!  I wasn&#x27;t used to using a brush to apply cover up before and it took a little getting used to but it applies the foundation smoothly, even along lines under the eyes.</li>
            <li> its a great brush...its one i cant live without because it applies the application flawlessly but its way too small for a foundation brush...i use it as a concealer brush...if i was suppose to use this brush for foundation application , it would take forever for me to get ready...but its a great brush...and just because its too small for me dont mean it wont be perfect for you...</li>
            <li> Very good brush at a great price.  First time I ever used a brush to apply foundation, and it works wonders.  Much quicker than dabbing on with my fingers and the brush gives a nicer finish.  Easy to clean, I use shampoo.  I will continue to use May Kay&#x27;s liquid foundation makeup brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, reasonably-priced brush, and it arrive promptly.  Really nice finish for foundation.  And it doesn&#x27;t SHED!!</li>
            <li> it is a very good foundation brush and i really like it. the texture is soft enough to use on my face but it is a little bit expensive</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for a short time. The verdict is: I have no complaints about this beauty tool. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using liquid mineral makeup for about 15 years and never came across a brush like this! It literally glides on. Highly recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my fiance and she absolutely love it. everything came as advertised. no complaints from her about this.</li>
            <li> The brush makes it easy to apply the foundation. What a flawless look you will get with using the brush verses a sponge or your fingers. I would highly recommend this to a friend. MaryKay has high quality makeup and makeup tools!! The brisely are a high quality and it doesn&#x27;t SHED!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best makeup brush I have ever used.  I put the Mary Kay Foundation on my left hand and use the brush to lift it off.  It really works very well spreading out the foundation, you don&#x27;t even know you have it on, it is so smooth.  Ladies, buy this brush, it is fantastic.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first foundation brush so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to but it is great quality and blends foundation nicely. Some makeup brushes are so expensive and this seems to do the trick for a fraction of the price. I would recommend it for the novice makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay makeup so I thought I&#x27;d love their brush not so. The bristles are very rough on the face...Don&#x27;t buy this brush. I can&#x27;t even use it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Alright, so I just received this brush today and I&#x27;m super excited to use it! I&#x27;ve been using my fingers to apply foundation since I&#x27;ve started wearing make up, and I&#x27;m hoping that this will make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as I&#x27;ve just got it, I have no actual review (hence the three stars). However, the shipping was prompt and the package is in perfect shape. The bristles are really soft, so that&#x27;s a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update once I test trial it!</li>
            <li> I depend on this brush to apply my foundation. Always makes the foundation go on smooth and no lines. Love.</li>
            <li> It distributes my foundation evenly and it is super easy to use. Def worth the price! Stop hesitating and buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Cleans up very nice!</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply my liquid foundations. It doesn&#x27;t create streaks, and will apply the product as thinly as I please. It feels oh so soft against my face, and is a nice shape for getting into crevices. I do use my fingers to blend my foundation in for a seamless look, but I&#x27;m sure if I didn&#x27;t want to get my hands dirty I could probably use this brush. I prefer a stiffer, denser brush for blending in foundation, like the Boots No. 7 foundation brush, but that is my preference. This brush isn&#x27;t as stiff or dense. One thing I should note is that the metal part on the brush I received is silver, where the picture of the one here is black. All in all, I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh. The brush is so soft and it works so well with liquid foundation. I use the MAC Matchmaker liquid foundation or something like that. The brush puts the foundation flawlessly on my face and it lasts all day. no lines, no dark spots, and you dont have to go over and over with the brush to cover your face. You must buy this! This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear too much makeup so the brush was perfect for me. Nice and soft, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried using makeup Brush, this brush is great, applies solution smooth. I recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, they do what they&#x27;re suppose to do</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic! I have been putting off trying a foundation brush and I don&#x27;t know why I put it off for so long. I do not like using my fingers to put on foundation, so I have always used the cosmetic wedge sponges. I have always felt like most of it gets absorbed and after using this, I can&#x27;t believe how much foundation I have wasted all this time. My face during the fall and winter gets dry and so the sponge would make it worse. This brush is just wonderful. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It was a relatively inexpensive brush and it&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s fairly stiff and the makeup seems to go on thick.  It doesn&#x27;t shed at all so that&#x27;s good.  Next time I&#x27;d probably spend a bit more and get a nice soft brush.</li>
            <li> Kind of small for a foundation brush. Still a nice brush.</li>
            <li> I decided to order some Mary Kay make-up products from Amazon and added this brush on a whim.  I think that it is a very good brush, especially for the price.  I actually use this brush to apply primer to my face before putting on make-up - works great!!  I have recommended this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Had looked for a nice makeup brush for applying my liquid foundation for a while. And luckily found this!! Bought another one right after a week of getting it! Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a very expensive foundation brush from MAC but returned it because it didn&#x27;t blend my foundation in well. Then I found this... wow! It does such a good job. The bristles are soft but still stiff because it is a foundation brush. It blends my liquid foundation in beautifully and allows me to apply it very thin so I don&#x27;t feel caked in makeup. My makeup looks so even and natural. I&#x27;m sure some of the credit goes to my foundation too (MAC Matchmaster... highly recommend that as well), but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush... and at a fraction of the price of the one I returned. It also seems very well made.</li>
            <li> This brush is working well for me- I&#x27;ve not experienced any bristles falling out or streaking when I apply the foundation.  All in all, it&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
            <li> I received the brush quickly and it was just like it said.  It holds up well, especially since I have to clean it more than the average person due to my horrible skin.  I really like it and I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  Just as described.</li>
            <li> The bristles are smooth and it applies foundation evenly. Im happy with it, and it is easy to wash as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  I loved my old one, so I am sure I will love this one, too.</li>
            <li> This is so worth it for the price I love this brush.. it really works wonders. Perfect for any foundation</li>
            <li> I like this brush but it is a bit stiff &amp; can feel rough on delicate areas. But I will continue to use it until I find a softer one this size.</li>
            <li> great brush, great price! Works great for liquid foundations. I think it might absorb a bit more of the product than I&#x27;d like, but overall it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft. It makes me feel like an Egyptian Princess putting on her beauty for the Pharoah to behold. This brush looks professional, and is a must have ladies!</li>
            <li> This was my first foundation brush and I think it&#x27;s really good quality. The bristles are smooth are its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love my new brush, and it was cost effective also my sister paid 35 for this same brush at MAC and they apply foundation the same, I saved big on this one!</li>
            <li> I added this to my Mary Kay brush collection I love them! If you don&#x27;t have a collection of make up brushes treat yourself to Mary Kay&#x27;s collection of brushes.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as other reviews say. It felt like it was scratching my skin a little. I can&#x27;t apply my makeup with this brush. I still love Mary Kay though.</li>
            <li> once u use this product a few times you will love it! easy to apply liquid foundation with and easy to rinse out!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s alright.  I felt it was a little rough, and I don&#x27;t find myself using it very often.  I just didn&#x27;t love the bristles or this brush.  Much prefer Clinique&#x27;s foundation brush, even though it&#x27;s much more expensive.  However, for the price, this brush does it&#x27;s job just fine.  If you want a cheaper foundation brush that doesn&#x27;t suck, this is a fine choice.</li>
            <li> Even coverage and very soft, on par with professional brushes. I would totally recommend if you are looking for a good brush for a reasonable price:)</li>
            <li> This is a good, durable brush.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it has lived up to the recommendations and more.  it&#x27;s lightweight and durable. It&#x27;s not hard like some of them. Gentle to the delicate skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful. It applies the makeup smoothly. The other brushes I had before did not do as great of a job</li>
            <li> its soft on my face. I love it</li>
            <li> This brush is great .. What a bargain .. i use with liquid foundation</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose and a great price....bristles holding up well....</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the tips of the bristles are weirdly pointy so when I get to the delicate ares like around my nose and my eyes the brush hair poke and jab into my skin and it hurts.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and great price makeup goes in smooth.</li>
            <li> I like to get a nice medium to full coverage with my liquid foundation. This brush definitely gives me that. However, it like pokes at my face. I think this is because the brush is too firm. I&#x27;ve washed it twice since I got it and I thought that might solve the issue, but it still tends to hurt my face a bit. It&#x27;s not completely uncomfortable. But the brush does do a good job. Although, I will not repurchase because the brush pokes at my face too much.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing make up brush! I used it for a liquid face mask. It spreads the liquid evenly over your face. All around great product!</li>
            <li> Loved this ! I&#x27;ve had this for quite a while now maybe a year and it&#x27;s still good as new!! No shedding and I constantly wash it to prevent bacteria.</li>
            <li> I hate it. It feels like plastic</li>
            <li> So nice.  I use this to apply my makeup and then use a kabuki brush to even-out my makeup.  It looks fresh and flawless.</li>
