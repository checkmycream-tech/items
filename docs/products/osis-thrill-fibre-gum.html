            <li>Love love love i!</li>
            <li>Try it you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>well,  I was almost able to purchase 2 cans for what one salon would cost.  </li>
            <li>I immediately bought a jar, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I love all of the OSIS products.  </li>
            <li>Schwarzkopf  product, [[ASIN:B007KA804Q Got2b Chaotic Fiber Gum]], seems to work much better for me.  </li>
            <li>A must for a cute pixie cut.</li>
            <li>Love it, just as advertised.. Would buy agin</li>
            <li>Love this for volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Osis brand Fibre Gum for over a year now and have enjoyed the hold it puts on my hair without leaving the flakes and rock-hard state of gel.</li>
            <li>Much, much better to use than hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair look a lot thicker and holds shape much better</li>
            <li>great and natural shine</li>
            <li>It does a great job on &amp;#34;holding&amp;#34; my naturally curly hair in place.</li>
            <li>just good stuff&amp;#62; if I would have bought this in a salon it would have cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect product for my super short hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply &amp;amp; holds the shape.</li>
            <li>I need something strong to hold it</li>
            <li>My favorite had been Garnier Fructis Fiber Gum Putty, 5.0 Oz until Garnier discontinued the product; I really haven&#x27;t found a suitable replacement yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>been using for 5 years,  light yet holds your style.</li>
            <li>Apply SUPER lightly after straightening.</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;ve been using it for many years, it is easy with  Osis Thrill Fibre Gum to make your  short hair look stylish.</li>
            <li>This product is identical to the salon and much more reasonable;  If you need such a product I think you would find it meets your needs surprising</li>
            <li>and it looks completely fresh and full.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side it does hold my hair in place and adds some thickness to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I used up my last container, so I needed more!</li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously amazing if you have short hair!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for males with thick hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser used it on me first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it holds better if you put it in when your hair is dry, though.</li>
            <li>I have a short haircut, w/ fine hair.</li>
            <li>so I did not have very high expectations.</li>
            <li>Very high quality fibre gum,  my hair  loos</li>
            <li>Fast transaction.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and really like it</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>An hour after application it does absolutely nothing-</li>
            <li>Thank you, So much.  </li>
            <li>This is such a unique hair product.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>When I forget to wash it out before I go to sleep, I&#x27;m quickly reminded by my phone vibrating next to me, another friend looking to hang out, another girl looking for a night of passion with my new, muscular body and luscious</li>
            <li>Product provides a strong hold, but does not leave your hair greasy or overly stiff.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because it finishes my hair style with shine and soft texture.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little and it rinses out clean if you don&#x27;t want to shampoo your hair every day.</li>
            <li>Works well for thin, fine hair to give it body throughout the day.</li>

            <li> Works well for thin, fine hair to give it body throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have to use it or my hair falls flat.</li>
            <li> It works when my hair is very short and as it grows out to what is long for me, about 2 1/2 inches.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;The preferred pink goop for my short hair every day.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> and when he&#x27;s run out has tried other products, but each time he has he&#x27;s always come back to this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would give some lift to my hair, but it actually weighs it down.</li>
            <li> If you let your hair grow just a little (and by this I mean 3 weeks after a haircut) it doesn&#x27;t really have any strength.</li>
            <li> I still prefer Got2b Chaotic, but in the future if that is not available I think that Osis Thrill is a viable substitute.</li>
            <li> If you want a wet hair look, you can put it on when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I use just a little in wet hair, then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 3 years and won&#x27;t use any other products.</li>
            <li> And this is with using only a small amount of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> Only hair product found that adds control to your hair without the sticky, hard helmet-head look.  </li>
            <li> If it starts to look limp halfway through the day, I just rough it up a bit</li>
            <li> You use such a small amount that it lasts forever!  </li>
            <li> I typically use a gel or gum-type product for my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually style my hair when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a little sticky, but not crispy at all.</li>
            <li> Grab a little and stretch it between your fingers to get the fibers going, then &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; the strands onto hair and work in.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t hold short spiky thin hair in place at all.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want it to be stiff and my hair still shines.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day, to tame &amp; style my otherwise unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> My barber gave my a slick cut, and introduced me to this Osis fiber gum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or stiff, just gives my hair life!</li>
            <li> I used to be weak, shy, and quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick and gooey.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, flyaway hair.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair product freak, and even though I&#x27;ve had very very short hair for several years, I still need something to give it that bedhead look. You only need a little and it rinses out clean if you don&#x27;t want to shampoo your hair every day. Not sticky or gummy, definitely not greasy.</li>
            <li> I used up my last container, so I needed more!</li>
            <li> Only hair product found that adds control to your hair without the sticky, hard helmet-head look.  Introduced to this by our hair stylist in Mexico and loved it.  Both my wife and I use it and when we came back to the States we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Looked on Amazon and there it was.  Try it you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This is such a unique hair product.  I am able to give my hairstyle a professionally-styled look just by smacking a dab of Thrill between my hands and applying all over!  If it starts to look limp halfway through the day, I just rough it up a bit and it looks completely fresh and full.  It&#x27;s not sticky or stiff, just gives my hair life!</li>
            <li> Great. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> its great I have used it for  years, and keep trying to find it ! So happy when I do!</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this hair product! As someone with frizzy/naturally curly hair, I can&#x27;t go without this on a humid day. Apply SUPER lightly after straightening. And it smells delicious too!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would give some lift to my hair, but it actually weighs it down.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for my super short hair.  I usually style my hair when it is wet.  I just apply about a dime size amount of this product and spike my hair into a faux hawk and go.  It stays all day even if I run my fingers through it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for years and when he&#x27;s run out has tried other products, but each time he has he&#x27;s always come back to this product.</li>
            <li> Schwarzkopf&#x27;s Osis &#x27;Thrill&#x27; is the only product that works well on my hair. I have short hair and to keep it &#x27;perky&#x27; I need something strong to hold it but I don&#x27;t want it to be stiff and my hair still shines.  I haven&#x27;t found another product to satisfy me as well as Thrill..  I used to get it at the salon but the price kept increasing.  This product is identical to the salon and much more reasonable;  If you need such a product I think you would find it meets your needs surprising well,  I was almost able to purchase 2 cans for what one salon would cost.  I recommend this supplier.</li>
            <li> I used to be weak, shy, and quiet. I was essentially a six foot mop, given the state of my hair. Then I decided to get a haircut, delete my Facebook, and hit the gym. My barber gave my a slick cut, and introduced me to this Osis fiber gum. I immediately bought a jar, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment this stuff hits my hair in the morning, my phone starts blowing up with texts from the dozens of girls that have fallen for me and my hair. My cell phone bill is through the roof. When I forget to wash it out before I go to sleep, I&#x27;m quickly reminded by my phone vibrating next to me, another friend looking to hang out, another girl looking for a night of passion with my new, muscular body and luscious mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am stronger, faster, and smarter than I ever was before. And I owe it all to Osis fibre gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**DO NOT PURCHASE IF IN MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP OR HAVE OBLIGATIONS BEYOND BEING AN INSPIRATION TO ALL HUMANS EVER*</li>
            <li> This is a great product for males with thick hair.  Works great.  I&#x27;ve been using for 3 years and won&#x27;t use any other products. Fast transaction.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve been constantly using for my curls for years! And it&#x27;s awesome! It not only defines my curls but it gives a medium hold while adding thickness and body to my hair! Love love love i!</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve been using it for many years, it is easy with  Osis Thrill Fibre Gum to make your  short hair look stylish.</li>
            <li> Best smelling hairgel ever!</li>
            <li> works great better than she excepted</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and really like it</li>
            <li> A relatively good product. But, I will not order it again. There were mixed reviews on the product so I did not have very high expectations.</li>
            <li> Good product for hair that needs texture.</li>
            <li> Works well for thin, fine hair to give it body throughout the day. I have to use it or my hair falls flat.</li>
            <li> Best price on the internet if you consider shipping. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a short haircut, w/ fine hair. This is the best I&#x27;ve tried. Started using it after my hair stylist used it. Love the stuff. It&#x27;s easy to apply &amp;amp; holds the shape.</li>
            <li> Very high quality fibre gum,  my hair  loos great and natural shine I would definitely recommend for everyone</li>
            <li> just good stuff&amp;#62; if I would have bought this in a salon it would have cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> Great product was delivers on time!&lt;br /&gt;Would order again, thx!</li>
            <li> I love all of the OSIS products.  This is easy to work with and has a great bubble gum smell to it.</li>

My favorite had been Garnier Fructis Fiber Gum Putty, 5.0 Oz until Garnier discontinued the product; I really haven&#x27;t found a suitable replacement yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this OSIS Thrill Fibre Gum on Amazon I decided to give it a try. On the positive side it does hold my hair in place and adds some thickness to my fine hair.  However, I wish the product was a bit thicker - it tends to give my hair a shiny &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; that I&#x27;m not going for.  And this is with using only a small amount of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Schwarzkopf  product, [[ASIN:B007KA804Q Got2b Chaotic Fiber Gum]], seems to work much better for me.  However, as I&#x27;ve continued to use this tin of product up I become happier with it (or perhaps learned how to use it correctly).  I still prefer Got2b Chaotic, but in the future if that is not available I think that Osis Thrill is a viable substitute.</li>
            <li> I received the product as listed in a timely manner.  Very good experience!</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair a nice shine and definition. A must for a cute pixie cut. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong scent. It leaves my hair a little sticky, but not crispy at all. It also works well to revive unwashed hair on those days when you don&#x27;t have time to shower before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> Love it, just as advertised.. Would buy agin</li>
            <li> Osis Thrill Fibre Gum 100ml .Good stuff.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this product.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;The preferred pink goop for my short hair every day.&lt;br /&gt;Will re-order in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously amazing if you have short hair! It gives great texture and bounce to the hair and is honestly the best smelling hair product I&#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li> Love this for volume. Don&#x27;t need a lot?!</li>
            <li> I get a thrill every time I use it.  It&#x27;s so thick and gooey.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the greasy kid stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Osis brand Fibre Gum for over a year now and have enjoyed the hold it puts on my hair without leaving the flakes and rock-hard state of gel.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair styling product. Much, much better to use than hair spray.  My hair dresser used it on me first and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. You use such a small amount that it lasts forever!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t hold short spiky thin hair in place at all.  Might as well use nothing....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair gum instead of gel for a while now because it doesn&#x27;t flake like gel when it dries. Even the next morning my hair will still be held in place for the next part. If you want a wet hair look, you can put it on when your hair is wet. I&#x27;ve found that it holds better if you put it in when your hair is dry, though.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> An hour after application it does absolutely nothing- no hold or texture whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Great great product!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a number of years.  Product provides a strong hold, but does not leave your hair greasy or overly stiff.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> been using for 5 years,  light yet holds your style.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, works like it says it does.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on &amp;#34;holding&amp;#34; my naturally curly hair in place.</li>
            <li> Grab a little and stretch it between your fingers to get the fibers going, then &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; the strands onto hair and work in. Adds tons of texture and body. Smells good too, nice unisex scent.</li>
            <li> I bought the product thinking that a strenght of 3 would hold my hair and model it the way I wanted but in reality it only works with very short hair. If you let your hair grow just a little (and by this I mean 3 weeks after a haircut) it doesn&#x27;t really have any strength.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for almost 10 years and it has always worked great!! Stays in place without that crusty feel and washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;Thx!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin, flyaway hair.  I use just a little in wet hair, then blow dry.  Makes my hair look a lot thicker and holds shape much better have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Thank you, So much.  They got here in time. We travel  around the U.S from R.V parks. And stay 1 to 2 weeks. And I got them, again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again,</li>
            <li> I use it every day, to tame &amp; style my otherwise unruly hair.  Carol Raizin</li>
