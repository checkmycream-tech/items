            <li>Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I swear that your skin will love you for it!!!</li>
            <li>This company went beyond great service.  </li>
            <li>These creams are great moisturizers however NONE of them will cure the aging process.</li>
            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>Regardless, I cannot imagine that makeup could ever look good applied over this.</li>
            <li>needs to be built with heavier material,outside of that its a good product.easy to assemble ,and operate.handy item to have.</li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased with this product ...</li>
            <li>This is an effective product at a really good price.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>All of that sweat is well worth the result!!!  </li>
            <li>it DOES give very good results and this old woman is ever so pleased that she has found it and plans on keeping on using it!</li>
            <li>First I have to agree that this company went beyond great service.</li>
            <li>Anything that is too good to be true.....</li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin, so I ignored that.</li>
            <li>Definately better than risking results of botox.</li>
            <li>I had to remove the top.  </li>
            <li>And it feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>most of us are looking for.</li>
            <li>I am looking to buy more products in their line.</li>
            <li>You see years ago I was a top model</li>
            <li>I have read copious articles on slowing the aging process and many tell you to take control.</li>
            <li>I now have to pay more money for a scar product.  </li>
            <li>More snake oil.</li>
            <li>It works and longer you use it better</li>
            <li>I do use it sparingly more</li>
            <li>you use the more it tingles on the skin.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Not so, it worked very well!!!!</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for very good results ... then this product is definitely for you ....</li>
            <li>The product is already working to lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li>I saw no difference in fine wrinkles, a lift or anything.</li>
            <li>I first saw it on Rachael Ray&#x27;s show and was pleased with the results and ordered it and am pleased that I did ...</li>
            <li>I was sold Wrinkle Repair by a Nutra-Lift representative, who told me it has the highest concentration of ingredients to smooth wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>They also sent 3 emails and shipped a free product with the one I bought.  </li>
            <li>I experienced the same results as the tester on the Rachel Ray show.</li>
            <li>They threw in a free cleanser that said to use \\&quot;2</li>
            <li>While it seemed to smooth and lift my skin, it burned.</li>
            <li>It filled in my mouth wrinkles and took away my drooping jaw line.</li>
            <li>I also had to wait a couple weeks for my product and received a free gift (eye cream.)  </li>
            <li>I also received Advanced Maximun Eye Repair(free gift).</li>
            <li>I had adverse reactions because my skin is so fair, pinky, sensitive.</li>
            <li>Live and learn--if it sound too good to be true...  </li>
            <li>I know this is not for everyone however it really does work!!!</li>
            <li>Nutra-Lift Instant Results is a remarkable product.  </li>
            <li>or when I have special function .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great - it makes my skin feel more supple and it does erase those little lines around my mouth!  </li>
            <li>I rarely order this type of product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good results with it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to look a bit younger.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to order my 2nd jar of this and have been more than satisfied with this product ...</li>
            <li>I received my first order of Instant Results and I absolutely love the product!  </li>
            <li>I waited 1 week and tried it again to have a similar but more severe reaction.</li>
            <li>So now I paid this money and have most of it left unusable.</li>
            <li>but so far seems to smooth the wrinkle away.  </li>
            <li>Mission accomplished!  </li>
            <li>You use small amounts of this cream which seemed good  at first</li>
            <li>They had sent an excuse saying they were flooded with orders and had to make more product.  </li>
            <li>It does pretty much what Botox does without the injections.  </li>
            <li>While I liked at first it became increasing more difficult to use.</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with this company either, they have always been very helpful to me, of course I wasn&#x27;t asking for a refund either and being in sales I can understand why they wouldn&#x27;t refund if you purchased somewhere else because they have to pay a share to others that sell their product.</li>
            <li>Nutra-Lift Instant Results Wrinkle Remover is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>She saw the infomercial and really believed in the product and testimonials.  </li>
            <li>She wants me to return it for a refund.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I see results, I really like the cool feeling it distributes once applied.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could live without this!</li>
            <li>The last time I had a very severe reaction with huge welts and unbearable itchiness that lasted for several days.</li>
            <li>Of the fast improvements for my mature skin in just four days.</li>
            <li>He guaranteed a refund if I wasn&#x27;t pleased, but only if I purchased directly from Nutra-Lift (aka \\&quot;Younger You.)</li>
            <li>Last time I will be gullible to buying a product that promises so much!</li>
            <li>I suspect that the women tested did not usually wear moisturizer, which I do.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products but this one is the only one that has worked so well</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for my adult daughter to see my &#x27;new face&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I do not recall if there was a money back guarantee, but if there is, I would certainly return it.</li>
            <li>My eye lids no longer droop,and I can see clear again after two days.</li>
            <li>It smells rancid, like old cosmetics &amp; lotions.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on this, the contents is like old school glue and does NOT work.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and it burns for a couple of minutes when it is applied.  </li>
            <li>I am a 61 yr old woman</li>
            <li>I tired it again the following morning after a good night&#x27;s sleep and again, no improvement.  </li>
            <li>Buyer beware, this does not work if you are an older woman, I am unsure about younger women.</li>
            <li>Just got this item in the mail as it was back ordered due to heavy demand -- they were nice enough to send a free product also due to the delay.</li>
            <li>I am not some workout guru just a common person who really hates the whole aging thing!!</li>
            <li>The literature that arrived with the product showed before/after photos that clearly were retouched, shot in completely different lighting conditions.</li>
            <li>Hello to everyone fighting back the aging process,    I am 48 years old and have tried virtually every cream out there.</li>

            <li> Hello to everyone fighting back the aging process,    I am 48 years old and have tried virtually every cream out there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a major wrinkle problem (yet!), but there was absolutely no change to what I do have.  </li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m anxious to try it out and have heard nothing but positive feedback from those who are using this product.</li>
            <li> Found out about Nutra-Lift Instant Results Wrinkle Remover on the Rachael Ray  Show and so I ordered, couldn&#x27;t wait for it to come, it did not work on me  at all, a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> My skin was grey and the tone in my body was sagging...  </li>
            <li> For some strange reason my skin has that peachy youthful look that I had in my twenties.  </li>
            <li> When I received this product it appeared to have been previously opened and possibly used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a few days</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands on them)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they got the results they did on The Rachel Ray Show, but I saw absolutely no change after applying this cream.  </li>
            <li> but I received no positive results.    </li>
            <li> I reapplied the Nutra-lift on my face that night (after cleansing with my usual product) to only one side of my face to see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I have waited longer on orders from other companies.</li>
            <li> It might work on other women or mens skin but not mine.</li>
            <li> It made my face feel tight and dry all day!  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this was not what I expected, it burned after I put it on and it left a tingle feeling for a few hours after applying, I may  just be sensitive skin, I was hoping it would do as I have seen on TV.</li>
            <li> Not worth the wait</li>
            <li> This was $60 down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Rachel, you let me down.</li>
            <li> I have purchased things previously but never had an issue before.</li>
            <li> Made the lines () around my mouth a lot less</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the ones with the bad reviews were expecting miracle and there is no such things as absolute miracles ...</li>
            <li> I guess it makes a little bit of a difference.  </li>
            <li> It would not go on evenly, and my skin looked blotchy, uneven.</li>
            <li> You will notice a differance within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This discouraged me so I began to go to the gym everyday.  </li>
            <li> I struggle everyday with where did the years go.    </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my face.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit where I have some wrinkles I am not (fortunately)</li>
            <li> you can watch the video of Dr. Youn, a plastic surgeon, he used this product on a lady and you can plainly see the results for yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to try out the product for another month seeing that I&#x27;m undergoing treatment for skin cancer on my face.</li>
            <li> Just got it this past Monday.</li>
            <li> usually is.  </li>
            <li> Wasted my money!</li>
            <li> However, it has a chalky, dull finish.</li>
            <li> As far as the scent of the product, I don&#x27;t think it smells bad, but if it took away my wrinkles and sagging skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret my purchase in the least.</li>
            <li> The product is thick (gelatinous) &amp; needs a paddle to get it out of the jar.  </li>
            <li> My Neck and Face have tightened and my wrinkles are slowly disappearing with every application.  </li>
            <li> When I asked for a refund, I received a rude email telling me that I should see a Dermatologist, because I must have a \\&quot;serious skin</li>
            <li> lately however I seem to have developed a rash from it; so I am disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> I hate to say this-- old baby vomit.</li>
            <li> At least the container was recyclable!</li>
            <li> But their website sometimes doesn&#x27;t work, and when I call their customer service they are SO rude!</li>
            <li> After three days of looking increasingly worse, my hopes that this would be my go to wrinkle remover vanished.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why they showed a dramatic result.</li>
            <li> There is sometimes a vague tingle/itch temporarily until it starts to work.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say</li>
            <li> Minimal,if any, results--and a customer service rep who told me I had to be wrong because 99% of their customers reorder.</li>
            <li> Also, it has an unpleasant smell like rotting fruit,</li>
            <li> It began to clump making it very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> but it began to clump which made it impossible to spread on the face without clumps.</li>
            <li> A frustrating and worthless experience!</li>
            <li> Very  very very very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> And worst of all, I got zero results.  </li>
            <li> Terribly dissapointed.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> This company went beyond great service.  They called me twice about a delay in production that was not their fault.  They also sent 3 emails and shipped a free product with the one I bought.  I give them the highest recommendation and will continue to do business with them.   Please keep them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I experienced the same results as the tester on the Rachel Ray show. There is sometimes a vague tingle/itch temporarily until it starts to work. Definately better than risking results of botox. Can&#x27;t wait for my adult daughter to see my &#x27;new face&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product at 3 different intervals. After one application, I had some redness and itchiness. I waited 1 week and tried it again to have a similar but more severe reaction. Determined to use Nura-lift, I waited yet another week and tried it again. The last time I had a very severe reaction with huge welts and unbearable itchiness that lasted for several days. I contacted Nutra-lift and was told to return it immediately. But here is my problem - Nutra-lift will not refund my money since I bought it from an Amazon seller. The reply from the Amazon seller is - I can&#x27;t accept anything returned that has been opened. How are you protected from this sort of predicament when you purchase items on Amazon? I have purchased things previously but never had an issue before. If anyone can offer me advice, I would appreciate it. Email me rrhlwilson@comcast.net.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing Rachel Rays show demonstrating the product. While I liked at first it became increasing more difficult to use. It began to clump making it very difficult to use. You use small amounts of this cream which seemed good  at first but it began to clump which made it impossible to spread on the face without clumps. When I asked for a refund from the company they wouldn&#x27;t refund the money because I purchased it from buxnie and buxnie wouldn&#x27;t refund it because it was over the 30 days, there is 3/4&#x27;s of it unused. So now I paid this money and have most of it left unusable.</li>
            <li> I was sold Wrinkle Repair by a Nutra-Lift representative, who told me it has the highest concentration of ingredients to smooth wrinkles and fine lines. He guaranteed a refund if I wasn&#x27;t pleased, but only if I purchased directly from Nutra-Lift (aka \\&quot;Younger You.) The literature that arrived with the product showed before/after photos that clearly were retouched, shot in completely different lighting conditions. Testimonials said results were seen after 6 weeks of use. Since I already had the bottle, I used it every day for 6 weeks with NO results-- nothing. Also, it has an unpleasant smell like rotting fruit, or-- I hate to say this-- old baby vomit. When I asked for a refund, I received a rude email telling me that I should see a Dermatologist, because I must have a \\&quot;serious skin condition.\\&quot; Nutra-Lift placed the fault on me instead of their inferior product. They also refused to refund my money because I&#x27;d used the product over 30 days, as their literature advised. A frustrating and worthless experience!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a few days but so far seems to smooth the wrinkle away.  I apply it and then put my makeup on and seems to make my skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product everytime I use it my face break outs with red rash  I have tried several times but I also have the same result</li>
            <li> This was $60 down the drain.  The product is thick (gelatinous) &amp; needs a paddle to get it out of the jar.  It smells rancid, like old cosmetics &amp; lotions. And worst of all, I got zero results.  It did nothing &#x27;instantly&#x27; or otherwise. Chucked it in the trash after trying it for a week.  I just couldn&#x27;t stand the way I smelled after using it. Last time I will be gullible to buying a product that promises so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to try out the product for another month seeing that I&#x27;m undergoing treatment for skin cancer on my face. However I&#x27;m anxious to try it out and have heard nothing but positive feedback from those who are using this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on Jan 11th and did not receive it until Feb 8th.  They had sent an excuse saying they were flooded with orders and had to make more product.  Well, I wish I had cancelled my order.  I believe the rush to make product to fill orders resulted in a sub-standard cream.  The texture of the cream was somewhat gritty and there were NO INSTANT RESULTS!  They threw in a free cleanser that said to use \\&quot;2 squirts\\&quot; and I could not get it to come out of the bottle.  I had to remove the top.  They also instruct you to the cleanser on your hand for 24 hrs before applying it to the face.  Why?  Wasn&#x27;t this product tested before going to market?  What is in it that may cause someone to have a reaction?    I reapplied the Nutra-lift on my face that night (after cleansing with my usual product) to only one side of my face to see the difference.  I waited 10 minutes and there was NO difference.  I tired it again the following morning after a good night&#x27;s sleep and again, no improvement.  It made my face feel tight and dry all day!  I do not like it at all and do not recommend it.  I do not recall if there was a money back guarantee, but if there is, I would certainly return it.</li>
            <li> Found out about Nutra-Lift Instant Results Wrinkle Remover on the Rachael Ray  Show and so I ordered, couldn&#x27;t wait for it to come, it did not work on me  at all, a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> After seeing this product tested on Rachel Ray&#x27;s show, I decided to try it. Sorry to say but I received no positive results.    I suspect that the women tested did not usually wear moisturizer, which I do. Maybe that&#x27;s why they showed a dramatic result.</li>
            <li> I received my first order of Instant Results and I absolutely love the product!  I use Instant Results in the morning. The product is already working to lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on my face. I can see and feel a difference. I get lots of compliments on the youthfulness of my skin. And it feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> I saw this on Rachel Ray show with Dr. Yuan. Had to try it. Just got it this past Monday. While it seemed to smooth and lift my skin, it burned. I have very fair sensitive skin, so I ignored that. However, it has a chalky, dull finish. I could not apply makeup over this. It would not go on evenly, and my skin looked blotchy, uneven. Makeup sank into my pores, magnifying and enhancing them. My husband refused to kiss my face because of the \\&quot;greasy gunk\\&quot; on it. And too, it is stinky. After three days of looking increasingly worse, my hopes that this would be my go to wrinkle remover vanished. I had adverse reactions because my skin is so fair, pinky, sensitive. Regardless, I cannot imagine that makeup could ever look good applied over this.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! You will notice a differance within a few minutes. It filled in my mouth wrinkles and took away my drooping jaw line. Made the lines () around my mouth a lot less deep.&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> First I have to agree that this company went beyond great service. I will never have a concern about dealing with them. I did have to wait on my order but as I understand they were not expecting the response they received fron RR&#x27;s viewers. I have waited longer on orders from other companies. As for the product I think it works well. Face it, nothing but surgery will bring the results most of us are looking for. I don&#x27;t regret my purchase in the least.</li>
            <li> Just got this item in the mail as it was back ordered due to heavy demand -- they were nice enough to send a free product also due to the delay.</li>
            <li> After seeing Buxnie&#x27;s Nutra-lift Instant Results Wrinkle Remover on the Racheal Ray Show, I decided to order the product and try it for myself. I love it! Not only do I see results, I really like the cool feeling it distributes once applied.</li>
            <li> I also had to wait a couple weeks for my product and received a free gift (eye cream.)  I was skeptical to use them but love both products.  I saw an immediate improvement on my neck and face.  I am looking to buy more products in their line.</li>
            <li> Hello to everyone fighting back the aging process,    I am 48 years old and have tried virtually every cream out there. From Elastiderm to Strivectin.  These creams are great moisturizers however NONE of them will cure the aging process. You see years ago I was a top model so I was struggling with all of this. My skin was grey and the tone in my body was sagging...  I decided about a year ago to take control after several visits to the plastic surgeon looking for answers. I was given advise on bodylifts to botox. This discouraged me so I began to go to the gym everyday.  I have read copious articles on slowing the aging process and many tell you to take control. I decided it was time.  I started walking which led to running as time went by. As a result after one year (there is no such thing as a 90 day plan for a buff body) I had gotten my youth back!!! My skin is rejuvenated and my body is tone. All of that sweat is well worth the result!!!  For some strange reason my skin has that peachy youthful look that I had in my twenties.  I know this is not for everyone however it really does work!!! I am not some workout guru just a common person who really hates the whole aging thing!! I struggle everyday with where did the years go.    SO.... In retrospect my answer is NO cream. (Trust me I have spent thousands on them) It is a matter of taking control and becominhg the healthiest you can be. I swear that your skin will love you for it!!! I also have gotten the pleasure of wearing a bathing suit proudly!  GOOD LUCK to all!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they got the results they did on The Rachel Ray Show, but I saw absolutely no change after applying this cream.  I don&#x27;t have a major wrinkle problem (yet!), but there was absolutely no change to what I do have.  This was a waste of money.  Rachel, you let me down.</li>
            <li> I saw this item on the Rachael Ray show.  So I decided to try it.  However, I don&#x27;t think it is for everyone.  As soon as I put it on, my face burned and it  was red for 4 days - upon which my skin started to peel.   I now have to pay more money for a scar product.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.  REDFACE</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on this, the contents is like old school glue and does NOT work. More snake oil.</li>
            <li> I also saw the Rachael Ray show where the doctor was reviewing several products and he and the woman who tried it recommended Nutra-Lift. I rarely order this type of product but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Minimal,if any, results--and a customer service rep who told me I had to be wrong because 99% of their customers reorder. Live and learn--if it sound too good to be true...  At least the container was recyclable!</li>
            <li> It dried out my face.  I saw no difference in fine wrinkles, a lift or anything. It might work on other women or mens skin but not mine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even want to give it one star!!!  Terribly dissapointed.  Cream was yellow not white and left my face burned.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  I threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Nutra-Lift Instant Results is a remarkable product.  It does pretty much what Botox does without the injections.  I&#x27;ve had good results with it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to look a bit younger.</li>
            <li> Nutra lift   Very  very very very very disappointed. Not worth the wait....I might as well have put water on my face!!!!!&#x27;!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Of the fast improvements for my mature skin in just four days.</li>
            <li> Nutra-Lift Instant Results ... Immediately the worry lines on my forehead were softened ... Along with providing instant hydration to all the face &amp; neck !</li>
            <li> It was a moisturizing cream, but it did not give the results advertised.  I would not but this product again.</li>
            <li> I like the product. But their website sometimes doesn&#x27;t work, and when I call their customer service they are SO rude! I am constantly trying to find the product on Amazon or ebay, so I can avoid them. Wouldn&#x27;t even bother, except that the product actually does work.....Been using it just over a year.....lately however I seem to have developed a rash from it; so I am disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> Not quite whar it was hyped to be.  Anything that is too good to be true.....usually is.  Would not recommend to anyone or buy anoth er.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get suckered in!! They pull you in with an enticing &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; offer and then if you have a life (not sitting around watching a calendar) and dont contact them within 15 days they charge you $85 for the $5 trial!!!</li>
            <li> Did not see the results. Though you get a one month trial period, you only have two weeks to notify the company you do not want the product or you are charged $85.</li>
            <li> This product does work and if you go to Rachel Ray&#x27;s website and go to Tues. 1/11 you can watch the video of Dr. Youn, a plastic surgeon, he used this product on a lady and you can plainly see the results for yourself. I have never had a problem with this company either, they have always been very helpful to me, of course I wasn&#x27;t asking for a refund either and being in sales I can understand why they wouldn&#x27;t refund if you purchased somewhere else because they have to pay a share to others that sell their product. As far as the scent of the product, I don&#x27;t think it smells bad, but if it took away my wrinkles and sagging skin I wouldn&#x27;t care how it smelled. I have tried many other products but this one is the only one that has worked so well and it doesn&#x27;t involve needles.[[ASIN:B000YPZLJG Nutra-lift® Instant Results Wrinkle Remover]]</li>
            <li> Ordered NutraLift thinking wasting my money? Not so, it worked very well!!!! [[ASIN:B000YPZLJG Nutra-lift® Instant Results Wrinkle Remover]]    It is not a miracle!!!! It is a mini miracle in a jar</li>
            <li> Nutra-Lift Instant Results Wrinkle Remover is a fantastic product. I could see results in two days. I also received Advanced Maximun Eye Repair(free gift). The eye repair is out of this world. My eye lids no longer droop,and I can see clear again after two days. I will be buying these products again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this Item before .   It works and longer you use it better you look .  You may have keep it up. Now I use it 3 times a week or when I have special function .  I have heard some people have a reaction to product  so do a test spot on back side of you neck.  In my opinion. I am fifty and have been told I look like i am 38 .  So I would say it in truth takes 5 to ten yrs off . Just depends what shape your skin is in when you start.   becasue Price I do use it sparingly more you use the more it tingles on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was in total amazement after using this for 2 days!  My Neck and Face have tightened and my wrinkles are slowly disappearing with every application.  I don&#x27;t think I could live without this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friend of mine who is in her 60&#x27;s.  She saw the infomercial and really believed in the product and testimonials.  She received it and tried it as per the instructions and saw no results.  I have seen her multiple times and I too see no change in her skin from using this product.  She wants me to return it for a refund.  Buyer beware, this does not work if you are an older woman, I am unsure about younger women.</li>
            <li> Junk!  Wasted my money!</li>
            <li> It has the consistence of creamy wax.  My skin is sensitive and it burns for a couple of minutes when it is applied.  I guess it makes a little bit of a difference.  I will use it up but will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I am a 61 yr old woman and I have been very pleased with this product ... I am getting ready to order my 2nd jar of this and have been more than satisfied with this product ... I have to admit where I have some wrinkles I am not (fortunately) ...overwhelmed by them ... and this does help ALOT ... I first saw it on Rachael Ray&#x27;s show and was pleased with the results and ordered it and am pleased that I did ... I am not sure if the ones with the bad reviews were expecting miracle and there is no such things as absolute miracles ... but if you are looking for very good results ... then this product is definitely for you .... it DOES give very good results and this old woman is ever so pleased that she has found it and plans on keeping on using it!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this was not what I expected, it burned after I put it on and it left a tingle feeling for a few hours after applying, I may  just be sensitive skin, I was hoping it would do as I have seen on TV.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product at a really good price. I get lots of compliments on how well my skin looks after using it, and i will definitely purchase the Instant Results again!</li>
            <li> needs to be built with heavier material,outside of that its a good product.easy to assemble ,and operate.handy item to have.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it appeared to have been previously opened and possibly used.  It smelled rotten and there was no way it could be applied to a face.  Horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great - it makes my skin feel more supple and it does erase those little lines around my mouth!  Mission accomplished!  Now for an anti-aging device to sending me back 10 years!!  :)</li>
