            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>For my kind of hair it is a staple in my cabinet.  </li>
            <li>It does give that nice &amp;#34;at the beach&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was very suprised at how awesome this is.</li>
            <li>I can report that I really like what it does on freshly-shampooed hair; it makes your hair fuller and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the way my hair felt &amp; looked.</li>
            <li>although many disappoint, every once &amp; a while you get a good one.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best sea salt texturizing spray I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It provides wonderful body and looks thicker than it really is.</li>
            <li>It creates that perfect and sexy \\&quot;right from the beach\\</li>
            <li>It is very easy and quick to get a great look from this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I will LOVE the product!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product gives my hair the texture I need to style it any way I want.  </li>
            <li>The product is perfect for fine, mostly straight hair.</li>
            <li>Love Aquage products, wanted a good sea salt spray, this product fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>My main issue was that it didn&#x27;t give my hair any texture and it made my hair incredibly sticky.</li>
            <li>I was really happy with this product (light clean scent) and the results.</li>
            <li>The description and reviews of this product were very accurate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving this product to help thicken my bangs and make them look full!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a product to add volume AND it has a great smell too!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have purchased many many items through amazon</li>
            <li>perfect texturing reminiscent of those summer beach days.</li>
            <li>Again, the product is ok but the packing/shipping can be improved.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay, kinda like... baby powder and sea salt.</li>
            <li>and it really does a great job of taming and controlling the curls.  </li>
            <li>I would love to write a review on this</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sea salt spray.</li>
            <li>I love the fullness this gives to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried others but this brand is top notch.</li>
            <li>When I ran out I checked amazon to see if I could find it for a better price</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>This is my favorite texturizing spray.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It seems like there should be a better way to ship liquids to prevent this.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li>I love the prodect but the spray bottle was broke.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>For people with heavier and thicker hair might work much better.</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for a styling spray that gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Oil of Morocco is OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s moisturizing, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s drying, either.  </li>
            <li>With this product, I am able to get body (without ruining/teasing) and my curls stayed in all day even through ample amounts of wind and sweat.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I also has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, good price.</li>
            <li>Use on mostly dry hair for best results.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair at night, spray this in, twist and pin my hair, and in the morning, I wake up with beachy waves, and very full texture.  </li>
            <li>Test the texture; if you want more, repeat spraying lightly while using the blowdryer.</li>
            <li>This creates a nice texture so that updos stay in place a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, first of all.  </li>
            <li>Gives my fine hair texture so that I can style it.</li>
            <li>The product works fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and it works for me.  </li>
            <li>WIT FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>It works for my fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I would say it smells like cheap shampoo or strong perfumed lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice smell to it, and leaves your hair with gentle, lightly tousled waves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found a product that fits it&#x27;s price and does what I want it too!</li>
            <li>Lightly spray your hair (2-3 sprays)</li>
            <li>FABULOUS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous for curly hair</li>
            <li>The product itself is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I ALWAYS use B&amp;B&#x27;s Defrizz to keep my waves smooth but that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference with this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product probably would work fabulously on someone with shorter, thinner hair</li>
            <li>It is so silky smooth that I can&#x27;t get it to hold curl or even stay put in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it does great thing for my fine hair, but it arrived slightly damaged as it wasn&#x27;t packaged well by the shipper.</li>
            <li>My stylist used this product in my hair at my last cut - it was amazing!</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product at a salon and immediately fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff -- it does make your hair &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; and leaves it pretty shineless</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that my hair looks better on Day 2, and even better on Day 3.  </li>
            <li>so I just sucked it up and kept the product even though the bottle wasn&#x27;t full.  </li>
            <li>I wish the bottle gave more tips on how much to use.</li>
            <li>I love this hair texturizer, it can give me some style to my wavy hair without having to do much.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention you guys always get it to me fast :)</li>
            <li>last summer and loved it,</li>
            <li>This stuff straight up turns you into a sexy surfer god.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this spray would be good for finger styling my short hair, but it does not work well for that purpose.</li>
            <li>It completely  eliminates the need for any kind of curling implement.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and straight so it does not provide enough texture to be as effective as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft, shiney, wavy, and more importantly it does what it says.</li>
            <li>This will now go \\&quot;under investigation\\&quot; to see if I am worthy of a refund or replacement.  </li>
            <li>Works great in my hair when Im late and just need a quick cute hair</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who needs texture in their hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, slick/smooth, and naturally blond hair.  </li>
            <li>great product for a messy look.</li>
            <li>It adds more volume than you&#x27;d think, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>And it works much better on my natural hair vs the dyed hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my natural hair feel thicker at the top.</li>
            <li>&amp; hopefully I will get better results with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It is pricier than some, but very much worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>This fills in the volume right away.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>right amount of volume and control looks natural- easy to use- one or to spritz&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine (like, dandelion fluff fine) and this works well for texture and volume.</li>
            <li>Great product especially if you have fine and/or limp hair.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the first bottle I ordered arrived damaged.  </li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>Lets face it, kelp, sea salt &amp; algea can be pretty narley smelling.</li>
            <li>Lets face it, kelp, sea salt &amp; algea can be pretty narley smelling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products to volumize my hair only to have them be &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; in and of themselves.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it is a personal preference.</li>
            <li>I used to use the beach blonde sea salt spray and loved it, so was trying to find something similar.</li>
            <li>Brought out my natural soft waves without the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; many products deliver.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product from a salon after a major hair change and fell in love with how it gave my hair a little bit more texture and volume.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be used for &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; but you can use it for any style that needs a little more OOMPH!</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and have tried so many things that claim to give you \\&quot;beachy hair\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>Build the texture slowly and make sure your hair is dry before adding more product to prevent it from becoming too sticky.</li>
            <li>I apply a large amount in my towel-dried hair and comb the product through my hair.</li>
            <li>and i get soft frizz free waves although some pieces stay pretty spiral curled because my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>but when it arrived the top was loose</li>
            <li>It creates nice volume and texture, and I think I&#x27;ll be using this a lot this summer, when I like to let my hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, short, hair and my hairstylist recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make hair look dull, just an incredible product overall.  </li>
            <li>will say, this product will probably work for others with a different hair texture than me (fine and straight would probably work best with this) but if your hair is naturally wavy and thick, this will definitely not hold it or keep volume in your hair.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a very  beachy look.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it gets a waxy almost sticky feel.  </li>
            <li>It feels thicker and holds your style much longer.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>Maybe  I used too much..</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>and You don&#x27;t need much to give your hair some beachy texture.</li>
            <li>It really hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This product really separates my curls and gives the appearance of wind tousled hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>When I shampoo my hair, I apply a bit of mousse and then spray in some of this (not too much) and really like the results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it just didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>My straight hair stays in place all day without a tough-up even in humid weather.</li>
            <li>Made my hair really oily.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any \\&quot;matifying\\&quot; effect either that I&#x27;ve had in others.</li>
            <li>This is not a cheap product, and it was supposed to be a nice gift for my BFF.  </li>
            <li>It provides nice texture and volume that will last into the second day after a wash.</li>
            <li>I have 2 other inexpensive favorite products I want to mention (I have tried hundreds with many disappointments) that creates volume with thin color treated straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>It clearly would be better for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I can even brush it out later in the day and my hair will still look nice and shiny, without any dullness or dry appearance.  </li>
            <li>Not worth it to invest more money to return it.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp hair and wanted to try out this brand of sea salt spray based upon the reviews.</li>
            <li>If you have very fine, limp, I recommend KMS Sea Salt Spray.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I just got an email from the seller and they are sending me a new one at no charge!  </li>
            <li>Shipper was fast and bottle was new.  </li>
            <li>I started coloring my hair to give it some volume because as I got older my hair was getting thinner</li>
            <li>I have only used the product twice, but I do like it very much!  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you want to enhance the body and movement of your style.</li>
            <li>Lift and scrunch a little to separate strands for more texture without adding additional spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering today and will update if I find additional tips while styling for myself.</li>
            <li>This product is great--it helps coax a little more wave into my hair, but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky and my hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible but at first it&#x27;s not very pleasant until it fades.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that gets really frizzy if no product is put on it immediately after showering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to now have &amp;#34;good hair,&amp;#34; and I actually like my hair now.  </li>
            <li>This product had a strange smell, but not a particularly bad one.</li>
            <li>My hair is so fine and straight that it simply sits flat to my head at all times.  </li>
            <li>Other comparable products available at the drugstore don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li>This is my fave new product.</li>
            <li>I have used it for quite a long time, and it works well for my fine hair which normally wants to just lie flat against my head, even with a perm.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be more gritty because i&#x27;ve never used this sort of product before</li>
            <li>I expected better packaging and to actually use the product.:</li>
            <li>I was going to purchase again at the same salon, but decided to search on Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time recently.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine, blonde hair and can never get updos to stay put.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic; it gives me the volume that I want and does not weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair - this adds enough texture without making my hair look or feel dirty.&lt;br /&gt;Works with a blow dryer or if you finger/air dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, and I tried it on dry hair a couple days after shampooing for a touch-up blow dry; that didn&#x27;t work out too great.  </li>
            <li>This is a staple for me when I want an easy, slightly messy style.</li>
            <li>It adds interesting texture to my short cut without being sticky or weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li>It is now a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to be oily, and this product is too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair and am always looking for volumizing products that work.  </li>
            <li>Aquage is the only one that seems to have enough of a sea salt component to actually work on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I&#x27;m ALWAYS looking for miracle products for my fine straight limp hair and</li>
            <li>Product leaves your hair feeling natural but keeps it in place.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I have 15 year old color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I am growing out my natural color and have about 3\\&quot; now.</li>
            <li>This was my least favorite result.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and looks natural, not oily.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This spray allows me to completely style my hair in about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>This product smells really good but failed to give me the waviness I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My hair was stringy straight and flat.</li>
            <li>The little wave it had went straight pretty soon after</li>
            <li>The back of my medium-textured, medium-thick hair is cut pretty short - he blew it in all directions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I do use some right after blow drying my hair and then use other styling products to finish off with.</li>
            <li>This has a light, fruity smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine, thin, and straight as a stick.  </li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this to me to try and help my extremely fine yet thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and wanted the beachy wave look like beach blonde gave me.</li>
            <li>fast delivery,  product was what was expected</li>
            <li>All you do is spray liberally into wet hair, and scrunch using a blow dryer - scrunch lightly for waves, and tightly for curls.</li>
            <li>my hair is short-ish, thin, fine, with some natural wave, which this accentuates.</li>
            <li>I uses other Aquage products that I&#x27;m very satisified with.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>Use as little as possible to achieve the right balance.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that would enhance the natural waves of my hair without having to blow dry it every day.</li>
            <li>If you have fine or thin hair, this will definitely give it a boost and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like it has a ton of product on it.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> For my kind of hair it is a staple in my cabinet.  </li>
            <li> It does give that nice &amp;#34;at the beach&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was very suprised at how awesome this is.</li>
            <li> I can report that I really like what it does on freshly-shampooed hair; it makes your hair fuller and wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the way my hair felt &amp; looked.</li>
            <li> although many disappoint, every once &amp; a while you get a good one.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best sea salt texturizing spray I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> It provides wonderful body and looks thicker than it really is.</li>
            <li> It creates that perfect and sexy \\&quot;right from the beach\\</li>
            <li> It is very easy and quick to get a great look from this product.</li>

            <li> The product is perfect for fine, mostly straight hair.</li>
            <li> Love Aquage products, wanted a good sea salt spray, this product fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> My main issue was that it didn&#x27;t give my hair any texture and it made my hair incredibly sticky.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this product (light clean scent) and the results.</li>
            <li> The description and reviews of this product were very accurate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this product to help thicken my bangs and make them look full!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a product to add volume AND it has a great smell too!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased many many items through amazon</li>
            <li> perfect texturing reminiscent of those summer beach days.</li>
            <li> Again, the product is ok but the packing/shipping can be improved.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is okay, kinda like... baby powder and sea salt.</li>
            <li> and it really does a great job of taming and controlling the curls.  </li>
            <li> I would love to write a review on this</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sea salt spray.</li>
            <li> I love the fullness this gives to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried others but this brand is top notch.</li>
            <li> When I ran out I checked amazon to see if I could find it for a better price</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite texturizing spray.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It seems like there should be a better way to ship liquids to prevent this.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I love the prodect but the spray bottle was broke.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> For people with heavier and thicker hair might work much better.</li>
            <li> I will keep looking for a styling spray that gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Oil of Morocco is OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s moisturizing, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s drying, either.  </li>
            <li> With this product, I am able to get body (without ruining/teasing) and my curls stayed in all day even through ample amounts of wind and sweat.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I also has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, good price.</li>
            <li> Use on mostly dry hair for best results.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair at night, spray this in, twist and pin my hair, and in the morning, I wake up with beachy waves, and very full texture.  </li>
            <li> Test the texture; if you want more, repeat spraying lightly while using the blowdryer.</li>
            <li> This creates a nice texture so that updos stay in place a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, first of all.  </li>
            <li> Gives my fine hair texture so that I can style it.</li>
            <li> The product works fine</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and it works for me.  </li>
            <li> WIT FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> It works for my fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I would say it smells like cheap shampoo or strong perfumed lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice smell to it, and leaves your hair with gentle, lightly tousled waves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found a product that fits it&#x27;s price and does what I want it too!</li>
            <li> Lightly spray your hair (2-3 sprays)</li>
            <li> FABULOUS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous for curly hair</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I ALWAYS use B&amp;B&#x27;s Defrizz to keep my waves smooth but that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product probably would work fabulously on someone with shorter, thinner hair</li>
            <li> It is so silky smooth that I can&#x27;t get it to hold curl or even stay put in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it does great thing for my fine hair, but it arrived slightly damaged as it wasn&#x27;t packaged well by the shipper.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this product in my hair at my last cut - it was amazing!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product at a salon and immediately fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff -- it does make your hair &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; and leaves it pretty shineless</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that my hair looks better on Day 2, and even better on Day 3.  </li>
            <li> so I just sucked it up and kept the product even though the bottle wasn&#x27;t full.  </li>
            <li> I wish the bottle gave more tips on how much to use.</li>
            <li> I love this hair texturizer, it can give me some style to my wavy hair without having to do much.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention you guys always get it to me fast :)</li>
            <li> last summer and loved it,</li>
            <li> This stuff straight up turns you into a sexy surfer god.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this spray would be good for finger styling my short hair, but it does not work well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It completely  eliminates the need for any kind of curling implement.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and straight so it does not provide enough texture to be as effective as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft, shiney, wavy, and more importantly it does what it says.</li>
            <li> This will now go \\&quot;under investigation\\&quot; to see if I am worthy of a refund or replacement.  </li>
            <li> Works great in my hair when Im late and just need a quick cute hair</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who needs texture in their hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, slick/smooth, and naturally blond hair.  </li>
            <li> great product for a messy look.</li>
            <li> It adds more volume than you&#x27;d think, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> And it works much better on my natural hair vs the dyed hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my natural hair feel thicker at the top.</li>
            <li> &amp; hopefully I will get better results with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It is pricier than some, but very much worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> This fills in the volume right away.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> right amount of volume and control looks natural- easy to use- one or to spritz&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine (like, dandelion fluff fine) and this works well for texture and volume.</li>
            <li> Great product especially if you have fine and/or limp hair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the first bottle I ordered arrived damaged.  </li>
            <li> Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> Lets face it, kelp, sea salt &amp; algea can be pretty narley smelling.</li>
            <li> Lets face it, kelp, sea salt &amp; algea can be pretty narley smelling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to volumize my hair only to have them be &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; in and of themselves.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it is a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I used to use the beach blonde sea salt spray and loved it, so was trying to find something similar.</li>
            <li> Brought out my natural soft waves without the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; many products deliver.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product from a salon after a major hair change and fell in love with how it gave my hair a little bit more texture and volume.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be used for &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; but you can use it for any style that needs a little more OOMPH!</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and have tried so many things that claim to give you \\&quot;beachy hair\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> Build the texture slowly and make sure your hair is dry before adding more product to prevent it from becoming too sticky.</li>
            <li> I apply a large amount in my towel-dried hair and comb the product through my hair.</li>
            <li> and i get soft frizz free waves although some pieces stay pretty spiral curled because my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> but when it arrived the top was loose</li>
            <li> It creates nice volume and texture, and I think I&#x27;ll be using this a lot this summer, when I like to let my hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, short, hair and my hairstylist recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make hair look dull, just an incredible product overall.  </li>
            <li> will say, this product will probably work for others with a different hair texture than me (fine and straight would probably work best with this) but if your hair is naturally wavy and thick, this will definitely not hold it or keep volume in your hair.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a very  beachy look.</li>
            <li> If you use too much it gets a waxy almost sticky feel.  </li>
            <li> It feels thicker and holds your style much longer.</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> Maybe  I used too much..</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> and You don&#x27;t need much to give your hair some beachy texture.</li>
            <li> It really hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This product really separates my curls and gives the appearance of wind tousled hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> When I shampoo my hair, I apply a bit of mousse and then spray in some of this (not too much) and really like the results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li> My straight hair stays in place all day without a tough-up even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really oily.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any \\&quot;matifying\\&quot; effect either that I&#x27;ve had in others.</li>
            <li> This is not a cheap product, and it was supposed to be a nice gift for my BFF.  </li>
            <li> It provides nice texture and volume that will last into the second day after a wash.</li>
            <li> I have 2 other inexpensive favorite products I want to mention (I have tried hundreds with many disappointments) that creates volume with thin color treated straight fine hair.</li>
            <li> It clearly would be better for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I can even brush it out later in the day and my hair will still look nice and shiny, without any dullness or dry appearance.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it to invest more money to return it.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, limp hair and wanted to try out this brand of sea salt spray based upon the reviews.</li>
            <li> If you have very fine, limp, I recommend KMS Sea Salt Spray.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I just got an email from the seller and they are sending me a new one at no charge!  </li>
            <li> Shipper was fast and bottle was new.  </li>
            <li> I started coloring my hair to give it some volume because as I got older my hair was getting thinner</li>
            <li> I have only used the product twice, but I do like it very much!  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want to enhance the body and movement of your style.</li>
            <li> Lift and scrunch a little to separate strands for more texture without adding additional spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering today and will update if I find additional tips while styling for myself.</li>
            <li> This product is great--it helps coax a little more wave into my hair, but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky and my hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible but at first it&#x27;s not very pleasant until it fades.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that gets really frizzy if no product is put on it immediately after showering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to now have &amp;#34;good hair,&amp;#34; and I actually like my hair now.  </li>
            <li> This product had a strange smell, but not a particularly bad one.</li>
            <li> My hair is so fine and straight that it simply sits flat to my head at all times.  </li>
            <li> Other comparable products available at the drugstore don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> This is my fave new product.</li>
            <li> I have used it for quite a long time, and it works well for my fine hair which normally wants to just lie flat against my head, even with a perm.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be more gritty because i&#x27;ve never used this sort of product before</li>
            <li> I expected better packaging and to actually use the product.:</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase again at the same salon, but decided to search on Amazon first.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time recently.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine, blonde hair and can never get updos to stay put.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic; it gives me the volume that I want and does not weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair - this adds enough texture without making my hair look or feel dirty.&lt;br /&gt;Works with a blow dryer or if you finger/air dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, and I tried it on dry hair a couple days after shampooing for a touch-up blow dry; that didn&#x27;t work out too great.  </li>
            <li> This is a staple for me when I want an easy, slightly messy style.</li>
            <li> It adds interesting texture to my short cut without being sticky or weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It is now a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tends to be oily, and this product is too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair and am always looking for volumizing products that work.  </li>
            <li> Aquage is the only one that seems to have enough of a sea salt component to actually work on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I&#x27;m ALWAYS looking for miracle products for my fine straight limp hair and</li>
            <li> Product leaves your hair feeling natural but keeps it in place.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I have 15 year old color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my natural color and have about 3\\&quot; now.</li>
            <li> This was my least favorite result.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and looks natural, not oily.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This spray allows me to completely style my hair in about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product smells really good but failed to give me the waviness I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My hair was stringy straight and flat.</li>
            <li> The little wave it had went straight pretty soon after</li>
            <li> The back of my medium-textured, medium-thick hair is cut pretty short - he blew it in all directions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I do use some right after blow drying my hair and then use other styling products to finish off with.</li>
            <li> This has a light, fruity smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine, thin, and straight as a stick.  </li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this to me to try and help my extremely fine yet thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and wanted the beachy wave look like beach blonde gave me.</li>
            <li> fast delivery,  product was what was expected</li>
            <li> All you do is spray liberally into wet hair, and scrunch using a blow dryer - scrunch lightly for waves, and tightly for curls.</li>
            <li> my hair is short-ish, thin, fine, with some natural wave, which this accentuates.</li>
            <li> I uses other Aquage products that I&#x27;m very satisified with.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> Use as little as possible to achieve the right balance.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would enhance the natural waves of my hair without having to blow dry it every day.</li>
            <li> If you have fine or thin hair, this will definitely give it a boost and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like it has a ton of product on it.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it, so it can be hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, but this one definitely doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My only critique is after using it daily for about a month, my hair is starting to dry out</li>
            <li> However if you want less body and very soft hair, this might be the product your looking for.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair already, but this spray gave it even more volume., and it costs less than other brands, too.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m never sure how much of this stuff to spray on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bring out its natural waves, but instead seemed to weigh my hair down and make it straighter.</li>
            <li> when it arrived, it was apparent that it had developed a small leak in transit.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it in your hair after you dry it, but the texture of the hair is different.</li>
            <li> They left my hair feeling dry and sticky and my hair did not achieve the desired effect.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and it does the job without weighting my hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair lacks \\&quot;body,\\&quot; and I&#x27;ve used Aquage spray for a long time to add volume.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to long hair</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Love the product but impossible to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but depending on the day and the weather, it may have less wave than on other days.  </li>
            <li> spray then let dry and go at it.</li>
            <li> as* you are blowing it dry.</li>
            <li> I let it dry with a diffuser</li>
            <li> I 1st blow dryed my hair until it was almost dry, then sprayed some product in my hand and disbursed it with my fingers and then finished blow drying.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my roots for volumes and then I spray this on the roots to enhance the waves and get rid of any frizz, and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> before I use any products that tend to dry my hair (like salt sprays)</li>
            <li> I use this on my damp hair before I dry it and also add it to dry hair afterwards.  </li>
            <li> have long (just past my shoulders), naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The 3rd time I blew dried my hair with the defuser until noticebly damp and sprayed a few pumps directly on my hair (5-6) and then continued to dry all the way with the defuser.</li>
            <li> The biggest benefit is you get 8 oz for less than $20 whereas for B&amp;B you get 4 oz for $25 (and that 4oz does not last very long at all!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I found that the Aquage started off looking decent but after a few hours looked limp and even frizzy...</li>
            <li> I was using the Bumble &amp; Bumble surf spray, but was sick of paying too much for a dinky bottle of product that would leave a white salt like residue if you used too much of it.</li>
            <li> I rolled my hair in a bun after spraying it in, which always made it wavy with beach blonde, but this product left my hair with very little wave.</li>
            <li> It gives me phenomenal waves/curls that everyone thinks are a natural &amp;#34;modified Marilyn,&amp;#34; and are shocked to learn that I get it from a bottle!</li>
            <li> I will admit that the Aquage product definitely works, but not the same long-lasting results that B&amp;B has (at least on my hair).</li>
            <li> This product gives a wet look without crunch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Sedu sea spray (too heavy, not enough salt), the Babai stuff, the Bumble and Bumble stuff ... and nothing has come close till now.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with an empty bottle  :</li>
            <li> This is the only styling aid that I have tried that added volume and texture without being heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It is the only spray that lets me do anything with my straight, thin, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> Although the Bumble &amp; Bumble is expensive, the results in comparison to this are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Not smart.  </li>
            <li> Aquage is pricier and harder to find than some other texturizing sprays-</li>
            <li> The 2nd time using I sprayed it directly on my wet towel dried hair (about 6 pumps) and dug out my defuser &amp; blow dried it until dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over due.  </li>
            <li> In other words, SHE has to send me pictures of this</li>
            <li> She lives on the other side of the country from me.  </li>
            <li> I plan to try other styling aids in this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other sea salt sprays and didn&#x27;t see how they made beach waves in my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use any other product.</li>
            <li> The other is schwarzkopf got2b powder&#x27;ful styling powder.</li>
            <li> I may have to try this product in a different way, but styling as usual (with a diffuser)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used any other sea salt products though.</li>
            <li> When my salon closed, I thought I&#x27;d never find it again!  </li>
            <li> It adds texture without making my hair look sticky or dark.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is about the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Not Your Mother&#x27;s is a disaster, and feels as if it ruins my hair.  </li>
            <li> Adds texture without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> When she got it over half of the bottle was gone.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hunt for a decent B&amp;B Surf/Salt Spray continues...</li>
            <li> but it just can&#x27;t hold long, wavy, thick hair without making it look weighed down.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m lazy, I like to let it air dry overnight and use the salt spray (or the surf spray- whatever you want to call it) to hold and volumize my messy curls without making them \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; like some products do.  </li>
            <li> I get nothing but a frizzy, undefined, limp mess.</li>
            <li> I lift up sections of hair, spay underneath, then scrunch a little.</li>
            <li> It adds a little volume just by shampooing your hair.</li>
            <li> Put a little in your palm, dab your fingers and then push them up through your hair.</li>
            <li> Put on a little hairspray if you like, and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> but all I do now is use the Aquage and then follow up with a few sprays of leave-in conditioner on my ends</li>
            <li> A few sprays of this before blow drying</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, so I can only wash it every 3 days</li>
            <li> and it kinda dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> This product is not sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, short hair.  </li>
            <li> This product WORKED by keeping my hairdo fluffy all day.  </li>
            <li> I felt like a grease ball after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Packaging of actual product arrived broken and product had leaked all over the box.  </li>
            <li> but some pieces would get a little stiff looking.</li>
            <li> My thin, dry hair gets some body without being heavy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews that the company can be hard to work with for returns or doesn&#x27;t allow them</li>
            <li> not sticky or stiff</li>
            <li> It is not easy to prove through pictures as the inside of the envelope is padded.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just a bad hair day, but everytime I use it -</li>
            <li> I got this for my hair as I have a hard time keeping it from going limp.  </li>
            <li> I usually use mousse</li>
            <li> Not pleased with feel of my hair</li>
            <li> It also helps to hold curls after I style it because my hair has texture instead of being so slick.  </li>
            <li> so I usually get mine online.</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair was still very limp with no body at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or hard either.</li>
            <li> made it stringy and hard to get a brush through.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair least of all add texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, medium/long kinda thick hair.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as I was hoping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was delivered with a broken nozzle (no cap) making what didn&#x27;t leak out not really useable anyway.</li>
            <li> The lid was taped on and broken.  </li>
            <li> and I see noticeable volume w/o the annoying disadvantages of a lot of other volumizing sprays (e.g., smell, stickiness).  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, it arrive having leaked all over the inside of the package.</li>
            <li> but I quess everything is expensive...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an alternative to Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Surf Spray for a while now because it is just so expensive.</li>
            <li> Unable to use this product.  </li>
            <li> I hated my hair, until the past two years, when I discovered this spray.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> and I hate having to put tons and tons of hairspray in to assist with it.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was very disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gives my hair a very  beachy look. It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or hard either.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Gives my fine hair texture so that I can style it.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be more gritty because i&#x27;ve never used this sort of product before but it seems to make my hair lighter! i love it a lot, it gives texture to my hair while making it look beachy!</li>
            <li> The description and reviews of this product were very accurate.  No surprises.  I have thick naturally curly/wavy hair.  This product gives a wet look without crunch.  It lasts all day.  If you use too much it gets a waxy almost sticky feel.  Use as little as possible to achieve the right balance.  For my kind of hair it is a staple in my cabinet.  Love the product but impossible to find locally.  Have to buy it online or at select hair salons.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tends to be oily, and this product is too heavy. It clearly would be better for dry hair. I will stick with Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray, even though it&#x27;s much more expensive. sigh.</li>
            <li> Aquage Sea Salt Texturizer gives your hair the feel of sea air.  It feels thicker and holds your style much longer.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product at a salon and immediately fell in love with it.  I was going to purchase again at the same salon, but decided to search on Amazon first.  I am definitely happy I made this decision because I was able to purchase this for $5 cheaper online.  I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a product to add volume AND it has a great smell too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sea salt spray that works ever since the John Freida Beach Waves spray was discontinued. I&#x27;ve tried the Sedu sea spray (too heavy, not enough salt), the Babai stuff, the Bumble and Bumble stuff ... and nothing has come close till now. Aquage is the only one that seems to have enough of a sea salt component to actually work on my fine hair. My only critique is after using it daily for about a month, my hair is starting to dry out but all I do now is use the Aquage and then follow up with a few sprays of leave-in conditioner on my ends and it looks and feels great. The product is perfect for fine, mostly straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and have tried so many things that claim to give you \\&quot;beachy hair\\&quot;.... Everything is either sticky, tacky, or makes your hair crunchy. NOT this stuff! It leaves your hair soft, shiney, wavy, and more importantly it does what it says. I also has a nice clean scent. I was using the Bumble &amp; Bumble surf spray, but was sick of paying too much for a dinky bottle of product that would leave a white salt like residue if you used too much of it. I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found a product that fits it&#x27;s price and does what I want it too! :) Finally!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Additionally, the first bottle I ordered arrived damaged.  The seller replaced it without any issues...I have only used the product twice, but I do like it very much!  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do. I have very fine hair and this product gives my hair the texture I need to style it any way I want.  I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who needs texture in their hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews. It did nothing for my hair. made it stringy and hard to get a brush through. My hair was stringy straight and flat. On the upside, the company that ships this product from Amazon, must have read about the issues with the nozzle leaking. It came hand packaged and wrapped to prevent leakage. So the shipper gets 5 stars. The prodct itself-less than 1.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased and sent to my best friend for her birthday.  When she got it over half of the bottle was gone.  They mailed it in an envelope.  Not smart.  Now I have to fill out a form, sign it, and send in pictures to prove it. In other words, SHE has to send me pictures of this then I have to send them to the seller.  She lives on the other side of the country from me.  It is not easy to prove through pictures as the inside of the envelope is padded.  This will now go \\&quot;under investigation\\&quot; to see if I am worthy of a refund or replacement.  This is not a cheap product, and it was supposed to be a nice gift for my BFF.  It is now a huge mess.  I have purchased many many items through amazon and I&#x27;ve never been so dissatisfied until now.</li>
            <li> perfect texturing reminiscent of those summer beach days. spray then let dry and go at it. has a nice pleasant smell which is an added bonus. when it arrived, it was apparent that it had developed a small leak in transit. however, the amount lost did not warrant a return. will buy this again when i run out.</li>
            <li> Product leaves your hair feeling natural but keeps it in place.  I uses other Aquage products that I&#x27;m very satisified with.</li>
            <li> The product works fine but when it arrived the top was loose and I lost some of the product because it had leaked all over in the packing envelop it came in... I read other reviews that the company can be hard to work with for returns or doesn&#x27;t allow them so I just sucked it up and kept the product even though the bottle wasn&#x27;t full.  Again, the product is ok but the packing/shipping can be improved.</li>
            <li> Adds lots of body when styling. Love the smell of this product. I plan to try other styling aids in this line.</li>
            <li> I used to use the beach blonde sea salt spray and loved it, so was trying to find something similar. I have long straight hair and wanted the beachy wave look like beach blonde gave me. This product smells really good but failed to give me the waviness I was looking for. I rolled my hair in a bun after spraying it in, which always made it wavy with beach blonde, but this product left my hair with very little wave. The little wave it had went straight pretty soon after but my hair did smell really nice!</li>
            <li> My stylist used this product in my hair at my last cut - it was amazing! Below are the tips for at-home use he gave:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lightly spray your hair (2-3 sprays) *as* you are blowing it dry. The back of my medium-textured, medium-thick hair is cut pretty short - he blew it in all directions.&lt;br /&gt;- Test the texture; if you want more, repeat spraying lightly while using the blowdryer. Build the texture slowly and make sure your hair is dry before adding more product to prevent it from becoming too sticky. Also, blowing as you spray will keep you from forming a helmet. Your hair should move freely.&lt;br /&gt;- Lift and scrunch a little to separate strands for more texture without adding additional spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering today and will update if I find additional tips while styling for myself.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My hair is super fine (like, dandelion fluff fine) and this works well for texture and volume. The scent is okay, kinda like... baby powder and sea salt. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My hair lacks \\&quot;body,\\&quot; and I&#x27;ve used Aquage spray for a long time to add volume.  I&#x27;m very pleased, &amp; will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This really works.  I have fine, limp hair and am always looking for volumizing products that work.  A few sprays of this before blow drying and I see noticeable volume w/o the annoying disadvantages of a lot of other volumizing sprays (e.g., smell, stickiness).  This has a light, fruity smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming.  Don&#x27;t overuse this and you&#x27;ll see a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and it really does a great job of taming and controlling the curls.  It does give that nice &amp;#34;at the beach&amp;#34; feeling!  Great smell too!!</li>
            <li> I just saw this stuff on Amazon and thought I would try it out -- it&#x27;s great. It provides nice texture and volume that will last into the second day after a wash.</li>
            <li> My sister owed me some money so I told her to buy me a good sea salt spray and this is amazing! I have naturally curly hair that gets really frizzy if no product is put on it immediately after showering. I usually use mousse but some pieces would get a little stiff looking. I have medium to long hair and i get soft frizz free waves although some pieces stay pretty spiral curled because my hair is naturally curly but I&#x27;m never sure how much of this stuff to spray on my hair. I wish the bottle gave more tips on how much to use.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. At first I thought it was just a bad hair day, but everytime I use it - I get nothing but a frizzy, undefined, limp mess. I tend to try a lot of these products and this was definitely not a winner. If you want the \\&quot;just walked off the beach or out of bed\\&quot; look - this will not do it. However if you want less body and very soft hair, this might be the product your looking for.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t sticky- right amount of volume and control looks natural- easy to use- one or to spritz&#x27;s and you are good to go</li>
            <li> Maybe  I used too much.. Not pleased with feel of my hair</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and it does exactly what it says. I apply a large amount in my towel-dried hair and comb the product through my hair. I let it dry with a diffuser and I have perfect, beachy, waves in my hair.</li>
            <li> I would love to write a review on this but when I got it yesterday it had spilled out during shipment and I ended up with an empty bottle  :(&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I just got an email from the seller and they are sending me a new one at no charge!  Excellent customer service and I&#x27;m sure I will LOVE the product!  Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, slick/smooth, and naturally blond hair.  I don&#x27;t know what I did before I had this product.  It adds texture without making my hair look sticky or dark.  A little goes a long way.  It also helps to hold curls after I style it because my hair has texture instead of being so slick.  It also doesn&#x27;t make hair look dull, just an incredible product overall.  I use this every day.</li>
            <li> This is my fave new product. I like the idea of creating volume without a lot of product or stickiness, etc. This does it. It smells great, sprays easily. You don&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it in your hair after you dry it, but the texture of the hair is different. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sea salt spray. I&#x27;ve tried multiple. It&#x27;s light and smells great and gives great volume if you use it on your roots. Love it!</li>
            <li> The white spray cap does not function correctly.</li>
            <li> I love the fullness this gives to my hair. Does not dry my hair out. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this product to help thicken my bangs and make them look full! Great for beach days, light and smells great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, it gives my hair thickness!!!</li>
            <li> Love Aquage products, wanted a good sea salt spray, this product fit the bill.  I have tried others but this brand is top notch.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, limp hair and wanted to try out this brand of sea salt spray based upon the reviews. It did absolutely nothing for me. It did not add any texture or volume. After using this, my hair was still very limp with no body at all. If you have very fine, limp, I recommend KMS Sea Salt Spray. That actually does add volume and texture to your hair. Don&#x27;t get Aquage.</li>
            <li> I use this and have bought for my niece.  I love this hair texturizer, it can give me some style to my wavy hair without having to do much.  I have pretty thick hair and You don&#x27;t need much to give your hair some beachy texture.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this spray before.  I have fine hair, and it works for me.  This seller delivered it to me in a timely manner and in good condition.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I first bought this product from a salon after a major hair change and fell in love with how it gave my hair a little bit more texture and volume. When I ran out I checked amazon to see if I could find it for a better price and of course Amazon came through (as always). Love this product and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product...I would recommend using a couple sprays of spray gel or hairspray to keep the look going all day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite texturizing spray. I lift up sections of hair, spay underneath, then scrunch a little. It smells great, and no crunch. It adds more volume than you&#x27;d think, which surprised me. This is a staple for me when I want an easy, slightly messy style. FYI my hair is short-ish, thin, fine, with some natural wave, which this accentuates.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but depending on the day and the weather, it may have less wave than on other days.  This product is great--it helps coax a little more wave into my hair, but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky and my hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; once it dries.  I can even brush it out later in the day and my hair will still look nice and shiny, without any dullness or dry appearance.  I would recommend this to anyone with wavy hair or those who want that &amp;#34;just came from a day at the beach look&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It gives you that 3 day hair texture. My hair is thin, so I can only wash it every 3 days or it gets frizzy and brittle.  This fills in the volume right away.</li>
            <li> I have shorter, finer hair and was hoping this would have added some texture and volume. It really hasn&#x27;t and it kinda dried my hair out. It probably works for longer hair that you can twist per everyone else&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair - this adds enough texture without making my hair look or feel dirty.&lt;br /&gt;Works with a blow dryer or if you finger/air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other sea salt sprays and didn&#x27;t see how they made beach waves in my hair. They left my hair feeling dry and sticky and my hair did not achieve the desired effect. This product really separates my curls and gives the appearance of wind tousled hair.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this as she is a hairdresser and I am in love and will use it forever! Not to mention you guys always get it to me fast :) Thank you for your great product and shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair at night, spray this in, twist and pin my hair, and in the morning, I wake up with beachy waves, and very full texture.  Yay!</li>
            <li> Lightweight texturizer, scent not too perfume-y. This is easily my 3rd purchase of this product, I find it spot-on for the price.</li>
            <li> fast delivery,  product was what was expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d  been using [[ASIN:B001N9MEFG Philip B Maui Wowie Beach Mist]] last summer and loved it, but I recently switched to the Curly Girl method, which has you using products that are all water-soluble and that don&#x27;t contain sulfates or silicones. Since the Aquage brand is CG-friendly and was recommended on a hair-care forum, I decided to try it out.  I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell to it, and leaves your hair with gentle, lightly tousled waves.  I have fine hair but a lot of it, so it can be hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, but this one definitely doesn&#x27;t.  It creates nice volume and texture, and I think I&#x27;ll be using this a lot this summer, when I like to let my hair dry naturally.  It creates that perfect and sexy \\&quot;right from the beach\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> I have tried many texturizing sprays and this one is the best,  I would definitely recommend this.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Worked so well in my hair!  I have thin, straight hair that is difficult to style and a good friend recommended this product.  This is the only styling aid that I have tried that added volume and texture without being heavy or sticky.  I will order again!</li>
            <li> Excellent volume product for hair.  This is a liquid spray that is neither oily nor foamy.  I have used it for quite a long time, and it works well for my fine hair which normally wants to just lie flat against my head, even with a perm.</li>
            <li> My family loves this product</li>
            <li> FABULOUS PRODUCT IT GIVES YOUR HAIR LOTS OF VOLUME AND SMELLS GREAT.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE WIT FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it it would be like the John Frieda product that was discontinuted years ago. Well itis not. After using this my hair is tacky, sticky and cant even run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous for curly hair</li>
            <li> I was very suprised at how awesome this is. It&#x27;s ridiculous. I&#x27;m a dude, medium/long kinda thick hair. This stuff straight up turns you into a sexy surfer god. My hair will do anything and look damn good. I don&#x27;t need to use any other product.</li>
            <li> Very nice spray and works on curls.. Use on mostly dry hair for best results.</li>
            <li> Best product found for volume.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would enhance the natural waves of my hair without having to blow dry it every day. This really did nothing for my hair. It didn&#x27;t bring out its natural waves, but instead seemed to weigh my hair down and make it straighter. The search continues...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff -- it does make your hair &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; and leaves it pretty shineless but the product gives your hair lots of body and volume.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time recently.  I can report that I really like what it does on freshly-shampooed hair; it makes your hair fuller and wonderful.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, and I tried it on dry hair a couple days after shampooing for a touch-up blow dry; that didn&#x27;t work out too great.  When I shampoo my hair, I apply a bit of mousse and then spray in some of this (not too much) and really like the results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have long, fine, blonde hair and can never get updos to stay put.  This creates a nice texture so that updos stay in place a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> I have 15 year old color treated hair. I started coloring my hair to give it some volume because as I got older my hair was getting thinner (I&#x27;m 44). I am growing out my natural color and have about 3\\&quot; now. I noticed it will not add waves to color treated hair so keep that in mind. And it works much better on my natural hair vs the dyed hair. It makes my natural hair feel thicker at the top. I 1st blow dryed my hair until it was almost dry, then sprayed some product in my hand and disbursed it with my fingers and then finished blow drying. The result was just ok (not impressed but not unhapppy with the look of my hair). The 2nd time using I sprayed it directly on my wet towel dried hair (about 6 pumps) and dug out my defuser &amp; blow dried it until dry. I really liked the way my hair felt &amp; looked. Not as thick as I was hoping but it did add volume. The 3rd time I blew dried my hair with the defuser until noticebly damp and sprayed a few pumps directly on my hair (5-6) and then continued to dry all the way with the defuser. This was my least favorite result. So, I will continue to grow my hair out &amp; hopefully I will get better results with my natural hair. I have 2 other inexpensive favorite products I want to mention (I have tried hundreds with many disappointments) that creates volume with thin color treated straight fine hair. One is Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine. It adds a little volume just by shampooing your hair. The other is schwarzkopf got2b powder&#x27;ful styling powder. This stuff is amazing. Put a little in your palm, dab your fingers and then push them up through your hair. Stay close to the scalp to maximize volume at the roots. Obviously, I&#x27;m ALWAYS looking for miracle products for my fine straight limp hair and although many disappoint, every once &amp; a while you get a good one. Oh, forgot to try and describe the smell of this spray. It&#x27;s not horrible but at first it&#x27;s not very pleasant until it fades. I would say it smells like cheap shampoo or strong perfumed lotion. The ingredient on the bottle for the scent reads: Fragrance (parfum). My opinion is that it needs to be added to cover up some of the \\&quot;sea\\&quot; ingredients. Lets face it, kelp, sea salt &amp; algea can be pretty narley smelling. Hope this was helpful!med lotion. The ingredient on the bottle for the scent reads: Fragrance (parfum).

            <li> This product is not sticky or heavy.  I have fine, thin hair and it does the job without weighting my hair down.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic.  If you have fine or thin hair, this will definitely give it a boost and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like it has a ton of product on it.  The only negative thing I have to say is about the packaging.  When I received the package, the bottle had compressed from the pressure during shipping and about a fourth of the product had leaked inside the packaging.  It seems like there should be a better way to ship liquids to prevent this.</li>
            <li> I have fine, short, hair and my hairstylist recommended this product.  I love it.  It adds interesting texture to my short cut without being sticky or weighing my hair down.  It lasts all day and looks natural, not oily.  A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over due.  Bottle lasts a long time.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have thin, short hair.  I&#x27;ve tried many products to volumize my hair only to have them be &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; in and of themselves.  With the humidity, my hair looked like &amp;#34;helmet hair&amp;#34; within an hour.  This product is fantastic; it gives me the volume that I want and does not weight my hair down.  It holds all day!!!!!!!!!!!  Love it and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I love the prodect but the spray bottle was broke. I emptied the contents into another bottle. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> This product had a strange smell, but not a particularly bad one. My main issue was that it didn&#x27;t give my hair any texture and it made my hair incredibly sticky. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was delivered with a broken nozzle (no cap) making what didn&#x27;t leak out not really useable anyway.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair care products I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or greasy and my hair holds it style even in humid weather. It is a great texturizer it gives you a great \\&quot;bed head\\&quot; look without looking unprofessional or out of control. I have used similar products and none compare.  My husband also uses this product and also loves it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this just didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.  I may have to try this product in a different way, but styling as usual (with a diffuser) it just didn&#x27;t really work for me.  I had heard rave reviews, so it is probably just my hair type.</li>
            <li> The product did not put any texture in my hair at all.  Granted I have fine hair but there was no change.  For the price, I was very disappointed.  Also the packaging by the seller was inadequate leading to the product leaking.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hair as I have a hard time keeping it from going limp.  This product WORKED by keeping my hairdo fluffy all day.  It is supposed to be used for &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; but you can use it for any style that needs a little more OOMPH!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My thin, dry hair gets some body without being heavy and weighed down.  It&#x27;s the only product I use for body.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.  unfortunately, it arrive having leaked all over the inside of the package. I read a similar review, but I figured maybe it was just a fluke.  guess not.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this on Amazon. Bought it after hairstylist used it on my short hair. Adds texture without weighing it down. It&#x27;s all I use now. Threw everything else out.</li>
            <li> This texturizing spray was a delightful surprise. My straight hair stays in place all day without a tough-up even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of hold. Great fragrance</li>
            <li> Made my hair really oily.  I felt like a grease ball after a few hours.  Would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> like this product. Seems to be a bit pricey for the amount you get but I quess everything is expensive...</li>
            <li> I have thick hair already, but this spray gave it even more volume., and it costs less than other brands, too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair least of all add texture. Haven&#x27;t used any other sea salt products though. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the brand or just the product itself that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great product especially if you have fine and/or limp hair. And of course if you like the &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; look, then just spray in and go!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this spray would be good for finger styling my short hair, but it does not work well for that purpose. My hair is very fine and straight so it does not provide enough texture to be as effective as I was hoping for. For people with heavier and thicker hair might work much better. I do use some right after blow drying my hair and then use other styling products to finish off with. I will keep looking for a styling spray that gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it does great thing for my fine hair, but it arrived slightly damaged as it wasn&#x27;t packaged well by the shipper.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell. It works perfectly but I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again. A friend at work loves the smell so I&#x27;m sure it is a personal preference.</li>
            <li> not for people with lots of hair</li>
            <li> Great delivery! I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like it and only gave it four stars because I don&#x27;t know how it compares to similar products for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best sea salt texturizing spray I&#x27;ve found.  It is pricier than some, but very much worth it to me.  I did not at all inherit good hair genes. My hair is baby fine, thin, and straight as a stick.  I hated my hair, until the past two years, when I discovered this spray.  This spray allows me to completely style my hair in about 5-7 minutes. It completely  eliminates the need for any kind of curling implement. It gives me phenomenal waves/curls that everyone thinks are a natural &amp;#34;modified Marilyn,&amp;#34; and are shocked to learn that I get it from a bottle! It provides wonderful body and looks thicker than it really is. I was surprised to find that my hair looks better on Day 2, and even better on Day 3.  My niece also has had the same experience. Aquage is pricier and harder to find than some other texturizing sprays- so I usually get mine online. But it works amazingly well, and, in my opinion, is the best on the market. It is very easy and quick to get a great look from this product. It&#x27;s fun to now have &amp;#34;good hair,&amp;#34; and I actually like my hair now.  Other comparable products available at the drugstore don&#x27;t even come close. Oil of Morocco is OK. Not Your Mother&#x27;s is a disaster, and feels as if it ruins my hair.  All you do is spray liberally into wet hair, and scrunch using a blow dryer - scrunch lightly for waves, and tightly for curls. Put on a little hairspray if you like, and you&#x27;re done. Good for the evening, as well as daytime.  You will definitely like this product.</li>
            <li> My wife says: I love this stuff!  It is the only spray that lets me do anything with my straight, thin, limp hair.  When my salon closed, I thought I&#x27;d never find it again!  So happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this product (light clean scent) and the results. Brought out my natural soft waves without the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; many products deliver. I highly recommend this product if you want to enhance the body and movement of your style.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, first of all.  I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s moisturizing, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s drying, either.  It works for my fine, wavy hair.  I blow dry my roots for volumes and then I spray this on the roots to enhance the waves and get rid of any frizz, and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> great product for a messy look.</li>
            <li> Shipper was fast and bottle was new.  Works great in my hair when Im late and just need a quick cute hair-do Good buy</li>
            <li> This works so well and does not have an overpowering smell.  My hair is not curly, but if I use this spray I can make it look like beachy waves.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. My hair does not do body or curl well and I hate having to put tons and tons of hairspray in to assist with it. With this product, I am able to get body (without ruining/teasing) and my curls stayed in all day even through ample amounts of wind and sweat. Also, it smells very good!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, good price.</li>
            <li> best stuff i ever used.full hair and hair stays in place with this product. i love it. no hair spray necessary.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an alternative to Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Surf Spray for a while now because it is just so expensive. However, I have found NOTHING that works on my hair like B&amp;B&#x27;s. After reading reviews of the Aquage Sea Salt Spray, I thought I had maybe found my ideal alternative. I will admit that the Aquage product definitely works, but not the same long-lasting results that B&amp;B has (at least on my hair). The biggest benefit is you get 8 oz for less than $20 whereas for B&amp;B you get 4 oz for $25 (and that 4oz does not last very long at all!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (just past my shoulders), naturally wavy hair. When I&#x27;m lazy, I like to let it air dry overnight and use the salt spray (or the surf spray- whatever you want to call it) to hold and volumize my messy curls without making them \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; like some products do.  Of course, everyone&#x27;s hair is different so you may have different results but I found that the Aquage started off looking decent but after a few hours looked limp and even frizzy...before I use any products that tend to dry my hair (like salt sprays) I ALWAYS use B&amp;B&#x27;s Defrizz to keep my waves smooth but that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference with this. And, depending on the weather, the frizziness could happen immediately. With Aquage I found that I had to refresh my &#x27;do midday or put it up in a bun to hide what a disaster it actually looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, this product will probably work for others with a different hair texture than me (fine and straight would probably work best with this) but if your hair is naturally wavy and thick, this will definitely not hold it or keep volume in your hair. I didn&#x27;t really notice any \\&quot;matifying\\&quot; effect either that I&#x27;ve had in others. However, the product does smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product probably would work fabulously on someone with shorter, thinner hair but it just can&#x27;t hold long, wavy, thick hair without making it look weighed down. Although the Bumble &amp; Bumble is expensive, the results in comparison to this are well worth it. Unfortunately my hunt for a decent B&amp;B Surf/Salt Spray continues...</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> Packaging of actual product arrived broken and product had leaked all over the box.  The lid was taped on and broken.  Not worth it to invest more money to return it.  Unable to use this product.  I expected better packaging and to actually use the product.:(</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel. not sticky or stiff</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this to me to try and help my extremely fine yet thick hair.  My hair is so fine and straight that it simply sits flat to my head at all times.  It is so silky smooth that I can&#x27;t get it to hold curl or even stay put in a ponytail.  This is my heaven sent product to fix all my problems.  I haven&#x27;t been one day without this product since and it works great for adding texture without sticky stiffness.  I use this on my damp hair before I dry it and also add it to dry hair afterwards.  Best product ever.</li>
