            <li> product not as described</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great. Great for clearing negative energy and refreshing spaces.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Works Great! My Feng Shui consultant and I have tested this product and it works great at clearing energy.This product is perfect for people who are sensitive to fragrances and smoke because the light clean scent disappears rapidly!</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged... loved samples...wish scent lasted longer. Doesn&#x27;t work.....</li>
            <li> Great way to cleanse negative energy without smoke. I also received three small samples of other sprays and I liked the prosperity product and I ordered that too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell. I wish it is a little cheaper, then I will use this more daily.</li>
            <li> Wonderful sage mist for when you cannot smudge with smoke. I use this around the house, and it smells and feels wonderful. Planning to use in my car and camper as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> This Is Sooooo Wonderful, I shall get some more! Thank You so much for Your Creation! Blessings!</li>
            <li> I was really in need of doing some smudging and  I needed to do it before my burning sage was going to show up so I ordered this.  I didn&#x27;t expect to love it so much.  I spray this stuff all the time.  Whenever I need a pep up, whenever someone I don&#x27;t like comes over, after they leave of course, Not as solemn as a burning event but it just smells so good.  Which I have never thought of burning sage.  I thought I would use this sparingly and use the bottle up and never reorder, but i suspect I will end up reordering . It is a generously large bottle, So I have a lot of use left So very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s just not convenient to get out the smudge stick, light it and worry about the ashes and smoke.  But this product takes out all the inconvenience with a simple to use spray you can use anytime, anywhere!  It makes it super easy to clear and cleanse a room (or yourself) quickly and the scent is not overpowering either!  It&#x27;s a PERFECT item for energy workers, healers and massage therapists to keep on hand in their healing rooms!  I LOVE it!!! :-)</li>
            <li> As Described.  Very Nice Scent</li>
            <li> This product smells clean, fresh and inviting. It is a more appropriate product for use in my office. I will also begin using it at home I finish using up my traditional sage burning products.</li>
            <li> neice uses it for monster spray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently experienced the Sage Smudge Spray and Body Mist spray and love the convenience of clearing a room when using a smudge sage stick isn&#x27;t an option due to the smoke.&lt;br /&gt;Mel McCarthy</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleansing my crystals or protecting myself on the go</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I truly believe in the re-energizing effects of smudging a room. Usually I burn white sage and use the smoke to smudge the room, but was told about this sage smudge spray and decided to give it a try. I just moved into a new apartment and wanted to cleanse the entire space. I used the spray and loved the way it smelled. No more smoky, burnt tree smell, now I have this fresh smell that lingers just enough to make you feel good, but without being a distracting odor. Best of all, it had the re-energizing, cleansing effects of the smoke. I love the way my apartment &amp;#34;feels.&amp;#34; This spray is less expensive and easier to use than the other way.</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance ...Positive energy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff,  easy way to smudge a room or home ...wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smelled great....room spray makes Smudgingpossible,where traditional ways are not allowed.....</li>
            <li> I love Ja&#x27;Mi products.  I use many of them.  This Sage Smudge Mist is very nice to use before a yoga class. I feel it cleans the air in the room.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the clean smell. Excellent alternative to lighting a sage stick.</li>
            <li> Great product and value, plus the free miniature samples are great to carry with me. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great for places where you can&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> Smells nice, I&#x27;ve been spraying it daily on me and on things and in areas that need some sage cleansing. I recommend this handy spray mist. I already reordered another bottle</li>
            <li> I am very happy I purchased this product.  It smells wonderful and it definitely leaves the area feeling lighter.  The shipping was quick also.</li>
            <li> I use this wonderful mist in my Reiki shop to keep the energy clear. I LOVE IT !!!! It enables me to keep my space clear without the smoke of burning sage, therefore no allergy issues for clients. A must have from now on !!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle. The spray mist of sage is very soothing, calming, &amp; easy to breathe in without it overpowering the room. I spray it on our bed before we get in and it real is peaceful. The 3 free samples are great scents too. This will probably be a staple in our home over the other products from the stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product delivered as promised in perfect condition.  The fragrance is quite soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Very good quality of the product. Would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> For New Years I have always liked to clear the year, say goodbye to the old., welcome in the New and burn a sage smudge for that nice cleansing smell; and I love that smell so much but of course one cannot do that in say a yoga class, or in a hotel room as I travel a lot for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this item and decided to purchase. It was not until after I bought it that I realized it contained two bottles and they are both generously  sized 4 ounce bottles  -compact enough  for travel but these will last me some time! The smell is wonderful; subtle, calming and cleansing! It creates a pleasant relaxed environment and I cannot wait to spray on my yoga towel next practice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set also came with not one but two mini freebie sets - each contains three bottles of their other scents: Prosperity which has a warm spicy scent  -the cinnamon and ginger really come through.  Soothing lavender mist which is really relaxing and will make a great pillow spray!  And my favorite - Rejuvenate  - massage and body oil! I love this so much I am going to buy a full size too - Frankincense is one of my favorite scents ever and mixes well with the peppermint and eucalyptus! It smells simply amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most amazing thing about these products is the price for the size and quality you get! Many companies charge much more for much less and their quality is nowhere near the quality of this! My new favorite company!! What a great find for the New Year!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Ja&#x27;Mi products!</li>
            <li> Liked the fragrance! Very calming!🌌</li>
            <li> My name is Christine Brisco, I am a Reiki Master in Las Vegas, I have used this product for many years, and I highly recommend this product, this product is used  in place of sage that you burn, you can use this spray anywhere in your practice for those that are allergic to smoke, you can also take this spray to your office or place of business to clear the energy, as I said I have used this product for many year, I just love it, and so will you enjoy.</li>
            <li> Smells great, very potent, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I said these products are the best on the market!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and the fragrance is lovely not overpowering.  My only complaint is that it said it came with travel size sample as well and it did not.</li>
            <li> Received order by the delivery date stated. Love the scent and feeling when I spray.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!  So happy because I can now use it for work without people knowing what I am doing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!!</li>
