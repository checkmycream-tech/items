    <ol>
            <li>Pacifica has some wonderful offerings for a very-affordable price.</li>
            <li>I smell delicious!</li>
            <li>This smells so good !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant, but not at all what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I had received one as a gift in April, and was delighted to find a replacement on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>THE FRAGRANCE IS AMAZING AND</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spicy but not in a hippie headshop too much kind of way.</li>
            <li>The description mentions how yummy and warm it smells, but it smells like neither cinnamon nor chocolate.</li>
            <li>spicy cinnamon scent with a hint of rich cocoa, great layered with the Pacifica Coconut Nectar for a decadent winter scent.</li>
            <li>This scent is way more floral than it is cocoa.  </li>
            <li>This scent reminds me of campfires and smores :)</li>
            <li>I love this scent</li>
            <li>The smell of the cocoa mixed with the cinnamon was delightful.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a terrible scent</li>
            <li>but I love the scent of chocolate/cocoa perfumes and this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>, more musk&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li>LOVE THE COMPLIMENTS.......</li>
            <li>This perfume has more cinnamon and almond scents.</li>
            <li>This perfume is very nice - friends and neighbors appreciated the fragrance on me.  </li>
            <li>Warm and spicy and rich with chocolate goodness.  </li>
            <li>I use this scent with the &amp;#34;Halloween&amp;#34; OR &amp;#34;moon and stars&amp;#34;  that makes for an incredibly wonderful unusual but pretty unique scent</li>
            <li>Nutmeg is quite pronounced when first sprayed, but be sure to let it mellow!</li>
            <li>When I first applied this, I thought I liked it.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic fall scant.</li>
            <li>Their perfumes are fabulous.</li>
            <li>and I do enjoy it -</li>
            <li>I adore this unique, fragrant, delectable scent.</li>
            <li>I usually get and this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited by the description of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a lover of chocolate scents, it&#x27;s certainly worth checking out!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet spicy- but not too sweet to be a dessert- smell.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I thoroughly enjoy most Pacifica products, and everyone&#x27;s taste in fragrances is different.</li>
            <li>After that smell goes away the actual perfume is very light.  </li>
            <li>I expected more of a sweet, spicy, foody scent.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was going to love Mexican Cocoa</li>
            <li>First of all, I NEVER wear perfume.</li>
            <li>It has a light chocolate under tone, but top notes are slightly flowery.</li>
            <li>it layers nicely with other chocolate and vanilla scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really on the fence with this, I expected a warm cocoa scent &amp;</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;alcohol-ish\\&quot; odor that occurs when you first spray the product is very nauseating to the point that I don&#x27;t want to wear it.  </li>
            <li>but unfortunately so few of the available scents are available in stores.</li>
            <li>The product itself was packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>It IS however very pleasing and not at all &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I found it very appealing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is very spicy, I do wish they lasted longer</li>
            <li>No matter how much I like them in the bottle, I feel like they&#x27;re always nauseating to wear.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a very chocolatey aroma, but it is nothing like that.</li>
            <li>When I initially received the Mexican Cocoa scent, I liked it.</li>
            <li>Dries down to an incredibly comforting dark chocolate.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing it from Whole Foods and received numerous compliments on the unique fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to try the Pacifica Mexican Cocoa Spray Perfume.</li>
            <li>but it is far less cocoa scented than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I wanted something different from the fruity sweet candylike smells</li>
            <li>it hoping that it wasn&#x27;t going to turn out like every other perfume, and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>This smells less like cocoa and more like almond.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this perfume, because I&#x27;ve been seeking a chocolate-cinnamon scent for a long, looong while now.</li>
            <li>and I still smell it , I love that its different than anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled in a perfume ,and I can definitely smell the cocoa in it, as one review said they couldn&#x27;t smell anything chocolate about it its definitely there.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favourite chocolate scents by far!</li>
            <li>I was absolutely horrified when I tried the Mexican Cocoa from Friki Tiki.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy it directly from Pacifica.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty scent, but it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>even better to mix with other scents since it&#x27;s not overly heavy.</li>
            <li>careful when spraying, I sometimes find my skin is red for 20 minutes or so after spraying it if I use it right out of the shower (when I always use perfume) probably due to the large percentage of cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li>I love Mexican Cocoa and have been wearing it almost daily for at least 3 years...  </li>
            <li>While I love chocolate fragrances, some of them can be sickly, sugary sweet.  </li>
            <li>But I saw this perfume in Mexican Cocoa at our local natural pharmacy</li>
            <li>The scents of natural perfumes don&#x27;t last as long as synthetic ones, but if you spray Pacifica in your hair and on your clothes it helps the scent last longer.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The fragrance dried down quickly and seemed to intensify as it did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far less offensive if I do the spray and walk through and</li>
            <li> After a few uses it started to smell off to me, like the scent was fading down to a cheap imitation baking vanilla scent or something similar (hard to describe).</li>
            <li> A dry, semi-sweet cocoa.</li>
            <li> It is far too strong and no chocolate at all :(</li>
            <li> Smells like dirty underarms mixed with something sweet.</li>
            <li> it is weak--- and there is no way that it is the real thing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Package came as expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problem whatsoever with this product.</li>

            <li> however it seems that though I can&#x27;t always smell it other people compliment me on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Trying a new scent by shopping online is probably just not a great idea</li>
            <li> I was left with an overpowering cinnamon smell that would not wash off no matter how hard I tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I love this, hate this or what.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavily cinnamon scented with a bit of almond and extremely potent though it doesn&#x27;t seem to last terribly</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours it seemed to have just disappeared.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sorry but on my skin (scents are very individual)</li>
            <li> Just when I think the staying power is questionable, I detect it on myself much later in the day.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little dark but more bittersweet than sad or evil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth living through the terrible initial smell for a perfume you can barely smell afterward.  </li>
            <li> The initial smell is so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t even consider giving it away as a gift.  </li>
            <li> I promise you that it not only smells bad-</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Pacifica.</li>
            <li> YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY.....</li>
            <li> Everyone (4 people) who have smelled it thinks it stinks.</li>
            <li> really bad smell not cocoa at all</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> Not like fake chemicals or some nasty Glade spray.</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is awful.</li>

            <li> First, let me say that I thoroughly enjoy most Pacifica products, and everyone&#x27;s taste in fragrances is different. When I initially received the Mexican Cocoa scent, I liked it. After a few uses it started to smell off to me, like the scent was fading down to a cheap imitation baking vanilla scent or something similar (hard to describe). May work for some people, just wasn&#x27;t for me. The product itself was packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Smells like dirty underarms mixed with something sweet. Everyone (4 people) who have smelled it thinks it stinks.</li>
            <li> spicy cinnamon scent with a hint of rich cocoa, great layered with the Pacifica Coconut Nectar for a decadent winter scent.</li>
            <li> I hate to give away my secret but this Pacifica Cocoa is great for a light dusting as is...or..even better to mix with other scents since it&#x27;s not overly heavy. It IS however very pleasing and not at all &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; scented which was my fear. The scent is a little dark but more bittersweet than sad or evil. It&#x27;s spicy but not in a hippie headshop too much kind of way. It&#x27;s sweet spicy- but not too sweet to be a dessert- smell. I found it very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;Ok. I&#x27;ll share. I use this scent with the &amp;#34;Halloween&amp;#34; OR &amp;#34;moon and stars&amp;#34;  that makes for an incredibly wonderful unusual but pretty unique scent but I&#x27;m looking forward to layering it with others as well. There you have it. Exotic with a touch of whimsy or is it whimsical with a touch of exotica? Whatever.</li>
            <li> This scent is way more floral than it is cocoa.  I expected more of a sweet, spicy, foody scent.  It&#x27;s pleasant, but not at all what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to love Mexican Cocoa but it is far less cocoa scented than I would have liked. It&#x27;s very heavily cinnamon scented with a bit of almond and extremely potent though it doesn&#x27;t seem to last terribly long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when spraying, I sometimes find my skin is red for 20 minutes or so after spraying it if I use it right out of the shower (when I always use perfume) probably due to the large percentage of cinnamon oil.

            <li> The \\&quot;alcohol-ish\\&quot; odor that occurs when you first spray the product is very nauseating to the point that I don&#x27;t want to wear it.  After that smell goes away the actual perfume is very light.  It&#x27;s not really worth living through the terrible initial smell for a perfume you can barely smell afterward.  If you do use it I would suggest maybe hanging a shirt outside and spraying it on.  Then putting the shirt on later in the day.  But that seems like a pain.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and it will probably sit in a drawer.  The initial smell is so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t even consider giving it away as a gift.  My suggestion is to stick with the candles.</li>
            <li> I am sorry but on my skin (scents are very individual) this smelled like hairspray from the 60s with a marzipan finish. Very unpleasant and I never wear it. However the bendor did ship it promptly. Trying a new scent by shopping online is probably just not a great idea but unfortunately so few of the available scents are available in stores.</li>
            <li> I love Mexican Cocoa and have been wearing it almost daily for at least 3 years...  I have been purchasing it from Whole Foods and received numerous compliments on the unique fragrance.  Since they recently discontinued it, I sought an online source&lt;br /&gt;  I was absolutely horrified when I tried the Mexican Cocoa from Friki Tiki.&lt;br /&gt;It is awful. I promise you that it not only smells bad- it is weak--- and there is no way that it is the real thing!&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Buy it directly from Pacifica.</li>
            <li> I adore this unique, fragrant, delectable scent. Only Pacifica has it. I&#x27;ve never found anything even close to it. It&#x27;s my signature fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Package came as expected. Absolutely no problem whatsoever with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic fall scant. Warm and spicy and rich with chocolate goodness.  This scent reminds me of campfires and smores :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this perfume, because I&#x27;ve been seeking a chocolate-cinnamon scent for a long, looong while now. The description mentions how yummy and warm it smells, but it smells like neither cinnamon nor chocolate. Intact it smells almost exaclty like patchouli and a dash of cloves. Not at all &amp;#34;Mexican cocoa&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t even like patchouli! It is far too strong and no chocolate at all :( I can not  even return it because perfume is a flammable substance and can not be re-shipped to the seller!</li>
            <li> This smells so good !spicy cocoa smell! I wanted something different from the fruity sweet candylike smells I usually get and this one is awesome. I sprayed it one time maybe an hour ago and I still smell it , I love that its different than anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled in a perfume ,and I can definitely smell the cocoa in it, as one review said they couldn&#x27;t smell anything chocolate about it its definitely there. But, perfumes smell different on everyone 😊</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Pacifica. Their perfumes are fabulous. This is one of my favorites. The scents of natural perfumes don&#x27;t last as long as synthetic ones, but if you spray Pacifica in your hair and on your clothes it helps the scent last longer.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of the Pacifica fragrances and I will mix them with other scents. I love this scent it is very spicy, I do wish they lasted longer however it seems that though I can&#x27;t always smell it other people compliment me on the fragrance. I would try it for the price it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is very nice - friends and neighbors appreciated the fragrance on me.  I had received one as a gift in April, and was delighted to find a replacement on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I was so excited by the description of this fragrance.  While I love chocolate fragrances, some of them can be sickly, sugary sweet.  When I first applied this, I thought I liked it.  The smell of the cocoa mixed with the cinnamon was delightful.  The fragrance dried down quickly and seemed to intensify as it did.  I was left with an overpowering cinnamon smell that would not wash off no matter how hard I tried.  When my husband arrived home that evening and I gave him a hug, he pulled away and said, &amp;#34;did you spill something on yourself?&amp;#34;.  He said I smelled like something spilled from the baking extracts shelf at the grocery store.  I pitched the bottle in the garage garbage can that night.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favourite chocolate scents by far! A dry, semi-sweet cocoa. Nutmeg is quite pronounced when first sprayed, but be sure to let it mellow! Dries down to an incredibly comforting dark chocolate. Just when I think the staying power is questionable, I detect it on myself much later in the day. Pacifica has some wonderful offerings for a very-affordable price. If you&#x27;re a lover of chocolate scents, it&#x27;s certainly worth checking out!</li>
            <li> This smells less like cocoa and more like almond. That&#x27;s not a terrible scent and I do enjoy it - but I love the scent of chocolate/cocoa perfumes and this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> really bad smell not cocoa at all, more musk&lt;br /&gt;so bad I had to wash it off  tossed it in the trash</li>
            <li> First of all, I NEVER wear perfume. No matter how much I like them in the bottle, I feel like they&#x27;re always nauseating to wear. But I saw this perfume in Mexican Cocoa at our local natural pharmacy and I was blown away. It smells like Chocolate! Mexican Cocoa in fact! Not like fake chemicals or some nasty Glade spray. I bought it hoping that it wasn&#x27;t going to turn out like every other perfume, and I was not disappointed! I smell delicious! The only downside might be that I&#x27;m walking around holding my arm up to my face and breathing in the chocolatey goodness. It&#x27;s so good!</li>
            <li> THE FRAGRANCE IS AMAZING AND SO TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE COMPLIMENTS.......GET THE BODY WASH AND THE&lt;br /&gt;BODY BUTTER...YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY.....</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mexican Cocoa scent. It has a light chocolate under tone, but top notes are slightly flowery. I&#x27;m not sure if I love this, hate this or what. It&#x27;s a pretty scent, but it didn&#x27;t last very long. After a few hours it seemed to have just disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really on the fence with this, I expected a warm cocoa scent &amp; this wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to try the Pacifica Mexican Cocoa Spray Perfume. I was hoping for a very chocolatey aroma, but it is nothing like that. This perfume has more cinnamon and almond scents. After it&#x27;s been on a while you do get a chocolate undertone. I will not purchase this fragrance again.</li>
