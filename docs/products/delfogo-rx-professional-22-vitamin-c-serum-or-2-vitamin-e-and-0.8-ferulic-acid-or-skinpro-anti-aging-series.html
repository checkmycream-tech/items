            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying a fair price for anything that lives up to its advertisement.</li>

            <li>and I’m happy to say I am pleased.</li>
            <li>With both Perricone and Skinceuticals both selling for over $100, they better have a great formula.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>A much better deal!</li>
            <li>This serum is full of Vitamin which I like and is ideal for skin discoloration and age spots.</li>
            <li>This price is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Once the Vitamin C toner/serum soaks in it really gives my face a wonderful glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps me looking good, reduces the bags under my eyes, and keeps me healthy and energized.</li>
            <li>Using this anti-aging serum is the finishing touch to start my day looking as good and healthy as I aim for.</li>
            <li>used to use Juice Beauty serum, which I liked -</li>
            <li>I feel good about using this product knowing it is a natural option, and the price is great for my pocketbook, too!</li>
            <li>Saving money is nice bonus as well.</li>
            <li>I was kind of resigned to the bags and raccoon</li>
            <li>/&gt;It had been about two years since I had used any kind of product on my face when I was introduced to DelFogo.</li>
            <li>At this point in using them I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Then I heard about Delfogorx Professional Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum, and was impressed that it had been proven to reverse sun damage through doctor and pharmacist testing.</li>
            <li>Delfogo Vitamic C serum is, by far, the best over-the-counter ant-aging treatment there is.</li>
            <li>My natural skin is at its best while using this!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good reason why Vitamin C Serum 22% isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>I have pretty great skin</li>
            <li>This skin product also helps to prevent UV damage which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>This is huge!  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the results and will reorder this product.</li>
            <li>Over the course of time, I sustained many burns to my skin.</li>
            <li>I know many people use this serum to prevent wrinkles and to reverse aging.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother, healthier, and more radiant than before.</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>The end result is unmatched antioxidant protection, hence more youthful looking</li>
            <li>Most beauty products are 65 – 85% water, but with 22% Vitamin C, I knew I was getting a potent product.  </li>
            <li>so I know I’m getting even more protection.  </li>
            <li>And I love the dropper.  </li>
            <li>The price was inexpensive compared to many skin products, so I ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin looked firmer and more youthful within days of using the product, and I could feel the serum working on my skin.</li>
            <li>Best of all, this product actually has the vitamins C and</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I’m happy to say that this product from Skinpro is a real winner in all senses of the word!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delfogo Anti-Aging Serum is honestly the best product I&#x27;ve found for fighting wrinkles, rough skin, and aging.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to see what my face looks like in 3 more weeks!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love how it brings a shine to your face also</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever post reviews to stuff, but the fact that it was so absurdly cheap and effective, as a shopping citizen</li>
            <li>and I just had to share the results with as many people as I could.</li>
            <li>Words can&#x27;t describe how pleased I&#x27;m with the results of this product and would recommend anyone who is suffering from aging.  </li>
            <li>and I can’t even see the lines any more.</li>
            <li>I will surely order the Rx Vitamin C Serum again</li>
            <li>Even better, this Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum was about $30.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>want my skin to look better (who doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li>every day;adding this serum to my routine as done more for my age spots and lines (OK wrinkles) than any product I can ever remember using.&lt;br /&gt;I’m</li>
            <li>I do like this product and will buy more</li>
            <li>I have a more even skin tone and many of my blemishes have faded away.  </li>
            <li>This serum promotes real results and thus I&#x27;m happy to have found it and add it to my skin care arsenal.  </li>
            <li>I also have been able to reduce the makeup under my eyes –</li>
            <li>You have so many options, when it comes to Vitamin C serums, but trust me when I tell you that this is the one that you want to use.</li>
            <li>I am using this twice a day and have seen fabulous results!  </li>
            <li>It has also added a refreshing look to my face giving me a boost of confidence about my face.</li>
            <li>I have to say I’m more than</li>
            <li>pleased with the results—and my skin seems to be getting even better the more I use it.</li>
            <li>My skin looked firmer and more youthful within days of using the product, and I could feel the serum working on my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was possible :) What a great product!</li>
            <li>Ok I don’t want to look 35 at 29.</li>
            <li>Up until finding this product I had tried many products.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Those caused more pimples.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wash your hands before applying so</li>
            <li>I love using Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>After catching a Dr. Oz special on alternatives to surgery for cosmetic procedures, I was pointed towards Vitamin C Serum as a way to reduce damage from sunburn in my skin.</li>
            <li>I’ve received a lot of compliments from my colleges, for a very healthy and fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li>Besides feeling more confident (which is already huge) about my skin, it is also noticeably softer and silkier.</li>
            <li>As a plant-based, 100% natural product, this is one of the better anti-aging products on the market and is a great choice for those not wanting to experiment with putting harmful chemicals on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>My skin felt firmer and many of the fine lines and sun spots disappeared.</li>
            <li>I used many creams and serums to try and hide under the many wrinkles on my face, but with this serum, my face feels refresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this DelfogoRx product a try, especially because it has vitamins C and E and ferulic acid as its ingredients, which I’ve read are very good for the skin and giving a person vitality and energy.  </li>
            <li>I was able to retaliate against environment by using the Delfogo Rx Vitamin C Serum, which fights free radicals.  </li>
            <li>She laughed and told me the whole story about how she found it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with the hope of repairing the damage I’ve already done, and preventing my fine lines from becoming deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Delfogo Rx is far superior to competitive products because of the chemical discoveries that are a watershed in healthy skin maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Delfogo</li>
            <li>I get and have gotten for years remarks that I have such beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>In fact, friends who saw my updated social profile pic thought I had used special makeup to make me look so good!  </li>
            <li>By the way, Skin Pro has good customer service and I look forward to the new products they bring.</li>
            <li>Good reasons to try this formula for the new Spring season.</li>
            <li>Fine product.  </li>
            <li>I am a fairly light skinned person, who tends to burn easily.</li>
            <li>I tried “Best Vitamin C Serum” with little expectation.</li>
            <li>and I don’t have a technically accurate explanation why this Vitamin C product works, but it…just does.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li>L-Ascorbic acid works by repairing the skin and fighting free radicals.  </li>
            <li>The antioxidants from the plants neutralize free radicals, and it has anti-inflammatory properties too.  </li>
            <li>I sound like a paid spokesperson,</li>
            <li>This stuff is really great for getting your younger looking self again.</li>
            <li>Anything we can do to help our health is important.  </li>
            <li>serum also has Vitamin E which also acts as an important component to prevent the cultivation of free radicals.  </li>
            <li>I also found out that it can help with smooth muscle growth.  </li>
            <li>What a great idea to add both components into one simple product!</li>
            <li>AND I feel great about acting proactively for my skin’s health!</li>
            <li>(Added bonus that It also goes on really smoothly under my makeup...)</li>
            <li>I enjoy that</li>
            <li>Vitamin C has been proven to block free radicals, which in theory gives you protection against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To start off, I must say that I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>I wear it at night as v c oxidizes on the skin in the light, and I can&#x27;t handle the hickory smoke smell on my face, neck and hands.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and use sunscreen religiously, but I love outdoor activities and have exposure over time with the development of brown spots.</li>
            <li>I feel like so many products have the good stuff you need but not nearly enough of it, and they don&#x27;t let you know</li>
            <li>I was able to notice my skin staying more supple and not drying or wrinkling much around my eyes or forehead.</li>
            <li>I think what these people do is combine the right combination of vitamins and acids, and my skin has never looked better, because of it.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>(They&#x27;re no longer the first thing I see on my face:)</li>
            <li>The original price is nearing $200</li>
            <li>but when I switched over to Delfogo I noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>As someone who grew up in the Sunshine state, I was always outside enjoying the warm sun and relaxing by the pool.</li>
            <li>Since I am able to see a difference, I will keep using this product and see how much it can do for me.</li>
            <li>For anyone who doesn’t know your body can’t create its own vitamin C, even though its vital for your immune system and protein synthesis.</li>
            <li>Not only do we have fair skin</li>
            <li>I love beauty and am willing to pay anything for the right product.  </li>
            <li>Quick absorption and no bad smell either.</li>
            <li>My skin is healthier and better, which makes me feel healthier and better, and the serum is paraben free, so right in line with the rest of the personal care items I use.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by my results after using Vitamin-C serum by Delfrogo Rx, my friend used it and I saw results in her skin which made me feel more comfortable about trying it myself.</li>
            <li>it absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a quick one step-one product serum.</li>
            <li>Actually, skin felt more moist, plump, and looked more even toned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure like many others, Mother Nature is starting to catch up with me.  </li>
            <li>I once had is becoming more apparent again.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is truly more vibrant and radiant as a result albeit</li>
            <li>After reading that serum is good for your skin I started my long search for a product.</li>
            <li>The sun has certainly caused some skin issues for me in the past, and I am very happy that I have found this product.</li>
            <li>But the Delfogo serum is my new favorite part of my skincare regime.  </li>
            <li>One of the cons is that it can be too strong, but the toner really works for me.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and after just a week, I could really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Immediately after the first application, I could feel my face tingle!</li>
            <li>As a makeup/beauty junkie, I have a lot of fun trying new products, but most of them don’t deliver.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest that anyone looking to keep their skin looking young or trying to reverse the universes effects on natural beauty buy this product, because not only is it better for your skin, it&#x27;s more affordable than a $60-$100 jar of creme that has many chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;-Jessie R.</li>
            <li>and I’ve already had some pleasant surprises with their other products too.</li>
            <li>It’s a great way to take care of my skin after the harsh winter that we just had in NY.</li>
            <li>After two weeks worth of use</li>
            <li>I realize how much more important it is to take care of my skin, especially around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>Scientists have finally harnessed the life-giving components of Vitamin C serum and distilled the product into an outstanding ant-aging formula that is available under the Delfogo Rx brand.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>These are the technical details, but what actually happens is the delivery of the most potent and advanced protection against photoaging by neutralizing free radicals and boosting collagen synthesis.</li>
            <li>Either way, with this serum my skin is soft, smooth and I can see the difference in my wrinkles already!  </li>
            <li>Kiehl&#x27;s ultimate brushless shave cream with a warm razor.</li>
            <li>I was younger, I spent my summers on the beach seeking the perfect tan.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It worked miracles for me by making my skin more firm, and allowing my skin to breathe more, which in turn took the droopy or wrinkled skin I had, and made it much better as a whole.</li>
            <li>so nobody really expects me to be using a skin care/beauty product, so instead of asking me what I’m using people have been saying things like, “you look really great lately, been getting more sleep?”</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it protects against harmful UV rays - great for people like me who love spending time in the sun but hate constantly reapplying suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First and very importantly, this product is ALL NATURAL!</li>
            <li>It is as thin as water, but just absorbs right in, and my face feels and looks wonderful!</li>
            <li>but I wanted to make sure that my skin remained healthy as I get older and wanted to use a product that would help prevent the aging process as much as possible.</li>
            <li>With many anti-aging products on the market, it is sometimes difficult to find just that perfect one that works with your particular skin tone and quality.  </li>
            <li>#2 Always use a good moisturizer and as you get older it will be necessary to add serums &amp; anti -oxidant products.</li>
            <li>One thing I did notice right away was the moisture level of my skin.</li>
            <li>Right now, I start my morning with a cooling ice mask (for about five minutes) and shave with</li>
            <li>Delfogo&#x27;s anti-aging serum, as it says in the description, has the highest concentration of Vitamin C on the market right now AND at a fraction of the cost of the industry leaders.</li>
            <li>If I sound like a commercial---I&#x27;ve been trying to pound this into my 37  year old  daughter&#x27;s  head since she was a teenager!!</li>
            <li>A quick web search shows that most are 20% and some are as low as 10%.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Along with these benefits, Delfogo reduces your wrinkles and increases your skin’s firmness by replacing vital ingredients that your skin needs to stay looking young and healthy!</li>
            <li>I have plenty of freckles and fine lines, and the overall texture of my skin is just not as smooth and youthful as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>With the dropper you get exactly the right amount.  </li>
            <li>I even found a number of no-name brand formulas here on Amazon significantly cheaper than these with as high as a 20% concentration of Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>Even though I am not that old, I started to notice fine lines creeping up on me around my eyes.</li>
            <li>My skin even looks healthier, more vibrant, and alive.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is a strong natural lightener (I prefer natural to bleach!), but there have been other pleasant side effects.</li>
            <li>Make sure to test it on a patch of skin on your inner arm before rubbing this all</li>
            <li>Not only did my skin look younger and more radiant – it just felt better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a Vitamin-C serum and if they actually worked.</li>
            <li>At first I tried Olay’s face serum</li>
            <li>I especially love that a few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Overall my face looks smoother, and my skin seems to have a more even tone.</li>
            <li>my face needs to combat the &amp;#34;40s&amp;#34; and what is coming next... :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to give a couple of tips to all you many younger women or women of any age out there.!</li>
            <li>but with a soft, smooth face I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>I recently had a problem with a nail polish Top- Coat.</li>
            <li>This antioxidant completely disrupts the free radicals in the body.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the first filter for me when finding products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has noticeably reduced the red marks left over from not being so nice to my face when I get a breakout, which wasn&#x27;t even something I thought it was going to do!</li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI for anybody interested in this product.  </li>
            <li>and I can definitely see a really lovely improvement in my skin texture.</li>
            <li>I wanted to do something to combat the telltale signs of premature aging, fast!  </li>
            <li>but it really works!  </li>
            <li>What attracted me to this product was that I noticed this product contained all natural ingredients, and it was alcohol and paraben free which is always a plus in my book.</li>
            <li>It’s the real deal!</li>
            <li>I get the same results as with a higher priced product, but I have more money in my wallet.</li>
            <li>This is definitely what my skin needs to be refreshed, and I&#x27;m keeping this top of my birthday/holiday gift wish list.</li>
            <li>A 22% Vitamin C formula simply means more protection and help for our complexions’.  </li>
            <li>No parabens reduces more potential risks.</li>
            <li>This stuff has literally made me feel younger and look better.</li>
            <li>Lines were diminished even more and firmness was definitely improved.</li>
            <li>In fact, I don’t think there is another on the market with a higher concentration.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Caused dryness at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had kind of dry skin, but after I started using this SkinPro, my skin feels a whole lot softer, and even tighter.</li>
            <li>I’m all about natural remedies and herbal therapies, so when I found this Delfogo anti-aging serum by SkinPro, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was even more effective than I expected.</li>
            <li>After trying out the Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks, I notice the fine lines are disappearing and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried other popular serums over the years but nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>I love to golf, sail and just be outside as much as I can.</li>
            <li>My eyes already looked good and I didn&#x27;t have crows feet, but I used several different eye creams.</li>
            <li>Having tried multiple serums, Delfogo&#x27;s is not remarkably different from the higher-priced alternatives, but that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that this product works considerably faster and has vastly greater results.  </li>
            <li>I like a product with natural healthy ingredients, and a product like this that actually does make a person look and feel better and younger.  </li>
            <li>I feel younger and more confident than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other anti-aging products, this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li>Decreases your under eye bag and makes your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E (2%) Serum + Pure Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>This serum is not cheap--but quick and easy to apply, and as soon as I use up all my other products I will go from once a day to strictly Skin-Pro Elete.</li>
            <li>I have recently fallen in love with a couple of skin care products from a fairly new company-Skin-Pro.</li>
            <li>It is also perfect for travelling due to its small size, so I take it with me every where I go.  </li>
            <li>With challenging aging skin, I have used &amp;#34;When Hope is not Enough&amp;#34; by Philosophy, and some Bobbi Brown products &amp;#34;religiously&amp;#34; with little success.</li>
            <li>Using this product after a couple weeks really evened out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed my face was softer and much smoother.</li>
            <li>For the price and the results, I would say this product is a real winner.</li>
            <li>With a pump you’re always getting too much product with each use.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really dreading that BIRTHDAY</li>
            <li>Plus, it has a whole host of benefits besides anti-aging.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really evening my complexion.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of time and effort researching skin care products, more specifically aging products.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of creams and oils (primarily vitamin E) and just recently have been reading about vitamin C</li>
            <li>Vitamin C helps to block further damage by free radicals and Vitamin E soothes and recovers damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew that this was the real deal.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to repair or maintain healthier skin.</li>
            <li>The thing that really convinced me though was the comments I got.</li>
            <li>Then some did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>The two together are really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>packaging is very sleek.  </li>
            <li>I really like the dropper style dispenser.  </li>
            <li>Rx brand is simply the only effective defense against environmental aging.</li>
            <li>I love recommending things to my friends, especially when it comes to natural products that work.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my skin is softer than when I started using it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>So far, so good – I’ve been using this for several months, and I began to see improvement within a few weeks, particularly with regard to my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing a lot of research and discovered that Vitamin C serum is the new hot product.  </li>
            <li>I’ve tried so many other products from drugstores and beauty stores, but nothing could ever seem to combat the forces of nature.</li>
            <li>I did drop my other serums and used the Elete-Pro twice a day to see if it worked and it did, so I feel confident that it will work and will be cost efficient once I go to strictly that one product.</li>
            <li>This serum also protects against sun and radiation, much better than other products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s more than any other Vitamin C product product on the market.  </li>
            <li>I can give you many reasons as to why I chose this product over something from Olay or other competitors</li>
            <li>Well, this SkinPro serum has 22% Vitamin C, the highest I have found anywhere and also significantly exceeds both Perricone and Skinceuticals formulas in both Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid, which are also essential ingredients in any serum of this nature.</li>
            <li>At first I had a problem with dispensing too much, but I was able to master it after a few applications.  </li>
            <li>Went back to my original product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still pretty young, but already starting to notice those fine lines and wrinkles that older women always talk about.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for myself (and other formerly unconcerned folks), SkinPro’s Best Vitamin C Serum works to both revive current skin conditions and reverse any previous damage.</li>
            <li>A few drops go a long way, it isn’t smelly or greasy and I am happy to say my skin feels and looks rejuvenated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very strong &#x27;hickory smoke&#x27; scent to it that does not fade away after it has dried.  </li>
            <li>My skin looked and felt better, wrinkles were far less apparent, and my face—especially around my eyes and mouth and cheeks—looked firmer and more vital.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used this high percentage but absolutely see the vitality in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other greasy facial creams, this serum left my skin feeling smooth, soft and just super healthy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, and a few did work to a certain degree.</li>
            <li>I think one problem is that many formulas out there have less Vitamin C than Delfogo Rx Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>As I’m getting older</li>
            <li>and we watched a few youtube videos too just to make sure it was backed up with real evidence.  </li>
            <li>I quickly began researching different product and soon found Skinceutical’s C E Ferulic.</li>
            <li>As I grew older, it took a toll on my skin.</li>
            <li>All off of this has made my skin look older, and like I have not been taking care of it.  </li>
            <li>The second reason (the reason I switched in the first place) was that I saw this one had a higher concentration of vitamin C (22%) compared to Perricone and others.</li>
            <li>on skin&lt;br /&gt;Works steadily over time&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and pray they never run out.</li>
            <li>About 2 months ago I saw an article on Skin-Pro DelfogoRX and their high 22% vitamin  C and began using it.</li>
            <li>When I was in high school</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the extremely high concentration of this product (22%)</li>
            <li>One product I used actually created redness and swelling, but when it comes to this Vitamin C serum, it&#x27;s been nothing but a positive experience, and thus I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Anti-Aging Serum, for several weeks, I’m turning heads for all the right reasons—my dark spots have faded and my once-wrinkled face now boasts smooth, radiant skin!</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and it reacts very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I just wash my face and go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments because of it.</li>
            <li>With preventive measures as the key for any skin care regimen its worth adding this serum to your routine because the results are tangible.</li>
            <li>THAT 3 or 4 min if you are young and just need a dab of moisturizer or a little longer when you (yuck) get older and need more lotions and potions</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use with my current skin care and has improved the overall tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried several anti-aging creams and lotions over the years, and I experienced little if any positive results from these other products.  </li>
            <li>The improvement I&#x27;ve seen in such a short time (a little under 4 weeks) is remarkable.</li>
            <li>found The DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-Aging Serum and after comparing the ingredients in several Vitamin C Serums available on Amazon, decided that this SkinPro serum is not only reasonably priced, but also offered the treatment I desired.  </li>
            <li>and we both feel admittedly better in our minds about working such a simple little thing that is so very important to all of us trying to maintain proper</li>
            <li>that is free from chemicals and other harmful contaminants.  </li>
            <li>and “did you start a new exercise or diet program?</li>
            <li>After a few days of using this, my skin was soft , moisturized and had a healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have combination skin with various age spots, some light acne scars and discoloration around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that I looked far older than what I was, so I wanted something to help counteract the effects of aging.</li>
            <li>This one is just the right consistency, with incredible value, and it contains natural vitamins unlike other weird chemically serums out there, so I trust this.</li>
            <li>I have dermal melasma (dark patches) on my cheeks and upper lip due to sun exposure, which cause me a great deal of embarrassment about my appearance.</li>
            <li>My wife, who was always very adamant about wearing sunscreen decided to look around for a product that would help rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-aging Serum From SkinPro to others.  </li>
            <li>My wife has spent a lot of money on special creams that come recommended by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li>My hubby says my skin is as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li>I love the price of this product compared to other products that claim to do the same job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The science is, free radicals, caused by natural metabolic processes, overtime create flaws in our genetic make-up causing among other things: wrinkles, sunspots, etc.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have made my skin soft again!</li>
            <li>Personally I get up early on the weekends and throughout the week, so it has taken a toll on my skin and how my overall appearance looked, so I decided to try this product, I have seen significant changes in how my skin has looked since I began using it.</li>
            <li>I noticed that with steady use of this product, it definitely firms my face, helping to diminish the fine lines that were starting to appear; especially my forehead area.</li>
            <li>That’s the key with this product, it repairs and gives your skin exactly what is needed nutritionally and naturally, without the added side effects of chemical enhanced products.</li>
            <li>A few years ago, fine lines and wrinkles appeared on my face, along with crow’s feet.  </li>
            <li>Putting it on in the morning and at night is also a little bit of a treat for my fingers, since the drops are buttery smooth.</li>
            <li>There are so many scams out there that it is hard to sift through what is snake oil and what is legitimate stuff proven by scientific evidence.  </li>
            <li>When people first meet me, they think I’m ten years older than I actually am.</li>
            <li>After years spent in the tanning booth, using cheap soaps and avoiding moisturizers altogether, I’m finally realizing the importance to quality skin-care products--especially products intended for my face.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried a couple things, but the only one that seems to confer any real results so far is this product.</li>
            <li>even though I may not be old enough for &amp;#34;anti wrinkle cream&amp;#34; this helps my skin stay youthful as it is now without much application.</li>
            <li>Burned my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is loaded with natural Vitamin C, so you know you are putting something on your skin</li>
            <li>I dilute it with water because I have sensitive skin, and Vitamin C is naturally acidic.  </li>
            <li>And being all natural is always a plus.</li>
            <li>This anti-aging serum isn’t just leaves obviously, but it is plant-based and really works on the physiology of the aging process.</li>
            <li>There is a lot of research that states Ferulic acid is directly associated with having direct anti-tumor effects against breast and liver cancer.  </li>
            <li>It seemed promising until I saw that it was over $100, which was definitely off putting.</li>
            <li>It’s also made in the USA and is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>I was told by a my esthetician that the product may have been old.</li>
            <li>I really noticed the difference with this product within a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not messy.  </li>
            <li>The Professional Vitamin C 22%</li>
            <li>There was only a couple companies I really had even heard of, Cellex, and SkinCeuticals</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find their product contained 22% Vitamin C</li>
            <li>After using DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22%</li>
            <li>This formula is gentle enough to use around your eyes and lips too.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all natural, no alcohol, no man-made chemicals are put into this serum.</li>
            <li>So far, after a week of using it, I see no difference at all in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself that old (mid-40s) but I would not shake a stick at anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li>From the time we were young</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and the blotches are going away.</li>
            <li>Skin A Soft Glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have naturally oily skin so for me</li>
            <li>A few of my co-workers even asked what I was using; that I looked younger and more refreshed.  </li>
            <li>So many choices but really only a few made by brands that I have heard of.</li>
            <li>Other brands may have somewhat similar results but they don’t compare in price, are not 100% natural, and the vitamin and ferulic acid content fails to match “Best Vitamin C Serums” content.  </li>
            <li>I have used some SkinPro products in the past and was very pleased with the results of the their other products.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;skin evening&amp;#34; products at different price points in the past with varied results.</li>
            <li>It will put the vibrant youthful “glow from within” look back into your skin.</li>
            <li>Other products claiming to offer similar solutions were either super pricy or contained a lower percentage of Vitamin C concentration.</li>
            <li>So when I discovered that SkinPro had a 22% Vitamin C concentration, plus more Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid, it wasn&#x27;t hard to choose my next product.</li>
            <li>A couple of drops per day as part of a daily skin-care regimen really seems to be making my skin brighter, clearer and overall healthier.</li>
            <li>As a 62 year-old male actor, I&#x27;ve really gotta recommend Delfogo RX to any guy who&#x27;s starting to see some aging affects.</li>
            <li>Generally however I was left unsatisfied by how much was not actually working.</li>
            <li>Sure, at first I felt uncomfortable with the idea, I thought only women used anti-aging creams.</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines under my eyes and am in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>A few weeks later I noticed that the fine lines are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>Living in a sunny area can definitely turn your skin old before its time, but I didn’t expect it to happen to me.</li>
            <li>I will be 67 years old next week!</li>
            <li>Now that I have tried DelfogoRx Professional Anti-Aging Serum from SkinPro, I am never going back.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this product covers it all, this Vitamin C serum nourishes the skin to bring the skin back to its natural firmness rather than mask it with a cream that doesn’t repair but maintains.  </li>
            <li>spent a bit too much time in my youth, out in the sun, with no sunblock</li>
            <li>I moved away from heavily marketed brand names into more natural Vitamin C formula a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>Being in my early thirties with skin that has begun to age, I am on the market for any product that will help my face look healthier and younger.</li>
            <li>I looked all over for something this good, but untiI I found it, I was met with nothing but disappointment.</li>
            <li>watching a Dr. Oz show about the benefits of Vitamin C and antioxidants, I tried Clinique’s Super Rescue Antioxidant Moisturizer and…nothing happened; it was a total of waste of $50.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully for my wallet, the next product I tried was this Delfogo Rx Professional Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>Featuring 22% Vitamin C, SkinPro evened out my complexion, curbed the dry skin around my nose, reduced under-eye puffiness, and after a few weeks of use, completely erased the tiny fine lines that were starting to appear under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the fact that free radicals are commonly associated with cancer causing agents is something that I try to keep a bead on as much as possible with the history of illness in my family.  </li>
            <li>I finally figured what the heck, even though I&#x27;m only in my early forties, why not try Delfogo Rx?</li>
            <li>I might have looked great then, but now the skin on my face tells a tragic tale.</li>
            <li>I’m already starting to get compliments about “looking healthier” in general, which I can’t complain about.  </li>
            <li>But over the past few years, I started to see my skin begin to change—unevenness, roughness, and fine lines!</li>
            <li>have noticed others, some say bad smell, some say pleasant citrus fragrance</li>
            <li>and you can adjust how much comes out by pressing the dropper slightly.</li>
            <li>I’ll be honest: for a long time, I was wary of “serums” and “formulas” aimed at improving my skin, or reducing the appearance of age.</li>
            <li>I’m still in my early 30s, with some minor lines already present, but hoping to prevent further damage.</li>
            <li>Still the dark circles and bags were starting to make me look older than I am.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was a little skeptical at first, and quite honestly I didn&#x27;t visually notice a difference right away, but it was my colleagues who started telling me that my skin was glowing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having had acne on and off, my face has seen its good and bad days.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Amazon has great customer service too.</li>
            <li> A couple of my friends have noticed, and it makes me feel great.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and repurchase this product because I am happy with it&#x27;s performance and ferulic acid concentration.</li>
            <li> Delfogo Rx is a great product to try.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is the best product of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li> Great results.</li>
            <li> Since this helps against free radicals, it&#x27;s an excellent product for me, given the hobbies I choose to keep.</li>
            <li> I must be protected by good genetics, I thought.</li>
            <li> I hope this encourages each of you to buy good skin care and USE IT----THOSE YEARS</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying a fair price for anything that lives up to its advertisement.</li>
            <li> Good skin.</li>
            <li> I already knew that Vitamin E was good for the brain and the healing of tissues in our body.  </li>
            <li> So I feel good about the changes I’ve seen</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does, but somehow I&#x27;m looking as good</li>
            <li> and I’m happy to say I am pleased.</li>
            <li> With both Perricone and Skinceuticals both selling for over $100, they better have a great formula.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> A much better deal!</li>
            <li> This serum is full of Vitamin which I like and is ideal for skin discoloration and age spots.</li>
            <li> This price is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Once the Vitamin C toner/serum soaks in it really gives my face a wonderful glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps me looking good, reduces the bags under my eyes, and keeps me healthy and energized.</li>
            <li> Using this anti-aging serum is the finishing touch to start my day looking as good and healthy as I aim for.</li>
            <li> used to use Juice Beauty serum, which I liked -</li>
            <li> I feel good about using this product knowing it is a natural option, and the price is great for my pocketbook, too!</li>
            <li> Saving money is nice bonus as well.</li>
            <li> I was kind of resigned to the bags and raccoon</li>
            <li> /&gt;It had been about two years since I had used any kind of product on my face when I was introduced to DelFogo.</li>
            <li> At this point in using them I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> Then I heard about Delfogorx Professional Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum, and was impressed that it had been proven to reverse sun damage through doctor and pharmacist testing.</li>
            <li> Delfogo Vitamic C serum is, by far, the best over-the-counter ant-aging treatment there is.</li>
            <li> My natural skin is at its best while using this!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a good reason why Vitamin C Serum 22% isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> I have pretty great skin</li>
            <li> This skin product also helps to prevent UV damage which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> This is huge!  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the results and will reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Over the course of time, I sustained many burns to my skin.</li>
            <li> I know many people use this serum to prevent wrinkles and to reverse aging.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother, healthier, and more radiant than before.</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> The end result is unmatched antioxidant protection, hence more youthful looking</li>
            <li> Most beauty products are 65 – 85% water, but with 22% Vitamin C, I knew I was getting a potent product.  </li>
            <li> so I know I’m getting even more protection.  </li>
            <li> And I love the dropper.  </li>
            <li> The price was inexpensive compared to many skin products, so I ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin looked firmer and more youthful within days of using the product, and I could feel the serum working on my skin.</li>
            <li> Best of all, this product actually has the vitamins C and</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I’m happy to say that this product from Skinpro is a real winner in all senses of the word!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delfogo Anti-Aging Serum is honestly the best product I&#x27;ve found for fighting wrinkles, rough skin, and aging.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to see what my face looks like in 3 more weeks!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love how it brings a shine to your face also</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever post reviews to stuff, but the fact that it was so absurdly cheap and effective, as a shopping citizen</li>
            <li> and I just had to share the results with as many people as I could.</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t describe how pleased I&#x27;m with the results of this product and would recommend anyone who is suffering from aging.  </li>
            <li> and I can’t even see the lines any more.</li>
            <li> I will surely order the Rx Vitamin C Serum again</li>
            <li> Even better, this Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum was about $30.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> want my skin to look better (who doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li> every day;adding this serum to my routine as done more for my age spots and lines (OK wrinkles) than any product I can ever remember using.&lt;br /&gt;I’m</li>
            <li> I do like this product and will buy more</li>
            <li> I have a more even skin tone and many of my blemishes have faded away.  </li>
            <li> This serum promotes real results and thus I&#x27;m happy to have found it and add it to my skin care arsenal.  </li>
            <li> I also have been able to reduce the makeup under my eyes –</li>
            <li> You have so many options, when it comes to Vitamin C serums, but trust me when I tell you that this is the one that you want to use.</li>
            <li> I am using this twice a day and have seen fabulous results!  </li>
            <li> It has also added a refreshing look to my face giving me a boost of confidence about my face.</li>
            <li> I have to say I’m more than</li>
            <li> pleased with the results—and my skin seems to be getting even better the more I use it.</li>
            <li> My skin looked firmer and more youthful within days of using the product, and I could feel the serum working on my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible :) What a great product!</li>
            <li> Ok I don’t want to look 35 at 29.</li>
            <li> Up until finding this product I had tried many products.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Those caused more pimples.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wash your hands before applying so</li>
            <li> I love using Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> After catching a Dr. Oz special on alternatives to surgery for cosmetic procedures, I was pointed towards Vitamin C Serum as a way to reduce damage from sunburn in my skin.</li>
            <li> I’ve received a lot of compliments from my colleges, for a very healthy and fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li> Besides feeling more confident (which is already huge) about my skin, it is also noticeably softer and silkier.</li>
            <li> As a plant-based, 100% natural product, this is one of the better anti-aging products on the market and is a great choice for those not wanting to experiment with putting harmful chemicals on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> My skin felt firmer and many of the fine lines and sun spots disappeared.</li>
            <li> I used many creams and serums to try and hide under the many wrinkles on my face, but with this serum, my face feels refresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this DelfogoRx product a try, especially because it has vitamins C and E and ferulic acid as its ingredients, which I’ve read are very good for the skin and giving a person vitality and energy.  </li>
            <li> I was able to retaliate against environment by using the Delfogo Rx Vitamin C Serum, which fights free radicals.  </li>
            <li> She laughed and told me the whole story about how she found it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the hope of repairing the damage I’ve already done, and preventing my fine lines from becoming deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Delfogo Rx is far superior to competitive products because of the chemical discoveries that are a watershed in healthy skin maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Delfogo</li>
            <li> I get and have gotten for years remarks that I have such beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li> In fact, friends who saw my updated social profile pic thought I had used special makeup to make me look so good!  </li>
            <li> By the way, Skin Pro has good customer service and I look forward to the new products they bring.</li>
            <li> Good reasons to try this formula for the new Spring season.</li>
            <li> Fine product.  </li>
            <li> I am a fairly light skinned person, who tends to burn easily.</li>
            <li> I tried “Best Vitamin C Serum” with little expectation.</li>
            <li> and I don’t have a technically accurate explanation why this Vitamin C product works, but it…just does.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li> L-Ascorbic acid works by repairing the skin and fighting free radicals.  </li>
            <li> The antioxidants from the plants neutralize free radicals, and it has anti-inflammatory properties too.  </li>
            <li> I sound like a paid spokesperson,</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great for getting your younger looking self again.</li>
            <li> Anything we can do to help our health is important.  </li>
            <li> serum also has Vitamin E which also acts as an important component to prevent the cultivation of free radicals.  </li>
            <li> I also found out that it can help with smooth muscle growth.  </li>
            <li> What a great idea to add both components into one simple product!</li>
            <li> AND I feel great about acting proactively for my skin’s health!</li>
            <li> (Added bonus that It also goes on really smoothly under my makeup...)</li>
            <li> I enjoy that</li>
            <li> Vitamin C has been proven to block free radicals, which in theory gives you protection against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To start off, I must say that I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> I wear it at night as v c oxidizes on the skin in the light, and I can&#x27;t handle the hickory smoke smell on my face, neck and hands.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and use sunscreen religiously, but I love outdoor activities and have exposure over time with the development of brown spots.</li>
            <li> I feel like so many products have the good stuff you need but not nearly enough of it, and they don&#x27;t let you know</li>
            <li> I was able to notice my skin staying more supple and not drying or wrinkling much around my eyes or forehead.</li>
            <li> I think what these people do is combine the right combination of vitamins and acids, and my skin has never looked better, because of it.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> (They&#x27;re no longer the first thing I see on my face:)</li>
            <li> The original price is nearing $200</li>
            <li> but when I switched over to Delfogo I noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> As someone who grew up in the Sunshine state, I was always outside enjoying the warm sun and relaxing by the pool.</li>
            <li> Since I am able to see a difference, I will keep using this product and see how much it can do for me.</li>
            <li> For anyone who doesn’t know your body can’t create its own vitamin C, even though its vital for your immune system and protein synthesis.</li>
            <li> Not only do we have fair skin</li>
            <li> I love beauty and am willing to pay anything for the right product.  </li>
            <li> Quick absorption and no bad smell either.</li>
            <li> My skin is healthier and better, which makes me feel healthier and better, and the serum is paraben free, so right in line with the rest of the personal care items I use.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by my results after using Vitamin-C serum by Delfrogo Rx, my friend used it and I saw results in her skin which made me feel more comfortable about trying it myself.</li>
            <li> it absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a quick one step-one product serum.</li>
            <li> Actually, skin felt more moist, plump, and looked more even toned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure like many others, Mother Nature is starting to catch up with me.  </li>
            <li> I once had is becoming more apparent again.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is truly more vibrant and radiant as a result albeit</li>
            <li> After reading that serum is good for your skin I started my long search for a product.</li>
            <li> The sun has certainly caused some skin issues for me in the past, and I am very happy that I have found this product.</li>
            <li> But the Delfogo serum is my new favorite part of my skincare regime.  </li>
            <li> One of the cons is that it can be too strong, but the toner really works for me.  </li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and after just a week, I could really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Immediately after the first application, I could feel my face tingle!</li>
            <li> As a makeup/beauty junkie, I have a lot of fun trying new products, but most of them don’t deliver.  </li>
            <li> I strongly suggest that anyone looking to keep their skin looking young or trying to reverse the universes effects on natural beauty buy this product, because not only is it better for your skin, it&#x27;s more affordable than a $60-$100 jar of creme that has many chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;-Jessie R.</li>
            <li> and I’ve already had some pleasant surprises with their other products too.</li>
            <li> It’s a great way to take care of my skin after the harsh winter that we just had in NY.</li>
            <li> After two weeks worth of use</li>
            <li> I realize how much more important it is to take care of my skin, especially around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> Scientists have finally harnessed the life-giving components of Vitamin C serum and distilled the product into an outstanding ant-aging formula that is available under the Delfogo Rx brand.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> These are the technical details, but what actually happens is the delivery of the most potent and advanced protection against photoaging by neutralizing free radicals and boosting collagen synthesis.</li>
            <li> Either way, with this serum my skin is soft, smooth and I can see the difference in my wrinkles already!  </li>
            <li> Kiehl&#x27;s ultimate brushless shave cream with a warm razor.</li>
            <li> I was younger, I spent my summers on the beach seeking the perfect tan.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It worked miracles for me by making my skin more firm, and allowing my skin to breathe more, which in turn took the droopy or wrinkled skin I had, and made it much better as a whole.</li>
            <li> so nobody really expects me to be using a skin care/beauty product, so instead of asking me what I’m using people have been saying things like, “you look really great lately, been getting more sleep?”</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, it protects against harmful UV rays - great for people like me who love spending time in the sun but hate constantly reapplying suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First and very importantly, this product is ALL NATURAL!</li>
            <li> It is as thin as water, but just absorbs right in, and my face feels and looks wonderful!</li>
            <li> but I wanted to make sure that my skin remained healthy as I get older and wanted to use a product that would help prevent the aging process as much as possible.</li>
            <li> With many anti-aging products on the market, it is sometimes difficult to find just that perfect one that works with your particular skin tone and quality.  </li>
            <li> #2 Always use a good moisturizer and as you get older it will be necessary to add serums &amp; anti -oxidant products.</li>
            <li> One thing I did notice right away was the moisture level of my skin.</li>
            <li> Right now, I start my morning with a cooling ice mask (for about five minutes) and shave with</li>
            <li> Delfogo&#x27;s anti-aging serum, as it says in the description, has the highest concentration of Vitamin C on the market right now AND at a fraction of the cost of the industry leaders.</li>
            <li> If I sound like a commercial---I&#x27;ve been trying to pound this into my 37  year old  daughter&#x27;s  head since she was a teenager!!</li>
            <li> A quick web search shows that most are 20% and some are as low as 10%.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Along with these benefits, Delfogo reduces your wrinkles and increases your skin’s firmness by replacing vital ingredients that your skin needs to stay looking young and healthy!</li>
            <li> I have plenty of freckles and fine lines, and the overall texture of my skin is just not as smooth and youthful as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> With the dropper you get exactly the right amount.  </li>
            <li> I even found a number of no-name brand formulas here on Amazon significantly cheaper than these with as high as a 20% concentration of Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Even though I am not that old, I started to notice fine lines creeping up on me around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin even looks healthier, more vibrant, and alive.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is a strong natural lightener (I prefer natural to bleach!), but there have been other pleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> Make sure to test it on a patch of skin on your inner arm before rubbing this all</li>
            <li> Not only did my skin look younger and more radiant – it just felt better.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a Vitamin-C serum and if they actually worked.</li>
            <li> At first I tried Olay’s face serum</li>
            <li> I especially love that a few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Overall my face looks smoother, and my skin seems to have a more even tone.</li>
            <li> my face needs to combat the &amp;#34;40s&amp;#34; and what is coming next... :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give a couple of tips to all you many younger women or women of any age out there.!</li>
            <li> but with a soft, smooth face I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I recently had a problem with a nail polish Top- Coat.</li>
            <li> This antioxidant completely disrupts the free radicals in the body.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the first filter for me when finding products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has noticeably reduced the red marks left over from not being so nice to my face when I get a breakout, which wasn&#x27;t even something I thought it was going to do!</li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI for anybody interested in this product.  </li>
            <li> and I can definitely see a really lovely improvement in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do something to combat the telltale signs of premature aging, fast!  </li>
            <li> but it really works!  </li>
            <li> What attracted me to this product was that I noticed this product contained all natural ingredients, and it was alcohol and paraben free which is always a plus in my book.</li>
            <li> It’s the real deal!</li>
            <li> I get the same results as with a higher priced product, but I have more money in my wallet.</li>
            <li> This is definitely what my skin needs to be refreshed, and I&#x27;m keeping this top of my birthday/holiday gift wish list.</li>
            <li> A 22% Vitamin C formula simply means more protection and help for our complexions’.  </li>
            <li> No parabens reduces more potential risks.</li>
            <li> This stuff has literally made me feel younger and look better.</li>
            <li> Lines were diminished even more and firmness was definitely improved.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don’t think there is another on the market with a higher concentration.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caused dryness at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had kind of dry skin, but after I started using this SkinPro, my skin feels a whole lot softer, and even tighter.</li>
            <li> I’m all about natural remedies and herbal therapies, so when I found this Delfogo anti-aging serum by SkinPro, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was even more effective than I expected.</li>
            <li> After trying out the Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks, I notice the fine lines are disappearing and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried other popular serums over the years but nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> I love to golf, sail and just be outside as much as I can.</li>
            <li> My eyes already looked good and I didn&#x27;t have crows feet, but I used several different eye creams.</li>
            <li> Having tried multiple serums, Delfogo&#x27;s is not remarkably different from the higher-priced alternatives, but that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that this product works considerably faster and has vastly greater results.  </li>
            <li> I like a product with natural healthy ingredients, and a product like this that actually does make a person look and feel better and younger.  </li>
            <li> I feel younger and more confident than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other anti-aging products, this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Decreases your under eye bag and makes your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E (2%) Serum + Pure Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> This serum is not cheap--but quick and easy to apply, and as soon as I use up all my other products I will go from once a day to strictly Skin-Pro Elete.</li>
            <li> I have recently fallen in love with a couple of skin care products from a fairly new company-Skin-Pro.</li>
            <li> It is also perfect for travelling due to its small size, so I take it with me every where I go.  </li>
            <li> With challenging aging skin, I have used &amp;#34;When Hope is not Enough&amp;#34; by Philosophy, and some Bobbi Brown products &amp;#34;religiously&amp;#34; with little success.</li>
            <li> Using this product after a couple weeks really evened out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed my face was softer and much smoother.</li>
            <li> For the price and the results, I would say this product is a real winner.</li>
            <li> With a pump you’re always getting too much product with each use.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really dreading that BIRTHDAY</li>
            <li> Plus, it has a whole host of benefits besides anti-aging.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really evening my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of time and effort researching skin care products, more specifically aging products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of creams and oils (primarily vitamin E) and just recently have been reading about vitamin C</li>
            <li> Vitamin C helps to block further damage by free radicals and Vitamin E soothes and recovers damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew that this was the real deal.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants to repair or maintain healthier skin.</li>
            <li> The thing that really convinced me though was the comments I got.</li>
            <li> Then some did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> The two together are really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> packaging is very sleek.  </li>
            <li> I really like the dropper style dispenser.  </li>
            <li> Rx brand is simply the only effective defense against environmental aging.</li>
            <li> I love recommending things to my friends, especially when it comes to natural products that work.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my skin is softer than when I started using it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> So far, so good – I’ve been using this for several months, and I began to see improvement within a few weeks, particularly with regard to my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing a lot of research and discovered that Vitamin C serum is the new hot product.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried so many other products from drugstores and beauty stores, but nothing could ever seem to combat the forces of nature.</li>
            <li> I did drop my other serums and used the Elete-Pro twice a day to see if it worked and it did, so I feel confident that it will work and will be cost efficient once I go to strictly that one product.</li>
            <li> This serum also protects against sun and radiation, much better than other products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s more than any other Vitamin C product product on the market.  </li>
            <li> I can give you many reasons as to why I chose this product over something from Olay or other competitors</li>
            <li> Well, this SkinPro serum has 22% Vitamin C, the highest I have found anywhere and also significantly exceeds both Perricone and Skinceuticals formulas in both Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid, which are also essential ingredients in any serum of this nature.</li>
            <li> At first I had a problem with dispensing too much, but I was able to master it after a few applications.  </li>
            <li> Went back to my original product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still pretty young, but already starting to notice those fine lines and wrinkles that older women always talk about.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for myself (and other formerly unconcerned folks), SkinPro’s Best Vitamin C Serum works to both revive current skin conditions and reverse any previous damage.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way, it isn’t smelly or greasy and I am happy to say my skin feels and looks rejuvenated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very strong &#x27;hickory smoke&#x27; scent to it that does not fade away after it has dried.  </li>
            <li> My skin looked and felt better, wrinkles were far less apparent, and my face—especially around my eyes and mouth and cheeks—looked firmer and more vital.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this high percentage but absolutely see the vitality in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other greasy facial creams, this serum left my skin feeling smooth, soft and just super healthy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, and a few did work to a certain degree.</li>
            <li> I think one problem is that many formulas out there have less Vitamin C than Delfogo Rx Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> As I’m getting older</li>
            <li> and we watched a few youtube videos too just to make sure it was backed up with real evidence.  </li>
            <li> I quickly began researching different product and soon found Skinceutical’s C E Ferulic.</li>
            <li> As I grew older, it took a toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> All off of this has made my skin look older, and like I have not been taking care of it.  </li>
            <li> The second reason (the reason I switched in the first place) was that I saw this one had a higher concentration of vitamin C (22%) compared to Perricone and others.</li>
            <li> on skin&lt;br /&gt;Works steadily over time&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and pray they never run out.</li>
            <li> About 2 months ago I saw an article on Skin-Pro DelfogoRX and their high 22% vitamin  C and began using it.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the extremely high concentration of this product (22%)</li>
            <li> One product I used actually created redness and swelling, but when it comes to this Vitamin C serum, it&#x27;s been nothing but a positive experience, and thus I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Anti-Aging Serum, for several weeks, I’m turning heads for all the right reasons—my dark spots have faded and my once-wrinkled face now boasts smooth, radiant skin!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and it reacts very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I just wash my face and go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments because of it.</li>
            <li> With preventive measures as the key for any skin care regimen its worth adding this serum to your routine because the results are tangible.</li>
            <li> THAT 3 or 4 min if you are young and just need a dab of moisturizer or a little longer when you (yuck) get older and need more lotions and potions</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use with my current skin care and has improved the overall tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried several anti-aging creams and lotions over the years, and I experienced little if any positive results from these other products.  </li>
            <li> The improvement I&#x27;ve seen in such a short time (a little under 4 weeks) is remarkable.</li>
            <li> found The DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-Aging Serum and after comparing the ingredients in several Vitamin C Serums available on Amazon, decided that this SkinPro serum is not only reasonably priced, but also offered the treatment I desired.  </li>
            <li> and we both feel admittedly better in our minds about working such a simple little thing that is so very important to all of us trying to maintain proper</li>
            <li> that is free from chemicals and other harmful contaminants.  </li>
            <li> and “did you start a new exercise or diet program?</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this, my skin was soft , moisturized and had a healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have combination skin with various age spots, some light acne scars and discoloration around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that I looked far older than what I was, so I wanted something to help counteract the effects of aging.</li>
            <li> This one is just the right consistency, with incredible value, and it contains natural vitamins unlike other weird chemically serums out there, so I trust this.</li>
            <li> I have dermal melasma (dark patches) on my cheeks and upper lip due to sun exposure, which cause me a great deal of embarrassment about my appearance.</li>
            <li> My wife, who was always very adamant about wearing sunscreen decided to look around for a product that would help rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-aging Serum From SkinPro to others.  </li>
            <li> My wife has spent a lot of money on special creams that come recommended by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My hubby says my skin is as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> I love the price of this product compared to other products that claim to do the same job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The science is, free radicals, caused by natural metabolic processes, overtime create flaws in our genetic make-up causing among other things: wrinkles, sunspots, etc.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have made my skin soft again!</li>
            <li> Personally I get up early on the weekends and throughout the week, so it has taken a toll on my skin and how my overall appearance looked, so I decided to try this product, I have seen significant changes in how my skin has looked since I began using it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that with steady use of this product, it definitely firms my face, helping to diminish the fine lines that were starting to appear; especially my forehead area.</li>
            <li> That’s the key with this product, it repairs and gives your skin exactly what is needed nutritionally and naturally, without the added side effects of chemical enhanced products.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, fine lines and wrinkles appeared on my face, along with crow’s feet.  </li>
            <li> Putting it on in the morning and at night is also a little bit of a treat for my fingers, since the drops are buttery smooth.</li>
            <li> There are so many scams out there that it is hard to sift through what is snake oil and what is legitimate stuff proven by scientific evidence.  </li>
            <li> When people first meet me, they think I’m ten years older than I actually am.</li>
            <li> After years spent in the tanning booth, using cheap soaps and avoiding moisturizers altogether, I’m finally realizing the importance to quality skin-care products--especially products intended for my face.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried a couple things, but the only one that seems to confer any real results so far is this product.</li>
            <li> even though I may not be old enough for &amp;#34;anti wrinkle cream&amp;#34; this helps my skin stay youthful as it is now without much application.</li>
            <li> Burned my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is loaded with natural Vitamin C, so you know you are putting something on your skin</li>
            <li> I dilute it with water because I have sensitive skin, and Vitamin C is naturally acidic.  </li>
            <li> And being all natural is always a plus.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging serum isn’t just leaves obviously, but it is plant-based and really works on the physiology of the aging process.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of research that states Ferulic acid is directly associated with having direct anti-tumor effects against breast and liver cancer.  </li>
            <li> It seemed promising until I saw that it was over $100, which was definitely off putting.</li>
            <li> It’s also made in the USA and is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I was told by a my esthetician that the product may have been old.</li>
            <li> I really noticed the difference with this product within a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not messy.  </li>
            <li> The Professional Vitamin C 22%</li>
            <li> There was only a couple companies I really had even heard of, Cellex, and SkinCeuticals</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find their product contained 22% Vitamin C</li>
            <li> After using DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22%</li>
            <li> This formula is gentle enough to use around your eyes and lips too.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all natural, no alcohol, no man-made chemicals are put into this serum.</li>
            <li> So far, after a week of using it, I see no difference at all in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself that old (mid-40s) but I would not shake a stick at anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> From the time we were young</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and the blotches are going away.</li>
            <li> Skin A Soft Glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have naturally oily skin so for me</li>
            <li> A few of my co-workers even asked what I was using; that I looked younger and more refreshed.  </li>
            <li> So many choices but really only a few made by brands that I have heard of.</li>
            <li> Other brands may have somewhat similar results but they don’t compare in price, are not 100% natural, and the vitamin and ferulic acid content fails to match “Best Vitamin C Serums” content.  </li>
            <li> I have used some SkinPro products in the past and was very pleased with the results of the their other products.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;skin evening&amp;#34; products at different price points in the past with varied results.</li>
            <li> It will put the vibrant youthful “glow from within” look back into your skin.</li>
            <li> Other products claiming to offer similar solutions were either super pricy or contained a lower percentage of Vitamin C concentration.</li>
            <li> So when I discovered that SkinPro had a 22% Vitamin C concentration, plus more Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid, it wasn&#x27;t hard to choose my next product.</li>
            <li> A couple of drops per day as part of a daily skin-care regimen really seems to be making my skin brighter, clearer and overall healthier.</li>
            <li> As a 62 year-old male actor, I&#x27;ve really gotta recommend Delfogo RX to any guy who&#x27;s starting to see some aging affects.</li>
            <li> Generally however I was left unsatisfied by how much was not actually working.</li>
            <li> Sure, at first I felt uncomfortable with the idea, I thought only women used anti-aging creams.</li>
            <li> I have some fine lines under my eyes and am in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> A few weeks later I noticed that the fine lines are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> Living in a sunny area can definitely turn your skin old before its time, but I didn’t expect it to happen to me.</li>
            <li> I will be 67 years old next week!</li>
            <li> Now that I have tried DelfogoRx Professional Anti-Aging Serum from SkinPro, I am never going back.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product covers it all, this Vitamin C serum nourishes the skin to bring the skin back to its natural firmness rather than mask it with a cream that doesn’t repair but maintains.  </li>
            <li> spent a bit too much time in my youth, out in the sun, with no sunblock</li>
            <li> I moved away from heavily marketed brand names into more natural Vitamin C formula a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Being in my early thirties with skin that has begun to age, I am on the market for any product that will help my face look healthier and younger.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for something this good, but untiI I found it, I was met with nothing but disappointment.</li>
            <li> watching a Dr. Oz show about the benefits of Vitamin C and antioxidants, I tried Clinique’s Super Rescue Antioxidant Moisturizer and…nothing happened; it was a total of waste of $50.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully for my wallet, the next product I tried was this Delfogo Rx Professional Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> Featuring 22% Vitamin C, SkinPro evened out my complexion, curbed the dry skin around my nose, reduced under-eye puffiness, and after a few weeks of use, completely erased the tiny fine lines that were starting to appear under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the fact that free radicals are commonly associated with cancer causing agents is something that I try to keep a bead on as much as possible with the history of illness in my family.  </li>
            <li> I finally figured what the heck, even though I&#x27;m only in my early forties, why not try Delfogo Rx?</li>
            <li> I might have looked great then, but now the skin on my face tells a tragic tale.</li>
            <li> I’m already starting to get compliments about “looking healthier” in general, which I can’t complain about.  </li>
            <li> But over the past few years, I started to see my skin begin to change—unevenness, roughness, and fine lines!</li>
            <li> have noticed others, some say bad smell, some say pleasant citrus fragrance</li>
            <li> and you can adjust how much comes out by pressing the dropper slightly.</li>
            <li> I’ll be honest: for a long time, I was wary of “serums” and “formulas” aimed at improving my skin, or reducing the appearance of age.</li>
            <li> I’m still in my early 30s, with some minor lines already present, but hoping to prevent further damage.</li>
            <li> Still the dark circles and bags were starting to make me look older than I am.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was a little skeptical at first, and quite honestly I didn&#x27;t visually notice a difference right away, but it was my colleagues who started telling me that my skin was glowing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having had acne on and off, my face has seen its good and bad days.  </li>
            <li> Since I have no intention of slowing down my outdoor activities and the use of sunscreen can only take you so far, I’ve begun the process of researching alternative methods of protecting my skin on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to anti-aging products, I am all over them, but have been leery, because of many past experiences that were negative.</li>
            <li> Not only is it less than half the price, it also has higher concentrations of Vitamin C, Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> The sun definitely did a number on me and caused me to age long before my time.</li>
            <li> As a middle aged woman showing signs of wrinkling, I am constantly looking for products to help me look younger.  </li>
            <li> With continued use of this serum I hope to further fight back against wrinkles and an uneven skin tone, thus far it&#x27;s worked wonders for my problematic skin</li>
            <li> Smelled like old oil, slightly rancid.  </li>
            <li> We cant stop the calendar from turning over and aging us, but we can stop or at least slow down the process with this amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product quickly corrected that, and I mean after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> It  doesn&#x27;t take that long to wash your face-----you</li>
            <li> and I like it when I receive good service and hate it when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The results were always the same, slight improvement, took a long time for it to work, my face felt too dry, and took a big chunk out of my wallet.</li>
            <li> I got a response from the seller the next day and she replaced both Base and Top Coat!</li>
            <li> This serum delivers antioxidant protection that you simply won’t find in any other product on the market today.</li>
            <li> Now, we look and see each other differently.</li>
            <li> and we have been searching for ways to teach each other how to do some daily routines to get healthier.  </li>
            <li> The DelfogoRx was relatively inexpensive compared to other products I researched so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything with parabens anymore, and it&#x27;s hard to find serums with CLEARLY defined amounts of active ingredients, but even harder to find natural ones-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I do live in such a harsh climate (harsh in the fact that my skin takes a beating)</li>
            <li> It gives a subtle glow and helps me to feel like I don&#x27;t need as much makeup anymore.</li>
            <li> As it is, within only a few days I could see and feel discernible results after applying the DelfogoRx formula to my face and the back of my hands.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of seeing a face full of unsightly wrinkles and dark spots, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Due to these factors I&#x27;m always on the lookout for anti aging facial skin care products, but have often been let down from various products that promise extreme results but simply don&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li> I also like that there is none of the usual bad-smelling alcohol odors you get with other similar products because it&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I am middle aged so my age was starting to show on my face a little.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try DelfogoRx because it was almost half the price AND had the actual ingredient percentages listed.</li>
            <li> Now the spots are so faint that just a quick brush of powder is needed as my routine.</li>
            <li> I tried to rejuvenate my skin with several products, but they did little to erase the sun damage.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricy, but you only have to apply a little at a time, so in the end you win.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> After doing some comparison shopping, I stumbled upon several generic brand Vitamin C Serums on Amazon that were less expensive and contained 20% of Vitamin C.; this SkinPro serum features 22% Vitamin C, the highest level I have found anywhere and also surpasses similar formulas in both Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid, vital components for this type of serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have to put on heavy makeup to try to disguise adult acne flare-ups that had left my skin an uneven mess.</li>
            <li> It also contains  Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E, with half the price tag of the other two companies I was initially researching.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always suffered from uneven skin tone and overall blotchiness.  </li>
            <li> After turning 40, I realized that the decade I&#x27;ve spent living at the beach have taken their toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> and there is really no reason not to take this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This is really a no brainer for us considering our family.  </li>
            <li> rice bran eye moisturizer, but I am partial to Skin Pro&#x27;s DelfogoRx Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> my acne created pot marks on the sides of my cheeks that were not very noticeable but still bothered me.</li>
            <li> Really a no brainer buy just based on the concentration of actives, so I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I am not loyal when it comes to products and I use quite a few different brands at any given time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a lot of other Vitamin C serums out there that are a lot costlier.  </li>
            <li> The product does not cause any irritation to my skin, and works in conjunction with other skin products.</li>
            <li> Now that I am 40, it seems like products have stopped working like they used to, or perhaps, its my skin that isn&#x27;t responding to some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure what they are, but I have been using Vitamin C, for several years.  </li>
            <li> It is so simple to take this small container out of your purse and it apply it to see results.</li>
            <li> Added this Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum product to regular routine and wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this twice a day (usually) on my face and neck for about 3 months now</li>
            <li> It has the highest concentration of vitamin C, and it does not contain all the chemicals that other products have, which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to the use of acne creams and soaps my skin has become dry…not helping my beauty at all.</li>
            <li> Only use a few drops every morning and night after you just cleaned your face and you will notice a difference in a few weeks if not sooner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to quantify, but I look years younger; if not just healthier.  </li>
            <li> Every beauty show or magazine you see mentions how bad Free Radicals are for your Skin.</li>
            <li> Within weeks, I noticed the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes disappearing.</li>
            <li> Within weeks, I noticed the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes disappearing.</li>
            <li> was looking for a product that would soften the dark circles and soothe away the bags I was toting under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After exfoliating, I did 2 layers of this, after 15 minutes a thick layer of hydrating creme and woke up with radiant skin the next day!</li>
            <li> I was seeking to energize my tired, sun-spotted face, but this product has shown a marked rejuvenation of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a big help in a small bottle!</li>
            <li> I’d never paid less than $150 for a serum.  </li>
            <li> it did help make them even less noticeable.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s literally less than $1 a day to use this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for use under a moisturizing eye cream, because the serum itself is not super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles on my brow have subsided and sun-spots previously on my nose</li>
            <li> of them would give my skin that tight feeling.</li>
            <li> Sorry, can&#x27;t use it long enough to see if the product is beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The vitamins are a added plus, still could be a little cheaper tho.</li>
            <li> When I saw the Delfogo Vitamin C serum discounted so heavily, I had my reservations.  </li>
            <li> For years, I had youthful, firm skin and didn’t think I needed to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is one step and is also fairly thin and just takes a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> He stumbled upon this product a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> After a few days I noticed it working on my pot marks.</li>
            <li> I have always had what I would consider to be uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s now and just thought it was all part of aging and was accepting it, but after just a few applications of this product,</li>
            <li> I’ve been using the Vitamin C Serum for a few months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from uneven skin tone and hyperpigmentation of sorts.</li>
            <li> There were a few that worked</li>
            <li> Use everyday.</li>
            <li> Other products, such as Lancome&#x27;s Renergie Anti-Aging cream and Life Cell&#x27;s Anti Aging cream are twice as expensive and not even comparable in effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I found this product after browsing amazon for a product to help slow down the aging process.</li>
            <li> My son and I decided to make a pact this past Winter</li>
            <li> My skin appeared smoother and seemed like it was glistening, unlike the duller tone it usually has.</li>
            <li> After doing some research about key ingredients to restore skin, like ferulic acid and vitamin E, I splurged on the expensive products notice any result except a dent in my spending budget.</li>
            <li> but it has diminished the small lines that were appearing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the odor to be unpleasant, but it definitely has a slight fragrance to it.  </li>
            <li> AS HARD TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR</li>
            <li> and my skin was dull.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a result of my California lifestyle, but I&#x27;m always wary of those &amp;#34;healthy skin&amp;#34; brands that are just loaded up with artificial chemicals, so I look for natural Vitamin C-based products, which is a little hard and always pricey.</li>
            <li> goodbye to puffiness from late night work hours, and a toddler who argues against sleep.</li>
            <li> Not only did it remain tacky on my skin, but the odor was soo unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Well, DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-Aging Serum has proven not to be afraid of those words!</li>
            <li> I knew my skin had reached a point that it needed some serious TLC, but cringed at using anything that included “anti-aging.”</li>
            <li> always a little skeptical about trying serums.  </li>
            <li> I have been a sun-worshipper in the past, and unfortunately it shows –</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to try this product because I have combination / oily skin and was afraid this would make it worse.  </li>
            <li> That was worse than what I was trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I am not a beautiful woman--</li>
            <li> My research in to these formulas was disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> I looked into options to help lighten the spots, but didn’t like what found; lasers are expensive and might exacerbate the situation, and hydroquinone caused a lot of irritation — and I didn’t like the idea of putting “bleach” on my face anyway.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I neglected to protect my skin and it shows.</li>
            <li> It was way too expensive, and didn&#x27;t meet expectations.  </li>
            <li> But this just fails.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to get some expensive makeup from a beauty store, so I went on amazon and got Delforgo.</li>
            <li> but I’m overwhelmed by the array of ridiculously expensive retinol, alpha-hydroxy, soy, antioxidant and vitamin C</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I would get burned quite often.</li>
            <li> change is difficult once you’ve set your routine.  </li>
            <li> (I might add that all these products were loaded with artificial additives)</li>
            <li> I also really, really hate wasting $50 /$75 on useless products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the discrepancy, unless I received a bad bottle.  </li>
            <li> regardless, it results in a bad review.  </li>
            <li> Some were actually so bad that I got headaches.</li>
            <li> Was sadly disappointed this time.  </li>
            <li> Each drop gives a boost of vitamin C to my face and is the base of my morning ritual.</li>
            <li> IMPOSSIBLE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Burned my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Fine product.  No irritation to skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and use sunscreen religiously, but I love outdoor activities and have exposure over time with the development of brown spots. I have tried many &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;skin evening&amp;#34; products at different price points in the past with varied results. This product is easy to use with my current skin care and has improved the overall tone and texture of my skin. I am satisfied with the results and will reorder this product. I&#x27;ve also told my girlfriends, sister, and mom about it, and it has to be good for me to do that!</li>
            <li> As someone who grew up in the Sunshine state, I was always outside enjoying the warm sun and relaxing by the pool. Over the course of time, I sustained many burns to my skin. The sun definitely did a number on me and caused me to age long before my time. I didn’t want to look like I was 50 when I was in my 30s, so I began looking for something that could help reverse the damage I had caused to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I do live in such a harsh climate (harsh in the fact that my skin takes a beating) I was able to retaliate against environment by using the Delfogo Rx Vitamin C Serum, which fights free radicals.  This serum delivers antioxidant protection that you simply won’t find in any other product on the market today. It is loaded with natural Vitamin C, so you know you are putting something on your skin that is free from chemicals and other harmful contaminants.  This product is a must have!</li>
            <li> Even though I am not that old, I started to notice fine lines creeping up on me around my eyes. Living in a sunny area can definitely turn your skin old before its time, but I didn’t expect it to happen to me. After trying out the Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks, I notice the fine lines are disappearing and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years. Since I am able to see a difference, I will keep using this product and see how much it can do for me.</li>
            <li> Just bought another bottle of this liquid gold. What I do is make a toner with it by mixing a couple drops of serum with water and dab it on after cleansing my face. I dilute it with water because I have sensitive skin, and Vitamin C is naturally acidic.  One of the cons is that it can be too strong, but the toner really works for me.  Make sure to test it on a patch of skin on your inner arm before rubbing this all over!&lt;br /&gt; Once the Vitamin C toner/serum soaks in it really gives my face a wonderful glow.&lt;br /&gt; I know many people use this serum to prevent wrinkles and to reverse aging.  But I&#x27;m only 21 and I&#x27;ve always suffered from uneven skin tone and overall blotchiness.  Using this product after a couple weeks really evened out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of other Vitamin C serums out there that are a lot costlier.  This one is just the right consistency, with incredible value, and it contains natural vitamins unlike other weird chemically serums out there, so I trust this. Definitely one of my beauty essentials.</li>
            <li> After years spent in the tanning booth, using cheap soaps and avoiding moisturizers altogether, I’m finally realizing the importance to quality skin-care products--especially products intended for my face. Fortunately for myself (and other formerly unconcerned folks), SkinPro’s Best Vitamin C Serum works to both revive current skin conditions and reverse any previous damage. Unlike other greasy facial creams, this serum left my skin feeling smooth, soft and just super healthy. Other products claiming to offer similar solutions were either super pricy or contained a lower percentage of Vitamin C concentration. Featuring 22% Vitamin C, SkinPro evened out my complexion, curbed the dry skin around my nose, reduced under-eye puffiness, and after a few weeks of use, completely erased the tiny fine lines that were starting to appear under my eyes.</li>
            <li> SkinPro International has discovered the fountain of youth and bottled it. That might be an exaggeration, but I truly feel like this Vitamin C Serum delivered on everything it promises. After two weeks worth of use I noticed my face was softer and much smoother. Within a month, my skin was so energized!  I can’t remember the last time my skin felt so revived. A few of my co-workers even asked what I was using; that I looked younger and more refreshed.  I’ve been telling everyone about this serum. I look forward to applying the serum at night and seeing the results in the morning. I’ve tried other popular serums over the years but nothing compares to this. I highly recommend this product and pray they never run out.</li>
            <li> After turning 40, I realized that the decade I&#x27;ve spent living at the beach have taken their toll on my skin. I searched for a product that would help reverse some of the damage, but most of the ones I found were extremely expensive and just didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying DelfogoRx, I think I&#x27;ve finally found the solution. This product is so easy to use and after just a week, I could really tell a difference. Not only did my skin look younger and more radiant – it just felt better. It was as though the years of sun damage never even happened. My skin felt firmer and many of the fine lines and sun spots disappeared. I feel younger and more confident than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other anti-aging products, this one is a keeper. I plan to continue to buy and use the DelfogoRx skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still pretty young, but already starting to notice those fine lines and wrinkles that older women always talk about. Maybe it&#x27;s a result of my California lifestyle, but I&#x27;m always wary of those &amp;#34;healthy skin&amp;#34; brands that are just loaded up with artificial chemicals, so I look for natural Vitamin C-based products, which is a little hard and always pricey. The last product I tried gave me a &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; sized sample and although it seemed great, I could not afford the hefty $150 per bottle price tag once the sample ran out! And 15% Vitamin C concentration just didn&#x27;t seem that revolutionary. So when I discovered that SkinPro had a 22% Vitamin C concentration, plus more Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid, it wasn&#x27;t hard to choose my next product. And when you see a production beating out it&#x27;s competition in quality and price, buyer beware! Needless to say, I was a little skeptical at first, and quite honestly I didn&#x27;t visually notice a difference right away, but it was my colleagues who started telling me that my skin was glowing! One thing I did notice right away was the moisture level of my skin. I&#x27;ve always had kind of dry skin, but after I started using this SkinPro, my skin feels a whole lot softer, and even tighter. Now that I can see and feel the difference, I would definitely never go back.</li>
            <li> I’m still a relatively young guy, but I’ve spent enough time out in the sun over the years that it’s starting to catch up with me. Since I have no intention of slowing down my outdoor activities and the use of sunscreen can only take you so far, I’ve begun the process of researching alternative methods of protecting my skin on a daily basis.  I’ve tried a couple things, but the only one that seems to confer any real results so far is this product. A couple of drops per day as part of a daily skin-care regimen really seems to be making my skin brighter, clearer and overall healthier. I’m already starting to get compliments about “looking healthier” in general, which I can’t complain about.  I like that this has Vitamin E in it as well; there’s also something called “Ferulic Acid” which is supposed to have anti-cancer properties. Whatever the case is, I&#x27;m impressed with my results and happily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a Vitamin-C serum and if they actually worked. I have pretty great skin but I wanted to make sure that my skin remained healthy as I get older and wanted to use a product that would help prevent the aging process as much as possible. I was pleasantly surprised by my results after using Vitamin-C serum by Delfrogo Rx, my friend used it and I saw results in her skin which made me feel more comfortable about trying it myself. My skin feels smoother, healthier, and more radiant than before. It&#x27;s also not oily which was a concern of mine, finding a serum that isn&#x27;t too oily but still provides enough moisture to increase the collagen in my skin. I&#x27;m now a fan.</li>
            <li> As I’m getting older I realize how much more important it is to take care of my skin, especially around my eyes and mouth. Normally I just wash my face and go. After doing some research I decided to add a face serum to my morning regimen. At first I tried Olay’s face serum but I didn’t like the way it left my skin feeling. I turn to Amazon all the time for stuff and was very pleased to come across SkinPro’s Best Vitamin C Serum. It leaves my skin smooth but not greasy. After a couple of weeks I saw a difference in texture. It’s a great way to take care of my skin after the harsh winter that we just had in NY. I especially love that a few drops goes a long way. And being all natural is always a plus. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I have dermal melasma (dark patches) on my cheeks and upper lip due to sun exposure, which cause me a great deal of embarrassment about my appearance. I looked into options to help lighten the spots, but didn’t like what found; lasers are expensive and might exacerbate the situation, and hydroquinone caused a lot of irritation — and I didn’t like the idea of putting “bleach” on my face anyway. Lo and behold, I came across Delfogo Rx, and it’s done wonders my unsightly brown spots. Vitamin C is a strong natural lightener (I prefer natural to bleach!), but there have been other pleasant side effects. Overall my face looks smoother, and my skin seems to have a more even tone. For the price and the results, I would say this product is a real winner.</li>
            <li> I purchased Defolgo Rx Vitamin C Serum last month and I’m happy to say I am pleased. I spend the summer months gardening and tending to my flowers and even though I wear sunscreen and a hat, my skin has still been exposed to the suns harmful rays. Since this helps against free radicals, it&#x27;s an excellent product for me, given the hobbies I choose to keep. I was sold from the start.I have tried many, and a few did work to a certain degree.Generally however I was left unsatisfied by how much was not actually working.When I invest in something I want to reap in all the benefits not just one or two. So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Scientists have finally harnessed the life-giving components of Vitamin C serum and distilled the product into an outstanding ant-aging formula that is available under the Delfogo Rx brand.&lt;br /&gt;What it does for the skin fulfills the age-old desire to maintain the freshness of youthful skin. Delfogo Rx is far superior to competitive products because of the chemical discoveries that are a watershed in healthy skin maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Delfogo Rx  is a manifestation of taking the healing properties of Vitamin C to its maximum potential. The miraculous formula melds the industry-leading 22% concentration of Vitamin C Serum with Ferulic Acid (0.8 %) + Vitamin E (2%) Serum + Pure Hyaluronic Acid. These are the technical details, but what actually happens is the delivery of the most potent and advanced protection against photoaging by neutralizing free radicals and boosting collagen synthesis. The end result is unmatched antioxidant protection, hence more youthful looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;Delfogo Rx brand is simply the only effective defense against environmental aging.</li>
            <li> I love beauty and am willing to pay anything for the right product.  When I saw the Delfogo Vitamin C serum discounted so heavily, I had my reservations.  I’d never paid less than $150 for a serum.  But the Delfogo serum is my new favorite part of my skincare regime.  Most beauty products are 65 – 85% water, but with 22% Vitamin C, I knew I was getting a potent product.  I already knew that Vitamin C reduces wrinkles (which I actually saw in 2 weeks) but this serum also protects against sun damage.  That’sgreat to use under my moisturizer so I know I’m getting even more protection.  And I love the dropper.  With a pump you’re always getting too much product with each use.  With the dropper you get exactly the right amount.  All in all a purchase I’m definitely going to make again.</li>
            <li> For years, I had youthful, firm skin and didn’t think I needed to wear sunscreen. I must be protected by good genetics, I thought. A few years ago, fine lines and wrinkles appeared on my face, along with crow’s feet.  I tried to rejuvenate my skin with several products, but they did little to erase the sun damage. Then I heard about Delfogorx Professional Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum, and was impressed that it had been proven to reverse sun damage through doctor and pharmacist testing. The price was inexpensive compared to many skin products, so I ordered a bottle. My skin looked firmer and more youthful within days of using the product, and I could feel the serum working on my skin. Within weeks, I noticed the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes disappearing. Crow’s feet and age spots also disappeared. According to Skin Pro’s website, this is because of the combination of vitamin C, vitamin E, and the ferulic acid. These ingredients protect against the sun’s rays and reverse their damage, decrease skin roughness, and the length of facial lines. The product does not cause any irritation to my skin, and works in conjunction with other skin products.</li>
            <li> As a makeup/beauty junkie, I have a lot of fun trying new products, but most of them don’t deliver.  I’m happy to say that this serum is one I would (and will) buy again and again.  I have been a sun-worshipper in the past, and unfortunately it shows – I have plenty of freckles and fine lines, and the overall texture of my skin is just not as smooth and youthful as it used to be.  (Yes, sun damage is a reality, even in a snowy northern climate!)  I purchased this product with the hope of repairing the damage I’ve already done, and preventing my fine lines from becoming deeper wrinkles.  So far, so good – I’ve been using this for several months, and I began to see improvement within a few weeks, particularly with regard to my fine lines.  This is a big help in a small bottle!</li>
            <li> L-Ascorbic acid works by repairing the skin and fighting free radicals.  I&#x27;ve never used this high percentage but absolutely see the vitality in my skin.  I will order again and stop using Skin Ceuticals.</li>
            <li> I love to golf, sail and just be outside as much as I can. Unfortunately, I neglected to protect my skin and it shows. My wife, who was always very adamant about wearing sunscreen decided to look around for a product that would help rejuvenate my skin. Well, she found it and I can’t believe what a difference it made. Delfogo Vitamic C serum is, by far, the best over-the-counter ant-aging treatment there is. My wife has spent a lot of money on special creams that come recommended by her dermatologist. After seeing what a transformation my skin has gone through, she herself began using this product. Now, we look and see each other differently. These days you can’t beat an all-natural ingredient list and this one has got it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a serum to help with the aging process. Now that I am 40, it seems like products have stopped working like they used to, or perhaps, its my skin that isn&#x27;t responding to some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Either way, with this serum my skin is soft, smooth and I can see the difference in my wrinkles already!  Best of all, this product actually has the vitamins C and E my face needs to combat the &amp;#34;40s&amp;#34; and what is coming next... :-)</li>
            <li> As a woman who loves the outdoors, my face takes a bit of a beating from the seasons (snow, sun, wind, etc). As a result of a lifestyle that I love, unfortunately it’s beginning to take its toll on my youth. I’m all about natural remedies and herbal therapies, so when I found this Delfogo anti-aging serum by SkinPro, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was even more effective than I expected. I would recommend this product to anyone considering trying it. I love recommending things to my friends, especially when it comes to natural products that work. This anti-aging serum isn’t just leaves obviously, but it is plant-based and really works on the physiology of the aging process. The antioxidants from the plants neutralize free radicals, and it has anti-inflammatory properties too.  Along with these benefits, Delfogo reduces your wrinkles and increases your skin’s firmness by replacing vital ingredients that your skin needs to stay looking young and healthy! I’ve tried so many other products from drugstores and beauty stores, but nothing could ever seem to combat the forces of nature. Not until I found this great product. Love it.</li>
            <li> I will be 67 years old next week! IMPOSSIBLE! I am very fair complected and do not have brown spots, or masque, or anything on my face that some people mention. My hubby says my skin is as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt! I get and have gotten for years remarks that I have such beautiful skin.  I&#x27;d like to give a couple of tips to all you many younger women or women of any age out there.! I have NEVER since I was 16 gone to bed with Make-up on! I just Don&#x27;t!!....It  doesn&#x27;t take that long to wash your face-----you will have to look at it a LONG---TIME! #2 Always use a good moisturizer and as you get older it will be necessary to add serums &amp; anti -oxidant products.I have recently fallen in love with a couple of skin care products from a fairly new company-Skin-Pro. The one I am reviewing is DelfogoRX 22% Vitamin C! Every beauty show or magazine you see mentions how bad Free Radicals are for your Skin. Not really sure what they are, but I have been using Vitamin C, for several years.  About 2 months ago I saw an article on Skin-Pro DelfogoRX and their high 22% vitamin  C and began using it. I LOVE IT! It is as thin as water, but just absorbs right in, and my face feels and looks wonderful! I like that it absorbs so quickly. It has some hylaluronic acid in it also.  I like their Elite-Pro Eye serum as well. It is one step and is also fairly thin and just takes a tiny bit. My eyes already looked good and I didn&#x27;t have crows feet, but I used several different eye creams. This serum is not cheap--but quick and easy to apply, and as soon as I use up all my other products I will go from once a day to strictly Skin-Pro Elete. I did drop my other serums and used the Elete-Pro twice a day to see if it worked and it did, so I feel confident that it will work and will be cost efficient once I go to strictly that one product. The ratings I have read on it are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER -TAKE THAT 3 or 4 min if you are young and just need a dab of moisturizer or a little longer when you (yuck) get older and need more lotions and potions to--- WASH YOUR FACE BEFORE BED! I don&#x27;t care how beautifully you dress, if you don&#x27;t have nice skin you will never look your best! If I sound like a commercial---I&#x27;ve been trying to pound this into my 37  year old  daughter&#x27;s  head since she was a teenager!! She knows she should, but will do it for a while and then break the commitment and her face shows the results for all to see. I am not a beautiful woman-- but with a soft, smooth face I get lots of compliments.MAKE THAT COMMITMENT -- BELIEVE ME, THE YEARS FLY BY! By the way, Skin Pro has good customer service and I look forward to the new products they bring. I sound like a paid spokesperson,NOT- but I worked in customer service for years and I like it when I receive good service and hate it when I don&#x27;t. Amazon has great customer service too. I recently had a problem with a nail polish Top- Coat. I couldn&#x27;t get the lid off! I got a response from the seller the next day and she replaced both Base and Top Coat! NOW THAT IS CUSTOMER APPRECIATION!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIKE  I SAID, I&#x27;M NOT A PAID SPOKESPERSON, but I&#x27;m really dreading that BIRTHDAY NEXT WEEK--I JUST CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT!!!!!! I hope this encourages each of you to buy good skin care and USE IT----THOSE YEARS ARE FLYING BY. YOU CAN&#x27;T&lt;br /&gt;STOP THE CALENDAR, BUT IT&#x27;S NOT QUITE AS HARD TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR IF YOU DON&#x27;T LOOK LIKE A WRINKLED PRUNE! BE WELL, AND KEEP FIGHTING THAT CALENDAR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kye Serum.&lt;br /&gt;It is a quick one step-one product serum.</li>
            <li> This was touted as all the rage for diminishing wrinkles. It was way too expensive, and didn&#x27;t meet expectations.  I don&#x27;t mind paying a fair price for anything that lives up to its advertisement. But this just fails.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great for getting your younger looking self again. Plus, it has a whole host of benefits besides anti-aging. As a former employee of a health and nutrition store I am a big fan of this formula. Quick absorption and no bad smell either. For anyone who doesn’t know your body can’t create its own vitamin C, even though its vital for your immune system and protein synthesis. Which means…you guessed it! Good skin. I take a bottle of this from time to time when I know I will be getting a lack of sleep. It keeps me looking good, reduces the bags under my eyes, and keeps me healthy and energized. I definitely recommend this anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> My son and I decided to make a pact this past Winter and we have been searching for ways to teach each other how to do some daily routines to get healthier.  We have cancer that runs throughout our family and anything we can do to work in some preventative maintenance throughout our day is truly a God send.  He stumbled upon this product a few weeks ago and we both feel admittedly better in our minds about working such a simple little thing that is so very important to all of us trying to maintain proper health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m always a little skeptical about trying serums.  There are so many scams out there that it is hard to sift through what is snake oil and what is legitimate stuff proven by scientific evidence.  I’m happy to say that this product from Skinpro is a real winner in all senses of the word!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you have Ferulic acid.  This antioxidant completely disrupts the free radicals in the body.  I’ve done a lot of research into this as a health care provider and DNA damage and cell aging is something that I have read about in a lot of publications.  Moreover, the fact that free radicals are commonly associated with cancer causing agents is something that I try to keep a bead on as much as possible with the history of illness in my family.  There is a lot of research that states Ferulic acid is directly associated with having direct anti-tumor effects against breast and liver cancer.  Anything we can do to help our health is important.  I’m pumped that my son got me into this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum also has Vitamin E which also acts as an important component to prevent the cultivation of free radicals.  This acts with the Vitamin C in the product and it forms something in the body to protect the cells from damage.  The antioxidant properties are something to be noted.  All I had to do was ask a friend of mine who is a biologist at the local University about it.  She told me all about this stuff and we watched a few youtube videos too just to make sure it was backed up with real evidence.  I also found out that it can help with smooth muscle growth.  This is huge!  I’m getting into my elder years and I can use all the help I can get!  Also, my son is a runner and he is already noting how it is improving his training!  I already knew that Vitamin E was good for the brain and the healing of tissues in our body.  I like to make tables in my spare time and I am often injuring my hands.  Anything I can do to speed up the healing process of my cuts and nicks is well received.  I add it all up and there is really no reason not to take this stuff.  This is really a no brainer for us considering our family.  What a great idea to add both components into one simple product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a month but already see a difference in my skin. Pores are much smaller and skin glows. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> With challenging aging skin, I have used &amp;#34;When Hope is not Enough&amp;#34; by Philosophy, and some Bobbi Brown products &amp;#34;religiously&amp;#34; with little success. Now that I have tried DelfogoRx Professional Anti-Aging Serum from SkinPro, I am never going back. Besides feeling more confident (which is already huge) about my skin, it is also noticeably softer and silkier. A couple of my friends have noticed, and it makes me feel great.</li>
            <li> I am not loyal when it comes to products and I use quite a few different brands at any given time.  Right now, I start my morning with a cooling ice mask (for about five minutes) and shave with Kiehl&#x27;s ultimate brushless shave cream with a warm razor. I use (MALIN + GOETZ) rice bran eye moisturizer, but I am partial to Skin Pro&#x27;s DelfogoRx Vitamin C serum. Each drop gives a boost of vitamin C to my face and is the base of my morning ritual. Using this anti-aging serum is the finishing touch to start my day looking as good and healthy as I aim for.</li>
            <li> I’ll be honest: for a long time, I was wary of “serums” and “formulas” aimed at improving my skin, or reducing the appearance of age. But over the past few years, I started to see my skin begin to change—unevenness, roughness, and fine lines! I quickly began researching different product and soon found Skinceutical’s C E Ferulic. It seemed promising until I saw that it was over $100, which was definitely off putting. And then I found SkinPro’s Delfogo Rx Vitamin C Serum. Not only is it less than half the price, it also has higher concentrations of Vitamin C, Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E. A much better deal! It’s also made in the USA and is 100% natural. A few drops go a long way, it isn’t smelly or greasy and I am happy to say my skin feels and looks rejuvenated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it improve my skin soon after I began using it, but it also protects against all kinds UVA, UVB and infrared A! I still use sunscreen, but because SkinPro acts as an antioxidant, it strengthens the protection of sunscreen. So I feel good about the changes I’ve seen AND I feel great about acting proactively for my skin’s health!</li>
            <li> Delfogo Anti-Aging Serum is honestly the best product I&#x27;ve found for fighting wrinkles, rough skin, and aging. I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments because of it. It has surpassed leading brands of anti-aging cream and serum in Vitamin C, E, and Ferulic Acid, and you can definitely see the difference. I used many creams and serums to try and hide under the many wrinkles on my face, but with this serum, my face feels refresh and clean. Other products, such as Lancome&#x27;s Renergie Anti-Aging cream and Life Cell&#x27;s Anti Aging cream are twice as expensive and not even comparable in effectiveness. Only use a few drops every morning and night after you just cleaned your face and you will notice a difference in a few weeks if not sooner. This serum also protects against sun and radiation, much better than other products I have ever used. It is also perfect for travelling due to its small size, so I take it with me every where I go.  It is so simple to take this small container out of your purse and it apply it to see results.</li>
            <li> First and very importantly, this product is ALL NATURAL! I don&#x27;t use anything with parabens anymore, and it&#x27;s hard to find serums with CLEARLY defined amounts of active ingredients, but even harder to find natural ones- that&#x27;s the first filter for me when finding products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Juice Beauty serum, which I liked - but I decided to try DelfogoRx because it was almost half the price AND had the actual ingredient percentages listed. I feel like so many products have the good stuff you need but not nearly enough of it, and they don&#x27;t let you know how much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 1/2 weeks, once a day, at night after washing my face. I LOVE IT. It has noticeably reduced the red marks left over from not being so nice to my face when I get a breakout, which wasn&#x27;t even something I thought it was going to do! My face feels softer in the morning after using it. I&#x27;m fair-skinned, and I&#x27;ve ALSO noticed some freckles and sunspots fading. Between that and the acne marks it&#x27;s really evening my complexion. I&#x27;m really excited to see what my face looks like in 3 more weeks! (Added bonus that It also goes on really smoothly under my makeup...)</li>
            <li> This product was actually de&lt;br /&gt;trimental to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Orange in color,very sticky. I was told by a my esthetician that the product may have been old.Would never reccomend</li>
            <li> When I was in high school my acne created pot marks on the sides of my cheeks that were not very noticeable but still bothered me. Note I am a man who can’t just cover it up with make up.The DelfogoRx was relatively inexpensive compared to other products I researched so I decided to give it a try. After a few days I noticed it working on my pot marks. Although it did not entirely rid the pot holes off my cheeks it did help make them even less noticeable. The vitamins are a added plus, still could be a little cheaper tho.</li>
            <li> This product returned results after about a month, a lot sooner than I was expecting. I was able to notice my skin staying more supple and not drying or wrinkling much around my eyes or forehead. I enjoy that even though I may not be old enough for &amp;#34;anti wrinkle cream&amp;#34; this helps my skin stay youthful as it is now without much application. It gives a subtle glow and helps me to feel like I don&#x27;t need as much makeup anymore. My natural skin is at its best while using this!  This price is amazing.  The bottle will last a minimum of a month so it&#x27;s literally less than $1 a day to use this product.</li>
            <li> I really noticed the difference with this product within a short amount of time. I was a little nervous to try this product because I have combination / oily skin and was afraid this would make it worse.  I did cut back my usage to just once a day, at night.  My skin appeared smoother and seemed like it was glistening, unlike the duller tone it usually has. I also like that there is none of the usual bad-smelling alcohol odors you get with other similar products because it&#x27;s 100% natural. Best of all, it protects against harmful UV rays - great for people like me who love spending time in the sun but hate constantly reapplying suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI for anybody interested in this product.  The dispenser is a dropper but it&#x27;s not messy.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product. Decreases your under eye bag and makes your skin super soft. Love how it brings a shine to your face also</li>
            <li> After exfoliating, I did 2 layers of this, after 15 minutes a thick layer of hydrating creme and woke up with radiant skin the next day!</li>
            <li> Actually, skin felt more moist, plump, and looked more even toned.</li>
            <li> With many anti-aging products on the market, it is sometimes difficult to find just that perfect one that works with your particular skin tone and quality.  The Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-Aging Serum is an excellent product to try.  As a plant-based, 100% natural product, this is one of the better anti-aging products on the market and is a great choice for those not wanting to experiment with putting harmful chemicals on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, all you have to do is place 2-3 drops in your hand and rub into the area you want to treat.  It also comes with the added benefit of protecting against damaging sun rays. This product not only helped to lesson some of the lines around my eyes, but it made my skin feel softer as well.  I feel good about using this product knowing it is a natural option, and the price is great for my pocketbook, too!</li>
            <li> As a 62 year-old male actor, I&#x27;ve really gotta recommend Delfogo RX to any guy who&#x27;s starting to see some aging affects. Sure, at first I felt uncomfortable with the idea, I thought only women used anti-aging creams. But then brother slash agent prodded me to do it, and eventually I gave in to try it. I wasn&#x27;t about to get some expensive makeup from a beauty store, so I went on amazon and got Delforgo. I don&#x27;t know how it does, but somehow I&#x27;m looking as good I did in my mid 50&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t ever post reviews to stuff, but the fact that it was so absurdly cheap and effective, as a shopping citizen I felt obliged.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of time and effort researching skin care products, more specifically aging products. I&#x27;m sure like many others, Mother Nature is starting to catch up with me.  There was only a couple companies I really had even heard of, Cellex, and SkinCeuticals (my dermatologist sells this line), but for what they both contained  in Vitamin C (15%) and the big price tag, I kept searching. Then I learned that SkinPro has just created a Vitamin C Serum. I have used some SkinPro products in the past and was very pleased with the results of the their other products.  I was pleasantly surprised to find their product contained 22% Vitamin C, that&#x27;s more than any other Vitamin C product product on the market.  It also contains  Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E, with half the price tag of the other two companies I was initially researching.  So I decided to buy the Delfogo Rx by SkinPro and I just had to share the results with as many people as I could. I have always had what I would consider to be uneven skin tone and my skin was dull.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s now and just thought it was all part of aging and was accepting it, but after just a few applications of this product, the radiant glow I once had is becoming more apparent again. Words can&#x27;t describe how pleased I&#x27;m with the results of this product and would recommend anyone who is suffering from aging.  We cant stop the calendar from turning over and aging us, but we can stop or at least slow down the process with this amazing product. Thank you so SkinPro for making me feel younger again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It absorbs quickly without being greasy.  I use it morning and night along with a moisturizer and like the results.</li>
            <li> After hearing about the benefits of Vitamin C on Dr. Oz, I decided to give it a try. I’m still in my early 30s, with some minor lines already present, but hoping to prevent further damage. It is a bit pricy, but you only have to apply a little at a time, so in the end you win.&lt;br /&gt;This serum moisturizes like nothing else on my bathroom self. I like how it lets the skin breath. Many similar products tend to form an uncomfortable layer. With the Rx Vitamin C Serum, it’s like it is not even there. And as inconspicuous as it is, it gets the job done. After a few days of using this, my skin was soft , moisturized and had a healthy glow to it. A few weeks later I noticed that the fine lines are starting to fade. I’ve been using the Vitamin C Serum for a few months now and I can’t even see the lines any more. I’ve received a lot of compliments from my colleges, for a very healthy and fresh looking skin. I will surely order the Rx Vitamin C Serum again and I’ve already had some pleasant surprises with their other products too. Definitely a great brand for skin care!</li>
            <li> Added this Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum product to regular routine and wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this twice a day (usually) on my face and neck for about 3 months now and I can definitely see a really lovely improvement in my skin texture. My skin feels firmer and the lines around my mouth fading (They&#x27;re no longer the first thing I see on my face:) Even better, this Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum was about $30.&lt;br /&gt;I want my skin to look better (who doesn&#x27;t?) but I’m overwhelmed by the array of ridiculously expensive retinol, alpha-hydroxy, soy, antioxidant and vitamin C products out there.  I also really, really hate wasting $50 /$75 on useless products&lt;br /&gt;After watching a Dr. Oz show about the benefits of Vitamin C and antioxidants, I tried Clinique’s Super Rescue Antioxidant Moisturizer and…nothing happened; it was a total of waste of $50.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully for my wallet, the next product I tried was this Delfogo Rx Professional Vitamin C Serum. I use alpha hydroxy and a moisturizer with spf 30 sunscreen every day;adding this serum to my routine as done more for my age spots and lines (OK wrinkles) than any product I can ever remember using.&lt;br /&gt;I’m not a scientist and I don’t have a technically accurate explanation why this Vitamin C product works, but it…just does. I hope they make this $30 product forever!</li>
            <li> After doing some comparison shopping, I stumbled upon several generic brand Vitamin C Serums on Amazon that were less expensive and contained 20% of Vitamin C.; this SkinPro serum features 22% Vitamin C, the highest level I have found anywhere and also surpasses similar formulas in both Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid, vital components for this type of serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was younger, I spent my summers on the beach seeking the perfect tan. I might have looked great then, but now the skin on my face tells a tragic tale. When people first meet me, they think I’m ten years older than I actually am. Ouch!  I wanted to do something to combat the telltale signs of premature aging, fast!  I was tired of seeing a face full of unsightly wrinkles and dark spots, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found The DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-Aging Serum and after comparing the ingredients in several Vitamin C Serums available on Amazon, decided that this SkinPro serum is not only reasonably priced, but also offered the treatment I desired.  Immediately after the first application, I could feel my face tingle! After using DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-Aging Serum, for several weeks, I’m turning heads for all the right reasons—my dark spots have faded and my once-wrinkled face now boasts smooth, radiant skin! I couldn’t be happier!</li>
            <li> As a middle aged woman showing signs of wrinkling, I am constantly looking for products to help me look younger.  It looks like I have found that product.  Not only did it lessen my wrinkles in the two weeks that I have used it, but, my skin has a softness I haven’t felt in quite a time. I have to say that this product covers it all, this Vitamin C serum nourishes the skin to bring the skin back to its natural firmness rather than mask it with a cream that doesn’t repair but maintains.  That’s the key with this product, it repairs and gives your skin exactly what is needed nutritionally and naturally, without the added side effects of chemical enhanced products. I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> This serum is full of Vitamin which I like and is ideal for skin discoloration and age spots. It works to fade them while brightening up the overall skin tone. It will put the vibrant youthful “glow from within” look back into your skin. In about a week you will notice an overall smoother and improved texture. This formula is gentle enough to use around your eyes and lips too. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I love the price of this product compared to other products that claim to do the same job. Though it&#x27;s not that big in size, it will last you forever! For both of my eyes I need smaller than a pea sized drop. I think the packaging is perfect for the product inside and you can adjust how much comes out by pressing the dropper slightly. I purchased this product after hearing about the benefits of ferulic acid for skin. I have some fine lines under my eyes and am in my late 30&#x27;s and I have noticed my under eye area is brighter and feels firmer after having used this product for almost a month now. I would recommend this for use under a moisturizing eye cream, because the serum itself is not super moisturizing. I will continue to use and repurchase this product because I am happy with it&#x27;s performance and ferulic acid concentration.</li>
            <li> Why choose DelfogoRx over anything else in the anti-aging line? I can give you many reasons as to why I chose this product over something from Olay or other competitors, it&#x27;s all natural, no alcohol, no man-made chemicals are put into this serum. Personally I get up early on the weekends and throughout the week, so it has taken a toll on my skin and how my overall appearance looked, so I decided to try this product, I have seen significant changes in how my skin has looked since I began using it. I strongly suggest that anyone looking to keep their skin looking young or trying to reverse the universes effects on natural beauty buy this product, because not only is it better for your skin, it&#x27;s more affordable than a $60-$100 jar of creme that has many chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;-Jessie R.</li>
            <li> spent a bit too much time in my youth, out in the sun, with no sunblock and I&#x27;m paying for it now.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of creams and oils (primarily vitamin E) and just recently have been reading about vitamin C serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science is, free radicals, caused by natural metabolic processes, overtime create flaws in our genetic make-up causing among other things: wrinkles, sunspots, etc.  Vitamin C has been proven to block free radicals, which in theory gives you protection against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try skin pro&#x27;s product because it&#x27;s advertised as a one, two punch in skin care.  Vitamin C helps to block further damage by free radicals and Vitamin E soothes and recovers damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the extremely high concentration of this product (22%) or the specific combination of formulas but it really works!  I was seeking to energize my tired, sun-spotted face, but this product has shown a marked rejuvenation of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to quantify, but I look years younger; if not just healthier.  Wrinkles on my brow have subsided and sun-spots previously on my nose have al but disappeared.  If you are unsure about whether or not to buy, I say do it!  The improvement I&#x27;ve seen in such a short time (a little under 4 weeks) is remarkable.</li>
            <li> I was impressed  I do like this product and will buy more</li>
            <li> To start off, I must say that I really enjoy using this product. I found this product after browsing amazon for a product to help slow down the aging process. I am middle aged so my age was starting to show on my face a little. What attracted me to this product was that I noticed this product contained all natural ingredients, and it was alcohol and paraben free which is always a plus in my book. Not to mention the price. The original price is nearing $200 and I definitely couldn&#x27;t afford that, but $30, I could manage for my budget. I noticed that with steady use of this product, it definitely firms my face, helping to diminish the fine lines that were starting to appear; especially my forehead area. This skin product also helps to prevent UV damage which is very important to me. My skin even looks healthier, more vibrant, and alive. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have tried several anti-aging creams and lotions over the years, and I experienced little if any positive results from these other products.  I decided to give this DelfogoRx product a try, especially because it has vitamins C and E and ferulic acid as its ingredients, which I’ve read are very good for the skin and giving a person vitality and energy.  As it is, within only a few days I could see and feel discernible results after applying the DelfogoRx formula to my face and the back of my hands.  My skin looked and felt better, wrinkles were far less apparent, and my face—especially around my eyes and mouth and cheeks—looked firmer and more vital.  I like a product with natural healthy ingredients, and a product like this that actually does make a person look and feel better and younger.  So I highly recommend DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-aging Serum From SkinPro to others.  It’s the real deal!</li>
            <li> I purchased this under the free/auto refill program.  It has a very strong &#x27;hickory smoke&#x27; scent to it that does not fade away after it has dried.  Others can notice the smell.  I wear it at night as v c oxidizes on the skin in the light, and I can&#x27;t handle the hickory smoke smell on my face, neck and hands.  Sorry, can&#x27;t use it long enough to see if the product is beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed others, some say bad smell, some say pleasant citrus fragrance....I don&#x27;t understand the discrepancy, unless I received a bad bottle.  regardless, it results in a bad review.  Will not be purchasing again.  lesson learned...you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> So far, after a week of using it, I see no difference at all in my skin.  I do not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> So was in the market for a Vitamin C Serum. So many choices but really only a few made by brands that I have heard of. Perricone, Skinceuticals and SkinPro. With both Perricone and Skinceuticals both selling for over $100, they better have a great formula. My research in to these formulas was disappointing to say the least. Both contained only 15% Vitamin C. I even found a number of no-name brand formulas here on Amazon significantly cheaper than these with as high as a 20% concentration of Vitamin C. Well, this SkinPro serum has 22% Vitamin C, the highest I have found anywhere and also significantly exceeds both Perricone and Skinceuticals formulas in both Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid, which are also essential ingredients in any serum of this nature. Really a no brainer buy just based on the concentration of actives, so I bought this product. Now you probably want to know how it performed. I&#x27;ve always suffered from uneven skin tone and hyperpigmentation of sorts. This product quickly corrected that, and I mean after only a few applications. Also the radiant glow speaks for itself. Seeing is believing and its simply incredible. I don&#x27;t consider myself that old (mid-40s) but I would not shake a stick at anti-aging benefits. With preventive measures as the key for any skin care regimen its worth adding this serum to your routine because the results are tangible. This serum has done for my skin within a week what a lifetime of fancy creams hasn&#x27;t come close to doing. My skin has become noticeably softer and smoother. This is why I say if I could only have one skin care product, this would be it.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for something this good, but untiI I found it, I was met with nothing but disappointment. I think one problem is that many formulas out there have less Vitamin C than Delfogo Rx Vitamin C Serum. It&#x27;s packed with nutrients like Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E. It has gradually smoothed out the wrinkles on my face, even my developing crow&#x27;s feet. It&#x27;s also simple to apply. It leaves similar skin-care products in the dust. Some of them can take forever to see results. You don&#x27;t have forever, so you need to start taking care of your skin with quality products. There&#x27;s a good reason why Vitamin C Serum 22% isn&#x27;t cheap: it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> After catching a Dr. Oz special on alternatives to surgery for cosmetic procedures, I was pointed towards Vitamin C Serum as a way to reduce damage from sunburn in my skin. Delfogo&#x27;s anti-aging serum, as it says in the description, has the highest concentration of Vitamin C on the market right now AND at a fraction of the cost of the industry leaders. Having tried multiple serums, Delfogo&#x27;s is not remarkably different from the higher-priced alternatives, but that&#x27;s a good thing.  I get the same results as with a higher priced product, but I have more money in my wallet. They&#x27;ve definitely found a returning costumer here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for awhile for a vitamin C serum and after searching on Amazon and seeing the reviews for the Delfogo best Vitamin C serum from Skinpro I was intrigued.  Since it has the highest concentration (22%) of Vitamin C I decided to order it and give it a try.  I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have combination skin with various age spots, some light acne scars and discoloration around my eyes.  Due to these factors I&#x27;m always on the lookout for anti aging facial skin care products, but have often been let down from various products that promise extreme results but simply don&#x27;t deliver.  Well after using this vitamin C serum for almost a month there has been noticeable change in my overall appearance.  I have a more even skin tone and many of my blemishes have faded away.  My skin feels smoother and tighter and I&#x27;m hearing compliments from friends and co workers about my improved complexion.  This serum promotes real results and thus I&#x27;m happy to have found it and add it to my skin care arsenal.  With continued use of this serum I hope to further fight back against wrinkles and an uneven skin tone, thus far it&#x27;s worked wonders for my problematic skin and therefore I recommend it to anyone looking to utilize a vitamin C serum to improve their overall complexion.</li>
            <li> I knew my skin had reached a point that it needed some serious TLC, but cringed at using anything that included “anti-aging.” Well, DelfogoRx Professional Vitamin C 22% Anti-Aging Serum has proven not to be afraid of those words! After doing some research about key ingredients to restore skin, like ferulic acid and vitamin E, I splurged on the expensive products notice any result except a dent in my spending budget. Went the opposite way, to a considerably cheaper price with GreatSkin, and felt like I got what I paid for – not much. I finally figured what the heck, even though I&#x27;m only in my early forties, why not try Delfogo Rx? Three weeks later, I&#x27;m feeling rejuvenated.  I used to have to put on heavy makeup to try to disguise adult acne flare-ups that had left my skin an uneven mess. Now the spots are so faint that just a quick brush of powder is needed as my routine. I also have been able to reduce the makeup under my eyes – goodbye to puffiness from late night work hours, and a toddler who argues against sleep. In fact, friends who saw my updated social profile pic thought I had used special makeup to make me look so good!  My skin is healthier and better, which makes me feel healthier and better, and the serum is paraben free, so right in line with the rest of the personal care items I use. Putting it on in the morning and at night is also a little bit of a treat for my fingers, since the drops are buttery smooth. This is definitely what my skin needs to be refreshed, and I&#x27;m keeping this top of my birthday/holiday gift wish list.</li>
            <li> Growing up, I was always outside around the pool and soaking up the sun. Unfortunately, I would get burned quite often. As I grew older, it took a toll on my skin. I noticed that I looked far older than what I was, so I wanted something to help counteract the effects of aging. When I found this product, I figured I would give it a shot. I can honestly say that my skin is softer than when I started using it a few weeks ago. I hope it continues to improve my skin and turn back the hands of time for me.</li>
            <li> A 22% Vitamin C formula simply means more protection and help for our complexions’.  If you have not tried Vitamin C Serum as part of your daily beauty regiment than Delfogo Rx is a great product to try.  I moved away from heavily marketed brand names into more natural Vitamin C formula a few years ago.  My complexion is truly more vibrant and radiant as a result albeit change is difficult once you’ve set your routine.  This scientific formula is healing, protective, cutting-edge. No parabens reduces more potential risks. Saving money is nice bonus as well. Good reasons to try this formula for the new Spring season.</li>
            <li> I’ve experimented with different anti-aging skin products before. The results were always the same, slight improvement, took a long time for it to work, my face felt too dry, and took a big chunk out of my wallet. (I might add that all these products were loaded with artificial additives) I tried “Best Vitamin C Serum” with little expectation. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this product works considerably faster and has vastly greater results.  As a construction worker I work predominately in the sun, and that takes a toll on my skin. As I mentioned earlier, with SkinPro’s serum I noticed the difference immediately, but when I started receiving compliments at work and being asked, “How are you getting younger?”  I knew that this was the real deal. Other brands may have somewhat similar results but they don’t compare in price, are not 100% natural, and the vitamin and ferulic acid content fails to match “Best Vitamin C Serums” content.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to repair or maintain healthier skin. You’ll look and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff has literally made me feel younger and look better. I am happy to say that this is the best Vitamin C serum out there. You have so many options, when it comes to Vitamin C serums, but trust me when I tell you that this is the one that you want to use. It worked miracles for me by making my skin more firm, and allowing my skin to breathe more, which in turn took the droopy or wrinkled skin I had, and made it much better as a whole. I think what these people do is combine the right combination of vitamins and acids, and my skin has never looked better, because of it. When it comes to anti-aging products, I am all over them, but have been leery, because of many past experiences that were negative. One product I used actually created redness and swelling, but when it comes to this Vitamin C serum, it&#x27;s been nothing but a positive experience, and thus I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I am using this twice a day and have seen fabulous results!  Will use it forever and ever!</li>
            <li> Being in my early thirties with skin that has begun to age, I am on the market for any product that will help my face look healthier and younger. After reading that serum is good for your skin I started my long search for a product. And after looking for a while I found Delfogo vitamin C serum.  It has the highest concentration of vitamin C, and it does not contain all the chemicals that other products have, which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having had acne on and off, my face has seen its good and bad days.  Not to mention overexposure to the sun. Due to the use of acne creams and soaps my skin has become dry…not helping my beauty at all. All off of this has made my skin look older, and like I have not been taking care of it.  But after using Delfogo vitamin C serum for two months my skin has rejuvenated, it’s looking healthier, and I am looking younger. Not only that, but it has diminished the small lines that were appearing. It has also added a refreshing look to my face giving me a boost of confidence about my face.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best product of its kind on the market. I say that for several reasons: I used Perricone’s vitamin C serum for a time and it seemed to work well, but when I switched over to Delfogo I noticed a significant improvement. Lines were diminished even more and firmness was definitely improved. The second reason (the reason I switched in the first place) was that I saw this one had a higher concentration of vitamin C (22%) compared to Perricone and others. In fact, I don’t think there is another on the market with a higher concentration. A quick web search shows that most are 20% and some are as low as 10%.&lt;br /&gt;  The thing that really convinced me though was the comments I got. I’m a guy so nobody really expects me to be using a skin care/beauty product, so instead of asking me what I’m using people have been saying things like, “you look really great lately, been getting more sleep?” and “did you start a new exercise or diet program? You look younger.”&lt;br /&gt;  I have to say I’m more than pleased with the results—and my skin seems to be getting even better the more I use it.</li>
            <li> My skin looked firmer and more youthful within days of using the product, and I could feel the serum working on my skin. Within weeks, I noticed the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes disappearing. Crow’s feet and age spots also disappeared. According to Skin Pro’s website, this is because of the combination of vitamin C, vitamin E, and the ferulic acid. These ingredients protect against the sun’s rays and reverse their damage, decrease skin roughness, and the length of facial lines.  It leaves a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; on my skin and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> A vitamin C serum is essential for your skin, and this product works wonders! I am a fairly light skinned person, who tends to burn easily. I don&#x27;t always wear makeup with SPF and often forget to put on any type of sunblock, especially on my face. The sun has certainly caused some skin issues for me in the past, and I am very happy that I have found this product. It seems to have made my skin soft again! I didn&#x27;t think it was possible :) What a great product!</li>
            <li> I am 29. I just recently turned 29 in April of this year. My genetics dictate that I will get the raccoon eyes and the transatlantic bags under my eyes. I still have the youthful look about my face. Still the dark circles and bags were starting to make me look older than I am. Ugh. I am only 29 I don’t want to look 50. Ok I don’t want to look 35 at 29. To women they seem like they are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product that would soften the dark circles and soothe away the bags I was toting under my eyes. Up until finding this product I had tried many products. There were a few that worked ok but the bulk of them did not. My skin is sensitive and it reacts very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of them would give my skin that tight feeling. Some were actually so bad that I got headaches. Some of these would even made my skin peel. That was worse than what I was trying to get rid of. Some of them made my face feel oily. Those caused more pimples. Then some did absolutely nothing. I was kind of resigned to the bags and raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had been about two years since I had used any kind of product on my face when I was introduced to DelFogo. I found out about it from my cousin. My cousin and I look a lot a like. From the time we were young our family joked that we were twins separated at birth. We even had the same raccoon eyes, bags, and blotches on our skin. When I ran into her my immediate thought was that she had makeup on. As I got closer to her I realized that she only had on lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smacked her on the arm and said, “Aight, what are you wearing?” She laughed and told me the whole story about how she found it. She then gave me the link to buy it and I did. I didn’t just buy this product I also got the Elite Serum. The two together are really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for about two months. At this point in using them I am thrilled. My skin is soft and the blotches are going away. The bags are also starting to soften under my eyes. I am getting closer to looking at my age and I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on skin&lt;br /&gt;Works steadily over time&lt;br /&gt;Softens Skin&lt;br /&gt;Gives Skin A Soft Glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Caused dryness at first</li>
            <li> My family has struggled with skin sensitivity. Not only do we have fair skin but we also have piebaldism (which means there are skin patches that don&#x27;t produce pigment that protects the skin). I have been doing a lot of research and discovered that Vitamin C serum is the new hot product.  The difference from one product to another is the actual percentage of Vitamin C serum.  I found this product by googling Vitamin C products with highest percentage of Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very sleek.  I really like the dropper style dispenser.  At first I had a problem with dispensing too much, but I was able to master it after a few applications.  Just be sure to wash your hands before applying so you don&#x27;t contaminate the serum.  I didn&#x27;t find the odor to be unpleasant, but it definitely has a slight fragrance to it.  The serum itself wasn&#x27;t greasy, even though I thought it might be.  I do have naturally oily skin so for me I only use it at night.  So far, I love it.  My skin is hydrated and I feel good knowing that my skin is being protected against all of the environmental issues trying to age me!</li>
            <li> I love using Vitamin C serum and I do research products before purchasing.  Was sadly disappointed this time.  Not only did it remain tacky on my skin, but the odor was soo unpleasant.  Smelled like old oil, slightly rancid.  Tried using this product just at night, but I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the odor to even fall asleep.  Went back to my original product.</li>
            <li> Use everyday. And once a week with derma roller. Great results.</li>
