            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>They have really good brushes at a really good price.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a thinner brush the MAC 210 brush provides an extremely fine line and is very good if you have the money).     </li>
            <li>Makes the best lines ever and soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Top quality brush, allows you to apply gel liner with the precision of liquid every time!  </li>
            <li>However after I \\&quot;cracked\\&quot; the lacquer by gently flexing it, I tested it out and was impressed.</li>
            <li>I  liked to antibacterial feature of this brush.</li>
            <li>This one has enough stiffness and heft yet still a fine point and is perfect for use w/ cake liners or shadows to make a clean perfect line.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash and handle!</li>
            <li>The point is very fine and has almost a teardrop shape to it.</li>
            <li>would like a tad more flexibility...</li>
            <li>I would love this if the metal was thicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this brush.  </li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and by the way, I love the bdellium brushes.</li>
            <li>I love this company and its product line.</li>
            <li>I returned to another favorite instead.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better eyeliner brush :-)</li>
            <li>and I get a very clean tip.</li>
            <li>My daughter ordered this and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It would be easy to draw thicker line just by lying the brush more on its side.</li>
            <li>Because this brush is tapered so nicely and stays firm as you apply your liner (I use eyeshadow or cake liner), it&#x27;s the perfect tool to make a fine and controlled line.</li>
            <li>I am on a lifelong quest for the perfect eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li>Awesome natural bristle brush paints a smooth straight line.</li>
            <li>I love the bright yellow colors and the tip of this brush</li>
            <li>Great Brush for lining the eyes, especially using a gel liner.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t great for super fine lines, but good for doing small to medium details.</li>
            <li>Applies smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>THAT DOES WELL FOR A PRECISE LINE</li>
            <li>and I use a cheap angled brush.</li>
            <li>Fantastic company, I can&#x27;t wait to see them at the Make-up show NYC,</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>This brush is great for doing a dramatic but clean cat eye, it glided on my gel eyeliner smoothly and with great precision.</li>
            <li>So far I have been able to make a nice looking line across my top lash but haven&#x27;t been very successful in doing anything more complicated or thicker.</li>
            <li>Then I got interested in a more polished eyeliner look and bought a gel eyeliner from MAC.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about picking up a nice angel brush to complete the set</li>
            <li>This brush is soft, flexible, pointed at the tip, easy to hold and maneuver with, and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>is very crisp and looks better than the ones I currently use for gel eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner brush is perfect, firm bristle, nice thin point and arrived quick</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy the rest of the Bdellium line.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a very thin line.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t waste the product and am able to get super close to my lady line.</li>
            <li>This brush was cheap enough that I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>I think it is really just a matter of practice than the quality of the brush.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I like a nice solid eyeliner effect on my upper lid.</li>
            <li>I just wish the clear pouch in which it stores was a bit more sturdy and sealed closed, because I take the brush with me in my purse for on-the-go touch ups.</li>
            <li>Clever triangular tube (to protect bristles) won&#x27;t roll off the sink and get lost.</li>
            <li>but the bristles closer to the handle are more stiff</li>
            <li>This is a new brand for me to try.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this does a great job with a little bit thicker line that I usually want.</li>
            <li>I realize it is a fine line between too stiff and too soft for applying liner...</li>
            <li>I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day.</li>
            <li>It is soft on the tip</li>
            <li>it looked like an old toothbrush with the fibers going in every which way.</li>
            <li>Some brushes are too soft and tend to wobble under the pressure of application.</li>
            <li>Nice and slim to make as thin a line as you, and even a bolder one.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hold a lot of product, but as the brush became less stiff it did hold more product, though was able to do less detail.</li>
            <li>At first the brush was very stiff and only the very tip could be used.</li>
            <li>When this one first arrived I was dissapointed to find a chunky looking brush that was much thicker than expected with stiff lacquered bristles.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because I wanted a thicker brush to do more dramatic lines</li>
            <li>eye\\&quot; at the outer corners of my eyes for more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>I think I need to go for a very fine eyeliner brush as I like a very thin line until the corner of my eye, and then I like to wing it out a bit.</li>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical of getting a fine line with this brush because of other reveiws I have read.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too big for what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to do facepainting with for cosplay, so I have not used it for regular everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner application is so much easier with a thin pointed brush like this than a bent brush or a slanted angle brush.</li>
            <li> but it ends up just moving the eyeliner around) or liner, which is skinny enough to achieve a thin line but big enough to pick up product and admister it generously.</li>
            <li> FAV BRUSH HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> I think writing down a review should be optional.</li>
            <li> I do think it would work well for slightly thicker eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I usually line my eyes with a dark brown eyeshadow from MAC that I bought years ago</li>
            <li> It is a bit stiff...</li>
            <li> The brush is stiff but it does not irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I felt I was pressing down really hard on my eyelids because the bristles weren&#x27;t bending.</li>
            <li> I used to only write a review if there was something wrong.</li>
            <li> My usual angled brush just wasn&#x27;t cutting it because it was so old</li>
            <li> However, I found this brush very stiff - to the point where it hurt my eyelids to use it.</li>
            <li> For some reason I seem to have a hard time with the mix of product</li>
            <li> I am not good at washing my brushes as often as I should.</li>
            <li> Using gel liner, this brush allows me to create from a thin line to a thick line, depending on my mood.</li>
            <li> Not too thin or thick.</li>
            <li> The liner brush I used before this was too thin and flimsy to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My daughter ordered this and it works pretty good. Though we thought we were only ordering 1 brush, but 12 ended up being delivered. If that was the case, this is definitely a great deal, for a good brush!</li>
            <li> Great Brush for lining the eyes, especially using a gel liner. It is a bit stiff...would like a tad more flexibility...I realize it is a fine line between too stiff and too soft for applying liner...this comes close.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to do facepainting with for cosplay, so I have not used it for regular everyday makeup. At first the brush was very stiff and only the very tip could be used. It didn&#x27;t hold a lot of product, but as the brush became less stiff it did hold more product, though was able to do less detail. It wasn&#x27;t great for super fine lines, but good for doing small to medium details. I do think it would work well for slightly thicker eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner application is so much easier with a thin pointed brush like this than a bent brush or a slanted angle brush. I bought this one because I wanted a thicker brush to do more dramatic lines and I couldn&#x27;t bear to drop another $20 bucks for a MAC 209 (side note, if you are looking for a thinner brush the MAC 210 brush provides an extremely fine line and is very good if you have the money).     When this one first arrived I was dissapointed to find a chunky looking brush that was much thicker than expected with stiff lacquered bristles. However after I \\&quot;cracked\\&quot; the lacquer by gently flexing it, I tested it out and was impressed. This brush is great for doing a dramatic but clean cat eye, it glided on my gel eyeliner smoothly and with great precision.</li>
            <li> PERFECT for my inglot gel liner. Makes the best lines ever and soft and beautiful. Shipped very fast. This is my FAV brush</li>
            <li> This eyeliner brush is perfect, firm bristle, nice thin point and arrived quick</li>
            <li> It works well with gel eyeliner. Applies smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> I like a nice solid eyeliner effect on my upper lid. Using gel liner, this brush allows me to create from a thin line to a thick line, depending on my mood. And I can achieve the perfect \\&quot;cat eye\\&quot; at the outer corners of my eyes for more dramatic effect. This brush is soft, flexible, pointed at the tip, easy to hold and maneuver with, and cleans easily. I just wish the clear pouch in which it stores was a bit more sturdy and sealed closed, because I take the brush with me in my purse for on-the-go touch ups.</li>
            <li> Works great ! Makes a perfect fine line . Loved the price and arrived on time .</li>
            <li> I would love this if the metal was thicker. A bit fragile. Best bristles ever.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  It&#x27;s great for the winged eyeliner.  Goes on smoothly.  The brush is stiff but it does not irritate my eyes.  I&#x27;m so glad I got this brush.  A+++++</li>
            <li> FAV BRUSH HANDS DOWN THAT&#x27;S ALL I GOTTA SAY AND ITS SO DENSE AND THATS MIGHT BE A PROBLEM FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT I FEEL LIKE THAT DOES WELL FOR A PRECISE LINE ESPECIALLY A WINGED EYE LINER LOOK</li>
            <li> Awesome natural bristle brush paints a smooth straight line. Clever triangular tube (to protect bristles) won&#x27;t roll off the sink and get lost.</li>
            <li> I think writing down a review should be optional. Just like how it used to be. I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day. But now we can&#x27;t send a rating until we give a review on the product we ordered. I used to only write a review if there was something wrong. I f not, then I give five stars. I don&#x27;t time to write a review for everything I order so I&#x27;ll just copy and paste this on every order. MAKE THIS SECTION OPTIONAL. Thank you and have a great day!</li>
            <li> Top quality brush, allows you to apply gel liner with the precision of liquid every time!  Easy to wash and handle!</li>
            <li> Marches these brushes are very very impressive will ask him more and their very beautiful and suitable Thank you for your cooperation and for the rapid and Tusilkm</li>
            <li> This is a new brand for me to try. I love the bright yellow colors and the tip of this brush is very crisp and looks better than the ones I currently use for gel eyeliner.  Great price, fast shipping. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Perfect for use with latisse! Doesn&#x27;t waste the product and am able to get super close to my lady line.</li>
            <li> AH-MAZING. This has to be the best eyeliner brush I have ever ever had.  It is soft on the tip but the bristles closer to the handle are more stiff which makes it PERFECT for the car eye liner or any type of lining you need to do.  I will most likely buy the rest of the Bdellium line.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. Nice and slim to make as thin a line as you, and even a bolder one. Great for the price!</li>
            <li> Eyeliner brush is the best ever. It works perfect when you start lining the eye.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am on a lifelong quest for the perfect eyeliner brush. This is good. It&#x27;s really good. But it&#x27;s not perfect. It&#x27;s a little too big for what I&#x27;m looking for. I think I need to go for a very fine eyeliner brush as I like a very thin line until the corner of my eye, and then I like to wing it out a bit. Any suggestions? For some reason I seem to have a hard time with the mix of product (gel eyeliners not fully covering so i have to keep going over the line with product but it ends up just moving the eyeliner around) or liner, which is skinny enough to achieve a thin line but big enough to pick up product and admister it generously. Anyway, this does a great job with a little bit thicker line that I usually want. Maybe I just need to try the 705.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and by the way, I love the bdellium brushes. They have really good brushes at a really good price.</li>
            <li> I usually line my eyes with a dark brown eyeshadow from MAC that I bought years ago and I use a cheap angled brush. This daily routine has worked for me for ages. Then I got interested in a more polished eyeliner look and bought a gel eyeliner from MAC. My usual angled brush just wasn&#x27;t cutting it because it was so old it looked like an old toothbrush with the fibers going in every which way. This brush was cheap enough that I decided to try it out. So far I have been able to make a nice looking line across my top lash but haven&#x27;t been very successful in doing anything more complicated or thicker. I think it is really just a matter of practice than the quality of the brush. The point is very fine and has almost a teardrop shape to it. It would be easy to draw thicker line just by lying the brush more on its side. I expect this brush will last quite a while and it feels like it is very good quality. I&#x27;m thinking about picking up a nice angel brush to complete the set and hopefully I can achieve the look I am going for.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Because this brush is tapered so nicely and stays firm as you apply your liner (I use eyeshadow or cake liner), it&#x27;s the perfect tool to make a fine and controlled line. Some brushes are too soft and tend to wobble under the pressure of application. Not this one. Best find for me.</li>
            <li> I love this company and its product line. I&#x27;m an aspiring make-up artist/ wanna-be mogul.  Fantastic company, I can&#x27;t wait to see them at the Make-up show NYC, May 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Quality</li>
            <li> Brush arrived on time and is a great!</li>
            <li> The liner brush I used before this was too thin and flimsy to get the job done.  This one has enough stiffness and heft yet still a fine point and is perfect for use w/ cake liners or shadows to make a clean perfect line.</li>
            <li> I  liked to antibacterial feature of this brush. I am not good at washing my brushes as often as I should. However, I found this brush very stiff - to the point where it hurt my eyelids to use it. I felt I was pressing down really hard on my eyelids because the bristles weren&#x27;t bending. I returned to another favorite instead.</li>
            <li> This is one of my go to brushes. Great brush for the price. Not too thin or thick.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Especially for the price. I was a bit skeptical of getting a fine line with this brush because of other reveiws I have read. I use it with my MAC fluid line and I get a very clean tip. Great purchase and saves money.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Fast shipping. Goes on smooth. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better eyeliner brush :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect for a very thin line.</li>
