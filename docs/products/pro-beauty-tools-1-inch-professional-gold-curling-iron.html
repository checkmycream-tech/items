            <li>after 8 months it the power cord started to get finicky and would only work in certain positions.  </li>

            <li> I bought this at Walmart a year ago, and I am so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dial on the side is out of the way of my hand when I am grabbing and twisting the iron. The on/off switch is out of the way too. So many of the other irons out there have a button or a dial right on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing heats up and is ready to use in about 45 seconds. I have the thickest and waviest hair ever, and I am curled and ready to go on one strand in 10 seconds. It gets so hot you can EASILY burn yourself simply by touching your skin to it even for the shortest time so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron is worth way more than they charge for it, my curls stay curly ALL day and without hairspray. This iron is a must if you are searching for a cheap, well-made piece of equipment. You won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron, mine broke after about 5 years of use, BTW it was the same brand. So I replaced it with a new one, I opted not to get the ceramic one which is what i had. I don&#x27;t regret not getting ceramic, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference. One thing i have noticed is a faint chemical smell when this is on, I am sure it is whatever its coated with burning off. Hopefully I&#x27;m not breathing in toxic fumes, but as soon as you turn it off it goes away. With time and use I hope the smell goes away. Overall great curling iron, money well spent.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve had three of these now, and each one is amazing! They kept their curling proficiency until they stopped working.  The first one stopped working after I ignorantly plugged it into an outlet in France (my bad!).  The other stopped working after a power outage while it was plugged in at my parents&#x27; house (this was also after two years of using it 3-4 times a week).  I love them!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! I would never purchase any other brand. I love how long the cord is, the fact that the cord swivels and has a &amp;#34;built in&amp;#34; piece of velcro to wrap the cord up when you put it away or travel! It has very good heat selections, heats quickly - Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have very thin, hard to curl hair and this keeps curl in my hair all day.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Loved the rotating cord for less tangles.  Loved how hot it got quickly.  Loved how my hair didn&#x27;t tangle under the clip.&lt;br /&gt;But after 8 months it the power cord started to get finicky and would only work in certain positions.  And by 10 months - it won&#x27;t work at all...</li>
            <li> Great curling iron &#x3D; love it!  I have thick hair so need HIGH heat &#x3D; this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Really a nice product and much cheaper than in stores.</li>

            <li> Gets hot quickly and leaves my hair super shiney.  I have one at work and at home now.  Fast shipper.</li>
            <li> I love how the cord swivels so it don&#x27;t get tangled. Heats up fast. Start with low heat and work your way up.</li>
            <li> There are no complaints on this. It gets hot quickly. Is ergonomically easy to handle and love the look of it.</li>
            <li> Burned my hair, my head and my hands.  Wish I could return it</li>
            <li> My wife loves these worth the price</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have automatic shut off.</li>
            <li> hot...holds curls all day!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the best one I have ever used. I have told everyone to get one before they run out</li>
            <li> I purchased this and used it twice before it stopped working. It&#x27;s flimsy and feels cheap. Will not purchase this brand in the future.</li>
