    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very impressed.  </li>
            <li>One of the best bleaching Hair products i have used.</li>
            <li>Speedy delivery, great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product works great at hiding hair by bleaching it a lighter shade.</li>
            <li>Great product...works in 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Perfect, cheap and effective!</li>
            <li>Excellent product...very easy to use...</li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;d say it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>works super well!!!</li>
            <li>No redness or irritation, works wonderfully and fast!</li>
            <li>Okay so to start off my face is allergic to virtually every creme ever made!</li>
            <li>This cream works amazingly</li>
            <li>I honestly felt nothing, so i don&#x27;t know what people were talking about...</li>
            <li>it is very easy to apply I recommend thIs PrOdUct</li>
            <li>Just more effective.</li>
            <li>So I started using Sally for mostly upperlip and sideburns.</li>
            <li>I will also mention that Sally, contrary to peoples reviews, BURNS WAY MORE THAN SURGI!!!Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, lets move on.</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite for bleaching hair.it</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m gonna give it one more chance and try it on my arms.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 3 years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend jolen which is more of a pain to mix and measure but worth it, definitely more effective.</li>
            <li>If you are going to bleach your body hair, this is one of the better products available.</li>
            <li>Yes is kind is itches and a bit burns after you wash it off but trust me its so worth it.</li>
            <li>I found the cream to be quite hassle free.</li>
            <li>I experienced no burning or tingling sensations while the cream is on my skin, although the skin that came into contact with the bleach did lighten, but I have found this to only be temporary.</li>
            <li>You may experience light discomfort during the process but afterwards just use cocoa butter or vaseline or something with aloe to ease soreness.</li>
            <li>process is fairly straight-forward, uncomplicated, and not very messy.</li>
            <li>It is a really good bleaching cream for white skin .</li>
            <li>This is the best bleach set I&#x27;ve found lately.</li>
            <li>but so far it is just the same as when I was able to find this in stores, and works great.</li>
            <li>Ok so I use this product a couple of times and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It kind of burned my skin (I don&#x27;t know if I was just sensitive to it</li>
            <li>Works well and works quickly.</li>
            <li>I think this would be great for people with dark hair on their arms.</li>
            <li>So I definitely recommend this product you will love it!</li>
            <li>Doesnt burn(for me), light brown hair, 10 or more minutes, no clue how long it lasts...</li>
            <li>I spent about 10 minutes..or maybe more, on it, and it made it a light brown.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m addicted to this product; it really works wonderfully and truly invisible results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time user, so I will definitely update as months go by, to give a better reflection on the product.</li>
            <li>I have never used powdered hair bleach, but after reading the reviews of such products, I would say I was quite pleased with my experience with the Surgi bleaching cream.</li>
            <li>It alwasy stings just a bit when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li>This product works because it does drastically lighten/soften the appearance of facial hair to a light brown almost golden tint.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sally: First, because I&#x27;ve been using this much longer (1yr+).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely redo again in a few days..to make it even lighter, but it&#x27;s a nice comparison.</li>
            <li>: Burns, light blonde hair, 5 minutes (10 tops), lasts about a month (does not &amp;#34;gradually&amp;#34; make and keep hair that</li>
            <li>And hopefully, It really does gradually lighten the shade and keep it as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once bleached, the hair does blend in really well, and becomes quite invisible.</li>
            <li>After the 3rd try, I got the hair as light as my skin color, and now the hairs aren&#x27;t noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a simple but effective way to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t burn like most other creams it doesn&#x27;t make the hair invisible</li>
            <li>I began taking a hair growth vitamin and it is not only working for the hairs on my head, but also on hair that grows elsewhere which made facial hair more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got high tolerance for pain, so i just ignore it.</li>
            <li>but then again, i did say i have high tolerance for pain..</li>
            <li>The biggest reason why i bought surgi, while i had sally, is because Surgi promises to slowly make the hair light and stay that way : &amp;#34;The blended product will gradually lighten facial, arm and leg hair to a more natural skin tone shade.&amp;#34; If I am misunderstanding, please let me know.</li>
            <li>I leave the hair bleaching cream on a little longer than the instructions; I have found that 20 minutes works well for me, but I would make sure to test the product in a small area, and see what your own individual experience is.</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic in the sense that my hair went from dark brown to not noticeable AT ALL.</li>
            <li>It has less chemicals in it&#x27;s ingredient list, and is a hassle free product.</li>
            <li>( If you use on a large area like your legs, be sure not to use the tiny little tray, use a bowl and your hands (in gloves of course), cause that tiny spatula tray will get you nowhere.</li>
            <li>It tingled a little when I left on more than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Did not soften as well in microwave as fast as expected and cooled off way to fast.</li>
            <li>My hair are completely invisible.</li>
            <li>I like sally, because it really makes it completely blonde within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Just apply sensitive skin moisturizer and cooling gel afterwards or prepare for pain.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it would burn me in that sensitive area, but thankfully that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t leave it for long as it burns too much , so</li>
            <li>This makes it very hard to tell if i&#x27;m mixing the amounts correctly, huge globs come out filling the whole tray.</li>
            <li>Last year i bought this same product and it was much easier to mix the creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with it hurting my skin, or not lightening hair adequately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other name brand creams and this is gentler, but works better.</li>
            <li>large reason I choose &amp;#34;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream&amp;#34;, was due to the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>And also the itch and stuff lasts for like ten minutes and trust me its nothing you can&#x27;t bare, heck you barely feel it.</li>
            <li>came quick right after I bought it and ill definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>I put it on and after half the amount it says to eave it on it was itchy and felt like red hot fire.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what I was thinking when I bought this because I don&#x27;t have dark hair on my face or arms.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product exactly six times everyday Tuesday-Sunday</li>
            <li>I left it on for the allotted time and it didn&#x27;t turn my dark brown hair much lighter...maybe lighter brown.  </li>
            <li>have dark, fine hair on my legs, and the &amp;#34;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream&amp;#34; bleaches my hair blonde in one go (as I mentioned earlier, I do wait a little longer).</li>

            <li> have dark, fine hair on my legs, and the &amp;#34;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream&amp;#34; bleaches my hair blonde in one go (as I mentioned earlier, I do wait a little longer).</li>
            <li> If you are darker hued after removing it your removal area will appear slightly darker than normal but, your skin will definetly go back to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have high hopes when this is not true.</li>
            <li> We live in a culture that tends to be repulsed by women&#x27;s leg hair, so I felt ultra self-conscious, and decided I would try bleaching the hair to make it less</li>
            <li> With the cream formula its easy to measure out small amounts to bleach just a small area.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this really works or not</li>
            <li> The results of Invisibleach are long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> I notice that I have a lot of &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; and it causes my tinted sunscreen to look weird and not so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t leave it for long to get the correct result.</li>
            <li> Once you measure out and mix the two creams together, you simply apply the cream to the desired location using the plastic spatula (or other spreading device).</li>
            <li> I use up one box of this product when bleaching the hair on both of my lower legs, but smaller areas would require much less of the bleaching</li>
            <li> This to me is an easier way of trying to eliminate the hair by waxing or shaving and much less time consuming (only takes 10 mins).</li>
            <li> and doesn&#x27;t burn only a little itch.</li>
            <li> For some reason my local stores only seem to have the powder variety as of late, which I don&#x27;t have much luck with (powder liquefies after a few uses, and its hard to measure).</li>
            <li> Worked well, just as I had expected.</li>
            <li> It has not completely become invisible but it has made it much less aggressive looking.</li>
            <li> The color of my hair is black, and It took 3 tries to get it to lighten my hair to the shade I wanted it.</li>
            <li> But it makes a lot Less noticeable</li>
            <li> Since my legs are a larger surface than my arms or face, I just throw away the small plastic tray and spatula, and use a popsicle stick and small plate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My arm hair is amazingly light and it is not as painful as other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> If that Just For Men gets your beard a little too dark, try this for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> But if you have really dark hair, it might take a few times for the hair to lighten.</li>
            <li> I never liked the idea of waxing or shaving, because they usually come back and it looks hideous and...</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering a product like this online</li>
            <li> This creme however did not leave hives while it did burn just a little bit</li>
            <li> /&gt;Upon opening the box, you will find a 1.5 oz. tube of Bleaching Cream, a 1 oz. tube of Activating Cream, a small plastic tray &amp; applicator spatula, as well as instructions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usual tint.</li>
            <li> Now the opening for tube number 1 is the width of a toothpaste tube, while tube number 2 has the small opening like it use to.</li>
            <li> While not perfect, the Surgi brand appears to be less toxic and chemical laden when compared to other hair bleaching products</li>
            <li> In my late 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> it was more annoying then unbearably painful.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is, that this stuff BURNSSSSSS.</li>
            <li> I am bleaching my arms hair which is quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Instead of looking like I had the chicken pox</li>
            <li> I get really bad in-grown hairs when I remove the hair on my legs, and have tried just about every hair removal tactic, as well as in-grown hair treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATES: (updates will go under here)</li>
            <li> The smell was awful, so I couldn&#x27;t use the product in my bedroom.</li>

            <li> Hey, guys! If that Just For Men gets your beard a little too dark, try this for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Perfect, cheap and effective!</li>
            <li> No redness or irritation, works wonderfully and fast!</li>
            <li> Did not soften as well in microwave as fast as expected and cooled off way to fast. Had to dig it out of container and place in wax warmer. Lost a lot of product doing this.</li>
            <li> works super well!!! and doesn&#x27;t burn only a little itch. good price.</li>
            <li> So I just got it, and used it on my arms. (I use the sally hansen on my face). Now, I shall compare the 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally: First, because I&#x27;ve been using this much longer (1yr+). So I started using Sally for mostly upperlip and sideburns. I never liked the idea of waxing or shaving, because they usually come back and it looks hideous and...it feels like you&#x27;re shaving, so i opted for bleach. Because, with bleach, i can count on the lightness fading slowly, enough time for me to redo without anyones notice. Just more effective. Also, mine lasts about a month before i redo. I like sally, because it really makes it completely blonde within 5 minutes. BUT IT BURNS. I&#x27;ve got high tolerance for pain, so i just ignore it. I will also mention that Sally, contrary to peoples reviews, BURNS WAY MORE THAN SURGI!!!Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surgi:I used it on my arms. First time user, so I will definitely update as months go by, to give a better reflection on the product. The biggest reason why i bought surgi, while i had sally, is because Surgi promises to slowly make the hair light and stay that way : &amp;#34;The blended product will gradually lighten facial, arm and leg hair to a more natural skin tone shade.&amp;#34; If I am misunderstanding, please let me know. I don&#x27;t want to have high hopes when this is not true. Ok, lets move on. I spent about 10 minutes..or maybe more, on it, and it made it a light brown. I&#x27;ll most likely redo again in a few days..to make it even lighter, but it&#x27;s a nice comparison. And it doesnt burn. I honestly felt nothing, so i don&#x27;t know what people were talking about...but then again, i did say i have high tolerance for pain..so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Sally: Burns, light blonde hair, 5 minutes (10 tops), lasts about a month (does not &amp;#34;gradually&amp;#34; make and keep hair that color).&lt;br /&gt;Surgi: Doesnt burn(for me), light brown hair, 10 or more minutes, no clue how long it lasts...I just go it...so i will update. And hopefully, It really does gradually lighten the shade and keep it as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/30/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATES: (updates will go under here)</li>
            <li> In my late 50&#x27;s I notice that I have a lot of &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; and it causes my tinted sunscreen to look weird and not so smooth.  I don&#x27;t really know what I was thinking when I bought this because I don&#x27;t have dark hair on my face or arms.  I think this would be great for people with dark hair on their arms.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s meant to do. The problem is , it does burn. I followed everything that the instructions say but I can&#x27;t leave it for long as it burns too much , so I can&#x27;t leave it for long to get the correct result. My solution is to apply the cream by short amounts of times multiple times. I am bleaching my arms hair which is quite uncomfortable. It does what it&#x27;s meant to do</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite for bleaching hair.it came quick right after I bought it and ill definitely be repurchasing. totally recommend buying</li>
            <li> This is the best bleach set I&#x27;ve found lately. For some reason my local stores only seem to have the powder variety as of late, which I don&#x27;t have much luck with (powder liquefies after a few uses, and its hard to measure). I was a little nervous about ordering a product like this online but so far it is just the same as when I was able to find this in stores, and works great. With the cream formula its easy to measure out small amounts to bleach just a small area. I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with it hurting my skin, or not lightening hair adequately.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, great product. I&#x27;ve tried a few other name brand creams and this is gentler, but works better. Very impressed.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This cream works amazingly it doesn&#x27;t burn like most other creams it doesn&#x27;t make the hair invisible But it makes a lot Less noticeable it is very easy to apply I recommend thIs PrOdUct</li>
            <li> One of the best bleaching Hair products i have used. My arm hair is amazingly light and it is not as painful as other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was looking for bleach for the hair on my legs, and settled on this product: &amp;#34;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream For Face &amp; Arms&amp;#34;. I get really bad in-grown hairs when I remove the hair on my legs, and have tried just about every hair removal tactic, as well as in-grown hair treatment. Instead of looking like I had the chicken pox 24/7, I decided I would let the hair grow out, and the skin on my legs heal. We live in a culture that tends to be repulsed by women&#x27;s leg hair, so I felt ultra self-conscious, and decided I would try bleaching the hair to make it less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A large reason I choose &amp;#34;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream&amp;#34;, was due to the ingredient list. While not perfect, the Surgi brand appears to be less toxic and chemical laden when compared to other hair bleaching products available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the box, you will find a 1.5 oz. tube of Bleaching Cream, a 1 oz. tube of Activating Cream, a small plastic tray &amp; applicator spatula, as well as instructions. Since my legs are a larger surface than my arms or face, I just throw away the small plastic tray and spatula, and use a popsicle stick and small plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is fairly straight-forward, uncomplicated, and not very messy. The ratio of Bleaching Cream to Activating cream is 1:2. I have never used powdered hair bleach, but after reading the reviews of such products, I would say I was quite pleased with my experience with the Surgi bleaching cream. I found the cream to be quite hassle free. Once you measure out and mix the two creams together, you simply apply the cream to the desired location using the plastic spatula (or other spreading device). I leave the hair bleaching cream on a little longer than the instructions; I have found that 20 minutes works well for me, but I would make sure to test the product in a small area, and see what your own individual experience is. The last step is to rinse the bleaching cream off your skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark, fine hair on my legs, and the &amp;#34;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream&amp;#34; bleaches my hair blonde in one go (as I mentioned earlier, I do wait a little longer). I experienced no burning or tingling sensations while the cream is on my skin, although the skin that came into contact with the bleach did lighten, but I have found this to only be temporary. Once bleached, the hair does blend in really well, and becomes quite invisible. I use up one box of this product when bleaching the hair on both of my lower legs, but smaller areas would require much less of the bleaching cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product works great at hiding hair by bleaching it a lighter shade. It has less chemicals in it&#x27;s ingredient list, and is a hassle free product. Plus, there is no skin irritation or burning sensations during application. If you are going to bleach your body hair, this is one of the better products available.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...very easy to use...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a simple but effective way to remove unwanted facial hair. I began taking a hair growth vitamin and it is not only working for the hairs on my head, but also on hair that grows elsewhere which made facial hair more noticeable. This product works because it does drastically lighten/soften the appearance of facial hair to a light brown almost golden tint. I have used this product exactly six times everyday Tuesday-Sunday and I am pleased with the results.It has not completely become invisible but it has made it much less aggressive looking. This to me is an easier way of trying to eliminate the hair by waxing or shaving and much less time consuming (only takes 10 mins). You may experience light discomfort during the process but afterwards just use cocoa butter or vaseline or something with aloe to ease soreness. * If you are darker hued after removing it your removal area will appear slightly darker than normal but, your skin will definetly go back to it&#x27;s usual tint. My experience was about an hour but it may vary by person. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I like this product because it makes my facial hair invisible an dI don&#x27; thave to worry about hair bumps.  It alwasy stings just a bit when you first put it on.  but I don&#x27;t care.  I don&#x27;t want hair on my face!</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic in the sense that my hair went from dark brown to not noticeable AT ALL. The only bad thing is, that this stuff BURNSSSSSS. I put it on and after half the amount it says to eave it on it was itchy and felt like red hot fire. When I washed it off my skin was red, and itchy for a while. Just apply sensitive skin moisturizer and cooling gel afterwards or prepare for pain. If you don&#x27;t have a low pain tolerance, then I definitely reccomend because it does work. NOTE: ( If you use on a large area like your legs, be sure not to use the tiny little tray, use a bowl and your hands (in gloves of course), cause that tiny spatula tray will get you nowhere.</li>
            <li> Ok so I use this product a couple of times and I really like it. Yes is kind is itches and a bit burns after you wash it off but trust me its so worth it. And also the itch and stuff lasts for like ten minutes and trust me its nothing you can&#x27;t bare, heck you barely feel it. So I definitely recommend this product you will love it!</li>
            <li> Okay so to start off my face is allergic to virtually every creme ever made! The bleach I have tried burned and left hives on my face. This creme however did not leave hives while it did burn just a little bit it was more annoying then unbearably painful. Love it I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this really works or not but it burns when you use it, I&#x27;m gonna give it one more chance and try it on my arms. I would recommend jolen which is more of a pain to mix and measure but worth it, definitely more effective.</li>
            <li> Worked well, just as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Works well and works quickly. I&#x27;ve tried the Sally Hansen brand and it doesn&#x27;t even compare. The results of Invisibleach are long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to lighten my armpit hair. I was concerned that it would burn me in that sensitive area, but thankfully that didn&#x27;t happen. It tingled a little when I left on more than 10 minutes.  The color of my hair is black, and It took 3 tries to get it to lighten my hair to the shade I wanted it. After the 3rd try, I got the hair as light as my skin color, and now the hairs aren&#x27;t noticeable. The smell was awful, so I couldn&#x27;t use the product in my bedroom. I would recommend using it in a room with a lot of air flow... or use it outside. All in all, I&#x27;d say it was a good buy. But if you have really dark hair, it might take a few times for the hair to lighten.</li>
            <li> Last year i bought this same product and it was much easier to mix the creams. Now the opening for tube number 1 is the width of a toothpaste tube, while tube number 2 has the small opening like it use to. This makes it very hard to tell if i&#x27;m mixing the amounts correctly, huge globs come out filling the whole tray.</li>
            <li> Great product...works in 5 minutes</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> It kind of burned my skin (I don&#x27;t know if I was just sensitive to it but it turned red and welted up.  I left it on for the allotted time and it didn&#x27;t turn my dark brown hair much lighter...maybe lighter brown.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product; it really works wonderfully and truly invisible results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 3 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended for those who want invisible results.</li>
