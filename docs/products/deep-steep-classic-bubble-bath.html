            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The Brown Sugar Vanilla scent of this bubble bath smells amazing and this bubble bath produces A LOT of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>It bubbles up nicely with just 2 capfuls.</li>
            <li>Does not smell like vanilla does make nice bubbles in the bath</li>
            <li>I purchased because I liked the natural/mild ingredients and the &amp;#34;promise&amp;#34; that it would smell as indicated (Brown sugar &amp; vanilla).  </li>
            <li>gives you bubbles, but you would have to use almost 1/2 the bottle for a nice, luxurious bubble bath.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and wonderful product.</li>
            <li>smell wasnt very strong, so if you like that it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it</li>
            <li>I love taking a bath with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Have others tried this and found a better smell?</li>
            <li>the bubble bath was ok.</li>
            <li>It is mild and have a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>the scent was very mild and it doesn&#x60;t make many bubbles.</li>
            <li>with soft water it works great.</li>
            <li>fantastic price and fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Smells more like cheap perfume</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of Steep&#x27;s Lavender bubble bath; it is a great product; soft and gentle lavender smell with good bubbles.</li>
            <li>greatest bubble bath ever, bubbles last a long time, smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for a more vanilla sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I wanted something free of chemicals, overpowering scents, something that&#x27;s safe and environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>(I know, sounds bizarre, but true!)</li>
            <li>lovely bubble bath, mildly scented</li>
            <li>I light some scented vanilla candles, hop in the shower while the tub fills with bubble, then soak in the water.</li>
            <li>I love bubble baths, especially in winter, and was very happy to find this made with all natural ingredients....</li>
            <li>I just got this and it made tons of bubbles and smelled great and was a bigger bottle than I thought</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li>So I was excited to order the brown sugar vanilla one.</li>
            <li>This bubble bath is great and my bubbles lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li>SOme were packaged better so that the top did not pop open as easily....</li>
            <li>quickly given the scent</li>
            <li>And because of the awesome customer service I received I will only buy my Deep Steep products here!</li>
            <li>I found that you must use 3 or more capfuls to get a decent amount of bubbles.</li>
            <li>This one is a bit thin and watery and doesn&#x27;t make as many bubbles, but it smells nice and rises off nicely.</li>
            <li>My toddler and I both have sensitive skin and we love this bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>Lots of other scents as well and really good price.</li>
            <li>I love most things that are vanilla scented, but this is so sweet smelling - the vanilla vague, smells more floral to me -</li>
            <li>I expected more esp because the other reviews said it smells great</li>
            <li>mainly a soapy clean smell.</li>
            <li>Great bubbles, but the vanilla smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>but I just feel ripped off its as if the pple open the bottle took out more then 90% of the origional soap and just put in some dollars store soap,in th ed bottle and replaced the seal ...</li>
            <li>Love the Deep Steep variety but this one was open....and leaked.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and smells great after a bath and the bubbles last a long time.</li>
            <li>A little light which is better than overpowering.</li>
            <li>Given the price isn&#x27;t as high as some others this could be worth going through it</li>
            <li>It smells more like cheap car air freshener :/</li>
            <li>I tried Deep Steep because I love a bubble bath, but my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Nice bubbles and all, but no Fun smell!</li>
            <li>I feel smooth all day and the next from the bubble.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I was hoping it&#x27;s smell stronger of vanilla, but really it just smells like bubble bath</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a bubble bath that really SUDS up with lots and lots of bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This is a nice bubble bath, but it&#x27;s not as nice as the one i&#x27;m used to using [ModSpa.. which is pretty much impossible to find anymore].</li>
            <li>Bubbles were okay, but smells a little &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but I LOVE this stuff!!</li>
            <li>This bubble bath has a nice, subtle scent that is not too overpowering (which was a concern of mine purchasing it)</li>
            <li>, it smells just like that cheap hand soap from your grocery store and it made my entire body dry and itchy even after rinsing off.</li>
            <li>but you have to use quite a bit (6-8 cap-fulls) to get a really bubbly bath in a standard sized tub.  </li>
            <li>and all the other things make a long worth the while</li>
            <li>, they were not soft and fluffy, and they didn&#x27;t last long, nor make my skin feel silky and smooth.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> Soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is far too subtle.  </li>
            <li> After a few minutes, it just smells like soap.</li>
            <li> usually i dont leave negatives</li>
            <li> I usually do a mixture of Epson salt with this brown sugar vanilla.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a defective bottle, but there was no sugar or vanilla smell to it at all.</li>
            <li> sadly, the bubbles were small &amp; rough</li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> but when I pour it in the tub from the bottle its nothing weak</li>
            <li> Alas, I don&#x27;t understand; my bottle has no scent.</li>
            <li> and If I like something ill review it</li>
            <li> so ill know to buy it again</li>
            <li> sad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like when scents seem fake or chemical based</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is awful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was disappointing</li>
            <li> i review items because I have a bad memory</li>

            <li> this smell so good and the bubble and all the other things make a long worth the while</li>
            <li> The smell is good, and there are lots of bubbles! But you have to pour a lot of it into the tub...</li>
            <li> Smells great. Soft and subtle. Not too strong. But doesn&#x27;t make a lot of bubbles.</li>
            <li> Lovely bubble bath with a very nice scent!</li>
            <li> Some of the product arrived leaking into the bag that covered each botle.  SOme were packaged better so that the top did not pop open as easily....</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent &amp; bubbles well!</li>
            <li> Great bubbles, but the vanilla smell doesn&#x27;t last long. After a few minutes, it just smells like soap.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful. A little light which is better than overpowering. It bubbles up nicely with just 2 capfuls. How well it bubbles will depend on the water you have but with soft water it works great. Totally recommend if you want to stay away from sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li> Love it. Deeply relaxing. I light some scented vanilla candles, hop in the shower while the tub fills with bubble, then soak in the water. I feel smooth all day and the next from the bubble.</li>
            <li> lovely bubble bath, mildly scented</li>
            <li> This bubble bath has a nice, subtle scent that is not too overpowering (which was a concern of mine purchasing it)</li>
            <li> this was disappointing I expected more esp because the other reviews said it smells great well mine smells like nothing the aroma was in the bag but when I pour it in the tub from the bottle its nothing weak i review items because I have a bad memory and If I like something ill review it so ill know to buy it again usually i dont leave negatives but I just feel ripped off its as if the pple open the bottle took out more then 90% of the origional soap and just put in some dollars store soap,in th ed bottle and replaced the seal ...sad</li>
            <li> Does not smell like vanilla does make nice bubbles in the bath but I was hoping for a more vanilla sweet smell. It smells more like cheap car air freshener :/</li>
            <li> Bubbles were okay, but smells a little &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> greatest bubble bath ever, bubbles last a long time, smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  love.</li>
            <li> Love the Deep Steep variety but this one was open....and leaked. Not good</li>
            <li> This is an Organic Product. Do not have to worry about harmful chemicals and it smells good too. For bubble-bath lovers only.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought it I really like it you everyone should give it a try you will feel  relax after the bath</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly but you have to use quite a bit (6-8 cap-fulls) to get a really bubbly bath in a standard sized tub.  Given the price isn&#x27;t as high as some others this could be worth going through it quickly given the scent is so good!  I don&#x27;t like when scents seem fake or chemical based, this is just a warm, rich smell that makes for an excellent soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> I tried Deep Steep because I love a bubble bath, but my skin is very sensitive. I was skeptical, but I LOVE this stuff!! My skin feels and smells great after a bath and the bubbles last a long time. It&#x27;s my new favorite! And because of the awesome customer service I received I will only buy my Deep Steep products here!</li>
            <li> I felt inclined to actually write a review because i received an email asking me to not if i would rate it 3 stars or less.&lt;br /&gt;The bubbles are good, not the best, not the worst.&lt;br /&gt;The smell wasnt very strong, so if you like that it&#x27;ll work for you. I was hoping it&#x27;s smell stronger of vanilla, but really it just smells like bubble bath soap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a prettier bottle compared to others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> The Brown Sugar Vanilla scent of this bubble bath smells amazing and this bubble bath produces A LOT of bubbles.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> the smell of the brown sugar vanilla is so nice! I love taking a bath with this stuff. the bubbles last the entire bath (1 hour at least) I usually do a mixture of Epson salt with this brown sugar vanilla. fantastic price and fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it sounded like the perfect bubble bath to me. I wanted something free of chemicals, overpowering scents, something that&#x27;s safe and environmentally friendly. Unfortunately, this product is awful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it came wrapped in plastic wrap (the type you use to cover food) and when I unscrewed the cap to remove the seal.....well, there was no seal! Any personal hygiene or bath product I have ever bought has had that seal so you know you&#x27;re actually getting what is displayed on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it smells just like that cheap hand soap from your grocery store and it made my entire body dry and itchy even after rinsing off. I never had any problems with allergies so I am convinced it&#x27;s the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never ever buying anything from Deep Steep again, it was a waste of my money and I wish I could return it!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is far too subtle.  I prefer their Honeydew Spearmint version.</li>
            <li> I love most things that are vanilla scented, but this is so sweet smelling - the vanilla vague, smells more floral to me - it&#x27;s not at all what I expected. Smells more like cheap perfume and I doubt I will ever use it -</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of Steep&#x27;s Lavender bubble bath; it is a great product; soft and gentle lavender smell with good bubbles. So I was excited to order the brown sugar vanilla one. Alas, I don&#x27;t understand; my bottle has no scent. Not sure if I got a defective bottle, but there was no sugar or vanilla smell to it at all. Nice bubbles and all, but no Fun smell! Should I exchange it for another bottle? Have others tried this and found a better smell? Sugar or vanilla smell? Or is it just not a well scented one?</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t. I love bubble baths, especially in winter, and was very happy to find this made with all natural ingredients....sadly, the bubbles were small &amp; rough (I know, sounds bizarre, but true!), they were not soft and fluffy, and they didn&#x27;t last long, nor make my skin feel silky and smooth. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice bubble bath, but it&#x27;s not as nice as the one i&#x27;m used to using [ModSpa.. which is pretty much impossible to find anymore]. This one is a bit thin and watery and doesn&#x27;t make as many bubbles, but it smells nice and rises off nicely.</li>
            <li> My toddler and I both have sensitive skin and we love this bubble bath.  It is mild and have a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased because I liked the natural/mild ingredients and the &amp;#34;promise&amp;#34; that it would smell as indicated (Brown sugar &amp; vanilla).  I smells nothing like brown sugar and/or vanilla . . . mainly a soapy clean smell. The bubble are short lived. . . didn&#x27;t add anything to my bath.  I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I bought as a gift no review yet</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful and the scent lasts after the shower rinse. Will definitely continue to purchase deep steep product line.</li>
            <li> I just got this and it made tons of bubbles and smelled great and was a bigger bottle than I thought so you get a lot for your money. I  got the lavender camomile scent too. This bubble bath is great and my bubbles lasted for a long time. Lots of other scents as well and really good price.</li>
            <li> Smells, really, really good. I have yet to find a bubble bath that really SUDS up with lots and lots of bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;This gives you bubbles, but you would have to use almost 1/2 the bottle for a nice, luxurious bubble bath. At $10.50, I like to use something that would last longer than 3 baths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is the brown sugar and vanilla flavor. Again, smells yummy, but not a lot of suds. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> the bubble bath was ok. the scent was very mild and it doesn&#x60;t make many bubbles. I found that you must use 3 or more capfuls to get a decent amount of bubbles. I prefer Avon bubble bath over this one.</li>
