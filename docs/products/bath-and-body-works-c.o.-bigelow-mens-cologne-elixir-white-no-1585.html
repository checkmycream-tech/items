            <li>C.O. Bigelow No.032 Bay Rum Original Formulary Cologne</li>
            <li>Great for just everday when you want to just spritz with something a little light and masculine to refresh yourself and make sure you&#x27;re not giving off &#x27;the funk.&#x27;</li>
            <li>He is 30 years old, so he wanted to smell age appropriate...</li>
            <li>always complimented on the clan, fresh smell of this product----and</li>
            <li>I have most of the other Bigelow fragrances and this one might have just earned the &#x27;favorite&#x27; spot with me.</li>
            <li>People tend to comment (positively) on its effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my premium fragrance for special occassions usually, but for everyday freshness / nice scent, it&#x27;s light and crisp, fresh, and I&#x27;ve often gotten compliments on it.</li>

            <li>It really isn&#x27;t an aftershave</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of polo green and smells very manly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bigelow produces quality products and this one comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>White No 1585 is a fresh, citrusy smelling cologne that can be worn during the day or evening.  </li>
            <li>When I smelled this one, it reminded me of a fruitier/lighter version of Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>so you see that I am old school when it comes to fragrances.</li>

            <li> Great stuff...The ladies love it.</li>
            <li> Really nice daytime cologne at a very reasonable price. It&#x27;s scent stay on during the day. People tend to comment (positively) on its effect.</li>
            <li> I had intended to order the Bigelow Bay Rum cologne and mistakenly clicked on this product. This fragrance has staying power and is, in fact, reminiscent of a barber shop. More importantly, the women in my life love the scent.</li>
            <li> My hubby is an &amp;#34;old soul&amp;#34; and loves to smell great every day for work or going out.

            <li> Nice product, good price, and all the packing is recyclable!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it!!  Much better deal than most fragrances that are 5X the price!</li>
            <li> Love this. A friend turned me on to it by giving me a half-filled used bottle and I&#x27;ve bought it ever since. Great for just everday when you want to just spritz with something a little light and masculine to refresh yourself and make sure you&#x27;re not giving off &#x27;the funk.&#x27; Great price for the quantity you get and last a while. It&#x27;s not my premium fragrance for special occassions usually, but for everyday freshness / nice scent, it&#x27;s light and crisp, fresh, and I&#x27;ve often gotten compliments on it. I recommend!</li>
            <li> White No 1585 is a fresh, citrusy smelling cologne that can be worn during the day or evening.  I have most of the other Bigelow fragrances and this one might have just earned the &#x27;favorite&#x27; spot with me.</li>
            <li> Picked this up at bath and body works and I have to say this smells great. Im a cologne collector and this smells beat some of my $50+ ones. It kind of reminds me of polo green and smells very manly.</li>
            <li> This is the cologne my boyfriend wears and it is absolutely wonderful. I try to make sure he always has it.</li>
            <li> Everything went fine and as planned...love this cologne!</li>
            <li> This order came on time &amp; has it&#x27;s authentic smell;no better way or deal comes close...... Appreciationz :)</li>
            <li> At last, cologne that smells like a top-shelf vodka tonic.  All the women in my life can rest easy;  I&#x27;m officially in love with myself.  That&#x27;s how good this cologne smells.</li>
            <li> always complimented on the clan, fresh smell of this product----and it lasts----keep one in the car and one at home.</li>
            <li> My son purchased this cologne for me and I am impressed. I am a fan of [[ASIN:B0085UECY2 Proraso Aftershave Lotion, Refresh, 100 ml]] and [[ASIN:B001EZ3XU4 Bath &amp; Body Works C.O. Bigelow No.032 Bay Rum Original Formulary Cologne For Men 3.4 fl oz (100 ml)]] so you see that I am old school when it comes to fragrances. Bigelow 1585 has a pleasing, herbal, woodsy scent that lasts a long time, but isn&#x27;t too overpowering. I have received quite a few compliments. It really isn&#x27;t an aftershave and because I shave 5 times/week, I usually save this scent for evenings.&lt;br /&gt;Bigelow produces quality products and this one comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter - ask her!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my son... he loves it!</li>
            <li> Nice sporty fragrance cologne for men.</li>
            <li> Great scent! Quick delivery!</li>
