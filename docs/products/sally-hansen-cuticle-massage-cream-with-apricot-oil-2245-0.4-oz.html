            <li>Great stuff-Hardens and shines nails.  </li>
            <li>AGO I AM HAPPY TO SEE IT</li>
            <li>BACK.I IS GREAT FOR NAILS AND CUTLES</li>
            <li>Still works great though.</li>
            <li>Happy with both the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>I may have been mistaken, but it works great anyway.</li>
            <li>Cream is great</li>
            <li>but it is just OK, that the best stuff I have used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sally Hansen Cuticle Massage Cream for many years and it is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>Really good stuff.  </li>

            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>But for a week or so after a manicure, I use this and it does help with keeping my cuticles looking nice.</li>
            <li>Keep it handy.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best cuticle cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>There is better out there</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>and it turned out to be BETTER</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it and the smell</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cuticle cream for 15 years or more, nothing works quite as well.  </li>
            <li>I love doing rock work and gardening around my home</li>
            <li>This has saved my nails and cuticles so they look healthy.</li>
            <li>sometimes so I&#x27;m glad I can find it on here.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works very well.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it works perfectly for my very dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>I love this fabulous product because it perfects your cuticles.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get the full benefit, but if you remember to use it regularly, your hands will look wonderful.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic cuticle cream.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>It smells great (mild apricot scent) and it absorbs very quickly so you aren&#x27;t left with greasy fingers.</li>
            <li>Super easy to take with you in your purse</li>
            <li>I clean houses for a living</li>
            <li>This is nice stuff for keeping your cuticles soft.  </li>
            <li>It is no longer available at my local retail store; I was thrilled to find it on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>After getting your cuticles healthy, taking biotin capsules, and using rejuvacote nail growth polish, I now have long beautiful nails that are real and looks like an American manicure but better because it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>I put a little on at night before I go to bed and by morning it has helped greatly.  </li>
            <li>The only cuticle cream I&#x27;ve tried that keeps my cuticles nice without softening my nails.  </li>
            <li>so I ran across this cream and honestly after the second time I used it I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>Also, I never wear nail polish, so the cream that is rubbed onto the nail can be absorbed into the nail itself and keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, my cuticles are hardly ever scraggly, does a good job!</li>
            <li>I usually use it right before bed and in the morning my cuticles and nails look great.  </li>
            <li>It also is great to expedite the healing of small cuts or scratches.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li>My cuticles and hands are always very dry and this cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li>One problem that I have found is that it has been dried out when I have purchased it at a local store, but I am happy to see that you now have a seal on it to keep it fresh longer.  </li>
            <li>haha), because he uses it consistently.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that ALWAYS delivers excellent results, and after 40 years of trying a wide variety of products (including creams and oils supposedly made specifically for classical guitarists), that&#x27;s saying a lot.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and it stays where you put it and absorbs into skin nicely leaving a slight smoothness where it was applied.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make much difference, so I stopped buying it.  </li>
            <li>really work on your nails and cuticles too</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t oily at all and works way better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li>great little secret love this product</li>
            <li>Even with using it up to six or seven times more frequently than directed, a single 0.4 oz.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>Love the product but one container was completely dried up and unusable.</li>
            <li>I play classical guitar and the strings are played with the nails, so strong nails are essential.  </li>
            <li>has been able to do -- it makes my cuticles soft, easily manageable, and keeps hangnails from forming (which used to happen daily due to my dry skin).</li>
            <li>First let me say, I ordered this 2pack but only got one.</li>
            <li>Way back when I first started using this</li>
            <li>An advantage of this cream is that it not only takes care of cuticles, making professional manicures unnecessary, but over time encourages the growth of strong, white nails (perhaps because the nails grow from the cuticle bed, and a healthier bed means better nails).  </li>
            <li>However, Sally Hansen listened to customers and fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li>Then my husband complained about rough fingertips and cracking nails, and he tried it-and loved it.  </li>
            <li>One of the two I received was a bit granular which is not typical for this product.</li>
            <li>Applying this stuff just before bed every night has done what no other product on the market (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a LOT!)</li>
            <li>It works fast and effectively on dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I use it at least five or six times daily, and sometimes more --</li>
            <li>The old brand I used was white</li>
            <li>I recently moved to an area with a major climate change.</li>

            <li> A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> Dry skin on your feet?  </li>
            <li> last!/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream used to dry out</li>
            <li> This smells peachy to me and has saved my hands from the ragged and dry cuticles I get every winter.</li>
            <li> As I aged, I started getting hangnails.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds to rub a bit into the cuticles and onto the nails, so I don&#x27;t find it too much trouble.  </li>
            <li> I am usually too lazy to wear gloves when cleaning or gardening but as long as I use this cream regularly my nails never weaken or break.  </li>
            <li> , I wash my hands constantly and clean my home with chemicals and never remember to wears gloves, so my cuticles get really raw and painful...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that since they color it orange it sometimes stains my clothes and ruins them.  </li>
            <li> This two-pack costs me about half of what I pay at W.....t.</li>
            <li> and when I bought it few times in the past, it was so dry that I could not use it and had to return it.</li>
            <li> I use this cream everyday and have a container in purse, kitchen and bathroom.</li>
            <li> The cream is very stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it in stores</li>
            <li> If I stop using it for any length of time (which I have done in the past, when I ran out and failed to replace it promptly) my nails grow weak and thin.  </li>
            <li> Part of the secret is probably seeing it so often that I apply it often.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you&#x27;re prone to calluses on your fingers, like I am, once they form, this stuff is useless.  </li>
            <li> vial lasts for months, and it isn&#x27;t expensive to begin with.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed when using this product.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering or annoying as some reviewers said.</li>
            <li> I had horrible hangnails (cuticle lifting all around the edges of the nail)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using this years ago for cosmetic purposes.  It didn&#x27;t make much difference, so I stopped buying it.  As I aged, I started getting hangnails.  Since this was the only cuticle cream I had ever seen, I tried it again.  Miracle!  Then my husband complained about rough fingertips and cracking nails, and he tried it-and loved it.  Now I can&#x27;t keep it on hand (uh, no pun intended, but...haha), because he uses it consistently.  This two-pack costs me about half of what I pay at W.....t.</li>
            <li> The cream is very stiff.  I actually wonder if it was &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; when I received it.  I have used it anyway...but wish it was creamier and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this fabulous product because it perfects your cuticles. The cuticle disappears with smoothness after you apply it. I would never use cuticle oil because if you touch your face or anything else after applying it you will end up with oily skin. This product isn&#x27;t oily at all and works way better than any other I have used. After getting your cuticles healthy, taking biotin capsules, and using rejuvacote nail growth polish, I now have long beautiful nails that are real and looks like an American manicure but better because it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> This is nice stuff for keeping your cuticles soft.  Unfortunately, if you&#x27;re prone to calluses on your fingers, like I am, once they form, this stuff is useless.  But for a week or so after a manicure, I use this and it does help with keeping my cuticles looking nice.</li>
            <li> great little secret love this product it&#x27;s creamy smells great really work on your nails and cuticles too</li>
            <li> I used to &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; at my cuticles as a child.  As such, I have extremely dry and damaged cuticles. Applying this stuff just before bed every night has done what no other product on the market (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a LOT!) has been able to do -- it makes my cuticles soft, easily manageable, and keeps hangnails from forming (which used to happen daily due to my dry skin). Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.  I usually use it right before bed and in the morning my cuticles and nails look great.  I have also noticed a decrease in hangnails since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff-Hardens and shines nails.  Good price, rapid delivery!!</li>
            <li> I got this because it was a 2:1 with my sister.  I have used before and it was priced well but it is just OK, that the best stuff I have used.  There is better out there but if you are trying to find a cheaper product this will do.</li>
            <li> First let me say, I ordered this 2pack but only got one. Amazon did refund me without any problems though. But as for the product, I&#x27;ve used this since I was 14 when I took cosmetology. I love the smell of this. It isn&#x27;t overpowering or annoying as some reviewers said. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it stays where you put it and absorbs into skin nicely leaving a slight smoothness where it was applied. Way back when I first started using this I had horrible hangnails (cuticle lifting all around the edges of the nail) and this totally stopped that from happening. You won&#x27;t be disappointed when using this product.</li>
            <li> Super easy to take with you in your purse and since it&#x27;s a cream you don&#x27;t have to worry about it spilling as you would with cuticle oil. It smells great (mild apricot scent) and it absorbs very quickly so you aren&#x27;t left with greasy fingers.</li>
            <li> I have tried every cuticle cream on the market.  At one time Revlon was my favorite; it was always difficult to find so I tried Sally Hansen Cuticle cream and it turned out to be BETTER AND THE BEST WORKING CREAM EVER MADE. I have been using it now for years.</li>
            <li> I USED TO BUY IT A LONG TIME AGO I AM HAPPY TO SEE IT BACK.I IS GREAT FOR NAILS AND CUTLES</li>
            <li> I use this cream everyday and have a container in purse, kitchen and bathroom. Anything that dries out your hands, will also affect your cuticles. Keep it handy.</li>
            <li> This is a good product - smells nice, softens finger tips nicely. The only problem  I have is that like the other reviews, I only received 1, instead of the Pack of 2 the description says. I thought Amazon would have figured out their problem with the packing of this in a box, but they did not.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE!  Problems with cuticles solved!  Did you know that you can use it on your feet too?  Dry skin on your feet?  Now gone...  /But don&#x27;t tell anyone, so supplies last!/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream used to dry out and when I bought it few times in the past, it was so dry that I could not use it and had to return it. However, Sally Hansen listened to customers and fixed the problem.  Each jar now has a protective cover. Drying issue - solved. Thank you Sally Hansen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, my cuticles are hardly ever scraggly, does a good job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it and the smell</li>
            <li> This smells peachy to me and has saved my hands from the ragged and dry cuticles I get every winter. Plus, it&#x27;s so tiny that I keep it on my desk at work. Part of the secret is probably seeing it so often that I apply it often. And that I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. One of the two I received was a bit granular which is not typical for this product. That is why I gave it four stars. Still works great though.</li>
            <li> The only cuticle cream I&#x27;ve tried that keeps my cuticles nice without softening my nails.  I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  I apply at night before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning, my cuticles and rough edges around my fingernails are moisturized and not nearly as rough as they were before using the product.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a few weeks so far but so far so good.  Happy with both the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I helps cut down/dissolve the cuticles without having to remove it afterwards, and it keeps my entire nail and cuticle area healthier. Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve use this for years. It also is great to expedite the healing of small cuts or scratches. I thought the package used to say it was fortified with vitamin e, but I don&#x27;t see that on here. I may have been mistaken, but it works great anyway.</li>
            <li> Cream is great but it was not a &amp;#34;pack of two&amp;#34; as indicated.  I only received one .4 ounce jar. So rather over-priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sally Hansen Cuticle Massage Cream for many years and it is the best I have found.  I have also recently tried your Salon Manicure Cuticle Eraser and Balm and tried another of your cuticle products through the years and neither compare to the massage cream.  I like the fact that it is thicker and remains on the cuticles longer.  It has a very pleasing fragrance.  One problem that I have found is that it has been dried out when I have purchased it at a local store, but I am happy to see that you now have a seal on it to keep it fresh longer.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue this product.  The reason I purchased it online is that I am having problems finding it locally.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years.  It is no longer available at my local retail store; I was thrilled to find it on amazon.com.  It is absolutely the best cuticle cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to an area with a major climate change. The tips of my fingers were getting so scaly so I ran across this cream and honestly after the second time I used it I noticed a difference. And you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a great product -- my cuticles have never been better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cuticle cream for 15 years or more, nothing works quite as well.  I love doing rock work and gardening around my home, I wash my hands constantly and clean my home with chemicals and never remember to wears gloves, so my cuticles get really raw and painful...I put a little on at night before I go to bed and by morning it has helped greatly.  I always have a jar on hand.  I never remember to use it daily so I don&#x27;t get the full benefit, but if you remember to use it regularly, your hands will look wonderful.</li>
            <li> An advantage of this cream is that it not only takes care of cuticles, making professional manicures unnecessary, but over time encourages the growth of strong, white nails (perhaps because the nails grow from the cuticle bed, and a healthier bed means better nails).  I play classical guitar and the strings are played with the nails, so strong nails are essential.  I have tried just about everything out there for maintaining my nails and this product is the finest I&#x27;ve found.  I am usually too lazy to wear gloves when cleaning or gardening but as long as I use this cream regularly my nails never weaken or break.  If I stop using it for any length of time (which I have done in the past, when I ran out and failed to replace it promptly) my nails grow weak and thin.  Note: the directions say to use this cream daily.  I use it at least five or six times daily, and sometimes more -- the results I describe may require this level of use.  It only takes a few seconds to rub a bit into the cuticles and onto the nails, so I don&#x27;t find it too much trouble.  Also, I never wear nail polish, so the cream that is rubbed onto the nail can be absorbed into the nail itself and keep it from drying out. This is the only product I have found that ALWAYS delivers excellent results, and after 40 years of trying a wide variety of products (including creams and oils supposedly made specifically for classical guitarists), that&#x27;s saying a lot.  Even with using it up to six or seven times more frequently than directed, a single 0.4 oz. vial lasts for months, and it isn&#x27;t expensive to begin with.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time to prevent hang nails.  My only complaint is that since they color it orange it sometimes stains my clothes and ruins them.  The old brand I used was white and I can no longer get it.</li>
            <li> This has saved my nails and cuticles so they look healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works perfectly for my very dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> It is what it is. What else can I say. My wife likes it and uses it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cuticle cream.  Easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s thick so it stays in place on your cuticles to allow it to soften your cuticles. I clean houses for a living and my hands are constantly in water. My cuticles and hands are always very dry and this cream is amazing. I have a hard time finding it in stores sometimes so I&#x27;m glad I can find it on here.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works very well.</li>
            <li> I used to find this in the store with an apricot scent.  I can&#x27;t find that, but these work just as well.  I keep one a work in my desk at work, one by my chair in the living room and one on my night stand.  It works fast and effectively on dry cuticles.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love the product but one container was completely dried up and unusable.</li>
