            <li>But according to a plastic surgeon quoted at the end of the article, if you are looking for a magic bullet, this is not it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I could improve my skin much more.  </li>

            <li>The fine lines around my eyes have diminished.</li>
            <li>I use the Illumask for fine lines and brown spots.  </li>
            <li>Her skin looked brighter, smoother and the fine lines around her eyes disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy more!</li>
            <li>great product, easy to use (actually</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with my results!</li>
            <li>I wake up automatically when the light goes out after 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>15 minutes at night to wear the mask and  thoroughly enjoy the break of running around.</li>
            <li>With free shipping.  </li>
            <li>The results are amazing, considering I didn&#x27;t need that much improving.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;The magic bullet is no sun, or a good sunblock, and daily skin care maintenance.&amp;#34;  That sounds like stay out of the sun and use soap and water to me.</li>
            <li>that I loathe so much!!!</li>
            <li>it is very economical.</li>
            <li>I have now used the mask a full month.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and after only 3 weeks of use, I already see my skin tone is more even and fine lines are shrinking.</li>
            <li>This is a super product and it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend his mask:)</li>
            <li>I now leave the house with so much less make up on, but feel more confident!</li>
            <li>I noticed slight change in my skin after my first use, i was super excited and thought if I&#x27;m seeing a change after just one use, just imagine how great my skin is going to look after 30days</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very relaxing and easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get results, at least you&#x27;ve tried home anti-aging light therapy without a huge upfront cost; if it does, well, good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far my skin has changed for the better.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t worth a penny.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the product twice and therefore can not attest to whether it is effective in improving my skin.</li>
            <li>This mask is DISRUPTIVE to the industry as it brings easy-to-see results right at home.</li>
            <li>and she noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I definetly think, however, that it&#x27;s worth a try for someone who wants to improve the appearance of her skin.</li>
            <li>My face looks younger and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>It may be unrelated but the evening of my first use of this mask...</li>
            <li>Phototherapy used to only be available at your aestheticians office so I am grateful there is finally a product on the market you can use in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li>My skin looks younger and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have a relaxing 15 minutes, usually I meditate while I have the mask on, and have smoother skin right away.  </li>
            <li>And even less, per mask, if I sign her up for a monthly plan, which she wants to do, using her own credit card rather than my Amazon card.  </li>
            <li>I found my skin was definitely plumped up and the fine line and wrinkles reduced.  </li>
            <li>I previously suggested, if after trying the mask, you want to continue home light therapy, I&#x27;d invest in one of the longer lasting, more powerful devices.</li>
            <li>I got mine through my esthetician and it was much cheaper then on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>To Illumask,&lt;br /&gt; From what I&#x27;ve heard and results on my friends and reviews I have read, I would absolutely try this!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>So much for that wrinkle cream graveyard under my sink.</li>
            <li>They are not FDA approved to really work</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I paid $29.97 at Walmart &amp; although it was much cheaper</li>
            <li>You can jerryrig it to give you more sessions according to other users.</li>
            <li>Acne scars have pretty much disappeared and age spots are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>, I can see my face is glowing, the red is blending naturally with my extra white skin so my face looks naturally smooth and my complexion is more consistent and radiant.  </li>
            <li>I have been using IlluMask for over 30 days now and have noticed improvement in my skin tones...diminished wrinkles and my dark circles are not as prominent as they used to be.  </li>
            <li>70 with a lot of wrinkles and see some slight changes for the better.</li>
            <li>it works, good for you; if not, you&#x27;ve only wasted</li>
            <li>a truly grat product and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it .  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely positive I am NOT the only one who feels this way, as I have read many other comments!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doing so would not only be cheaper in the long run, it&#x27;d also be a better choice for the environment.</li>
            <li>I bought the mask with the idea that if I got results, I&#x27;d invest in one of the more expensive light-emitting devices that fight aging (it seems like a huge waste of money to spend $28-$40 dollars every month on this mask when one could get a longer lasting device for $200-300).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days of consistently using the mask as instructed, I did notice that my skin appeared to be a bit brighter and the tone was a bit more even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the slight improvement, but probably not enough to buy the mask again or to invest in a more expensive device.</li>
            <li>I use the antiaging mask pretty regularly.  </li>
            <li>Less fine lines and after 45 days my friends are beginning to comment.  </li>
            <li>The only other product that I love are insoles for all my shoes.  </li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and found that  my fine lines and dark pigment spots on my face have either disappeared or diminished considerably.</li>
            <li>So I normally run around all day with no down time</li>
            <li>I have been using the illumask for approximately one month, the ease of use along with the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change since the third day.</li>
            <li>Was surprised by the Amazon price.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing my second one very soon.</li>
            <li>This product is a complete change to beauty care as we know it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beginning to think all the positive reviews are fake, more like a scam.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll preface my review by saying that I&#x27;m 51 years old and still get carded on a regular basis when I buy liquor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the mask for a month and a half and my face looks so much clearer!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete waste of 15 minutes of your day &amp; it did absolutely nothing for my face.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> it works, good for you; if not, you&#x27;ve only wasted</li>
            <li> a truly grat product and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it .  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely positive I am NOT the only one who feels this way, as I have read many other comments!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doing so would not only be cheaper in the long run, it&#x27;d also be a better choice for the environment.</li>
            <li> I bought the mask with the idea that if I got results, I&#x27;d invest in one of the more expensive light-emitting devices that fight aging (it seems like a huge waste of money to spend $28-$40 dollars every month on this mask when one could get a longer lasting device for $200-300).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days of consistently using the mask as instructed, I did notice that my skin appeared to be a bit brighter and the tone was a bit more even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the slight improvement, but probably not enough to buy the mask again or to invest in a more expensive device.</li>
            <li> I use the antiaging mask pretty regularly.  </li>
            <li> Less fine lines and after 45 days my friends are beginning to comment.  </li>
            <li> The only other product that I love are insoles for all my shoes.  </li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and found that  my fine lines and dark pigment spots on my face have either disappeared or diminished considerably.</li>
            <li> So I normally run around all day with no down time</li>
            <li> I have been using the illumask for approximately one month, the ease of use along with the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change since the third day.</li>
            <li> Was surprised by the Amazon price.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing my second one very soon.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete change to beauty care as we know it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to think all the positive reviews are fake, more like a scam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface my review by saying that I&#x27;m 51 years old and still get carded on a regular basis when I buy liquor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mask for a month and a half and my face looks so much clearer!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste of 15 minutes of your day &amp; it did absolutely nothing for my face.  </li>
            <li> I noticed bad reviews due to a person resell in the mask for profit we should focus on how great the product is when writing a review, I am not a product queen</li>
            <li> I am on my 5th mask and will continue, it works out to be much cheaper than all of the prescription topical creams I had previously been using!!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is I seem to take a 15 minute nap every single time I use it.  </li>
            <li> As you can probably imagine, I don&#x27;t have any lines, sagging or other issues typically related to aging skin.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the dark spots on my cheeks have faded a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> and I think my skin overall looks less coarse, the pores are less defined.</li>
            <li> your skin just starts to look healthier and younger after about 14 days maybe less.  </li>
            <li> boy was I wrong, that first use was the only time I saw any change</li>
            <li> their on-line price for a single mask is HALF of what I paid through an Amazon vendor.  </li>
            <li> I have read that other people have Jimmy Rigged the mask to work without buying refills</li>
            <li> However, a few months back, I noticed that my skin tone was getting a bit uneven in a few spots and that I had some discoloration on my cheek bones.</li>
            <li> It is fresher looking and slightly tighter.</li>
            <li> I close my eyes and typically fall asleep while using it,  granted I use it after I wash my face at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Does this work on black women&#x27;s skin?</li>
            <li> I have only gotten cold sores like once every two or three years as an adult.</li>
            <li> There are VISIBLE a results and little effort.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for just a few weeks and wish I would have known about this product years ago.</li>
            <li> She used it everyday for 30-days</li>
            <li> Usually it makes me go to sleep while using it</li>
            <li> Just do it everyday...!</li>
            <li> Being a devoted Erno Laszlo user for the past 17years</li>
            <li> My doctor does photo thepary in his office for thousands of dollars, what a waste of money!!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s so expensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The expensive creams and potions</li>
            <li> , I have everyone for I am a master of expensive cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks into using I have to stop for a while because my skin is so dry it looks awful.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that I have been prone to develop cold sores on my lips with sun exposure since childhood.</li>
            <li> That cold sore on my lip</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a device like this could improve my skin, but people it does!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using the illumask for approximately one month, the ease of use along with the results are amazing.  My skin looks younger and more vibrant.  The color tones have evened out and I am  very happy with the results</li>
            <li> performed as advertised&lt;br /&gt; would recommend this product to my friends</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Helps with the fine lines and wrinkles.  I got mine through my esthetician and it was much cheaper then on Amazon.  Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I use the antiaging mask pretty regularly.  Very happy with it!  My son can not go without the anti acne!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mask for 1 year now and I am extremely happy with the results.  I have seen a tremendouse difference in my skin tone, coloration and diminished fine wrinkles.  I purchase 2 at a time so i make sure i never make the mistake of skipping a day.  a truly grat product and highly recommended.  A simple 15 minutes a day is all you need to have to make this difference!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! Ingenius! It is so easy to use and after only 3 weeks of use, I already see my skin tone is more even and fine lines are shrinking.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I cannot believe that this even actually works.  It works amazing.  I can not explain it, after just one week of using this every day, only one application, I can see my face is glowing, the red is blending naturally with my extra white skin so my face looks naturally smooth and my complexion is more consistent and radiant.  I love it.  You just have to try it to believe it.  I was a skeptic.  I am now a true believer!  Do yourself a favor and just try it once.. you will see.  You will fall in love with your own beauty again!</li>
            <li> I have been using IlluMask for over 30 days now and have noticed improvement in my skin tones...diminished wrinkles and my dark circles are not as prominent as they used to be.  Overall, I am very pleased with my results!</li>
            <li> Aging gracefully is my thing, especially as a woman of color.  It&#x27;s like a very light airbrushing after 30 days.  My tone is more even and a bit firmer!  Less fine lines and after 45 days my friends are beginning to comment.  I feel more confident leaving the house with no make-up.  Usually it makes me go to sleep while using it so it&#x27;s very relaxing and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, and I can see an improvement in my skin.  I will continue using it because the results are so good!  I find it relaxing too.  I set aside 15 minutes of each day &amp;#34;for me&amp;#34;.  I never relaxed during the day, and this gives me a reason to allow myself 15 minutes, knowing I am helping my skin&#x27;s appearance during my break.  It is a &amp;#34;win-win&amp;#34; for me. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> To Illumask,&lt;br /&gt; From what I&#x27;ve heard and results on my friends and reviews I have read, I would absolutely try this!!!&lt;br /&gt;  If and when, I do not have to buy 30 to 90 days treatment refills!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  I have read that other people have Jimmy Rigged the mask to work without buying refills, I would not go that route. just as I will not buy a product that I would have to repeatedly buy refills to use!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  When the Illumask finally decide to make the product a buy and use, no strings attached purchase, I will wait!!!&lt;br /&gt;  I will be waiting to make a purchase of my own Illumask. I am absolutely positive I am NOT the only one who feels this way, as I have read many other comments!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Please, I know you can do it, I am positive you will have many very happy customers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for a week and I will update with final results. So far my skin has changed for the better. It is fresher looking and slightly tighter. Good results for one week. I gave it three stars because:  It is not &amp;#34;relaxing&amp;#34; as the manufacturer suggests. It is a pain to use. It&#x27;s like looking into 10,000 blinding suns, all while breathing toxic plastic fumes from the mask shield. Then the doorbell rings or there&#x27;s a fight between the kids and you have to take it off.  Problem is, you&#x27;re only allowed 30 sessions per mask. Then the thing quits. You can jerryrig it to give you more sessions according to other users. Otherwise you have to BUY another mask. This is unacceptable. No product should be designed to quit after X amount of uses.  I got this one at Target for $29.99. I think Walmart sells it for that price, too.  UPDATE: Two weeks into using I have to stop for a while because my skin is so dry it looks awful. I do think it has reduced my rosacea and I think my skin overall looks less coarse, the pores are less defined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface my review by saying that I&#x27;m 51 years old and still get carded on a regular basis when I buy liquor. As you can probably imagine, I don&#x27;t have any lines, sagging or other issues typically related to aging skin. However, a few months back, I noticed that my skin tone was getting a bit uneven in a few spots and that I had some discoloration on my cheek bones. I decided to try the Illumask to see if I could nip those issues in the bud. I bought the mask with the idea that if I got results, I&#x27;d invest in one of the more expensive light-emitting devices that fight aging (it seems like a huge waste of money to spend $28-$40 dollars every month on this mask when one could get a longer lasting device for $200-300).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days of consistently using the mask as instructed, I did notice that my skin appeared to be a bit brighter and the tone was a bit more even. I also noticed that the dark spots on my cheeks have faded a tiny bit. I have now used the mask a full month. I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change since the third day. I&#x27;m happy with the slight improvement, but probably not enough to buy the mask again or to invest in a more expensive device. It could be that my results were not big because I don&#x27;t have a lot of aging issues that need to be remedied. I definetly think, however, that it&#x27;s worth a try for someone who wants to improve the appearance of her skin. If you don&#x27;t get results, at least you&#x27;ve tried home anti-aging light therapy without a huge upfront cost; if it does, well, good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I previously suggested, if after trying the mask, you want to continue home light therapy, I&#x27;d invest in one of the longer lasting, more powerful devices. Doing so would not only be cheaper in the long run, it&#x27;d also be a better choice for the environment. The mask is non-recyclable. I hate the idea of thousands of these things flooding town dumps across the country every month, where they&#x27;ll probably remain for ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it works, good for you; if not, you&#x27;ve only wasted</li>
            <li> I have used the mask every day since January 2013. I am 67 years old and found that  my fine lines and dark pigment spots on my face have either disappeared or diminished considerably. I have recommended it to my sister and friends. I use it every morning while I do isometric exercises and am completely satisfied with it. I would highly recommend it .  Easy to use... Just do it everyday...!</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I am on my second one. I noticed a difference in my fine lines and skin tone. I got my at Target. Was surprised by the Amazon price. Contrary to what I&#x27;ve read, I find it relaxing. I close my eyes and typically fall asleep while using it,  granted I use it after I wash my face at night before I go to bed. Recommending to all my friends. So much for that wrinkle cream graveyard under my sink. The mask is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have used this and seen improvement on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Does this work on black women&#x27;s skin?</li>
            <li> I found my skin was definitely plumped up and the fine line and wrinkles reduced.  In addition, it totally relaxes me and at the same time I getting skin rejuvenation.  This is a great at home device and the pricepoint is very reasonable.  I will be purchasing my second one very soon.</li>
            <li> This is a super product and it only&lt;br /&gt;Makes sense why it would work for everyone ! I noticed bad reviews due to a person resell in the mask for profit we should focus on how great the product is when writing a review, I am not a product queen so this is great for me</li>
            <li> it works great but its cheaper almost everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for just a few weeks and wish I would have known about this product years ago. It is absolutely the BEST invention for skin care out there. At $1/day (yes you can purchase this mask at Target for $30) it is very economical. The results are amazing. My skin tone has improved. The fine lines around my eyes have diminished. I wish I could attach my personal before and after pictures here. It&#x27;s so easy to use. You open the box, pull out the mask, put it on like a pair of sunglasses and press the on button. The lights are not bothersome at all. It is quite relaxing. Fifteen minutes of &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time each night before I go to bed that produces great results - what more can you ask for? Definitely a product I will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the product! The way how easy it is to use, the result, the price! A great find, for every one, who looks to improve their look, without spending a fortune. A great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mask for a month and a half and my face looks so much clearer!  Acne scars have pretty much disappeared and age spots are almost completely gone.  It&#x27;s so nice to have a relaxing 15 minutes, usually I meditate while I have the mask on, and have smoother skin right away.  I will definitely keep using the mask and would recommend it for aging skin concerns.  I now leave the house with so much less make up on, but feel more confident!</li>
            <li> great product, easy to use (actually relaxing)...continue to get great results!</li>
            <li> This product is a complete change to beauty care as we know it. There are VISIBLE a results and little effort. This mask is DISRUPTIVE to the industry as it brings easy-to-see results right at home. I can&#x27;t tell you how impressed I really am. I&#x27;m 44.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on any product ever until now.  I use the Illumask for fine lines and brown spots.  I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how many people comment on my skin since using the mask.  You don&#x27;t see results instantly, it&#x27;s more like your skin just starts to look healthier and younger after about 14 days maybe less.  I use to follow the directions and only use the mask once a day but I now use it twice a day.  What a product, it truly works!  This is amazing!  The only problem I have with it is I seem to take a 15 minute nap every single time I use it.  I wake up automatically when the light goes out after 15 minutes.  So I normally run around all day with no down time but now I take 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night to wear the mask and  thoroughly enjoy the break of running around. I&#x27;m over 60 years and this is the greatest product ever.  By the way, I have also skipped some days but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter., it still works.  The expensive creams and potions, I have everyone for I am a master of expensive cosmetics.  They are all BS.  They are not FDA approved to really work BUT THE ILLUMASK IS FDA APPROVED BECAUSE IT REALLY WORKS. The only other product that I love are insoles for all my shoes.  Those have also changed my life like the Illumask.  My doctor does photo thepary in his office for thousands of dollars, what a waste of money!!  Do it at home with the Illumask for $30.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Illu acne mask. I have Rosacea and this anti aging mask immediately takes away any redness and evens out my skin tone!!! I am on my 5th mask and will continue, it works out to be much cheaper than all of the prescription topical creams I had previously been using!! I highly recommend his mask:)</li>
            <li> The anti aging mask has made a difference in my skins appearance for the better!  It has also made the fine lines around my eyes disappear and my skin is brighter and more youthful. I find this mask to be the easiest beauty item to use and it feels warm and relaxing. Today i saw it featured on the Today Show as a must have gadget and I am happy that more people will see how wonderful it really is!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  My face looks younger and more radiant.  Definitely helped even my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Just perfect every step of the way!!!</li>
            <li> Not that my wife doesn&#x27;t like the product, I just don&#x27;t like the price being quoted on Amazon.  My wife seems pleased with the results after 30 days, and asked me to reorder another one for her.  BUT I went to the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, which is listed with the instructions, and their on-line price for a single mask is HALF of what I paid through an Amazon vendor.  With free shipping.  And even less, per mask, if I sign her up for a monthly plan, which she wants to do, using her own credit card rather than my Amazon card.  According to an article in the NY Times, dated July 17, 2014, &amp;#34;Light Therapy for Home Use Catches On&amp;#34; IlluMask does no harm and may actually have some benefits.  But according to a plastic surgeon quoted at the end of the article, if you are looking for a magic bullet, this is not it.  &amp;#34;The magic bullet is no sun, or a good sunblock, and daily skin care maintenance.&amp;#34;  That sounds like stay out of the sun and use soap and water to me.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s so expensive on Amazon.  I paid $29.97 at Walmart &amp; although it was much cheaper it wasn&#x27;t worth a penny.  It&#x27;s a complete waste of 15 minutes of your day &amp; it did absolutely nothing for my face.  I&#x27;m beginning to think all the positive reviews are fake, more like a scam.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product twice and therefore can not attest to whether it is effective in improving my skin. What I can say is that I have been prone to develop cold sores on my lips with sun exposure since childhood. I have only gotten cold sores like once every two or three years as an adult. It may be unrelated but the evening of my first use of this mask...boom...there it was. That cold sore on my lip that I loathe so much!!!</li>
            <li> 70 with a lot of wrinkles and see some slight changes for the better.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  She used it everyday for 30-days and she noticed a difference right away.  Her skin looked brighter, smoother and the fine lines around her eyes disappeared.  She wore it after I put my kids to bed and it was a great way to end the day.</li>
            <li> Great at home product! Phototherapy used to only be available at your aestheticians office so I am grateful there is finally a product on the market you can use in the privacy of your own home. My skin is brighter, tighter and fresher looking. I will absolutely buy more!</li>
            <li> I noticed slight change in my skin after my first use, i was super excited and thought if I&#x27;m seeing a change after just one use, just imagine how great my skin is going to look after 30days...boy was I wrong, that first use was the only time I saw any change</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a device like this could improve my skin, but people it does!  Being a devoted Erno Laszlo user for the past 17years (I am now 47) I didn&#x27;t think I could improve my skin much more.  A close friend convinced me to buy this.  Let&#x27;s just say, she &amp;#34;paid it forward&amp;#34;.  The results are amazing, considering I didn&#x27;t need that much improving.  After about 2 weeks of use, I am seeing my pores get more refined and more of a glow developing as my skin tone evens out more. It is a perfect compliment to my current skin care regime.  I definitely plan to purchase a second mask and will review the results after 8 weeks.</li>
