            <li>Product is easy to rinse out and no horrible odor.</li>

            <li>I have only used it once so far with water, but my skin felt amazing and my pores where the clearest they have been since I realized I had pores!!</li>
            <li>other great thing is- for face mask alone</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, this clay showed up just in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just used this product and I felt the tingling sensation it describes, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It leaved my skin looking really clean and radiant and after 2 days it started peeling off, dead cells, so I must say I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>How amazing how this product has help me in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>My face looks more awake and young.  </li>
            <li>If you have extremely sensitive skin, this may be too strong for you.</li>

            <li>The customer service is phenomenal and they provide a lot of information for you to try different applications.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>my skin was smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>fast shipping also!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it for a hair mask and facial.</li>
            <li>I received my clay promptly and have enjoyed one facial mask and</li>
            <li>Just had my first change in dosage of meds so between that and humid weather.......</li>
            <li>Overall good product and works well, would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>have used clay masks my whole life but never in a powder form.</li>
            <li>The feel and the look is very youthful and supple.  </li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>This product really is invaluable.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I had some rough spots on the top of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>careful not to use to much, it makes more then you think...</li>
            <li>I am in my early fifties and I look good for my age, but I have recently started to notice that my skin may be starting to show signs of my age.</li>
            <li>I love this clay, I mixed this with apple cider vinegar as suggested on the back and did a face and body mask</li>
            <li>My skin was very soft after 1 treatment!</li>
            <li>I thought because it says organic would it be really good, but its not, I try the Aztec mask and 100% times better, the paste is so messy and the consistency its not good.</li>
            <li>If you have clogged pores, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to make another batch of detox foot clay choosing a new smell this time.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend using it if you plan to leave the house soon after using it or if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When you open the jar for the first time, the clay spills out a bit.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today mixed with organic apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>I saw a difference only my first use.</li>
            <li>my skin went completely out of control!</li>
            <li>Just started applying the clay a few days ago, totally enjoy the refreshing feel it leaves, looking forward to healing a few scars I have.</li>
            <li>This mask is different than the premixed clays because it&#x27;s pure.</li>
            <li>The results of the clay is a smoother and clear skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily and sensitive skin, but after one use oily areas look smoother, and their is no redness or irritation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an big deal, but when you open your new jar, tap it first on the counter to settle the contents and then sit the jar on the counter.</li>
            <li>and I can see my pores starting to clear up.</li>
            <li>I was completely taken by surprise on how red my face was after washing it off though.</li>
            <li>For starters- I have sensitive skin, combination skin, and I&#x27;ve recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism.</li>
            <li>and my face was back to normal the next morning.</li>
            <li>but this was the first time ever that I didn&#x27;t use any other help except the clay (left on over night) and lysine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the harsh things in one day but after 5 weeks, my face feels so much soft and clear.</li>
            <li>Your face will be a little red for the first 15 mins.</li>

            <li> Your face will be a little red for the first 15 mins.</li>
            <li> The only small issue I have with this product is that my skin gets really oily.  </li>
            <li> , this will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> My skin texture was very uneven and bumpy due to old (very old) acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I mix bentonite clay, apple Cider Vinegar a little peppermint oil (not crazy about the smell of of the vinegar) and small bit of coconut oil</li>
            <li> I ordered this on my boyfriends account and the container arrived scratched up and tattered not NEW like it should be.</li>
            <li> I have seriously used this clay every day so far</li>
            <li> I mixed it with Apple Cider Vinegar and am not sure that I will do that again as the smell burned my eyes almost to the point that I wanted to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with activated charcoal for an extra cleanse.</li>
            <li> I had started to notice my skin feeling a little loose at the corner of my eyes and around my jaw line.  </li>
            <li> purchased Shea butter from Molivera a few months ago</li>
            <li> I had trouble  with the t spot on my face and thought I give it a try</li>

            <li> I use this in a detox bath. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and I&#x27;m loving it. Product is easy to rinse out and no horrible odor. As a bonus, the seller sends emails about the clay, its many benefits, and additional tips on how to use the product. This was a great choice for me!</li>
            <li> The Product&lt;br /&gt;I have used clay masks my whole life but never in a powder form. I&#x27;m very impressed with this mask. My skin is smooth and clear. I mix the powder with a bit of apple cider vinegar as recommended and sometimes I use Thayer&#x27;s cucumber aloe witch hazel. This mask is different than the premixed clays because it&#x27;s pure. It dries very tight and you feel a bit of a burn or pulse. If you have extremely sensitive skin, this may be too strong for you. My skin texture was very uneven and bumpy due to old (very old) acne scarring. This is the smoothest my skin as felt in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Company&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Shea butter from Molivera a few months ago and I am very impressed with them. I like that they stamp a manufacture (where applicable) and/or expiration date on the package. They also seal the outside of the jar so you know it hasn&#x27;t been touched.  The only improvement they could make is to place a plastic or foll seal on the inside of the jar of clay. When you open the jar for the first time, the clay spills out a bit. It&#x27;s not an big deal, but when you open your new jar, tap it first on the counter to settle the contents and then sit the jar on the counter. If you twist it in midair, expect it to spill.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  My skin looks so good after I use it. The feel and the look is very youthful and supple.  I will definitely buy this again when I need to - this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff - perfect for my skin - helps revitalize it and remove imperfections of life!  I use this many times a week - it lasts forever because of the water absorption. This is not the one you eat (calcium benotinite) - this is sodium bentonite.</li>
            <li> Love it, just what i wanted</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my face feel so smooth and helps with my oily skin. It didn&#x27;t work for what I originally bought it for, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this as a face mask once since my purchase and loved it. My face did turn bright red but I was expecting that from reading the reviews. I just made sure that I did it in the evening before I went to bed and my face was back to normal the next morning. I mixed it with Apple Cider Vinegar and am not sure that I will do that again as the smell burned my eyes almost to the point that I wanted to wash it off. My face felt amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered, fast! It worked great! My skin was very soft after 1 treatment!</li>
            <li> Really works.  Everybody in the house is using this.  Will have to buy more.</li>
            <li> Sent a great email with uses for the Clay.&lt;br /&gt;Very informative and handy&lt;br /&gt;would love to buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on my boyfriends account and the container arrived scratched up and tattered not NEW like it should be. I&#x27;m HOPING it&#x27;s good quality but we&#x27;re not off to a good start. Either way, I definitely won&#x27;t order from here again.</li>
            <li> Mixed with essential oils (lavender, frankincense) and fractionated coconut oil, this clay creates a paste which relieves the itch of mosquito bites by drawing out the toxin.</li>
            <li> Just started applying the clay a few days ago, totally enjoy the refreshing feel it leaves, looking forward to healing a few scars I have.</li>
            <li> I thought because it says organic would it be really good, but its not, I try the Aztec mask and 100% times better, the paste is so messy and the consistency its not good.</li>
            <li> I was uncertain at first because I had never heard of it, but this product is wonderful! The customer service is phenomenal and they provide a lot of information for you to try different applications. Most companies do not provide that much attention, it made me love this product that much more!</li>
            <li> great product, great price. Skin looks much better and healthy.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to make another batch of detox foot clay choosing a new smell this time.</li>
            <li> Loved using the face mask, really helped my skin clear up and look amazing! Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair next.</li>
            <li> This mask is great. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week for several weeks and I can see my pores starting to clear up. I have big visible pores and I get a lot of blackheads. The last mask I did I noticed my forehead was blackhead free! My face feels smooth and clean afterwards. I usually mix it with activated charcoal for an extra cleanse. I gave some clay to a coworker and she really loved it. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> This product really is invaluable. I&#x27;ve found soo many great uses for it. Wish I had discovered it sooner, but happy to have it now!!</li>
            <li> Used this to make toothpaste. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I love it ..it cleans my pores really good..i uss it with braggs organic apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this clay, I mixed this with apple cider vinegar as suggested on the back and did a face and body mask my skin was smooth and clear. Overall good product and works well, would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff does its job &amp; does it well. If you have clogged pores, I highly recommend it. I used it for the first time today mixed with organic apple cider vinegar &amp; I already see &amp; feel an improvement in my skin. You literally feel the clay sucking the impurities from it. I was completely taken by surprise on how red my face was after washing it off though. I have moderately sensitive skin &amp; it made me bright red &amp; I looked like a lobster. Now I know to do it before bed so I have all night while I sleep for the redness to dissipate. I do not recommend using it if you plan to leave the house soon after using it or if you have very sensitive skin. I love it though! I wish I had heard about it sooner!</li>
            <li> careful not to use to much, it makes more then you think...I have only used it once so far with water, but my skin felt amazing and my pores where the clearest they have been since I realized I had pores!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this, having never used a mask before in my life.  I mixed it 2:1 (water/clay) for 15-20 minutes, and my face has never felt cleaner. I have oily and sensitive skin, but after one use oily areas look smoother, and their is no redness or irritation.  I am impressed.</li>
            <li> wonderful product! good for a lot of uses! fast shipping also!</li>
            <li> The clay on the face feels so soothing. The results of the clay is a smoother and clear skin. It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the harsh things in one day but after 5 weeks, my face feels so much soft and clear.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it for a hair mask and facial.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I really am glad I purchased this product. I have suffered with acne for years, but now it&#x27;s not that big of a deal anymore.  I have only been using this product for a week and already I&#x27;ve noticed my skin getting clearer.  The only small issue I have with this product is that my skin gets really oily.  I am hoping that does not last, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be clogging my pores and causing breakouts, so I&#x27;ll deal with it, or find a product to use with it to counteract that problem.  However, total must have.</li>
            <li> How amazing how this product has help me in a short period of time. I had trouble  with the t spot on my face and thought I give it a try , I was so happy from the result of using the clay. Someone told me how glowing my skin looked. I told her about the product and gave her some of mine  and she was hooked. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and I love it! It seems to tighten pores and help reduce acne.</li>
            <li> I just used this product and I felt the tingling sensation it describes, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant. It leaved my skin looking really clean and radiant and after 2 days it started peeling off, dead cells, so I must say I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I am in my early fifties and I look good for my age, but I have recently started to notice that my skin may be starting to show signs of my age. I did some research on things I can do for skin that is starting to sag; I came across this and I am so glad that I did. My skin now looks better than it did when I was in my 30’s. I only wish I had found this earlier in life. This mask is amazing.&lt;br /&gt; You can actually feel the mask tighten and tingle on your face. I believe you can actually feel it tightening your pores as it dries (that’s the tingling feeling). It does everything it says it will. I saw a difference only my first use. I had started to notice my skin feeling a little loose at the corner of my eyes and around my jaw line.  After one use my skin felt tighter and looked younger. I was amazed. I also feel like it gives me a really nice glow. The mask pulls blood to your face. Your face will be a little red for the first 15 mins. or so, but once that passes, I have a youthful glow. My face looks more awake and young.  I had some rough spots on the top of my cheeks. Now that area looks and feels so soft.&lt;br /&gt;This product did much more for my skin than I anticipated it would. The more I use it, the better my skin is looking and feeling. It is literally reversing my aging and I couldn’t be more excited as I am watching my face transform.  I love this product and I definitely recommend that</li>
            <li> I received my clay promptly and have enjoyed one facial mask and a detox bath!&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Not only is this product pure and exceptional, the customer service at this company is amazing. They followed up with an email that included recipes to mix for skin and hair remedies and asked me how I like their product. They reached out to me twice to see if everything was to my liking and if they could do anything more for me. Just simply wonderful!!  Also, this product has a shelf life of 5 years, which I think is great too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. I mix bentonite clay, apple Cider Vinegar a little peppermint oil (not crazy about the smell of of the vinegar) and small bit of coconut oil and it has been the best hair treatment I have ever done. Which is very sad because I am a hair product junkie. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> For starters- I have sensitive skin, combination skin, and I&#x27;ve recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Just had my first change in dosage of meds so between that and humid weather.......my skin went completely out of control! As in.....I didn&#x27;t wanna leave the house. Luckily for me, this clay showed up just in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it start healing up my acne, it healed up a cold sore. Yep, that happened too. (To be honest, I also take L-lysine) but this was the first time ever that I didn&#x27;t use any other help except the clay (left on over night) and lysine. Talk about relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any areas of my skin that didn&#x27;t have acne was so smooth too. I have seriously used this clay every day so far and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing is- for face mask alone, this will last you a very long time. I made the mistake of mixing too much...mix very small portions first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to use it in a bath or as a hair mask, but that will happen soon. I&#x27;m just very happy to see y face clearing up, but also looking and feeling smooth.</li>
