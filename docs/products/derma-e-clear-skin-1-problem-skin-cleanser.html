    <ol>
            <li>Excellent!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for the winter.  </li>
            <li>Great for systemic Acne.  </li>
            <li>It is great....</li>
            <li>But since it is my scrub to use on days I&#x27;m resting my skin from the microdermabrasion scrub, perhaps I should be happy</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice alternative for those of us who used to use The Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree oil face scrub.  </li>
            <li>However, for this scrub to be a perfect product I would like it to have more scrubbing particles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46, fair skinned, oily tzone and prone to hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>One can probably get too much of a good thing, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would imagine this is a good product</li>
            <li>This has honestly changed my life with how great my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Good.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for great price on great product!</li>
            <li>This is a good face wash, with a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliant is nice.  </li>
            <li>I prefer one with salicylic acid, which is not just for acne treatment but is also good for aging skin like mine, to slough off the top layer of skin cells and reveal a softer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wanted something with more exfoliation though.</li>
            <li>Very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>You can note the diference after use it, my skin looks and feel clean and great, it helps to reduce my large pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural so great in that regard as well.</li>
            <li>I really can not rate this product fairly.</li>
            <li>The dermabrasion scrub is very effective but should not be used more than once a week, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good everyday scrub.  </li>
            <li>I know have a counter full of the stuff!</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil scent is strong, but I like it.  </li>
            <li>This is ideal for people with dry skin,</li>
            <li>Good for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit more gentle than I like scrubs to be.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Dermae Hyrolaunic Acid eye cream and loved it so finally thought to give this line a try.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to scrubs being a little like sandpaper, but this has a pleasantly creamy texture, while still feeling like a scrub.</li>
            <li>My face is sensitive and prone to breaking out easily</li>
            <li>The smell is sort of strange, but not bad, strong.  </li>
            <li>Overall, nice stuff with natural ingredients, and the scrubby particles work well for my husband and myself.  </li>
            <li>I went so far as to try ProActiv with no results, and wanted to return to more natural products.</li>
            <li>As a holistic esthetician and avid DermaE user, I highly recommend this scrub!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about how well this has worked for me with the night cream twice a day(morning and night on my dry skin), exfoliate at night and cream wash in the morning.</li>
            <li>Very Clear Scrub not only contains salicylic acid (willow bark) but also has loads of tea tree oil, another product I love.  </li>
            <li>pores being minimized - recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fond of derma e products and swear by their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Derma-E&#x27;s works about the same as the original Body Shop tea tree oil formula and feels identical to me</li>
            <li>(Can&#x27;t say the same for my cat, who avoids me like the plague if I use the oil full strength.)  </li>
            <li>My acne has cleared up tremendously in the last month.</li>
            <li>so I am hesitant in using new face products..</li>
            <li>Not sure how I came across the Derma e brand but am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I typically exfoliate 2-3 times per week and each time I use this product, I notice how smooth and refined my skin looks as well as</li>
            <li>Its almost gone completely, but I also am using the very clear moisturizer</li>
            <li>It smells really natural.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin (a little more oily T-zone with occasional unexplained breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I scrub my face with it once a day and my acne has literally gone down so much.</li>

            <li> When I get a bad zit, though, I still use the Neutrogena acne spot gel to zap it quick.  </li>
            <li> slightly harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I did not receive the same product that I ordered, so</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with hormonal acne on my skin for a couple of years now with it only getting worse and worse.</li>

            <li> I have normal skin (a little more oily T-zone with occasional unexplained breakouts.  As a holistic esthetician and avid DermaE user, I highly recommend this scrub!</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s really helping my skin, except maybe for it&#x27;s dryness.</li>
            <li> This worked for my sister so i decided to get it for my son. i bought the soap, scrub and the lotion and It didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Thanks for great price on great product!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Very clean feeling.  The smell is sort of strange, but not bad, strong.  Exfoliant is nice.  Cleans face well</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I scrub my face with it once a day and my acne has literally gone down so much. Its almost gone completely, but I also am using the very clear moisturizer</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Not sure how I came across the Derma e brand but am so glad I did. I know have a counter full of the stuff! Night cream, day cream, eye cream, scrub...etc. My face is sensitive and prone to breaking out easily so I am hesitant in using new face products..but I am sold on this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order again as soon as I need to.</li>
            <li> Great for systemic Acne.  But after about three months, like all other products, your skin needs a change.  This is perfect for the winter.  Not good with sun screen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46, fair skinned, oily tzone and prone to hormonal acne. I typically exfoliate 2-3 times per week and each time I use this product, I notice how smooth and refined my skin looks as well as pores being minimized - recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> Good product. Will definitely purchase again. Good for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff. It smells really natural. Worth every penny. My skin actually hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a few years. I still have a ways to go, but it helps to keep my skin in check. I use it along side the VeryClear cleanser and scar gel!</li>
            <li> You can note the diference after use it, my skin looks and feel clean and great, it helps to reduce my large pores. It doesn&#x27;t cause any hurt to my skin. It is great....</li>
            <li> This is a good face wash, with a nice smell. They stopped carrying this at the local store, so looked online. Exfoliating and has a gritty texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fond of derma e products and swear by their [[ASIN:B000GF1E54 derma e Peptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Cr&amp;egrave;me, 2 oz (56 g)]] and [[ASIN:B0000CCW1N derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub, 2 oz (56 g)]].  The dermabrasion scrub is very effective but should not be used more than once a week, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good everyday scrub.  I prefer one with salicylic acid, which is not just for acne treatment but is also good for aging skin like mine, to slough off the top layer of skin cells and reveal a softer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Very Clear Scrub not only contains salicylic acid (willow bark) but also has loads of tea tree oil, another product I love.  Some people object to the smell of tea tree oil but I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have actually grown fond of its odor.  (Can&#x27;t say the same for my cat, who avoids me like the plague if I use the oil full strength.)  However, for this scrub to be a perfect product I would like it to have more scrubbing particles.  But since it is my scrub to use on days I&#x27;m resting my skin from the microdermabrasion scrub, perhaps I should be happy it&#x27;s a bit more gentle than I like scrubs to be. One can probably get too much of a good thing, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not sensitive so I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions to any of these products I use and I&#x27;m happy with the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I would imagine this is a good product but unfortunately I did not receive the same product that I ordered, so I really can not rate this product fairly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to scrubs being a little like sandpaper, but this has a pleasantly creamy texture, while still feeling like a scrub.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice alternative for those of us who used to use The Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree oil face scrub.  TBS&#x27;s reformulated scrub now has polyethylene beads (those nasty plastic beads that end up ingested by ocean critters), the same beads that made me have to throw in the towel with my beloved Neutrogena glycolic scrubs (grrrrr).  Derma-E&#x27;s works about the same as the original Body Shop tea tree oil formula and feels identical to me (my husband says the smell is a bit earthier and stronger, though).  Now that I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties, I don&#x27;t have the extreme acne I had when I was in my teens and into my late twenties, but I do get the occasional break-out.  This scrub does seem to help heal my skin.  When I get a bad zit, though, I still use the Neutrogena acne spot gel to zap it quick.  My husband likes this Derma-E scrub a lot, too, and he says it helps with ingrown hairs from shaving.  The tea tree oil scent is strong, but I like it.  Overall, nice stuff with natural ingredients, and the scrubby particles work well for my husband and myself.  This one keeps my skin less dry than other acne scrubs, too.  I&#x27;m now stuck in the purgatory of being acne-prone but starting to develop wrinkles and dry patches.  Derma-E&#x27;s scrubs don&#x27;t over dry my skin while getting the job done.  When I need something a little stronger, I whip out the Derma-E glycolic scrub for an instant glow and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with hormonal acne on my skin for a couple of years now with it only getting worse and worse. I am in my 30s and hadworse acne now than ever before. I went so far as to try ProActiv with no results, and wanted to return to more natural products. I had been using the Dermae Hyrolaunic Acid eye cream and loved it so finally thought to give this line a try. My acne has cleared up tremendously in the last month. I can&#x27;t say enough good about how well this has worked for me with the night cream twice a day(morning and night on my dry skin), exfoliate at night and cream wash in the morning. It&#x27;s all natural so great in that regard as well. It does smell like tea tree so if you don&#x27;t like hat smell do not purchase this. This has honestly changed my life with how great my skin feels. I&#x27;m going to try the skin evening serum from another line of Dermae to see if that helps with the scarring on my chin as this hasn&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li> slightly harsh on the skin. Working for a cosmetic surgeon, not recommended.</li>
            <li> Good.  I wanted something with more exfoliation though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference..feels oily don&#x27;t recommend for people with oily skin.This is ideal for people with dry skin,</li>
