            <li>The dmall tin cade is perfect for carrying in my purse or even my pocket!</li>
            <li>Titanium or zinc oxide have been recommended to me by my dermatologist as the best sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>It is especially good in desert climates.</li>
            <li>an excellent product that I will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Best of all is that this lip butter has no flavor and no aroma.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea Lip Butter is especially wonderful to use on my lips overnight to heal and protect from everything that has gone on during the day.  </li>
            <li>still prefer a \\&quot;tube\\&quot; like burts bees, because when you have to use your fingers, you end up with some of the product on said finger - what to do, what to do? :D</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a good lip butter, this would be a great product to try!</li>
            <li>I was happy to discover Nivea Lip Butter, as it contains titanium dioxide as a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>My lips feel great in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all, so it&#x27;s great for everyone.  </li>
            <li>Still, this is great for something I can keep indoors and use at night (after washing my hands).</li>
            <li>This is another great product from the Nivea company.  </li>
            <li>Great lip butter for chapped lips</li>
            <li>Imagine Nivea is pitching this against the very popular Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve.  </li>
            <li>my lips are often chapped, I find this balm very effective.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a problem with my lips drying out and cracking, and after trying many products, I found Burt&#x27;s Bees to work the best  for me - until now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>This balm did a good job of moisturizing my lips with out pulling up my lip stain.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with Nivea&#x27;s Lip Butter.  </li>
            <li>So, all in all, a good product and the tin is really cute.</li>
            <li>I used Carmex for many years and this is superior as it does not have the medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had some kind of SPF to protect against the sun though.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, lightweight lip balm.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll be trying more of their products because this is so good.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>Having been a fan of Nivea for many years, I was delighted to get this.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice even application.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good product that I am enjoying and hasn&#x27;t caused break outs or buildup of guck.  </li>
            <li>Also very nice tin that can fit into your coat or pants pocket.</li>
            <li>It is easy to transport, pleasant to apply and soothing and smoothing.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I found the balm better than most, but not quite as good as the best, in terms of preventing lip dryness for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Until I find something better, this is what I will use.  </li>
            <li>Nivea product is creamier and perhaps more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these lip balms.  </li>
            <li>Much more convenient.</li>
            <li>I love shea butter, so</li>
            <li>As for being kissable, my husband seems to be enjoying himself.  </li>
            <li>Also, the tin&#x27;s lid is loosely fitting; it does not screw on.  </li>
            <li>and I like it much better for this reason alone.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing not to have to smell or taste your lip treatments for a change.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>So, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d want to switch over to another</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm is Aquaphor, which was recommended to me by my doctor.  </li>
            <li>For best results with out without lipstick, exfoliate any dry, chapped skin from your mouth before applying.  </li>
            <li>My lips feel great while using it, soft and moisturized, never sticky or</li>
            <li>AND it does not appear to wear off easily.</li>
            <li>And as well, you should make sure fingers are clean or else</li>
            <li>After that, it&#x27;s easy to swirl the pad of your finger around the lip butter and smooth onto your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Nivea Lip Butter - it&#x27;s definitely proven itself worthy of winning a place in my permanent beauty care regime!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often wear lipstick these days but still need something to smooth and soften my lips.  </li>
            <li>B00B57QU60 Nivea Lip Butter Carded Tin, Smooth Kiss, 0.59 Ounce]] lives up to that reputation, softening without being gummy, slimy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth but not goopy.  </li>
            <li>This tin is about the same price as one stick of the Burt&#x27;s Bees so this is a great deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therapy  Advanced Formula  </li>
            <li>I decided to try the Nivea Lip Butter Smooth Kiss, which doesn&#x27;t have a taste or odor.  </li>
            <li>I wish that the Nivea Lip Butter Smooth Kiss came in a tube rather than a tin.  </li>
            <li>In order to apply it, I must rub my index finger across its smooth, waxy surface and spread it across my lips.  </li>
            <li>The Smooth Kiss version does not have a flavor that I can tell.  </li>
            <li>Swirl your index finger around the pan, and smooth across your lips before applying lipstick.  </li>
            <li>And Nivea&#x27;s products are available everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Smooth Kiss by the way is fragrance/flavor free.  </li>
            <li>I have used Chapstick for probably  50 years and loved it, until I apparently became allergic to the sunscreen ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I heard about these lip butters because I pretty much love all of Nivea&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>The moisture seemed to wear off quickly, and it didn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling particularly smooth after the balm itself was gone.  </li>
            <li>There are certain things that I look for in a lip balm: no funky flavor, something that is long-lasting, and something I can wear lip stick on top of.  </li>
            <li>For very dry lips, I still prefer blistex cream but for day to day, this is a great products.</li>
            <li>parkil(shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulsis (sweet almond) oil, water, glycerin, glyceryl glucoside, BHT, flavor, titanium dioxide.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients include: petroleum, shea butter, castor seed oil, sweet almond oil and glycerin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is called \\&quot;smooth kiss\\&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think I would want to kiss someone right after applying as again</li>
            <li>and I felt myself having to reapply fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>:)  My lips are accustomed to always having some type of lip balm on them, and I have tried many different types.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; of this Lip Butter is dominated by a pleasantly mild shea butter.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me very much of my Vaseline Lip Therapy, which is gender friendly, in that it can be used by both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good holding in lip moisture (like Vaseline) and that alone will help improve the feel of dry lips over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our daughter gets chapped lips very easily, and this lip balm went on very easily, absorbed quickly, and fixed her lips right up.  </li>
            <li>* - annnywaaay, the product&#x27;s feel on the lips is nice - although, and again this is where I like BB&#x27;s better, Nivea&#x27;s \\&quot;slipperier\\&quot; on the lips- not an unpleasant feel, but it makes me want to keep pressing my lips together just to feel that slippery -- I just had a great idea for what to use this product for.</li>
            <li>Love how soft the Nivea Lip Butter makes my lips!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty comparable to what I am using, but the highlights for the Nivea Lip Butter are that I feel like I am getting more due to the nice size of the tin.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth and creamy, and they moisturize really well.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased to find the Lip Butter lasts just as long.  </li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like about this kind of lip balm is that it is in a tin.</li>
            <li>Lipstick and gloss now smooths over my lips nicely and seems to both look fresher and last longer</li>
            <li>Honestly, the tin is large enough that I&#x27;m able to put it straight to my lips and apply like a stick balm straight from the tin.  </li>
            <li>Made my lips soft, also works great on my dry hands.</li>
            <li>Normally, I use Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Formula [[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Compared to more natural alternatives, I have found petrolatum, in proper proportion, to work better without leaving a film.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an original (classic) Chapstick girl all my life and probably won&#x27;t cross over to buying this more often than my Chapstick.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using Nivea lip products.  </li>
            <li>I love the taste of it and it instantly softens my lips.</li>
            <li>My lips look and feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>That aspect makes it not as appealing overall.</li>
            <li>Smooth Kiss makes an excellent lip primer by the way because it&#x27;s not too oily and provides a wonderfully smooth base for lipstick application.  </li>
            <li>I love the little tin that it comes in, it fits easily into my pocket.</li>
            <li>This wears off quickly, but it is a nice sensation for those few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Love that it comes in a little tin, like the original Nivea Creme.  </li>
            <li>Nivea has a long standing reputation of many decades as a moisturizer and this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>the Lip Butter comes in is easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li>If this occurred, a large surface of the lip butter would be exposed to the unclean material of my jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t expect the containers to have so much lip butter in them, they last for a long time and they smell really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea is known worldwide as the oldest manufacturer of skin moisturizer, and they consistently deliver high quality products.  </li>
            <li>Really like the product.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip butter.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that you get a lot of it</li>
            <li>Nivea Lip Butter is much smoother and easier to apply than Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>I much prefer a lip balm that is neutral and does not interfere with my perfume or things that I eat and drink.  </li>
            <li>This lippy arrived at a very convenient time for me...</li>
            <li>The lip butter is very greasy in my opinion...</li>
            <li>I really like this Nivea Lip Butter.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It also helps your lips gain back their original moisture.</li>
            <li>One application will last for hours and leaves my lips feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The size is somewhat smaller than the traditional navy tin (0.59 oz vs. 1 oz.), and rather than having the consistency of butter, the product is more of a balm/salve.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my expectations were high...</li>
            <li>It comes in a small tin, so is very easy for a man or woman to drop into a daybag of his/her choice.  </li>
            <li>That may be because of the convenience of the little Chapstick tube and the price difference more than any superiority of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It spreads very easily, and it is only necessary to use a very tiny amount.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really prefer to have this product in stick form, actually, it would be much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the little tin too!</li>
            <li>but this is a very soft product that would not work in a tube.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did not care for very much was the taste-lip butter.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips super soft; I work in a hospital and the air&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>The tin is easy to open and big enough to not become lost in the jumble at the bottom of a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you need something small to carry around with you, this is just as good of an option as any other lippy out there on the market.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really not much more to say other than that I was glad to have received this sample via Vine, and that my family and I used it with much success.  </li>
            <li>real test is at night, when for me, the Vaseline is the only option I could count on</li>
            <li>And after application my lips feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>The small, slim tin is easy to carry in pocket or purse.  </li>
            <li>The case is small, so it easily fits in a bag or pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it is fun to try other products periodically.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not a fan of trying to apply products this thick with my finger, because I don&#x27;t like standing there rubbing and rubbing just to get enough on my finger for suitable application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing profound.</li>
            <li>I was recently having some chapped lips issues, which gave me a chance to try this new Nivea Lip Butter.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to continually reapply and the tin looks barely used even after a month of usage.</li>
            <li>I mean, how many ways can you repackage chapstick and say it&#x27;ll work miracles on dry lips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I&#x27;ll enjoy this product, and like how it&#x27;s small and thin enough to fit into a pocket, or purse, or whatever, I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;ll switch out from my BB&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I did not find that I had to reapply the product any more or less, usually about one or two times a day when I am hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It seems to last a long time, and even after if wears off my lips still feel soft.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little more coating than regular Chapstick, which is what I usually use.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wish that the Nivea Lip Butter Smooth Kiss came in a tube rather than a tin.  </li>
            <li> In order to apply it, I must rub my index finger across its smooth, waxy surface and spread it across my lips.  </li>
            <li> The Smooth Kiss version does not have a flavor that I can tell.  </li>
            <li> Swirl your index finger around the pan, and smooth across your lips before applying lipstick.  </li>
            <li> And Nivea&#x27;s products are available everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Smooth Kiss by the way is fragrance/flavor free.  </li>
            <li> I have used Chapstick for probably  50 years and loved it, until I apparently became allergic to the sunscreen ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I heard about these lip butters because I pretty much love all of Nivea&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> The moisture seemed to wear off quickly, and it didn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling particularly smooth after the balm itself was gone.  </li>
            <li> There are certain things that I look for in a lip balm: no funky flavor, something that is long-lasting, and something I can wear lip stick on top of.  </li>
            <li> For very dry lips, I still prefer blistex cream but for day to day, this is a great products.</li>
            <li> parkil(shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulsis (sweet almond) oil, water, glycerin, glyceryl glucoside, BHT, flavor, titanium dioxide.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients include: petroleum, shea butter, castor seed oil, sweet almond oil and glycerin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is called \\&quot;smooth kiss\\&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think I would want to kiss someone right after applying as again</li>
            <li> and I felt myself having to reapply fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> :)  My lips are accustomed to always having some type of lip balm on them, and I have tried many different types.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; of this Lip Butter is dominated by a pleasantly mild shea butter.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me very much of my Vaseline Lip Therapy, which is gender friendly, in that it can be used by both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good holding in lip moisture (like Vaseline) and that alone will help improve the feel of dry lips over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our daughter gets chapped lips very easily, and this lip balm went on very easily, absorbed quickly, and fixed her lips right up.  </li>
            <li> * - annnywaaay, the product&#x27;s feel on the lips is nice - although, and again this is where I like BB&#x27;s better, Nivea&#x27;s \\&quot;slipperier\\&quot; on the lips- not an unpleasant feel, but it makes me want to keep pressing my lips together just to feel that slippery -- I just had a great idea for what to use this product for.</li>
            <li> Love how soft the Nivea Lip Butter makes my lips!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty comparable to what I am using, but the highlights for the Nivea Lip Butter are that I feel like I am getting more due to the nice size of the tin.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smooth and creamy, and they moisturize really well.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased to find the Lip Butter lasts just as long.  </li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like about this kind of lip balm is that it is in a tin.</li>
            <li> Lipstick and gloss now smooths over my lips nicely and seems to both look fresher and last longer</li>
            <li> Honestly, the tin is large enough that I&#x27;m able to put it straight to my lips and apply like a stick balm straight from the tin.  </li>
            <li> Made my lips soft, also works great on my dry hands.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Formula [[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Compared to more natural alternatives, I have found petrolatum, in proper proportion, to work better without leaving a film.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an original (classic) Chapstick girl all my life and probably won&#x27;t cross over to buying this more often than my Chapstick.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using Nivea lip products.  </li>
            <li> I love the taste of it and it instantly softens my lips.</li>
            <li> My lips look and feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> That aspect makes it not as appealing overall.</li>
            <li> Smooth Kiss makes an excellent lip primer by the way because it&#x27;s not too oily and provides a wonderfully smooth base for lipstick application.  </li>
            <li> I love the little tin that it comes in, it fits easily into my pocket.</li>
            <li> This wears off quickly, but it is a nice sensation for those few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Love that it comes in a little tin, like the original Nivea Creme.  </li>
            <li> Nivea has a long standing reputation of many decades as a moisturizer and this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> the Lip Butter comes in is easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li> If this occurred, a large surface of the lip butter would be exposed to the unclean material of my jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t expect the containers to have so much lip butter in them, they last for a long time and they smell really good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea is known worldwide as the oldest manufacturer of skin moisturizer, and they consistently deliver high quality products.  </li>
            <li> Really like the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip butter.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that you get a lot of it</li>
            <li> Nivea Lip Butter is much smoother and easier to apply than Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I much prefer a lip balm that is neutral and does not interfere with my perfume or things that I eat and drink.  </li>
            <li> This lippy arrived at a very convenient time for me...</li>
            <li> The lip butter is very greasy in my opinion...</li>
            <li> I really like this Nivea Lip Butter.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It also helps your lips gain back their original moisture.</li>
            <li> One application will last for hours and leaves my lips feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The size is somewhat smaller than the traditional navy tin (0.59 oz vs. 1 oz.), and rather than having the consistency of butter, the product is more of a balm/salve.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my expectations were high...</li>
            <li> It comes in a small tin, so is very easy for a man or woman to drop into a daybag of his/her choice.  </li>
            <li> That may be because of the convenience of the little Chapstick tube and the price difference more than any superiority of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It spreads very easily, and it is only necessary to use a very tiny amount.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really prefer to have this product in stick form, actually, it would be much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the little tin too!</li>
            <li> but this is a very soft product that would not work in a tube.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not care for very much was the taste-lip butter.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips super soft; I work in a hospital and the air&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> The tin is easy to open and big enough to not become lost in the jumble at the bottom of a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you need something small to carry around with you, this is just as good of an option as any other lippy out there on the market.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not much more to say other than that I was glad to have received this sample via Vine, and that my family and I used it with much success.  </li>
            <li> real test is at night, when for me, the Vaseline is the only option I could count on</li>
            <li> And after application my lips feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> The small, slim tin is easy to carry in pocket or purse.  </li>
            <li> The case is small, so it easily fits in a bag or pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it is fun to try other products periodically.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not a fan of trying to apply products this thick with my finger, because I don&#x27;t like standing there rubbing and rubbing just to get enough on my finger for suitable application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing profound.</li>
            <li> I was recently having some chapped lips issues, which gave me a chance to try this new Nivea Lip Butter.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to continually reapply and the tin looks barely used even after a month of usage.</li>
            <li> I mean, how many ways can you repackage chapstick and say it&#x27;ll work miracles on dry lips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I&#x27;ll enjoy this product, and like how it&#x27;s small and thin enough to fit into a pocket, or purse, or whatever, I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;ll switch out from my BB&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I did not find that I had to reapply the product any more or less, usually about one or two times a day when I am hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It seems to last a long time, and even after if wears off my lips still feel soft.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little more coating than regular Chapstick, which is what I usually use.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is in a small little metal tin that is easy to keep around...</li>
            <li> Lip Butter is a serious lip balm, not a waxy product designed for fun flavors or color.  </li>
            <li> My main objection is that it&#x27;s messy to use.</li>
            <li> I always use lip balm over my long lasting lipsticks.</li>
            <li> The Smooth Kiss Lip Butter has no flavor, once on it stays on and it is light enough to use as a base for other lip products.</li>
            <li> It keeps my lips soft and moisturized longer than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> It seemed to work well on chapped lips, but the moisture didn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> It does contain some questionable ingredients such as BHT, so if you are interested in a natural product you might want to avoid this.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time, I don&#x27;t have to reapply often.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tin that it comes in isn&#x27;t at all messy or difficult to open, but at the same time it&#x27;s secure enough that it&#x27;s never come loose in my purse, even being jostled around all the time.  </li>
            <li> It soothes dry lips, and moisturizes we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Fruit flavored lip balms dry my lips and/or break them out.  </li>
            <li> Apply the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; lip moisturizer and still wake up with dry lips.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say about this.  </li>
            <li> This one is a no thanks for me.</li>
            <li> Not much of a flavor to them though</li>
            <li> I tend to avoid lip gloss because I don&#x27;t like a heavy sticky feeling on my lips, so this lip butter presents a similar problem.</li>
            <li> We tried other products and this one cleared up his dry lips within 2 days!</li>
            <li> Just wish they would package it in something other than a pot</li>
            <li> It is also a little sticky and after a while the tin can get full of germs from putting your dirty finger in it to get the lip butter.</li>
            <li> product comes in a little tin, and when you open it, the product inside may seem a little hard and waxy, but, once you carefully \\&quot;press through\\&quot; the product, it warms under your finger and \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; the surface.</li>
            <li> It does get slightly softer when exposed to heat, but I haven&#x27;t had any of them melt or anything.  </li>
            <li> If you previously use Chapstick all the time you will find yourself depending on it less.</li>
            <li> also not a fan of the tin; I prefer lip balms in a stick for ease of application and less of a mess to wash off my hands.  </li>
            <li> it is a little sticky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a die-hard burts bees user and have little tubes of burts bees all over my little log house, in my purse, in my car.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy and waxy like Chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;It is unscented, unflavored and</li>
            <li> It is a lot of trouble to wash my hands every time I want to apply the lip balm.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> Nivea is about one third less expensive than Smith&#x27;s by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Encased in a small round metal tin, this lip balm is soothing and smoothing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not greasy and just a little dab works wonders!  </li>
            <li> Even when my lips are drier than usual, this stuff does the trick.  </li>
            <li> O.59 of an ounce seems like a small amount</li>
            <li> Rightly or wrongly, I believe that over time I will have a tin infested with germs which I will then be applying to my mouth on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> And usually if I kiss my wife after applying, I have to re-apply.  </li>
            <li> I substituted this product for the usual Burt&#x27;s Bees stick</li>
            <li> It provides a decent base for lipstick and alone, it imparts a slight sheen instead of a slick shine.</li>
            <li> Smith&#x27;s product has virtually the same ingredients - essential oils in a petroleum base.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fabulous lip moisturizer, just not thrilled with the method of application.</li>
            <li> I usually use lip balms that don&#x27;t contain any petroleum products, so I came into this one a little wary.  </li>
            <li> I apply, it makes my lips feel oily, and I seriously dislike that.  </li>
            <li> The product leaves a subtle glossy look on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is bad, especially during flu season.  </li>
            <li> I am fearful the lid might come off while it is residing inside one of the pockets of my tight blue jeans.  </li>
            <li> tend to get frustrated with the tin system long before the product is gone.  </li>
            <li> I tried it underneath a dark lipstick (I usually use a shea butter balm as a base), and the lipstick ended up staining my lips through the balm, which was quite a surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate having chapped or dry lips, so I apply lip balms throughout the day, and I use Vaseline on my lips at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it does in cold weather.</li>
            <li> Very tasteless with no scent</li>
            <li> Like Aquaphor, Nivea Lip Butter has a petrolatum base.  </li>
            <li> , he no longer grumbles about the awful taste.</li>
            <li> - did I poke a nasty finger in the tin?</li>
            <li> That is the worst experience with these products is the greasy feeling afterward.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love how soft the Nivea Lip Butter makes my lips! The dmall tin cade is perfect for carrying in my purse or even my pocket!</li>
            <li> I have used Chapstick for probably  50 years and loved it, until I apparently became allergic to the sunscreen ingredient.  I was happy to discover Nivea Lip Butter, as it contains titanium dioxide as a sunscreen.  Titanium or zinc oxide have been recommended to me by my dermatologist as the best sunscreens.  Until I find something better, this is what I will use.  When I put it on before bed, I wake up in the morning still feeling it.  That didn&#x27;t happen with Chapstick.  It is especially good in desert climates.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Nivea lip products.  It seemed to work well on chapped lips, but the moisture didn&#x27;t seem to last very long and I felt myself having to reapply fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I hate having chapped or dry lips, so I apply lip balms throughout the day, and I use Vaseline on my lips at night. I have been using the Nivea Lip Butter exclusively for over a week now, in place of the balms and Vaseline, to see what how it compared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lip Butter is a serious lip balm, not a waxy product designed for fun flavors or color.  It lasts for a long time, I don&#x27;t have to reapply often.  My lips feel great while using it, soft and moisturized, never sticky or waxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test is at night, when for me, the Vaseline is the only option I could count on to last 8 hours.  I have been very pleased to find the Lip Butter lasts just as long.  My lips feel great in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin the Lip Butter comes in is easy to open and close.  However, I&#x27;m not a fan of trying to apply products this thick with my finger, because I don&#x27;t like standing there rubbing and rubbing just to get enough on my finger for suitable application.  Honestly, the tin is large enough that I&#x27;m able to put it straight to my lips and apply like a stick balm straight from the tin.  I&#x27;d really prefer to have this product in stick form, actually, it would be much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous lip moisturizer, just not thrilled with the method of application.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this.  It&#x27;s a good product.  I&#x27;ve been an original (classic) Chapstick girl all my life and probably won&#x27;t cross over to buying this more often than my Chapstick.  That may be because of the convenience of the little Chapstick tube and the price difference more than any superiority of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Nivea product is creamier and perhaps more moisturizing. After all, it contains shea butter and the Chapstick does not.  So, all in all, a good product and the tin is really cute.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lip balms.  They&#x27;re smooth and creamy, and they moisturize really well.  If you want one with out any sort of fragrance in it, this would be the one to get.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all, so it&#x27;s great for everyone.  Even when my lips are drier than usual, this stuff does the trick.  I keep a tin of it in my makeup container, in my medicine cabinet and in my purse, so I always have some when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin that it comes in isn&#x27;t at all messy or difficult to open, but at the same time it&#x27;s secure enough that it&#x27;s never come loose in my purse, even being jostled around all the time.  It does get slightly softer when exposed to heat, but I haven&#x27;t had any of them melt or anything.  The balm has always held its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent product that I will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> There is no SPF protection in this lip balm, which limits it to indoor use. It is also a little sticky and after a while the tin can get full of germs from putting your dirty finger in it to get the lip butter. Tubes are a lot cleaner but this is a very soft product that would not work in a tube. I used Carmex for many years and this is superior as it does not have the medicinal smell. In fact, I don&#x27;t notice any smell at all. It is good holding in lip moisture (like Vaseline) and that alone will help improve the feel of dry lips over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is called \\&quot;smooth kiss\\&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think I would want to kiss someone right after applying as again it is a little sticky. It is lighter than Vaseline or Carmex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get frustrated with the tin system long before the product is gone.  I think it might be heat that causes them to stick shut.  Still, this is great for something I can keep indoors and use at night (after washing my hands).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often wear lipstick these days but still need something to smooth and soften my lips.  Nivea has a long standing reputation of many decades as a moisturizer and this [[ASIN:B00B57QU60 Nivea Lip Butter Carded Tin, Smooth Kiss, 0.59 Ounce]] lives up to that reputation, softening without being gummy, slimy or sticky.  The tin is easy to open and big enough to not become lost in the jumble at the bottom of a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is in a small little metal tin that is easy to keep around...in your pocket or purse.  It goes on smooth but not goopy.  It kept my lips feeling hydrated for quite awhile.  I do wish it had some kind of SPF to protect against the sun though.</li>
            <li> I always use lip balm over my long lasting lipsticks. This balm did a good job of moisturizing my lips with out pulling up my lip stain.  For very dry lips, I still prefer blistex cream but for day to day, this is a great products.</li>
            <li> This is another great product from the Nivea company.  Our daughter gets chapped lips very easily, and this lip balm went on very easily, absorbed quickly, and fixed her lips right up.  It comes in a small tin, so is very easy for a man or woman to drop into a daybag of his/her choice.  There&#x27;s really not much more to say other than that I was glad to have received this sample via Vine, and that my family and I used it with much success.  Add it to your cart if you are shopping for a lip balm on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have always used chapstick, but after using this, I realized this keeps my lips moisturized longer than chapstick.  I love the little tin that it comes in, it fits easily into my pocket. It is a lightweight lip butter that has no taste or smell to it at all. I like that I don&#x27;t have to apply it 100 times thru out they day. It keeps my lips soft and moisturized longer than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve used! I definitely give it 2 thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Made my lips soft, also works great on my dry hands.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight lip balm. It is not too heavy and waxy like Chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;It is unscented, unflavored and uncolored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin contains 16.7 grams of product. To put that in perspective, my stick of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm is 4.25 grams. The tin is equivalent to almost 4 sticks of the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. This tin is about the same price as one stick of the Burt&#x27;s Bees so this is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this kind of lip balm is that it is in a tin. It is a lot of trouble to wash my hands every time I want to apply the lip balm. And I am NOT going to stick use my unwashed hands in it to apply it. I prefer the stick. Much more convenient.</li>
            <li> Great lip butter for chapped lips</li>
            <li> It soothes dry lips, and moisturizes we&#x27;ll. If you previously use Chapstick all the time you will find yourself depending on it less. It also helps your lips gain back their original moisture.</li>
            <li> Really like the product. Makes my lips feel terrific! Just wish they would package it in something other than a pot</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! I love the taste of it and it instantly softens my lips. I only wish it came in a tube. If I am somewhere out that I can&#x27;t wash my hands it grosses me out to put my finger in the tub.</li>
            <li> I usually use lip balms that don&#x27;t contain any petroleum products, so I came into this one a little wary.  I love shea butter, so I thought I would give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply, it makes my lips feel oily, and I seriously dislike that.  The moisture seemed to wear off quickly, and it didn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling particularly smooth after the balm itself was gone.  I tried it underneath a dark lipstick (I usually use a shea butter balm as a base), and the lipstick ended up staining my lips through the balm, which was quite a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not a fan of the tin; I prefer lip balms in a stick for ease of application and less of a mess to wash off my hands.  This one is a no thanks for me.</li>
            <li> There are certain things that I look for in a lip balm: no funky flavor, something that is long-lasting, and something I can wear lip stick on top of.  The Nivae Lip Butter meets all those criteria. The Smooth Kiss Lip Butter has no flavor, once on it stays on and it is light enough to use as a base for other lip products. I love the little tin too!</li>
            <li> I really like this lip butter.  It has no scent, it&#x27;s not greasy and just a little dab works wonders!  I&#x27;d never tried the Nivea brand before.  Now I&#x27;ll be trying more of their products because this is so good.  My lips look and feel smooth and soft.  As for being kissable, my husband seems to be enjoying himself.  O.59 of an ounce seems like a small amount but I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks now and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it.  This should last a while.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Formula [[[ASIN:B003U6DH3S Vaseline Lip Therapy  Advanced Formula  0.35Ounce (Pack of 12)]]].  It doesn&#x27;t have a smell or taste.  Fruit flavored lip balms dry my lips and/or break them out.  I decided to try the Nivea Lip Butter Smooth Kiss, which doesn&#x27;t have a taste or odor.  It reminds me very much of my Vaseline Lip Therapy, which is gender friendly, in that it can be used by both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I wish that the Nivea Lip Butter Smooth Kiss came in a tube rather than a tin.  In order to apply it, I must rub my index finger across its smooth, waxy surface and spread it across my lips.  Unless I wash my hands before using it, I am in danger of spreading germs.  This is bad, especially during flu season.  Also, the tin&#x27;s lid is loosely fitting; it does not screw on.  I am fearful the lid might come off while it is residing inside one of the pockets of my tight blue jeans.  If this occurred, a large surface of the lip butter would be exposed to the unclean material of my jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I heard about these lip butters because I pretty much love all of Nivea&#x27;s products and so I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them. I really like the fact that you get a lot of it, I didn&#x27;t expect the containers to have so much lip butter in them, they last for a long time and they smell really good. Not much of a flavor to them though which is a downside for me.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with my lips drying out and cracking, and after trying many products, I found Burt&#x27;s Bees to work the best  for me - until now. Nivea Lip Butter is much smoother and easier to apply than Burt&#x27;s Bees. It has neither scent nor taste, so when I kiss my hubby goodnight, he no longer grumbles about the awful taste. One application will last for hours and leaves my lips feeling soft and smooth. Lipstick and gloss now smooths over my lips nicely and seems to both look fresher and last longer now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now apply any time of the day and not worry about the taste interfering with whatever I eat or drink AND it does not appear to wear off easily. I don&#x27;t have to continually reapply and the tin looks barely used even after a month of usage. I love Nivea Lip Butter - it&#x27;s definitely proven itself worthy of winning a place in my permanent beauty care regime!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with Nivea&#x27;s Lip Butter.  The small, slim tin is easy to carry in pocket or purse.  Best of all is that this lip butter has no flavor and no aroma.  I much prefer a lip balm that is neutral and does not interfere with my perfume or things that I eat and drink.  The Nivea Lip Butter is especially wonderful to use on my lips overnight to heal and protect from everything that has gone on during the day.  The one thing that I would like to change is that I am not a big fan of a tin that requires me to use my finger to apply the product. I end up with a greasy finger and have to wipe it or wash it.  Rightly or wrongly, I believe that over time I will have a tin infested with germs which I will then be applying to my mouth on a regular basis.  I have a Nivea product very similar to this that is in a lipstick like tube and I like it much better for this reason alone.</li>
            <li> Every night I have the same routine.  Apply the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; lip moisturizer and still wake up with dry lips.  And usually if I kiss my wife after applying, I have to re-apply.  With Nivea Lip Butter, the routine has changed.  Apply once, kiss the wife, and wake up with lips still moist.  What more could you ask for?  Can&#x27;t wait to see how it holds up in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Encased in a small round metal tin, this lip balm is soothing and smoothing. The moisture lasts, even through eating and drinking. Although I prefer balms  in stick form, this one did not make my finger sticky, It is scent-free which is a definite plus. It is refreshing not to have to smell or taste your lip treatments for a change. It provides a decent base for lipstick and alone, it imparts a slight sheen instead of a slick shine. This is a nice product. It is easy to transport, pleasant to apply and soothing and smoothing. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband after he split his lip and it hadn&#x27;t healed for over 2 months. We tried other products and this one cleared up his dry lips within 2 days! Pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> This lippy arrived at a very convenient time for me... I was recently having some chapped lips issues, which gave me a chance to try this new Nivea Lip Butter. I can&#x27;t say my expectations were high... I mean, how many ways can you repackage chapstick and say it&#x27;ll work miracles on dry lips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m not a huge fan. The lip butter is very greasy in my opinion... I put some on about an hour ago and I can still feel it a bit, but it has a greasy feel as though I rubbed olive oil on my lips. I tend to avoid lip gloss because I don&#x27;t like a heavy sticky feeling on my lips, so this lip butter presents a similar problem. If you&#x27;re not a fan of flavored lip balms, this one is completely tasteless, which is nice. The case is small, so it easily fits in a bag or pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give this product 3 stars. It&#x27;s nothing profound. I don&#x27;t feel like it miraculously helped my chapped lips. But if you need something small to carry around with you, this is just as good of an option as any other lippy out there on the market.</li>
            <li> I confess that I am a lip balm addict.  :)  My lips are accustomed to always having some type of lip balm on them, and I have tried many different types.  I really like this Nivea Lip Butter.  It spreads very easily, and it is only necessary to use a very tiny amount.  It seems to last a long time, and even after if wears off my lips still feel soft.  The Smooth Kiss version does not have a flavor that I can tell.  The product leaves a subtle glossy look on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the present, Amazon does not have the ingredients in this lip butter listed.  It does contain some questionable ingredients such as BHT, so if you are interested in a natural product you might want to avoid this.  Ingredients are as follows:  petroleum, polyglyceryl-3, diisostearate, butyrospermum parkil(shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulsis (sweet almond) oil, water, glycerin, glyceryl glucoside, BHT, flavor, titanium dioxide.  The product is made in Belgium.</li>
            <li> Age: 56&lt;br /&gt;Lips: quite luscious for my age - teeheehee :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a die-hard burts bees user and have little tubes of burts bees all over my little log house, in my purse, in my car. So, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d want to switch over to another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in a little tin, and when you open it, the product inside may seem a little hard and waxy, but, once you carefully \\&quot;press through\\&quot; the product, it warms under your finger and \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; the surface. After that, it&#x27;s easy to swirl the pad of your finger around the lip butter and smooth onto your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer a \\&quot;tube\\&quot; like burts bees, because when you have to use your fingers, you end up with some of the product on said finger - what to do, what to do? :D -- And as well, you should make sure fingers are clean or else are you introducing bacteria into the tin? OMG! I just thought of this! OMG-- my germaphobic jittery discombobulation just set in -ungh ungh - did I poke a nasty finger in the tin? oh dear, dear me! Ungh! ungh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*takes  deep breath* - annnywaaay, the product&#x27;s feel on the lips is nice - although, and again this is where I like BB&#x27;s better, Nivea&#x27;s \\&quot;slipperier\\&quot; on the lips- not an unpleasant feel, but it makes me want to keep pressing my lips together just to feel that slippery -- I just had a great idea for what to use this product for. Yeah. Nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#x27;ll enjoy this product, and like how it&#x27;s small and thin enough to fit into a pocket, or purse, or whatever, I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;ll switch out from my BB&#x27;s. However, if you are looking for a good lip butter, this would be a great product to try!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It makes my lips super soft; I work in a hospital and the air&#x27;s dry so I have chapped lips often. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it does in cold weather.</li>
            <li> Having been a fan of Nivea for many years, I was delighted to get this.  Love that it comes in a little tin, like the original Nivea Creme.  The size is somewhat smaller than the traditional navy tin (0.59 oz vs. 1 oz.), and rather than having the consistency of butter, the product is more of a balm/salve.  Imagine Nivea is pitching this against the very popular Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve.  Smith&#x27;s product has virtually the same ingredients - essential oils in a petroleum base.  Nivea is about one third less expensive than Smith&#x27;s by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my lips are often chapped, I find this balm very effective.  The ingredients include: petroleum, shea butter, castor seed oil, sweet almond oil and glycerin.  Smooth Kiss makes an excellent lip primer by the way because it&#x27;s not too oily and provides a wonderfully smooth base for lipstick application.  Swirl your index finger around the pan, and smooth across your lips before applying lipstick.  Think this would work just as well for lip stains too (although this I have not tried).  For best results with out without lipstick, exfoliate any dry, chapped skin from your mouth before applying.  Also recommended for controlling your eyebrows, buffing your nails and moisturizing your cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea is known worldwide as the oldest manufacturer of skin moisturizer, and they consistently deliver high quality products.  And Nivea&#x27;s products are available everywhere.  Smooth Kiss by the way is fragrance/flavor free.  Just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and lasts for a good amount of time. It feels a little more coating than regular Chapstick, which is what I usually use. My main objection is that it&#x27;s messy to use. That aspect makes it not as appealing overall.</li>
            <li> I substituted this product for the usual Burt&#x27;s Bees stick I use.  It&#x27;s pretty comparable to what I am using, but the highlights for the Nivea Lip Butter are that I feel like I am getting more due to the nice size of the tin.  No fragrance means I can share it with any member of my family in a pinch.  And after application my lips feel so soft.  They are instantly transformed.  This wears off quickly, but it is a nice sensation for those few minutes.  I did not find that I had to reapply the product any more or less, usually about one or two times a day when I am hydrated.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> That is the worst experience with these products is the greasy feeling afterward. This has a nice even application. Also very nice tin that can fit into your coat or pants pocket. The only thing I did not care for very much was the taste-lip butter. Very tasteless with no scent-I like alot of smell and taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm is Aquaphor, which was recommended to me by my doctor.  However, it is fun to try other products periodically.  Like Aquaphor, Nivea Lip Butter has a petrolatum base.  Compared to more natural alternatives, I have found petrolatum, in proper proportion, to work better without leaving a film.  The \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; of this Lip Butter is dominated by a pleasantly mild shea butter.  I found the balm better than most, but not quite as good as the best, in terms of preventing lip dryness for a long time.  Still, it&#x27;s a good product that I am enjoying and hasn&#x27;t caused break outs or buildup of guck.  I recommend it if you like lip balm in tubs rather than sticks or tubes.</li>
