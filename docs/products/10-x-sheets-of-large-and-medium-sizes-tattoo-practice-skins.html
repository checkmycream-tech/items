    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for practice!</li>
            <li>Awesome I use this because I&#x27;m not in a shop anymore and to keep practicing...</li>
            <li>I thought they would be great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good method/stability practice with your gun.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t a good buy</li>
            <li>I have been using this as good practice and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>The best advice to tell people is to take your time and put a light layer of vasoline or petroleum on when wiping off excess ink.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good tool to judge where you are on skin, but otherwise, I&#x27;d probably get better results on a banana.</li>
            <li>These are great practice for first timers.  </li>
            <li>The lead won&#x27;t smear, and stays on the skin better than you&#x27;d imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>a orange worked better</li>
            <li>These skins are ok.</li>
            <li>Quick with the order will be able to get a lot of shading practice.</li>
            <li>plus they are cheap.</li>
            <li>can clean off your lead transfer by using Vaseline and cloth.</li>
            <li>You are better off with fruit or really anything else.</li>
            <li>I will possibly order a lot more for additional practice!</li>
            <li>Works fine when tattooing but absorbs too much in when wiping.</li>
            <li>as far as the practice skin goes, it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>That alone makes it worth a star.</li>
            <li>I use the blue Shop Towels by Scott, they have a rougher texture and clean better..</li>
            <li>The only way I found to clean it up to be able to somewhat see your work is to scrub it for 10 minutes with petroleum jelly and a rag.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d imagine post everyone understands that right away.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping according to the person that i had purchased it for, he also states that he loves it, it was a gift for my wifes brother</li>
            <li>While most of us are used to using tattoo pens, or felt tips the rubber skins take lead from mechanical pencils quite well, standard No. 2 graphite pencils work</li>
            <li>Still have enough for more</li>
            <li>ok to for starting but</li>
            <li>its ok for starting out, i def would recommend this to anyone nor would i buy it again.</li>
            <li>The ink smears easy on the rubber skins and that&#x27;s assuming it actually stays on the skin in the first place.</li>
            <li>First, let&#x27;s say that these are no where close to what tattooing on real skin is like</li>
            <li>these things smear and stain and don&#x27;t look very presentable.  </li>
            <li>I would like to start off by saying that the shipping was beyond fast.</li>
            <li>Also not like real skin.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t absorb the ink very well.</li>
            <li>they are nothing like tattooing a real person..</li>
            <li>It dont feel like real skin while tattooing just dont buy this product</li>
            <li>these are okay to use, especially when you are practicing stuff like shading, but there is no substitute for the real thing because everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re buying them to just practice in general (beginning), them go right ahead.</li>
            <li>I clean my skin first and make sure it&#x27;s dry, and lay down my drawing obviously lead-down and take my finger and just gently rub the backside to press it against the skin.</li>
            <li>Overall it was worth the price</li>
            <li>The surface is pretty solid, I felt like I was practicing on rhino skin or something like that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!</li>
            <li>This is good for getting the feel of a gun before going to a person, but the big problem is when you try to wipe off the extra ink, the ink absorbs into the surface where you are wiping, thus turning the whole area that color, not just where you tattooed making it unable see the work you did.  </li>
            <li>Other then that my husband really likes this skin.</li>

            <li> Its pretty thick and holds ink well.</li>
            <li> This product would have got 5 starts but it took a long time to get here.</li>
            <li> i purchased thinking that it would be cool to have something to tattoo on if i got bored once in a while</li>
            <li> My only issue with these are no matter what you try to do (Green soap or something else)</li>
            <li> putting a bit of loob over your stencil helps but not much</li>
            <li> The smaller sheets didn&#x27;t act anything like skin, didn&#x27;t take ink hardly at all, and smeared when wiped.</li>
            <li> The product is not useful as practice skin.</li>
            <li> ink black looks</li>
            <li> grey can&#x27;t shade over all it sucks.</li>
            <li> For me though, it was kinda worthless, because I bought them to practice on portraits, which requires light shading and stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> (i use green soap when wiping ink away)</li>
            <li> Usually skin leaves ink smears when wiped</li>

            <li> These are pointless and useless for me.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get an idea of how you are doing when you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> I start tattoing the table these things are that thin.</li>
            <li> but was i wrong...</li>
            <li> Almost as bad as moth balls.</li>
            <li> No wash or solution with drying time needed like with Ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this by accident and want to share this with everyone since I&#x27;ve been doing the painful Ink method for a while</li>
            <li> absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> These practice skins smell terrible!</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!</li>

            <li> First, let&#x27;s say that these are no where close to what tattooing on real skin is like but I&#x27;d imagine post everyone understands that right away. If you are just starting out these are a must, you can still get an idea of what it&#x27;s like and it&#x27;s good method/stability practice with your gun. Also I wanna add a note about stencil transfers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a different/possibly better way to transfer stencils on these fake \\&quot;skins\\&quot; if you can call them that. While most of us are used to using tattoo pens, or felt tips the rubber skins take lead from mechanical pencils quite well, standard No. 2 graphite pencils work but for some reason not as well. I use 0.7mm basic lead refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paper; Notebook and printer paper will work find if you take your eraser on the back side of the paper and rub your eraser over the back side of your drawing. However I use Calco/Calque Tracing paper that is semi-transparent, you can pick this stuff up just about anywhere. Walmart is where I get mine. The tracing paper will allow you to transfer the lead drawing with ease. I clean my skin first and make sure it&#x27;s dry, and lay down my drawing obviously lead-down and take my finger and just gently rub the backside to press it against the skin. No wash or solution with drying time needed like with Ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this by accident and want to share this with everyone since I&#x27;ve been doing the painful Ink method for a while and it&#x27;s a pain in the neck. The ink smears easy on the rubber skins and that&#x27;s assuming it actually stays on the skin in the first place. The lead won&#x27;t smear, and stays on the skin better than you&#x27;d imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can clean off your lead transfer by using Vaseline and cloth. I use the blue Shop Towels by Scott, they have a rougher texture and clean better.. plus they are cheap. if you need help or have questions you can contact me via email. liquid.knights(at)gmail-dot-com.</li>
            <li> Perfect for practice! Still have enough for more</li>
            <li> The product is not useful as practice skin. It is coated with a substance that is like a hard plastic. You can&#x27;t shade at all on it. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Too chalky. Works fine when tattooing but absorbs too much in when wiping. So u cannot always see the consistency of your outlines</li>
            <li> This is good for getting the feel of a gun before going to a person, but the big problem is when you try to wipe off the extra ink, the ink absorbs into the surface where you are wiping, thus turning the whole area that color, not just where you tattooed making it unable see the work you did.  The only way I found to clean it up to be able to somewhat see your work is to scrub it for 10 minutes with petroleum jelly and a rag.</li>
            <li> absolutely horrible. Doesn&#x27;t work at all like it is supposed to. Wasn&#x27;t a good buy and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product would have got 5 starts but it took a long time to get here. Other then that my husband really likes this skin.</li>
            <li> ok to for starting but a orange worked better</li>
            <li> These are pointless and useless for me. I thought they would be great but i cant stand them at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as good practice and will continue to use this product. Its pretty thick and holds ink well.</li>
            <li> These are great practice for first timers.  My only issue with these are no matter what you try to do (Green soap or something else) these things smear and stain and don&#x27;t look very presentable.  They&#x27;re a good tool to judge where you are on skin, but otherwise, I&#x27;d probably get better results on a banana.</li>
            <li> Quick with the order will be able to get a lot of shading practice. I will possibly order a lot more for additional practice!</li>
            <li> Awesome I use this because I&#x27;m not in a shop anymore and to keep practicing... The best advice to tell people is to take your time and put a light layer of vasoline or petroleum on when wiping off excess ink.</li>
            <li> I would like to start off by saying that the shipping was beyond fast. I got it the 7th of Nov when I was suppose to get it between the 23-30 of Nov.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as far as the practice skin goes, it&#x27;s okay... I guess. The surface is pretty solid, I felt like I was practicing on rhino skin or something like that. As a result, the skin wasn&#x27;t retaining the ink all that well. All in all, it&#x27;sa descent product for the price. For me though, it was kinda worthless, because I bought them to practice on portraits, which requires light shading and stuff. If you&#x27;re buying them to just practice in general (beginning), them go right ahead. I would buy from this seller again. Peace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of these practice skins. I&#x27;d recommend spending the extra money and getting a quality set. These are nothing like skin.</li>
            <li> The smaller sheets didn&#x27;t act anything like skin, didn&#x27;t take ink hardly at all, and smeared when wiped. Oddly enough, the larger sheets were much better but still not perfect. Overall it was worth the price but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d order this product again. Shipping was prompt though.</li>
            <li> my brother did though, i bought them for him so he can practice using his tattoo machine. overall they are grate. thank you.</li>
            <li> I start tattoing the table these things are that thin. I tried to bring the needle further in but with no luck, You have to put two of these together to make it work. Also not like real skin. Wont stretch at all.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t give you any insight as a beginner. Terrible quality. You are better off with fruit or really anything else. This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping according to the person that i had purchased it for, he also states that he loves it, it was a gift for my wifes brother and he said its a must have for starters</li>
            <li> These practice skins smell terrible! Almost as bad as moth balls. I tried to practice with it, and the short time I could tolerate being close to it, I was dissatisfied with the results. The skins are very think and heavy and it doesn&#x27;t absorb the ink very well. Also, when you try to wipe the ink to see your lines it smears and stains the skins. Very hard to get an idea of how you are doing when you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;ve done. These went into the trash.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!&lt;br /&gt;NO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY! i purchased thinking that it would be cool to have something to tattoo on if i got bored once in a while but was i wrong... put it this way the stencil stayed better than the ink did... and even if you wanted something to just fool around with and try anyway the sheets are VERY thin and the needles \\&quot;skip\\&quot; over the rubber surface.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!</li>
            <li> these are okay to use, especially when you are practicing stuff like shading, but there is no substitute for the real thing because everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li> These skins are ok. they are nothing like tattooing a real person..its ok for starting out, i def would recommend this to anyone nor would i buy it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this weds from nj. It was shipped from ca n i got it today fri in my mailbox. That alone makes it worth a star. Usually skin leaves ink smears when wiped but i have yet to have any smears (i use green soap when wiping ink away) n ive done a big tattoo on one. It absorbs well wen needle hits and stencil sets well also.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this again it dont hold ink black looks grey can&#x27;t shade over all it sucks. It dont feel like real skin while tattooing just dont buy this product</li>
            <li> they work, yes you will smear ink everywhere when trying to see your lines.  putting a bit of loob over your stencil helps but not much</li>
