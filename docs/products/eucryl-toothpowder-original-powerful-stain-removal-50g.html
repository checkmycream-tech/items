            <li>Will buy again - great price.  </li>
            <li>Seems to do a fair job with cleaning but in my experience I can&#x27;t say that it has any great stain removal properties.  </li>
            <li>I has a pleasant taste, but I will probably not reorder this item.</li>
            <li>Used this tooth powder in UK &amp; EU &amp; found it to be a superior tooth polish/whitener.  </li>
            <li>ITEM GOOD AS ADVERTISED</li>

            <li>Good product.  </li>

            <li>and it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>Excellent home product to help keeping teeth clean between dental visits.  </li>
            <li>this is great powder, took along time to arrive , but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>All products are nice and good conditioned.</li>
            <li>EUCRYL IS THE BEST IN TEETH &amp; DENTAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS &amp; VERY REASONABLY</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Helps to keep teeth polished, easy  to use, great price too.</li>
            <li>This a powder is like your own dentist uses when you go for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>Its good stuff and Im glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as effective in that area as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>removing stains, and is also excellent at&lt;br /&gt;reducing plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Thr item arrived quickly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I will contnue to buy many many thing from amazon.</li>
            <li>Tooth powders work better at cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this stuff before and I am quite satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Taste is okay</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the Freshmint flavor of this product yet, but I think I&#x27;ll like it better.</li>
            <li>more than that may damage your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is better than any whitening toothpaste and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>The result is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, and I continue to use it and will probably buy another container when this one is depleted.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts, but this is magic.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>It sure beats paying upwards of $30 for those overpriced whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to do a flouride brush before and after using to keep your enamel safe.</li>
            <li>Better visit your dentist instead.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so good, so effective at cleaning your teeth really well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very smooth and very clean after using this brushing.</li>
            <li>I tried it today for the first time and ALL MY STAINS ARE GONE !!!  </li>
            <li>It does leave the mouth with a nice clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>It does leave my teeth feeling very clean and polished</li>
            <li>This did a pretty good job of getting rid of some stubborn stains.  </li>
            <li>The taste is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>It does have a nice mild mint flavor, close to what the dentist would use to polish your teeth</li>
            <li>Like the taste, leaves clean breath, but that&#x27;s about all!</li>
            <li>Love the taste, love the clean feeling, and do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Great old time product that still works.</li>
            <li>But it is better than the toothpaste available over the counter at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>All that said, I love the fresh clean feeling that I get from using this product!</li>
            <li>talk about getting your teeth white, and the taste is great</li>
            <li>Keep teeth feeling really smooth and stain free.</li>
            <li>It is non abrasive, has a nice licorice taste &amp; your teeth will feel MUCH cleaner.</li>
            <li>If I can run my tongue across my teeth and feel something that isn&#x27;t smooth, I know it&#x27;s time to use this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered Eucryl in Scotland a couple of years back, and found it a great alternative to the barrage of mint-flavored tooth care products</li>
            <li>Seems a safe product and results are great ... lasts longer than I expected ... would purchase again.</li>
            <li>My grandfather always used toothpowders &amp; died with all his own nice white teeth, no caps&amp; never a cavity.</li>
            <li>and it is not messy and is absolutely a good product.</li>
            <li>quick delivery, fair price, old reliable product you can depend upon.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Along with that, it also leaves such a remarkable taste in your mouth, I plan on ordering again.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is my most uninspiring review , but can I really be that enthused about tooth powder ?!</li>
            <li>but it makes my teeth feel clean especially with a electric toothbrush :P</li>
            <li>Not sweet tasting, but refreshing &amp; very effective.</li>
            <li>It bubbles and makes you feel you have really clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>I drink a fair amount of coffee and enjoy blueberries and blackberries on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel, and look, really clean.</li>
            <li>I like the clean, polished look and feel ..</li>
            <li>Bought this because I wanted to have something that approximates the clean feeling</li>
            <li>I ordered two because someone close to me really needs this!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be dissatisfied, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I used to buy a product very close to this called &amp;#34;Kep&amp;#34; and I used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of stain removal.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price just don&#x27;t expect a miracle to happen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, comes in a nice case, and is pleasant tasting (not that you eat it, but you know what I mean!).  </li>
            <li>When I order this product I was excited because I was a smoker looking to brighten my smile, but with this product it just was not so..</li>
            <li>Leaves mouth fresh and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Works ..keeps teeth clean and breath fresh.</li>
            <li>so it disappates quickly.</li>
            <li>I like to have super clean-feeling teeth.  </li>
            <li>This makes my teeth feel just as clean as they feel right after a cleaning at the dentist office.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, long story short, very happy.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it is important to brush gently when using this product.</li>
            <li>I do like the fresh taste and smoothness it leaves.</li>
            <li>Ok I was a bit over dramatic but this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>It definitely does clean your teeth much more than just toothpaste</li>
            <li>Dip again, top right middle.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>There is a light hint of mint when you brush your teeth with this stuff, and its gritty so when you brush your teeth, you feel as if you have just been to the dentist and your teeth are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d have to give up my favorite drink after trying all the advertised tooth &#x27;whiteners&#x27; that simply didn&#x27;t perform as advertised.  </li>
            <li>As far as making your teeth feel really smooth</li>
            <li>Only should use twice a week...but tempting to use more often.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for selling things so reasonable on Amazon, I enjoy my experience every time I shop here online.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would recommend doing this once a day on top of twice a day regular brushing.</li>
            <li>It seems to be like what is used at the dentist, at least your teeth feel nice and smooth like after your teeth have been cleaned.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I don&#x27;t see anything special when compared to other products with similar function.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if I continue using it for long period of time I will be able to see some results.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good idea to follow the directions on the box, and maybe use it even less frequently than twice a week.</li>
            <li>Anything this potent must have powerful stuff that will cause trouble with overuse.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpowder.  </li>
            <li>This tooth powder is absolutely GRRRREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it is the very best&lt;br /&gt;at</li>
            <li>It has really brightened my teeth</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say this is a &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; stain remover; however, it does make my teeth feel much cleaner than just using toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a month now and don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>If this is a stain remover it&#x27;s not doing much to remove any stains</li>
            <li>I will update when I see a real difference.</li>
            <li>Eucryl is a godsend for gentle stain removing.</li>
            <li>Very Good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This product really brightens up smokers and coffee drinkers teeth.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really take any stains away.</li>
            <li>rinse your toothbrush real well, dip it in there, and brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>cause I was feeling gritty and now my teeth are smooth again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to use with a tooth polisher I bought and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product upon hearing that it really makes your teeth a lot whiter.</li>
            <li>Removed years of tar build up on my teeth from smoking, and they&#x27;re so much whiter.</li>
            <li>Finally, I stumbled on this and found out it works just as good as the other product.  </li>
            <li>The other nice thing about it is your teeth are natural looking -</li>
            <li>The powder is in a round container -- be sure to not get water in the powder and to securely snap the lid back on.  </li>
            <li>And with the price being so low, it&#x27;s not a bad bet.</li>
            <li>One use was all I needed, but my stains were, as I said, very superficial and new.  </li>
            <li>I use a dip on the top left and middle.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>highly recommended even the hubby loves it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and I&#x27;ve used it two-three times a week for about three weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>I would recommend people just buy trays and bleach if they really want whitening action.</li>
            <li>Pycopay which you could get in Europe until just a few years ago was my favorite</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week and it leaves my teeth feeling smooth and gets rid of dark build up around the gum line from smoking and too much coffee.</li>
            <li>Dip again bottom right and middle.</li>
            <li>brushed first with my normal toothpaste</li>
            <li>It took a week for me to see a very marked difference in the lack of stain on his teeth.  </li>
            <li>But this seems to be exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>I first brush my teeth with regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>For the price its a very decent add on to your regular brushing.</li>
            <li>Fast acting better then white strips.will last a long time alot of product in the container.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste, it&#x27;s kind of lightly anise flavored, but I would like a fresher taste after using it, so I&#x27;m eager to try the Freshmint flavor.</li>
            <li>For last a couple years, I had bounght a lot of stuff from there, I fill very convinince.</li>
            <li>fast acting stain remover!!</li>
            <li>I discovered this tooth powder while visiting Scandinavia, and I was quite surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give this a try since I am a coffee and tea drinker; seems to remove some staining but still need to have a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>So, it might be that my stains were just superficial enough that they didn&#x27;t take much to get &#x27;em off to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening with regular use.</li>
            <li>Thought I was ordering a paste and was pleasantly surprised when I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to give it a full rating</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how effective it is for removing stains, but I think it&#x27;s made my teeth a little bit whiter.</li>
            <li>PRICED-TEETH BECOME CLEAN IN A FEW USES</li>
            <li>I find that plain old salt mixed with baking soda works better actually.</li>
            <li>and you will get a deep cleaning on the teeth and around the gums that normal tooth paste just can&#x27;t provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The container is hard to work with and spills easily.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would do a little more than the other reviews said.</li>
            <li>This product really works well with a Sonic or other brand of electric toothbrush and feels like you just had your teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>and I also had general yellowing despite twice yearly dental visits for cleanings.  </li>
            <li>I only used it four times and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any result.</li>
            <li>Not sure why I have this problem in the first place because I don´t smoke or drink coffee, but my teeth are never quite as white as they should be, but overall I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you are a smoker (and I am aware that we are few these days) its for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a few times and actually noticed a difference after the first application.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews of the product I had high hopes but they were let down.</li>

            <li> It does leave the mouth with a nice clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my teeth feeling very clean and polished</li>
            <li> This did a pretty good job of getting rid of some stubborn stains.  </li>
            <li> The taste is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li> It does have a nice mild mint flavor, close to what the dentist would use to polish your teeth</li>
            <li> Like the taste, leaves clean breath, but that&#x27;s about all!</li>
            <li> Love the taste, love the clean feeling, and do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great old time product that still works.</li>
            <li> But it is better than the toothpaste available over the counter at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> All that said, I love the fresh clean feeling that I get from using this product!</li>
            <li> talk about getting your teeth white, and the taste is great</li>
            <li> Keep teeth feeling really smooth and stain free.</li>
            <li> It is non abrasive, has a nice licorice taste &amp; your teeth will feel MUCH cleaner.</li>
            <li> If I can run my tongue across my teeth and feel something that isn&#x27;t smooth, I know it&#x27;s time to use this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discovered Eucryl in Scotland a couple of years back, and found it a great alternative to the barrage of mint-flavored tooth care products</li>
            <li> Seems a safe product and results are great ... lasts longer than I expected ... would purchase again.</li>
            <li> My grandfather always used toothpowders &amp; died with all his own nice white teeth, no caps&amp; never a cavity.</li>
            <li> and it is not messy and is absolutely a good product.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, fair price, old reliable product you can depend upon.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Along with that, it also leaves such a remarkable taste in your mouth, I plan on ordering again.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is my most uninspiring review , but can I really be that enthused about tooth powder ?!</li>
            <li> but it makes my teeth feel clean especially with a electric toothbrush :P</li>
            <li> Not sweet tasting, but refreshing &amp; very effective.</li>
            <li> It bubbles and makes you feel you have really clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> I drink a fair amount of coffee and enjoy blueberries and blackberries on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel, and look, really clean.</li>
            <li> I like the clean, polished look and feel ..</li>
            <li> Bought this because I wanted to have something that approximates the clean feeling</li>
            <li> I ordered two because someone close to me really needs this!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be dissatisfied, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I used to buy a product very close to this called &amp;#34;Kep&amp;#34; and I used it for many years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of stain removal.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price just don&#x27;t expect a miracle to happen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, comes in a nice case, and is pleasant tasting (not that you eat it, but you know what I mean!).  </li>
            <li> When I order this product I was excited because I was a smoker looking to brighten my smile, but with this product it just was not so..</li>
            <li> Leaves mouth fresh and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Works ..keeps teeth clean and breath fresh.</li>
            <li> so it disappates quickly.</li>
            <li> I like to have super clean-feeling teeth.  </li>
            <li> This makes my teeth feel just as clean as they feel right after a cleaning at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, long story short, very happy.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it is important to brush gently when using this product.</li>
            <li> I do like the fresh taste and smoothness it leaves.</li>
            <li> Ok I was a bit over dramatic but this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> It definitely does clean your teeth much more than just toothpaste</li>
            <li> Dip again, top right middle.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> There is a light hint of mint when you brush your teeth with this stuff, and its gritty so when you brush your teeth, you feel as if you have just been to the dentist and your teeth are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d have to give up my favorite drink after trying all the advertised tooth &#x27;whiteners&#x27; that simply didn&#x27;t perform as advertised.  </li>
            <li> As far as making your teeth feel really smooth</li>
            <li> Only should use twice a week...but tempting to use more often.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for selling things so reasonable on Amazon, I enjoy my experience every time I shop here online.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would recommend doing this once a day on top of twice a day regular brushing.</li>
            <li> It seems to be like what is used at the dentist, at least your teeth feel nice and smooth like after your teeth have been cleaned.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I don&#x27;t see anything special when compared to other products with similar function.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if I continue using it for long period of time I will be able to see some results.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good idea to follow the directions on the box, and maybe use it even less frequently than twice a week.</li>
            <li> Anything this potent must have powerful stuff that will cause trouble with overuse.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpowder.  </li>
            <li> This tooth powder is absolutely GRRRREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it is the very best&lt;br /&gt;at</li>
            <li> It has really brightened my teeth</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say this is a &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; stain remover; however, it does make my teeth feel much cleaner than just using toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now and don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> If this is a stain remover it&#x27;s not doing much to remove any stains</li>
            <li> I will update when I see a real difference.</li>
            <li> Eucryl is a godsend for gentle stain removing.</li>
            <li> Very Good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This product really brightens up smokers and coffee drinkers teeth.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really take any stains away.</li>
            <li> rinse your toothbrush real well, dip it in there, and brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> cause I was feeling gritty and now my teeth are smooth again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with a tooth polisher I bought and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product upon hearing that it really makes your teeth a lot whiter.</li>
            <li> Removed years of tar build up on my teeth from smoking, and they&#x27;re so much whiter.</li>
            <li> Finally, I stumbled on this and found out it works just as good as the other product.  </li>
            <li> The other nice thing about it is your teeth are natural looking -</li>
            <li> The powder is in a round container -- be sure to not get water in the powder and to securely snap the lid back on.  </li>
            <li> And with the price being so low, it&#x27;s not a bad bet.</li>
            <li> One use was all I needed, but my stains were, as I said, very superficial and new.  </li>
            <li> I use a dip on the top left and middle.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> highly recommended even the hubby loves it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, and I&#x27;ve used it two-three times a week for about three weeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> I would recommend people just buy trays and bleach if they really want whitening action.</li>
            <li> Pycopay which you could get in Europe until just a few years ago was my favorite</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week and it leaves my teeth feeling smooth and gets rid of dark build up around the gum line from smoking and too much coffee.</li>
            <li> Dip again bottom right and middle.</li>
            <li> brushed first with my normal toothpaste</li>
            <li> It took a week for me to see a very marked difference in the lack of stain on his teeth.  </li>
            <li> But this seems to be exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> I first brush my teeth with regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> For the price its a very decent add on to your regular brushing.</li>
            <li> Fast acting better then white strips.will last a long time alot of product in the container.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste, it&#x27;s kind of lightly anise flavored, but I would like a fresher taste after using it, so I&#x27;m eager to try the Freshmint flavor.</li>
            <li> For last a couple years, I had bounght a lot of stuff from there, I fill very convinince.</li>
            <li> fast acting stain remover!!</li>
            <li> I discovered this tooth powder while visiting Scandinavia, and I was quite surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try since I am a coffee and tea drinker; seems to remove some staining but still need to have a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> So, it might be that my stains were just superficial enough that they didn&#x27;t take much to get &#x27;em off to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening with regular use.</li>
            <li> Thought I was ordering a paste and was pleasantly surprised when I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to give it a full rating</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how effective it is for removing stains, but I think it&#x27;s made my teeth a little bit whiter.</li>
            <li> PRICED-TEETH BECOME CLEAN IN A FEW USES</li>
            <li> I find that plain old salt mixed with baking soda works better actually.</li>
            <li> and you will get a deep cleaning on the teeth and around the gums that normal tooth paste just can&#x27;t provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The container is hard to work with and spills easily.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would do a little more than the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> This product really works well with a Sonic or other brand of electric toothbrush and feels like you just had your teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> and I also had general yellowing despite twice yearly dental visits for cleanings.  </li>
            <li> I only used it four times and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any result.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I have this problem in the first place because I don´t smoke or drink coffee, but my teeth are never quite as white as they should be, but overall I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> If you are a smoker (and I am aware that we are few these days) its for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times and actually noticed a difference after the first application.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews of the product I had high hopes but they were let down.</li>
            <li> really works guys, not sure why others say it doesn&#x27;t maybe they aren&#x27;t using it correctly?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, I use this at least once a day and have had no ill effects or pain and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> After comparing this tooth powder -- I got same results with plain old baking soda.</li>
            <li> It will be a long time before I need to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I will use it because I paid for it, but other than that, I don&#x27;t expect it to do anything different.</li>
            <li> I will be back often again to buy this product again among others not just for myself but for all my other friends and associates.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just a little dip, not a big heap, so it lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t need to use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different to brush your teeth with tooth powder but just follow the directions</li>
            <li> I noticed that his teeth cleaning only lasted a couple of days until I got this little wonder powder for him.  </li>
            <li> , I think they only formed a few months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed and quicker than I expected it.</li>
            <li> This took my cheesy looking smile stained by espresso and cigarettes and made me look like a movie star.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find it certainly not here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least every other day, I use it with my oral hygiene regiment last a long time .</li>
            <li> Damn it works!&lt;br /&gt;i tried other products and i was about to give up on this stain on my teeth</li>
            <li> However, sprinkle a bit on your regular tooth past, or just use it on a damp toothbrush</li>
            <li> so wouldn&#x27;t see any extreme results.  </li>
            <li> Its a little sudsier than i expected</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little less soluble but it did do some polishing after 3-4 rounds.</li>
            <li> Have used the product a few times and noticed teeth are slightly whiter.</li>
            <li> I sometimes sprinkle a little on the toothpaste on the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucryl for a few months and like the results.  </li>
            <li> Follow directions and do not use everyday.</li>
            <li> This stain removal beats any expensive tooth cleaning set I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> It somewhat worked but is chalky and messy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have heavily stained teeth</li>
            <li> waste of time and money, DONT buy didnt do what it said it will do...</li>
            <li> , hopefully I&#x27;ll see a difference and the stains will be at least a little</li>
            <li> The directions on the box advise to use the product no more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> or you eill scrub your enamel off tooit definately gets hard stains off though</li>
            <li> I have been using this at least once a week and notice visibly whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> using those other expensive products when this works</li>
            <li> I have never experienced a miracle in my life time, but I think one happened today.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed at all with this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did nothing for stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Can be difficult to get at times though because it is not always carried in the states.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it didn&#x27;t work for me and its disappointing to buy something that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> And my teeth are not that bad.</li>
            <li> but I can say that I haven&#x27;t had a bad case yet.</li>
            <li> it removed my annoying stain on my front teeth from tea/</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> talk about getting your teeth white, and the taste is great, I mix it with my regular toothpaste and it works!  highly recommend</li>
            <li> Used this tooth powder in UK &amp; EU &amp; found it to be a superior tooth polish/whitener.  Not sweet tasting, but refreshing &amp; very effective.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpowder.  It bubbles and makes you feel you have really clean teeth.  Per the instructions, don&#x27;t use it every day.  I use it once a week.  Love the taste, love the clean feeling, and do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ITEM GOOD AS ADVERTISED</li>
            <li> This tooth powder is absolutely GRRRREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week and it is the very best&lt;br /&gt;at removing stains, and is also excellent at&lt;br /&gt;reducing plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.  There is no point&lt;br /&gt;to using those other expensive products when this works so so so good!</li>
            <li> When I order this product I was excited because I was a smoker looking to brighten my smile, but with this product it just was not so..</li>
            <li> Damn it works!&lt;br /&gt;i tried other products and i was about to give up on this stain on my teeth&lt;br /&gt; it removed my annoying stain on my front teeth from tea/coffee.&lt;br /&gt;it really works guys, not sure why others say it doesn&#x27;t maybe they aren&#x27;t using it correctly?&lt;br /&gt;I brushed first with my normal toothpaste then I used this eucryl and brushed it for about 4-5 minutes and VIOLA, my stain came off !!! im so happy</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste. If you are a smoker (and I am aware that we are few these days) its for you.</li>
            <li> My teeth were stained from coffee drinking and I also had general yellowing despite twice yearly dental visits for cleanings.  This product removed the stains and quite a bit of the yellowing that my dentist didn&#x27;t during regular cleaning.  It has really brightened my teeth and I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> EUCRYL IS THE BEST IN TEETH &amp; DENTAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS &amp; VERY REASONABLY PRICED-TEETH BECOME CLEAN IN A FEW USES</li>
            <li> I remember my parents using this tooth powder back in the 1940 - 50&#x27;s. I never thought I&#x27;d find it certainly not here on Amazon. This a powder is like your own dentist uses when you go for a cleaning. Use it once a week and your regular toothpaste the rest of the time. Keep teeth feeling really smooth and stain free. Great old time product that still works.</li>
            <li> Seems a safe product and results are great ... lasts longer than I expected ... would purchase again.</li>
            <li> sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and saccharin are neurotoxic and will aggravate the nerves in your mouth...avoid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should require a list of ingredients amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This makes my teeth feel just as clean as they feel right after a cleaning at the dentist office. I have asked a number of dental hygienists how I could get a hold of the gritty paste that they use for teeth cleaning. They all told me that it would not be possible for me to obtain it. But this seems to be exactly the same thing. The hygienists also said that using the product on a regular basis could wear the enamel off the teeth. The directions on the box advise to use the product no more than twice a week. I think it is a good idea to follow the directions on the box, and maybe use it even less frequently than twice a week. In addition, it is important to brush gently when using this product. All that said, I love the fresh clean feeling that I get from using this product!</li>
            <li> I wish this was a teeth whitener but it makes my teeth feel clean especially with a electric toothbrush :P</li>
            <li> I had a dental cleaning a month ago and my teeth were already staining from my coffee drinking.  I thought I&#x27;d have to give up my favorite drink after trying all the advertised tooth &#x27;whiteners&#x27; that simply didn&#x27;t perform as advertised.  In desperation and with gloomy expectations I ordered Eucryl toothpowder.  I tried it today for the first time and ALL MY STAINS ARE GONE !!!  I have never experienced a miracle in my life time, but I think one happened today.  I had to submit this recommendation.  Try it, you&#x27;ll be as stunned as I was.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I don&#x27;t see anything special when compared to other products with similar function.  It does what it is supposed to but not to the extent that the description leads on to.</li>
            <li> Definitely works to remove stains from teeth.  And a little goes a long way.  It will be a long time before I need to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all with this product.  After comparing this tooth powder -- I got same results with plain old baking soda.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the toothpaste, and again was expecting some miracle to whiten my teeth. And my teeth are not that bad. I will use it because I paid for it, but other than that, I don&#x27;t expect it to do anything different. I find that plain old salt mixed with baking soda works better actually.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say this is a &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; stain remover; however, it does make my teeth feel much cleaner than just using toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now and don&#x27;t see much difference. If this is a stain remover it&#x27;s not doing much to remove any stains</li>
            <li> Ordered 2; and religiously brushed; but to no avail!  Did not work for me, or I saw no results!  Like the taste, leaves clean breath, but that&#x27;s about all!</li>
            <li> good and interisting, I use them very good.I will contnue to buy many many thing from amazon. For last a couple years, I had bounght a lot of stuff from there, I fill very convinince. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> this does what the others claim in regard to whitening and cleaning your teeth, best ever and at 68 I needed it tried ALL the rest</li>
            <li> be carefull to not overuse this or you eill scrub your enamel off tooit definately gets hard stains off though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucryl for a few months and like the results.  It does leave the mouth with a nice clean feeling.  I just use it once a week.  Will purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> Excellent home product to help keeping teeth clean between dental visits.  Helps to keep teeth polished, easy  to use, great price too.</li>
            <li> Ordered this stuff to try to get rid of coffee stains that continually build up.  I would guess that, using it twice a day, it produced about 20% of the &amp;#34;hopeful results.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it worked for me. I&#x27;m a 3 to 5 cups a day coffee and tea drinker and it almost took all stains out in a couple of uses. It leaves my teeth naturally white unlike some whitening products that leave teeth excessively white.</li>
            <li> fast acting stain remover!! will buy again and wish my dentist sold it here!! highly recommended even the hubby loves it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this every night.  However, sprinkle a bit on your regular tooth past, or just use it on a damp toothbrush and you will get a deep cleaning on the teeth and around the gums that normal tooth paste just can&#x27;t provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No harm or damage done from use for over a year.  Just cleaner teeth!</li>
            <li> this product works great.would recommend. Fast acting better then white strips.will last a long time alot of product in the container.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, fair price, old reliable product you can depend upon. this product is a powder, it does work, it should not be used every day but in Incorporated use of once or twice every two weeks.  It does have a nice mild mint flavor, close to what the dentist would use to polish your teeth - I don&#x27;t mind using at all, I think you will like it as well.</li>
            <li> Tooth powders work better at cleaning teeth. Pycopay which you could get in Europe until just a few years ago was my favorite but this one is almost as good. It is non abrasive, has a nice licorice taste &amp; your teeth will feel MUCH cleaner. My grandfather always used toothpowders &amp; died with all his own nice white teeth, no caps&amp; never a cavity.</li>
            <li> Does not get rid of the yellow on my teeth, but it does make your teeth feel cleaner. I think if I use a stain remover and this it might help. Not sure why I have this problem in the first place because I don´t smoke or drink coffee, but my teeth are never quite as white as they should be, but overall I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this stuff before and I am quite satisfied with it.  Taste is okay and it is not messy and is absolutely a good product.</li>
            <li> I only used it four times and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any result. Perhaps if I continue using it for long period of time I will be able to see some results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Freshmint flavor of this product yet, but I think I&#x27;ll like it better. This doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste, it&#x27;s kind of lightly anise flavored, but I would like a fresher taste after using it, so I&#x27;m eager to try the Freshmint flavor. As far as making your teeth feel really smooth it deserves 5 stars. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how effective it is for removing stains, but I think it&#x27;s made my teeth a little bit whiter. I will update when I see a real difference.</li>
            <li> Its good stuff and Im glad I bought it. Took forever to arrive from seller via USPS. But thats not the products fault! Its a little sudsier than i expected so it disappates quickly. I was expecting a little less soluble but it did do some polishing after 3-4 rounds.</li>
            <li> I drink a fair amount of coffee and enjoy blueberries and blackberries on a regular basis. Eucryl is a godsend for gentle stain removing. Use it 2-3 Xs per week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did nothing for stains on my teeth. I continue to look for a product that works...</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very smooth and very clean after using this brushing. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This did a pretty good job of getting rid of some stubborn stains.  I would recommend people just buy trays and bleach if they really want whitening action.</li>
            <li> I discovered this tooth powder while visiting Scandinavia, and I was quite surprised with the results.  Very Good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I tried it and it didn&#x27;t work for me and its disappointing to buy something that doesn&#x27;t work.  After reading all the reviews of the product I had high hopes but they were let down.</li>
            <li> Teeth a lot whiter now :-)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Product really works as advertised.  Can be difficult to get at times though because it is not always carried in the states.  Worth the wait!</li>
            <li> A great stain remover for coffee and tobacco stains. Follow directions and do not use everyday. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  I do like the fresh taste and smoothness it leaves.</li>
            <li> Does the job, and makes a big difference over time. I ordered two because someone close to me really needs this!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be dissatisfied, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> This stain removal beats any expensive tooth cleaning set I&#x27;ve tried so far. I use it about once a week and it leaves my teeth feeling smooth and gets rid of dark build up around the gum line from smoking and too much coffee.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try since I am a coffee and tea drinker; seems to remove some staining but still need to have a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> So, it might be that my stains were just superficial enough that they didn&#x27;t take much to get &#x27;em off to begin with.  They were some tea stains that formed some lines along the contours of my front teeth, I think they only formed a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a bit of teeth whitening with a home kit, and it made the stains lighter but they didn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I brushed with this stuff for about 30 seconds and rinsed.  I was thinking, &amp;#34;well, hopefully I&#x27;ll see a difference and the stains will be at least a little whiter.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a double-take in the mirror - the stains were GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, long story short, very happy.  One use was all I needed, but my stains were, as I said, very superficial and new.  And with the price being so low, it&#x27;s not a bad bet.</li>
            <li> There is a light hint of mint when you brush your teeth with this stuff, and its gritty so when you brush your teeth, you feel as if you have just been to the dentist and your teeth are squeaky clean. i didn&#x27;t notice my teeth getting any lighter but then again i don&#x27;t use it religiously either, i only use it when i feel like i need it.</li>
            <li> I grew up using tooth powder and I missed it...so...looked at imgredients and Eucryl looked the best. LOVE it! My teeth feel, and look, really clean. Only should use twice a week...but tempting to use more often. Told a dentist friend and he got some. Perfect for coffee &amp; tea drinkers.  Staple item from now on.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed and quicker than I expected it. Thank you for a prompt delivery and quality product. This took my cheesy looking smile stained by espresso and cigarettes and made me look like a movie star. Ok I was a bit over dramatic but this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> i smoke a pack a day and drink three cups of coffee. my dentist gets the yellow color out every six months but this thing got it out after ten minutes of brushing. i use it once a week now and my friend who smokes kept looking at my teeth after I used it so I&#x27;m buying him some too. my yellowish tinted teeth now all white. i should have used this before instead of the 300 dollar ultra violet tooth spa i went to and save myself 300 bucks. NOW I KNOW&gt;</li>
            <li> Thr item arrived quickly and in good shape.  The product works. I have been using this at least once a week and notice visibly whiter teeth. I use it with the Eucryl toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Have used this and similar products over a period of years, and will continue to do so. Leaves mouth fresh and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times and actually noticed a difference after the first application.  A good product that brightens teeth as advertised!</li>
            <li> This product really brightens up smokers and coffee drinkers teeth.  Once or twice a week is good...more than that may damage your teeth.  Read the directions.  This product really works well with a Sonic or other brand of electric toothbrush and feels like you just had your teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening with regular use. I has a pleasant taste, but I will probably not reorder this item.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for selling things so reasonable on Amazon, I enjoy my experience every time I shop here online. All products are nice and good conditioned. I will be back often again to buy this product again among others not just for myself but for all my other friends and associates. I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to give it a full rating but I can say that I haven&#x27;t had a bad case yet.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been whiter and brighter! This stuff is better than any whitening toothpaste and lasts longer. I drink coffee all day and smoke and ALL the stains are gone! Also, I use this at least once a day and have had no ill effects or pain and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> this is great powder, took along time to arrive , but that&#x27;s okay. I use it at least every other day, I use it with my oral hygiene regiment last a long time . I have a strict regiment I follow for my teeth, this will always be part of it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would do a little more than the other reviews said. It definitely does clean your teeth much more than just toothpaste but it didn&#x27;t really take any stains away. Not bad for the price just don&#x27;t expect a miracle to happen.</li>
            <li> I like to have super clean-feeling teeth.  I first brush my teeth with regular toothpaste.  Then, I use this product with my electric toothbrush.  The result is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It somewhat worked but is chalky and messy. The container is hard to work with and spills easily.  Maybe you have to use it every night....</li>
            <li> If I can run my tongue across my teeth and feel something that isn&#x27;t smooth, I know it&#x27;s time to use this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just rinse your toothbrush real well, dip it in there, and brush your teeth. I use a dip on the top left and middle. Dip again, top right middle. Dip again, bottom and middle. Dip again bottom right and middle. Cause one dip won&#x27;t last for the entire mouth. But it&#x27;s just a little dip, not a big heap, so it lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t need to use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it just this morning cause I was feeling gritty and now my teeth are smooth again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, 5 stars! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Service was great. Received the order in about 2 weeks. Have used the product a few times and noticed teeth are slightly whiter. Thanks!</li>
            <li> works well, tastes good.</li>
            <li> Thought I was ordering a paste and was pleasantly surprised when I started using it.  Good product.  Glad I got the wrong thing...</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with a tooth polisher I bought and it works very well.  It seems to be like what is used at the dentist, at least your teeth feel nice and smooth like after your teeth have been cleaned.</li>
            <li> This powder does help with stain removal. For the price its a very decent add on to your regular brushing. Combined with an electric brush, just after one use you can see a great difference. I would recommend doing this once a day on top of twice a day regular brushing.</li>
            <li> I like the clean, polished look and feel ..I sometimes sprinkle a little on the toothpaste on the tooth brush.Works good that way too..</li>
            <li> When I was in my 20&#x27;s this stuff worked wonders, I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t work anymore maybe it isn&#x27;t the same as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I used to buy a product very close to this called &amp;#34;Kep&amp;#34; and I used it for many years.  Then it just disappeared off the market when the White Strips came on the scene.  I looked everywhere for a replacement and couldn&#x27;t find anything for years.  Finally, I stumbled on this and found out it works just as good as the other product.  Really glad to find it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different to brush your teeth with tooth powder but just follow the directions and it works fairly well.  The powder is in a round container -- be sure to not get water in the powder and to securely snap the lid back on.  The taste is pretty good too.  Seems to do a fair job with cleaning but in my experience I can&#x27;t say that it has any great stain removal properties.  I don&#x27;t have heavily stained teeth so wouldn&#x27;t see any extreme results.  Bought this because I wanted to have something that approximates the clean feeling your teeth have when you leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a dental cleaning.  This does help achieve that somewhat but it&#x27;s not as effective in that area as I would have liked.  It&#x27;s okay, and I continue to use it and will probably buy another container when this one is depleted.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, but this is magic. Use as directed, though. Anything this potent must have powerful stuff that will cause trouble with overuse. But for a once-a-week thorough scrubbing, it&#x27;s brilliant.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product upon hearing that it really makes your teeth a lot whiter. When I received the product , i used it as directed and could see an immediate improvement. Along with that, it also leaves such a remarkable taste in your mouth, I plan on ordering again. I just love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It sure beats paying upwards of $30 for those overpriced whitening strips.  It&#x27;s easy to use, comes in a nice case, and is pleasant tasting (not that you eat it, but you know what I mean!).  I will buy it again when I use up my current stash.  The other nice thing about it is your teeth are natural looking - definitely whiter but not that &amp;#34;too white,&amp;#34; obviously-whitened look that, for some reason, is the trend these days.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job! Removed years of tar build up on my teeth from smoking, and they&#x27;re so much whiter. I&#x27;m impressed and will be buying again when I run out. I highly recommend it, and I&#x27;ve used it two-three times a week for about three weeks.</li>
            <li> waste of time and money, DONT buy didnt do what it said it will do...</li>
            <li> Keeps teeth whiter.  Easy to use.  Will buy again - great price.  Just remember to do a flouride brush before and after using to keep your enamel safe.</li>
            <li> I discovered Eucryl in Scotland a couple of years back, and found it a great alternative to the barrage of mint-flavored tooth care products we&#x27;re stuck with in the US.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of stain removal.  It does leave my teeth feeling very clean and polished--probably its best feature.  I use it once or twice a week.  There&#x27;s a lot in the package, so it will last, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product. Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> Works ..keeps teeth clean and breath fresh. I feel like this is my most uninspiring review , but can I really be that enthused about tooth powder ?!</li>
            <li> Bought it and used it. But I still have no idea whether it works or not for a smoker. However, I am inclined toward not. Better visit your dentist instead.</li>
            <li> This is a wonder powder. My husband drinks a lot of coffee.  I noticed that his teeth cleaning only lasted a couple of days until I got this little wonder powder for him.  I saw a definite change in 2 days.  It took a week for me to see a very marked difference in the lack of stain on his teeth.  He now  uses it 3 days a week.  I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> I will rate at a later date, the verdict from the jury is not in just yet. I have been using the product. I have not conclude yet</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even find tooth powder in stores now. This stuff is so good, so effective at cleaning your teeth really well.</li>
            <li> It does not whiten like I had hoped.  But it is better than the toothpaste available over the counter at the drugstore.</li>
