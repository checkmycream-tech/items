            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I started researching more and found this brand.</li>

            <li>Dropper makes is easy to apply the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Strong Smell which helps a lot to keep all the bugs out of your body.</li>

            <li>I LOVE using my Tea Tree oil and the quick customer service</li>
            <li>has made me a HUGE FAN of Mellowleaf.</li>
            <li>The rubber stopper didnt&#x27; fit correctly in the cap</li>
            <li>I buy my own at Whole Foods, great value, still lasting.</li>
            <li>Then when traveling, the passenger compartment of the aircraft became filled with the smell as the bottle pressurized in flight and leaked.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as expected, great product and price.</li>
            <li>For the price, the bottle should be full.</li>
            <li>It is also great to help you heal your cuts and clear with a natural way.</li>
            <li>helped my acne go away a lot faster than the clean and clear salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide that made my pimples more inflamed.</li>
            <li>Works awesome on our tough laundry</li>
            <li>It is great natural tea tree oil for your daily usages for shampoo, body wash.</li>
            <li>I like how this smells kinda like fresh and minty</li>
            <li>I do like the dropper as it allows for me to have better control of the drops of oil as compared to the reducer caps that come on the essential oils.  </li>
            <li>First time buying tea tree oil</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying this brand.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li>It does state that it is 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li>I really like using tea tree oils in my bath and on my feet.  </li>
            <li>This oil is great for spot treating blemishes, before or after they&#x27;ve been broken.</li>
            <li>and it really works, got rid of inflammation and pimples really fast.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>which I is what  I like because it tells me that its the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The rubber top was collapsed and the bottle seemed to have leaked some of the product, as the bottle was not full.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Natural Antibiotic</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any looking to try a natural approach to skin ailments.</li>
            <li>I mix this oil with water &amp; spray my dogs as it&#x27;s a natural tick preventative.</li>
            <li>I would never get near anyone with the smell of this product on me.</li>
            <li>So far my dandruff is gone and my face seems to be clearing up.</li>
            <li>But once I opened it and let the air in, it popped back to normal.</li>
            <li>Within only a few days after placing my order, it arrived well packaged and secure.  </li>
            <li>, it heals your cuts, scratches, scars, acne like no other.</li>
            <li>My bottle was only half full and the rubber dropper was collapsed (like another reviewer said).</li>
            <li>It is 100% tea tree oil; with just a few drops you are pretty</li>
            <li>I personally have dry skin and have to make sure I put small amounts on the acne alone otherwise it can really dry up my face.</li>
            <li>Too little quantity, used it up too fast.</li>

            <li> Great product, used to eliminate toe nail fungus where all other expensive products and prescriptions failed.</li>
            <li> so Now i got half the bottel left.</li>
            <li> I purchased because it is a little larger</li>
            <li> However, there was no protective seal and bottle was about 1/3 empty.</li>
            <li> I was given some of this by a friend and it did what I expected, so no problems to report.</li>
            <li> , i had some acne and used this for a few spots and after 3 or 4 days the acne got alot smaller</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s milder than the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use it for acne, and other rashes on the body.  </li>
            <li> You can always refill it with other tea tree oil if you buy the dropper version once.</li>
            <li> It is helping ease wrinkles that I got using a terrible teen product that left huge wrinkles below my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried out a few tea tree oil products before but there is nothing matched with this Mellowleaf tea tree oil on quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to a mixture of witch hazel and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I add my eye and skin moisturizer after leaving the tea tree oil for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Used very little.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it leaked in shipment, everything smelled like tea tree oil when it arrived and it was gone in no time.</li>
            <li> Mellowleaf contacted me about my complaint and offered me another bottle.  </li>
            <li> Very small amount in bottles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used on toenails and hair and haven&#x27;t had a problem, although I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement, my dandruff hasn&#x27;t gotten worse either.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> I have tried out a few tea tree oil products before but there is nothing matched with this Mellowleaf tea tree oil on quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It is 100% tea tree oil; with just a few drops you are pretty set.&lt;br /&gt;- Strong Smell which helps a lot to keep all the bugs out of your body. (I mixed the oil with my shampoo &amp; body wash)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Natural Antibiotic, it heals your cuts, scratches, scars, acne like no other. My cut was literally healed with one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Could use some improvement on the label. I accidentally drop the bottle into a wet sink and all the letters and logo got smeared completely. However, it is not a reason to take off a star, I buy the product for the quality of it not for the cute look of the label. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY!!! It is great natural tea tree oil for your daily usages for shampoo, body wash. It is also great to help you heal your cuts and clear with a natural way.</li>
            <li> It works great for me!</li>
            <li> Great product, used to eliminate toe nail fungus where all other expensive products and prescriptions failed.</li>
            <li> I really like using tea tree oils in my bath and on my feet.  I do have a history of athletes foot, only on my left foot.  The tea tree oil calms any itching and stops further growth.  I was concerned about the dropper with the plastic.  When it arrived the dropper portion was depressed so no oil sat in the rubber portion.  I do like the dropper as it allows for me to have better control of the drops of oil as compared to the reducer caps that come on the essential oils.  I do think that this oil works as it should, it smells appropriately.  I would not use internally as I do not know the source of the oil or the distillation process.  It does state that it is 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to my lotion.  Tea tree oil is a wonderful product.  It also helps with acne.  I just purchased an organic dog shampoo with tea tree and it&#x27;s working great on my dog&#x27;s skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It met and exceeded my expectations. The eye dropper made using it very easy. Would do business with this company again.</li>
            <li> Works awesome on our tough laundry</li>
            <li> This oil is great for spot treating blemishes, before or after they&#x27;ve been broken. I personally have dry skin and have to make sure I put small amounts on the acne alone otherwise it can really dry up my face.</li>
            <li> It works wonders and the smell is very pleasant.  I got it to moisturized my skin and help heal a rash and boy did it work.  Mellowleaf gave me great service and product arrived in a timely manner.  I would recommend this product to any looking to try a natural approach to skin ailments.</li>
            <li> helped my acne go away a lot faster than the clean and clear salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide that made my pimples more inflamed. Awesome product, I recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s breaking out. Dropper makes is easy to apply the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of weeks and it really works, got rid of inflammation and pimples really fast. Dries up your skin but is manageable with a nice moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> First time buying tea tree oil and I love the dropper! Excellent product! Added to my shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this brand. I purchased because it is a little larger then Edensgarden. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with packaging or shipping. It arrived on time. I like the smell of this brand. I think it&#x27;s milder than the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried. I mix it with other oils as a facial cleanser, and with my toner. The dropper&#x27;s rubber was collapsed upon opening the box. But once I opened it and let the air in, it popped back to normal. No problem at all. This is a great product. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did have an issue with the packaging of this item. The rubber stopper didnt&#x27; fit correctly in the cap and I had to pour this into a different bottle.  Mellowleaf contacted me about my complaint and offered me another bottle.  I LOVE using my Tea Tree oil and the quick customer service has made me a HUGE FAN of Mellowleaf. I will be buying their oils from now on in the future.</li>
            <li> I payed $34 and it did NOT work and puls it was open so Now i got half the bottel left.</li>
            <li> Very small amount in bottles.  Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  Will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> Great stuff, good quality, but not for the money. Too little quantity, used it up too fast. Not sure if it leaked in shipment, everything smelled like tea tree oil when it arrived and it was gone in no time. I buy my own at Whole Foods, great value, still lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Looked forward to receiving this product. It arrived very promptly. However, there was no protective seal and bottle was about 1/3 empty. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  Had amazing results on a toenail.  Only down side was the bottle leaked on shipping to the point that the post office asked what it was.  Then when traveling, the passenger compartment of the aircraft became filled with the smell as the bottle pressurized in flight and leaked.  Not fond of the bottle but love the oil!!</li>
            <li> I love this tea tree oil.  I use it for acne, and other rashes on the body.  I love the results.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to a mixture of witch hazel and rubbing alcohol. My version of face wipe for my acne prone skin. This tea tree oil works wonders!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Great for blemishes.</li>
            <li> Good product seems to do the job</li>
            <li> I mix this oil with water &amp; spray my dogs as it&#x27;s a natural tick preventative. Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> My bottle was only half full and the rubber dropper was collapsed (like another reviewer said). The box had a strong smell when I opened it, I assume from leakage.  I applied some on my fingernails. Used very little. Rubbed it in.  The odor was repulsive!!  It did not go away. In an hour I was so overwhelmed by the smell that I had to take a shower. I sprayed my house to get rid of the odor. I would never get near anyone with the smell of this product on me. Someone said it keeps the bugs away. I understand why!!  It would keep people away also!!  I boxed it up and it is being returned.</li>
            <li> I love this it help you out if u have a foot fungus they say you can use it on your hair but i did not i was scared to use it on my hair holp this help out some one that is try to get this for a foot fungus</li>
            <li> The product is excellent.  However, I lost 99% of the product through leakage from the eye dropper when it was packed in my cosmetic bag while traveling.  Change the bottle and I will order again.  The seller of this product did replace the product because of the leakage issue, but whomever I spoke with was in denial about the bottle having problems.</li>
            <li> I was given some of this by a friend and it did what I expected, so no problems to report.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  Within only a few days after placing my order, it arrived well packaged and secure.  This is a wonderful product and i would encourage you to try this.  Regards, Melissa</li>
            <li> Just what I expected, only issue I had was the package smelled of tea tree oil so it could have been packaged more efficiently.</li>
            <li> The rubber top was collapsed and the bottle seemed to have leaked some of the product, as the bottle was not full.  For the price, the bottle should be full.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell, which I is what  I like because it tells me that its the real deal.  I&#x27;ve used on toenails and hair and haven&#x27;t had a problem, although I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement, my dandruff hasn&#x27;t gotten worse either.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find tea tree oil with a dropper these days, but it is very helpful.  You can always refill it with other tea tree oil if you buy the dropper version once.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for over two weeks. It leaves my skin feeling really smooth and soft. It is helping ease wrinkles that I got using a terrible teen product that left huge wrinkles below my eyes. They&#x27;re almost gone. I add my eye and skin moisturizer after leaving the tea tree oil for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying tea tree oil from multiple companies. All of them had defects, some of them would leak from the bottle and others would not even produce any results. I started researching more and found this brand. ordered one bottle and liked how it did not leak and the smell was very nice. I put it in my shampoo and for acne. So far my dandruff is gone and my face seems to be clearing up.</li>
            <li> I like how this smells kinda like fresh and minty, i had some acne and used this for a few spots and after 3 or 4 days the acne got alot smaller and i didnt have a lot of redness compared to when i used products with benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also liked the dropper, made it easier to put on cue-tips for applying on my acne spots.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected, great product and price.</li>
