            <li>I get many compliments on how silky it looks.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This treatment is great for the hair, but it made my scalp very itchy and flaky.  </li>
            <li>and my husband noticed and complemented me on how healthy my hair looked.</li>
            <li>If he noticed, I know it works. :)</li>
            <li>I was determined this time to take better care of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and it was s phenomenal thirst quencher once or twice a week at bedtime...</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>It more oiled my hair more than moisturized it.  </li>
            <li>Feels stronger and more flexible...</li>
            <li>Great seller,  fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>product is ok but not for my hair</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more :)</li>
            <li>I love what this hair strengthening Night-time treatment by Mizani does for my &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;-hair type.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I make sure to re-order so that I do not run out of it.</li>
            <li>I also love the creamy consistency, it is blended</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product, it is Awesome!</li>
            <li>It is light and leaves hair nice.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this after I was coerced into buying it from a friend.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but it does a lot more.  </li>
            <li>but I gave it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great seller, fast</li>
            <li>Love the Mizani line.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so healthy and strong when this product is applied.</li>
            <li>Great for nighttime natural hair are regime.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, its good without having to use a lot.</li>
            <li>But after using MIZANI H2O INTENSE NIGHT-TIME TREATMENT, it is good to wake up in the morning, take off my satin bonnet and my hair is saying \\&quot;let&#x27;s go out and break some hearts, hurt some feelings, steal the show\\</li>
            <li>Between this product and my henna treatments, my transistion has been relatively easy.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair strong, moist, and managable.</li>
            <li>Hair is moisturized and strong after the 1st use.</li>
            <li>This cream smells good but since the main ingredient is mineral oil</li>
            <li>H2 intense works awesome on my hair, makes it feels so soft and light.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser warned me about over hydrating my fine oily hair.</li>
            <li>I was using a hair lotion but along with it, my hair looks as healthy as before I was pregnant with any of my children.</li>
            <li>It does smell pleasant and has a nice consistency, but ... not really feeling it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products because I feel like I am practically new to relaxed hair again, and this is a wonderful overnight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>souflee/oil/creame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to wear a silk/silk-like scarf, body heat heating/shower cap, or plastic bag (same difference, LOL)</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It does its job without being greasy or too light.</li>
            <li>I honestly don’t see how it is classified as an intense nighttime treatment as opposed to a hairdress crème.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying it now and looking forward to fantastic results.</li>
            <li>NEVER play yourself cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mizani makes some of the BEST hair care products that&#x27;s lightweight, keeps moisture in the hair without being heavy and keeps hair of all textures from breaking off.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I can put this on in the night and in the morning my hair feels light and hydrated without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Those that are listed first are the ones that are most in abundance...</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, healthy, and dependable -- I know exactly what it will be like every morning, which is well-worth the price IMO.</li>
            <li>This product is okay, being the first Mizani product I’ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Great for damaged or just dry hair.</li>
            <li>This is great product for those who hair is dry and frizzy!  </li>
            <li>My hair always looks healthy, bouncy and it certainly gives it body.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and not heavy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much good old hair grease.</li>
            <li>nice hair and smell like old lady or find something else</li>
            <li>I have a good friend who swears by Mizani, so I picked this up at my local Target to give it a try.</li>
            <li>You pay more than that for a set of nails when the first thing everyone sees is your lovely face and that hair that is softly framing it.</li>
            <li>It is the best moisturizer for african american hair.</li>
            <li>I found it a bit pricy, however, I quickly learned it was worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I applied it sparingly (dime-sized dollop) because it was so rich</li>
            <li>Even though I go to a great stylist every two weeks I had started to notice a little breakage.</li>
            <li>After unwrapping my hair the next morning my hair looks absoultely amazing..</li>
            <li>giving  this great reviews didn&#x27;t do anything  but make hair feel heavy with oily build up.</li>
            <li>It is well worth $16</li>
            <li>Also, it has a lovely soft scent.</li>
            <li>It combs through the hair easily and gives decent shine as well as provides manageability.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to love it so far.</li>
            <li>I put this on at night, and in the morning my hair is soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Trust me,  the fifteen dollars is worth the fifteen minutes of fame you get in compliments.</li>
            <li>This Cream was great, i saturated my scalp with it and massaged my whole head, i was able to hold out on getting a relaxer for at least 2 weeks....</li>
            <li>and this keeps it straight after a good straightening and flat ironing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance and weight  are wonderful for my thick hair!I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>right there.    </li>
            <li>: start during the evening for the first few days, it will help greatly.</li>
            <li>very moisturizing, great smell, leaves hair feeling soft, shiny and does not need to be applied daily.</li>
            <li>so I am always in the market for good moisturizers that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to see if it was better than my current system.</li>
            <li>In the first 4 or 5 ingredients, it lists \\&quot;water, mineral oil, and petroleum\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I put about a quarter amount on each night (making sure I don&#x27;t miss any areas, and especially in my kitchen)</li>
            <li>If used consistently with Mizani Supreme oil works wonders.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>You used too much!</li>
            <li>first time users that is purchasing this nighttime treatment</li>
            <li>Using this product daily will help your hair to be healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let anyone deter you from trying this or any new product that you choose to spend your hard earned money on for what you feel is right for YOUR BEAUTIFUL HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had my hair relaxed a month ago after wearing it consistently in a weave for an entire year, so I am very concerned about keeping it healthy, moisturized and keep it from breaking off.</li>
            <li>Great product to repair seriously destroyed hair.  </li>
            <li>When used consistently, this product really does work.</li>
            <li>I decided later in the week to use a little more at bedtime (nickel to quarter sized dollop), wrapped my hair, and the next morning my hair was supple and had great body -- salon-quality.</li>
            <li>This product is great for dull, lifeless ethnic hair that tends to be dry, brittle and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>and I must say my hair is stronger, has a healthy shine and is growing in the dry areas where the breakage had begun.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and wash it out the next morning and haven&#x27;t noticed any more oil that normal even on days after the treatment.</li>
            <li>I use this product almost daily in order to smooth my hair to a point where I can comb it straight</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much, just a quarter to fifty cent piece size.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I like this product because I don&#x27;t have to use so much hair oil.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy unless you use to much.  </li>
            <li>I have relaxed, bi-racial hair that was breaking, shedding, and very dry/damaged and</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But after a night of this therapy my hair felt much softer.</li>
            <li>Thanks for  stocking these products.</li>
            <li>This creme is excellent for wrapping coarse and super thick hair at night!!!</li>
            <li>I heard such good reviews about this product, so I bought it even knowing it could possibly mess up my hair.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something less creamy and more hydrating.  </li>
            <li>can get a  better product for less</li>
            <li>But for those with really thick, coarse hair, it works great.</li>
            <li>Its a bit greasy if I put too much on, but when I put just enough on it leaves my hair feeling soft and full.</li>
            <li>I had to purchase the Mizani Iron curl cream because my hair is frizzy on my left side and silky straight on the right.  </li>
            <li>There is no reason for this product ot be so high in cost.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The night-time H2O has really helped my 13 year old with hair breakage and split</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it since I&#x27;ve gone natural but am very tempted to reintroduce it to my collection...</li>
            <li>I do not necessarily use it at nights, but usually right before I rush out the door.</li>
            <li>This cream works on my relaxed and new growth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this nighttime treatment because I like to try new products</li>
            <li>Protects my new growth from breakage.</li>
            <li>My hair has been super dry since moving to Texas</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and hydrated in the morning!</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time last night, ladies,we have a winner!</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been transitioning since Feb. 2012 and was having a lot of breakage due to dryness, so i purchased this product to see if i could stop the breakage without having to do the BIG CHOP</li>
            <li>It is kind of pricey, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This product, completely restored and repaired my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>Wrap or braid it and its ready the next morning.</li>
            <li>but my hair smelled like \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Well, with one use, my hair went from straw to soft, bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have all natural 4b/4c hair</li>
            <li>Last time I was here, I really felt my hair was matted when I returned home.</li>
            <li>However now that I am letting my relaxer grow out and going natural</li>
            <li>to go..the product made my hair soft and manageable it worked for me and the smell is a plus</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>It works miracles, keeps my hair soft and nourished</li>
            <li>My daughter has naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair has developed a noticeable strength.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transistioning to natural and like all transistioners, I started to experience breakage.  </li>
            <li>In addition, after use, my hair is extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your hair weekly or twice a week because it is thick and can cause build up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of other products that can give me the same results without my feeling like I&#x27;m going to have a trail of old men following me.</li>
            <li>after wrapping then releasing the hair the next morning it was softer and more tame (ie manageable).</li>
            <li>The everyday rose conditioning hairdress didn&#x27;t work half as well for me.</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair with fine strands prone to dryness and have had major issues with breakage in the past</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft and completely manageable, and I do not have to put anything else on it until maybe 2 nights later.</li>
            <li>My hair is 4B all natural; therefore this is the only product so far that loosens my curls along with adding shine with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky and, at least on my hair, soaks up fast so even if I do it right before bed, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it staining my pillowcase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent hair cream, not much different than the next brand in the store.</li>
            <li>I’ve used other products priced substantially less with similar or better results (I am texlaxed with hair somewhere in the 4 range).</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair, long, past my shoulders, and it&#x27;s fine or thin-textured.</li>
            <li>I was truly disappointed because Mizani has great ads.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put this product in my hair, the texture went from brittle, dry and frizzy to smooth and soft -seriously.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews but this product is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I normally wash and blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li>First my hair smelled bad the next morning and on top of that, it wasn&#x27;t moisturized.</li>
            <li>Because of our bone dry climate, natural hair and especially permed or color treated</li>
            <li>Not worth the high price.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I originally brought this product as a good leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> These ingredients are very cheap.</li>
            <li> A friend was visiting from California and highly recommended this product for her beautiful hair care regime.</li>
            <li> Magical product.  </li>

            <li> I really love it.</li>

            <li> always looks shiny and healthy afterwards.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on how silky it looks.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This treatment is great for the hair, but it made my scalp very itchy and flaky.  </li>
            <li> and my husband noticed and complemented me on how healthy my hair looked.</li>
            <li> If he noticed, I know it works. :)</li>
            <li> I was determined this time to take better care of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and it was s phenomenal thirst quencher once or twice a week at bedtime...</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> It more oiled my hair more than moisturized it.  </li>
            <li> Feels stronger and more flexible...</li>
            <li> Great seller,  fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> product is ok but not for my hair</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more :)</li>
            <li> I love what this hair strengthening Night-time treatment by Mizani does for my &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;-hair type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I make sure to re-order so that I do not run out of it.</li>
            <li> I also love the creamy consistency, it is blended</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product, it is Awesome!</li>
            <li> It is light and leaves hair nice.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this after I was coerced into buying it from a friend.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> but it does a lot more.  </li>
            <li> but I gave it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast</li>
            <li> Love the Mizani line.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so healthy and strong when this product is applied.</li>
            <li> Great for nighttime natural hair are regime.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, its good without having to use a lot.</li>
            <li> But after using MIZANI H2O INTENSE NIGHT-TIME TREATMENT, it is good to wake up in the morning, take off my satin bonnet and my hair is saying \\&quot;let&#x27;s go out and break some hearts, hurt some feelings, steal the show\\</li>
            <li> Between this product and my henna treatments, my transistion has been relatively easy.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair strong, moist, and managable.</li>
            <li> Hair is moisturized and strong after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> This cream smells good but since the main ingredient is mineral oil</li>
            <li> H2 intense works awesome on my hair, makes it feels so soft and light.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser warned me about over hydrating my fine oily hair.</li>
            <li> I was using a hair lotion but along with it, my hair looks as healthy as before I was pregnant with any of my children.</li>
            <li> It does smell pleasant and has a nice consistency, but ... not really feeling it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products because I feel like I am practically new to relaxed hair again, and this is a wonderful overnight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> souflee/oil/creame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to wear a silk/silk-like scarf, body heat heating/shower cap, or plastic bag (same difference, LOL)</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It does its job without being greasy or too light.</li>
            <li> I honestly don’t see how it is classified as an intense nighttime treatment as opposed to a hairdress crème.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying it now and looking forward to fantastic results.</li>
            <li> NEVER play yourself cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mizani makes some of the BEST hair care products that&#x27;s lightweight, keeps moisture in the hair without being heavy and keeps hair of all textures from breaking off.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I can put this on in the night and in the morning my hair feels light and hydrated without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Those that are listed first are the ones that are most in abundance...</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, healthy, and dependable -- I know exactly what it will be like every morning, which is well-worth the price IMO.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, being the first Mizani product I’ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Great for damaged or just dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is great product for those who hair is dry and frizzy!  </li>
            <li> My hair always looks healthy, bouncy and it certainly gives it body.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and not heavy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much good old hair grease.</li>
            <li> nice hair and smell like old lady or find something else</li>
            <li> I have a good friend who swears by Mizani, so I picked this up at my local Target to give it a try.</li>
            <li> You pay more than that for a set of nails when the first thing everyone sees is your lovely face and that hair that is softly framing it.</li>
            <li> It is the best moisturizer for african american hair.</li>
            <li> I found it a bit pricy, however, I quickly learned it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I applied it sparingly (dime-sized dollop) because it was so rich</li>
            <li> Even though I go to a great stylist every two weeks I had started to notice a little breakage.</li>
            <li> After unwrapping my hair the next morning my hair looks absoultely amazing..</li>
            <li> giving  this great reviews didn&#x27;t do anything  but make hair feel heavy with oily build up.</li>
            <li> It is well worth $16</li>
            <li> Also, it has a lovely soft scent.</li>
            <li> It combs through the hair easily and gives decent shine as well as provides manageability.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to love it so far.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night, and in the morning my hair is soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Trust me,  the fifteen dollars is worth the fifteen minutes of fame you get in compliments.</li>
            <li> This Cream was great, i saturated my scalp with it and massaged my whole head, i was able to hold out on getting a relaxer for at least 2 weeks....</li>
            <li> and this keeps it straight after a good straightening and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance and weight  are wonderful for my thick hair!I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> right there.    </li>
            <li> : start during the evening for the first few days, it will help greatly.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing, great smell, leaves hair feeling soft, shiny and does not need to be applied daily.</li>
            <li> so I am always in the market for good moisturizers that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to see if it was better than my current system.</li>
            <li> In the first 4 or 5 ingredients, it lists \\&quot;water, mineral oil, and petroleum\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I put about a quarter amount on each night (making sure I don&#x27;t miss any areas, and especially in my kitchen)</li>
            <li> If used consistently with Mizani Supreme oil works wonders.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> You used too much!</li>
            <li> first time users that is purchasing this nighttime treatment</li>
            <li> Using this product daily will help your hair to be healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let anyone deter you from trying this or any new product that you choose to spend your hard earned money on for what you feel is right for YOUR BEAUTIFUL HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had my hair relaxed a month ago after wearing it consistently in a weave for an entire year, so I am very concerned about keeping it healthy, moisturized and keep it from breaking off.</li>
            <li> Great product to repair seriously destroyed hair.  </li>
            <li> When used consistently, this product really does work.</li>
            <li> I decided later in the week to use a little more at bedtime (nickel to quarter sized dollop), wrapped my hair, and the next morning my hair was supple and had great body -- salon-quality.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dull, lifeless ethnic hair that tends to be dry, brittle and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> and I must say my hair is stronger, has a healthy shine and is growing in the dry areas where the breakage had begun.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and wash it out the next morning and haven&#x27;t noticed any more oil that normal even on days after the treatment.</li>
            <li> I use this product almost daily in order to smooth my hair to a point where I can comb it straight</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much, just a quarter to fifty cent piece size.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like this product because I don&#x27;t have to use so much hair oil.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy unless you use to much.  </li>
            <li> I have relaxed, bi-racial hair that was breaking, shedding, and very dry/damaged and</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But after a night of this therapy my hair felt much softer.</li>
            <li> Thanks for  stocking these products.</li>
            <li> This creme is excellent for wrapping coarse and super thick hair at night!!!</li>
            <li> I heard such good reviews about this product, so I bought it even knowing it could possibly mess up my hair.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something less creamy and more hydrating.  </li>
            <li> can get a  better product for less</li>
            <li> But for those with really thick, coarse hair, it works great.</li>
            <li> Its a bit greasy if I put too much on, but when I put just enough on it leaves my hair feeling soft and full.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase the Mizani Iron curl cream because my hair is frizzy on my left side and silky straight on the right.  </li>
            <li> There is no reason for this product ot be so high in cost.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The night-time H2O has really helped my 13 year old with hair breakage and split</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it since I&#x27;ve gone natural but am very tempted to reintroduce it to my collection...</li>
            <li> I do not necessarily use it at nights, but usually right before I rush out the door.</li>
            <li> This cream works on my relaxed and new growth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nighttime treatment because I like to try new products</li>
            <li> Protects my new growth from breakage.</li>
            <li> My hair has been super dry since moving to Texas</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and hydrated in the morning!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time last night, ladies,we have a winner!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been transitioning since Feb. 2012 and was having a lot of breakage due to dryness, so i purchased this product to see if i could stop the breakage without having to do the BIG CHOP</li>
            <li> It is kind of pricey, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product, completely restored and repaired my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wrap or braid it and its ready the next morning.</li>
            <li> but my hair smelled like \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Well, with one use, my hair went from straw to soft, bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have all natural 4b/4c hair</li>
            <li> Last time I was here, I really felt my hair was matted when I returned home.</li>
            <li> However now that I am letting my relaxer grow out and going natural</li>
            <li> to go..the product made my hair soft and manageable it worked for me and the smell is a plus</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> It works miracles, keeps my hair soft and nourished</li>
            <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair has developed a noticeable strength.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transistioning to natural and like all transistioners, I started to experience breakage.  </li>
            <li> In addition, after use, my hair is extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your hair weekly or twice a week because it is thick and can cause build up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of other products that can give me the same results without my feeling like I&#x27;m going to have a trail of old men following me.</li>
            <li> after wrapping then releasing the hair the next morning it was softer and more tame (ie manageable).</li>
            <li> The everyday rose conditioning hairdress didn&#x27;t work half as well for me.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair with fine strands prone to dryness and have had major issues with breakage in the past</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft and completely manageable, and I do not have to put anything else on it until maybe 2 nights later.</li>
            <li> My hair is 4B all natural; therefore this is the only product so far that loosens my curls along with adding shine with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> It goes on silky and, at least on my hair, soaks up fast so even if I do it right before bed, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it staining my pillowcase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent hair cream, not much different than the next brand in the store.</li>
            <li> I’ve used other products priced substantially less with similar or better results (I am texlaxed with hair somewhere in the 4 range).</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair, long, past my shoulders, and it&#x27;s fine or thin-textured.</li>
            <li> I was truly disappointed because Mizani has great ads.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put this product in my hair, the texture went from brittle, dry and frizzy to smooth and soft -seriously.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews but this product is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I normally wash and blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> First my hair smelled bad the next morning and on top of that, it wasn&#x27;t moisturized.</li>
            <li> Because of our bone dry climate, natural hair and especially permed or color treated</li>
            <li> Not worth the high price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 4a with super thick long hair</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair it generally gets dry and trashy.</li>
            <li> After wrapping my hair at night (Im African American) I usually moistuize it with this H2O Intense Treatment.</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning to natural and was looking for a product that would add moisture but on weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> flat ironed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negative people who judge other&#x27;s various and different home hair care regimens scares potential consumers away of buying from Mizani and</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for use on my dry relaxed, hair.  </li>
            <li> Softens my coarse dry hair.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m natural, the mineral oil is too heavy for regular use but it still works for when I decide to press out my hair.</li>
            <li> Folks with relaxed hair need to stay very far away from mineral oil and petro heavy products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with natural long Indian hair.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is coarse and I have a short cut I massage the H2 in every other day.</li>
            <li> but rather it just sits on top and makes the hair look dirty and greasy.</li>
            <li> One of the few things that keeps my natural hair hydrated</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m shocked there is even one bad one because this product is awesome especially for natural hair!</li>
            <li> This product is fairly expensive and I believed this to be a more \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; black hair care product.</li>
            <li> Use this every other night and you can extended the time between relaxer which will ultimately lead to healthier hair.  </li>
            <li> I can now just blow dry my hair and apply this to it at night.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder legnth and since using this product I have not had problems with spilt ends and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for dry scalp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deployed in Afghanistan and my hair is getting dry and bittle.  </li>
            <li> It is as if my dry, brittle hair has been hydrated.</li>
            <li> make my hair too dry idid not like it</li>
            <li> If you hair is not so dry all the time skip a day or use it as needed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse not to mention I went natural in the  ] driest of the dry Colorado.</li>
            <li> For those who don’t like oily products, I would say this one is not extremely oily but some may find it somewhat heavy on the strands</li>
            <li> I finally buckled down and made this purchase</li>
            <li> U only need a little &amp; it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who has thin or fine hair because it will be too thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> NO, REALLY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use when hair is wet after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I mean It leaves hair very oily, heavy and looking horrendous.  </li>
            <li> My hair and scalp are less dry.</li>
            <li> I only use a little like twice a week and it leaves hair bouncy and silky all week!</li>
            <li> I have really dry, thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> well, I can&#x27;t wait to see how the other products work.  </li>
            <li> In the morning you don&#x27;t have to worry about using oil sheen and other stuff.</li>
            <li> Use to prevent my hair from breaking due to dryness.  </li>
            <li> You make other women want to ask you what do you do to your hair?    </li>
            <li> After a few overnight applications, (don&#x27;t use a lot of product nightly or your hair will end up limp and oily the next day)</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t wake up to hard, crunchy hair the next morning because of it.</li>
            <li> The product is not absorbed by the hair or scalp.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say put a few drops in your hands and rub through your hair...don&#x27;t use this to roller set your hair and say it left your hair heavy?!?</li>
            <li> I worried it might weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> Will leave you hair hydrated and not weigh down hair..</li>
            <li> - that&#x27;ll keep moisture in when you lay down or do household</li>
            <li> She suses it on her edges to keep them down</li>
            <li> less breakage.</li>
            <li> I believe my hair has become softer and less damaged.</li>
            <li> Needless to say its now one of my main staples</li>
            <li> My hair is course and thick and very long.  </li>
            <li> used it on my child, it works well and less crying when brushing her hair</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I parted my hair and using a dab while braiding my hair in the morning I unbraided my hair applied a little oil</li>
            <li> I have the worst, most dry hair ever and this stuff works like a fairy godmother.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every other night, apply a leave-in conditioner, hair gloss, then a few drops of jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I even put a tiny little bit into my son&#x27;s curly, crazy hair (he is mixed) and it perfects it.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy.</li>
            <li> I have a few friends that use Mizani</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my hair has became so thin around my hairline, especially in the front and around my temple regions.</li>
            <li> , I find this is heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> price, one of the lowest on internet.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a few years, will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The downfall about this hair cream is the smell, no beautiful fragrance to it, If you have thick hair, all it will do is make it frizz up overnight, while it does leave it soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming at all like some reviews have said, and it keeps my hair in tip-top shape.</li>
            <li> I am sorry but this product did not work on my kinky coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased mizani products in the past.  </li>
            <li> Always makes my hair look better even on my worst day</li>
            <li> Not sure I see a small difference in just a weeks time on my edges.</li>
            <li> I did not love this product nor the smell.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell I say go for it,</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I cant imagine it would be a negative now.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, unruly, poofy curly hair and this product works wonders.</li>
            <li> I usually buy almost everything on amazon.com, but I wanted to try this out ASAP!</li>
            <li> /&gt;One author of a review is practically upset at other people because this treatment didn&#x27;t work for them, angry at some customers who wrote they had damaged hair and this product didn&#x27;t do wonders, agitated about another using this product with a roller set, vexed at one consumer who used this before going to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the same if you just put on coconut oil that has gone bad.</li>
            <li> But overall not an bad product.</li>
            <li> I thought about trying other products from this line but my experience with this product was so bad (had bad hair day for 2 days until I washed it again using my old</li>
            <li> The other two products ordered at the same time as this one, was absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Hate the feel of a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got my hands on a bad batch or</li>
            <li> yuck smells bad not sure  why everyone  is  </li>
            <li> -- unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped and I was discouraged.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the seller does not accept returns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s something wrong with those that don&#x27;t want to read directions and go by them.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about thus product</li>
            <li> so I was desperately in search of a product that wasn&#x27;t just greasy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are biracial,relaxed or whatever if your hair is in a bad shape don&#x27;t expect a miracle from no product....</li>
            <li> I hate to use a lot of heat in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I basically used this the one time and absolutely hated it!</li>
            <li> this product smells horrible and it´s just OIL.  </li>
            <li> I was very doubtful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Magical product.  I&#x27;m glad I found it</li>
            <li> Great product to repair seriously destroyed hair.  I bleached my hair four times and processed it an additional 4 times.  This product, completely restored and repaired my hair.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning to natural and was looking for a product that would add moisture but on weigh my hair down. This is it! This cream works on my relaxed and new growth. Its a nice consistency and its not greasy. I really like this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  It smells nice and it does the job. It doesn&#x27;t require much, just a quarter to fifty cent piece size.  The only negative is that it is expensive.  But I would still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nighttime treatment because I like to try new products and I wanted to see if it was better than my current system. I have relaxed hair, long, past my shoulders, and it&#x27;s fine or thin-textured. I usually wash my hair every other night, apply a leave-in conditioner, hair gloss, then a few drops of jojoba oil. Wrap or braid it and its ready the next morning. Instead of doing all that, I applied this product...BIG mistake. First my hair smelled bad the next morning and on top of that, it wasn&#x27;t moisturized. I was kinda greasy. This product is fairly expensive and I believed this to be a more \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; black hair care product. I should have read the ingredents list before purchase. In the first 4 or 5 ingredients, it lists \\&quot;water, mineral oil, and petroleum\\&quot;. These ingredients are very cheap. There is no reason for this product ot be so high in cost. You can always tell the quality of a product by reading the ingredients list. Those that are listed first are the ones that are most in abundance...when you get to the end of the list, those are at trace amounts. Folks with relaxed hair need to stay very far away from mineral oil and petro heavy products. The do not moisterize the hair but rather it just sits on top and makes the hair look dirty and greasy. I basically used this the one time and absolutely hated it! I thought about trying other products from this line but my experience with this product was so bad (had bad hair day for 2 days until I washed it again using my old system)I think I&#x27;ll stick to Nexxus, Design Essentials or KeraCare products.</li>
            <li> Great for damaged or just dry hair. Not to heavy. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel, not greasy.  Have been using now for 3wks. U only need a little &amp; it goes a long way. Will definitely reorder. I&#x27;m black with natural long Indian hair. Hate the feel of a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I heard it was a great way to add moisture to hair overnight. I&#x27;m not sure if I got my hands on a bad batch or what but I put it in on my hair and in the morning my hair felt good but my hair smelled like \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;. Hmmm lemme sseeeee....nice hair and smell like old lady or find something else..........hmmm...I think I&#x27;ll find something else. I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of other products that can give me the same results without my feeling like I&#x27;m going to have a trail of old men following me.</li>
            <li> I had been having problems with severe dryness and brittleness of my hair. I purchased this product because my hair dresser uses Mizani products on my hair. Well, with one use, my hair went from straw to soft, bouncy and shiny. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks in a week!</li>
            <li> I have a good friend who swears by Mizani, so I picked this up at my local Target to give it a try. I have relaxed hair with fine strands prone to dryness and have had major issues with breakage in the past so I am always in the market for good moisturizers that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down. This product is great. The first time I tried it, I applied it sparingly (dime-sized dollop) because it was so rich I worried it might weigh my hair down -- unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped and I was discouraged. I decided later in the week to use a little more at bedtime (nickel to quarter sized dollop), wrapped my hair, and the next morning my hair was supple and had great body -- salon-quality. Now I apply once a week  at bedtime after washing and blowdrying. My hair is shiny, healthy, and dependable -- I know exactly what it will be like every morning, which is well-worth the price IMO.</li>
            <li> I finally buckled down and made this purchase and Im happy that I did. After wrapping my hair at night (Im African American) I usually moistuize it with this H2O Intense Treatment. After unwrapping my hair the next morning my hair looks absoultely amazing..Its Shiny, healthy and has lots of volume. I love it!</li>
            <li> I began using this product because it was on sale at JCPenny and what can I say. It is the best moisturizer for african american hair. I hate to use a lot of heat in my hair.  I normally wash and blow dry and flat iron my hair onece a week. Talk about alot of heat. I can now just blow dry my hair and apply this to it at night. I wrap my hair and in the morning my hair looks as if I relaxed it, it has a beautiful shine, and it is not greasy. My hair is shoulder legnth and since using this product I have not had problems with spilt ends and dry hair. Use this every other night and you can extended the time between relaxer which will ultimately lead to healthier hair.  It is well worth $16</li>
            <li> I usually buy almost everything on amazon.com, but I wanted to try this out ASAP! Let me tell you! it has made a world of difference for my hair. I have all natural 4b/4c hair but I wear it blown out and flat ironed. Even though I go to a great stylist every two weeks I had started to notice a little breakage. The key here is to use it at night as directed. I put about a quarter amount on each night (making sure I don&#x27;t miss any areas, and especially in my kitchen) and then I put on a satin cap and then I wrap it with a scarf. My hair is so soft and hydrated in the morning! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> As always a favorite. This product leaves my hair shiny and manageable. I love this product and will continue to purchase it. I always keep on hand as a matter of fact. I really love it.</li>
            <li> this product smells horrible and it´s just OIL.  I mean It leaves hair very oily, heavy and looking horrendous.  It is the same if you just put on coconut oil that has gone bad.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hair products</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a lady from Brazil. I found it a bit pricy, however, I quickly learned it was worth it. My hair no longer appears lifeless between shampoos. I apply and brush the night or day before I plan to shampoo and my hair always looks shiny and healthy afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had my hair relaxed a month ago after wearing it consistently in a weave for an entire year, so I am very concerned about keeping it healthy, moisturized and keep it from breaking off. I have tried many different products because I feel like I am practically new to relaxed hair again, and this is a wonderful overnight moisturizer. My hair is shiny, soft and completely manageable, and I do not have to put anything else on it until maybe 2 nights later. The smell is not overwhelming at all like some reviews have said, and it keeps my hair in tip-top shape. It is kind of pricey, but a little bit goes a long way. I even put a tiny little bit into my son&#x27;s curly, crazy hair (he is mixed) and it perfects it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I only use Mizani products on my hair.  Since I started a year ago, My hair is healthier than it ever  has been.  I get many compliments on how silky it looks. The night-time H2O has really helped my 13 year old with hair breakage and split ends her hair is stronger/healthier.</li>
            <li> I am African American with colored ends. I was looking for a product that I could use to help me strengthen my ends. This product has done it for me. I wrap my hair at night and put on a silk scarf. I wake up in the morning and my ends are nicely moisturized. I have been using this for months now and my hair has seen great improvement! Love this product. I would definitely recommend any one with dry/damaged hair to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I use this on my hair before bed and when i wake up my hair is still shiny and bouncy. I don&#x27;t even have to add any product for that day until I&#x27;m going to bed again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! I only use a little like twice a week and it leaves hair bouncy and silky all week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and will for many more to come! It keeps my hair strong, moist, and managable.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for use on my dry relaxed, hair.  This treatment is great for the hair, but it made my scalp very itchy and flaky.  The product is not absorbed by the hair or scalp.  It flakes and it provides no moisture.  I would not recommend this product for dry scalp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have AA hair and this was a great way to help replenish my hair. I was using a hair lotion but along with it, my hair looks as healthy as before I was pregnant with any of my children. I simply had my hair in a  bun and my husband noticed and complemented me on how healthy my hair looked. If he noticed, I know it works. :)</li>
            <li> This creme is excellent for wrapping coarse and super thick hair at night!!! Will leave you hair hydrated and not weigh down hair.. Also, it has a lovely soft scent.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews but this product is worth it.  I&#x27;m deployed in Afghanistan and my hair is getting dry and bittle.  Last time I was here, I really felt my hair was matted when I returned home. I was determined this time to take better care of my hair.  My hair is course and thick and very long.  As soon as I put this product in my hair, the texture went from brittle, dry and frizzy to smooth and soft -seriously. I could not believe it. I have a few friends that use Mizani and now I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;m ordering all of their moisture products now. If the night-time treatment works this well, I can&#x27;t wait to see how the other products work.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> H2 intense works awesome on my hair, makes it feels so soft and light. Because my hair is coarse and I have a short cut I massage the H2 in every other day. It works great and I workout daily. It is as if my dry, brittle hair has been hydrated. I love it.</li>
            <li> I used this product regularly when I had a perm and it was s phenomenal thirst quencher once or twice a week at bedtime...after wrapping then releasing the hair the next morning it was softer and more tame (ie manageable). I haven&#x27;t used it since I&#x27;ve gone natural but am very tempted to reintroduce it to my collection...I cant imagine it would be a negative now. Anyway, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> hello the moisture that you get although the smell is offensive</li>
            <li> Overnight this makes a big difference. My hair and scalp are less dry.</li>
            <li> What would I do without this treatment? I do not necessarily use it at nights, but usually right before I rush out the door. My hair always looks healthy, bouncy and it certainly gives it body. I do not dare to use anything else. My hair is relaxed.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my hair has became so thin around my hairline, especially in the front and around my temple regions. It is so noticeable!!!! I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BUY ANOTHER MIZANI PRODUCT,EVER!</li>
            <li> I am sorry but this product did not work on my kinky coarse hair.  I will not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> make my hair too dry idid not like it</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this product.  I use after shampoo but before blow drying.  It is amazing and not heavy.</li>
            <li> Protects my new growth from breakage.</li>
            <li> I have purchased mizani products in the past.  However now that I am letting my relaxer grow out and going natural, I find this is heavy and greasy.  My children have mixed texture hair and they don&#x27;t like the feel of the product on their hair.  It does smell pleasant and has a nice consistency, but ... not really feeling it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, unruly, poofy curly hair and this product works wonders. I regularly relax my hair, but am still left with hair that poofs into a ball when it dries. I use this product almost daily in order to smooth my hair to a point where I can comb it straight (I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair.) It does its job without being greasy or too light.</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on my niece who told me it would work on severely damaged hair .. so I did it worked for me&lt;br /&gt;I parted my hair and using a dab while braiding my hair in the morning I unbraided my hair applied a little oil and I was&lt;br /&gt;good to go..the product made my hair soft and manageable it worked for me and the smell is a plus</li>
            <li> Started using this on my daughters hair to combat dryness. If used consistently with Mizani Supreme oil works wonders. Pleasant smell. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great product for those who hair is dry and frizzy!  I use this product at night and wrap my hair with a silk scarf.  I had to purchase the Mizani Iron curl cream because my hair is frizzy on my left side and silky straight on the right.  I like this product because I don&#x27;t have to use so much hair oil.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy unless you use to much.  Follow the directions exactly.  If you hair is not so dry all the time skip a day or use it as needed.  Try it and see if it works for you.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product because I felt that creams made my hair fizzy and unmanageable.  I was very doubtful but now I recommend it more than anything!</li>
            <li> This product is okay, being the first Mizani product I’ve ever tried. It’s nothing to write home about, especially considering its price. I’ve used other products priced substantially less with similar or better results (I am texlaxed with hair somewhere in the 4 range). The product is a lightweight cream with a pleasant smell. It combs through the hair easily and gives decent shine as well as provides manageability. I use it to roller set my hair at night to minimize frizz combined with gel for a stronger hold. For those who don’t like oily products, I would say this one is not extremely oily but some may find it somewhat heavy on the strands and I don&#x27;t recommend it for daily use.  I honestly don’t see how it is classified as an intense nighttime treatment as opposed to a hairdress crème. Personally, I won’t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me. I have relaxed, bi-racial hair that was breaking, shedding, and very dry/damaged and this product simply did nothing.</li>
            <li> This product works okay.  It is an oil based product.  It more oiled my hair more than moisturized it.  But overall not an bad product.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to love it so far. Feels stronger and more flexible...less breakage.</li>
            <li> Always makes my hair look better even on my worst day</li>
            <li> This product is great for dull, lifeless ethnic hair that tends to be dry, brittle and breaks easily. After a few overnight applications, (don&#x27;t use a lot of product nightly or your hair will end up limp and oily the next day) your hair will look shinier and healthier. Works best if a silk hair wrap is used overnight to allow product to work. Also works well on gray hair.</li>
            <li> This product is sitting in my cupboard unopened. The other two products ordered at the same time as this one, was absolutely terrible. Unfortunately, the seller does not accept returns. I won&#x27;t give this away to anyone I know, or even dislike for that matter. I was truly disappointed because Mizani has great ads.</li>
            <li> Not sure I see a small difference in just a weeks time on my edges. I will update u guys later.</li>
            <li> I did not see a change in my hair while using the product at night, it worked well as a leave in conditioner after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I did not love this product nor the smell. Great seller,  fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love the product. It arrived on time as promised. My hair feels so soft. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you have dry hair. I workout a lot so I needed some extra moisturizers. I put this on at night, and in the morning my hair is soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, its good without having to use a lot. In the morning you don&#x27;t have to worry about using oil sheen and other stuff. My hair is shiny, &amp; soft. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and you will get amazing results!!! I read these reviews and I&#x27;m shocked there is even one bad one because this product is awesome especially for natural hair! If you hair is over processed then don&#x27;t expect a miracle simple as that. You have to take care of your hair. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are biracial,relaxed or whatever if your hair is in a bad shape don&#x27;t expect a miracle from no product....that&#x27;s a problem only you can fix. The instructions say put a few drops in your hands and rub through your hair...don&#x27;t use this to roller set your hair and say it left your hair heavy?!? You used too much! Don&#x27;t use a handful before u go to work when it says use at night...don&#x27;t blame the product if you not going to use the instructions...simple as that! It&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product...it&#x27;s something wrong with those that don&#x27;t want to read directions and go by them.</li>
            <li> A friend was visiting from California and highly recommended this product for her beautiful hair care regime. I&#x27;m trying it now and looking forward to fantastic results.</li>
            <li> My stylist advised me to buy because I colored my hair.  Use to prevent my hair from breaking due to dryness.  It&#x27;s GREAT.  She said my hair looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for my hair. I have the worst, most dry hair ever and this stuff works like a fairy godmother.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time last night, ladies,we have a winner! My hair is thick and coarse not to mention I went natural in the  ] driest of the dry Colorado. Because of our bone dry climate, natural hair and especially permed or color treated hair breaks off in the weirdest places.    But after using MIZANI H2O INTENSE NIGHT-TIME TREATMENT, it is good to wake up in the morning, take off my satin bonnet and my hair is saying \\&quot;let&#x27;s go out and break some hearts, hurt some feelings, steal the show\\&quot; Yes mam, I will find somewhere to go to show this hair off. Trust me,  the fifteen dollars is worth the fifteen minutes of fame you get in compliments. (Like I got in church constantly) You make other women want to ask you what do you do to your hair?    You pay more than that for a set of nails when the first thing everyone sees is your lovely face and that hair that is softly framing it. That&#x27;s the Boo-yow right there.    they will think it&#x27;s a weave. NO, REALLY. NEVER play yourself cheap, you are your greatest asset so invest in YOU! Wear that hair gurl!    Can ya tell that I&#x27;m happy? LOL</li>
            <li> This Cream was great, i saturated my scalp with it and massaged my whole head, i was able to hold out on getting a relaxer for at least 2 weeks....i just wished it came in a bigger container.</li>
            <li> I use this product every 2-3 days.  It is a great night-time moistouirizer for my hair before I wash it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market I use this along with Aphogee and together it is dymo wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D. Peterson&lt;br /&gt;Houston, Texas</li>
            <li> Great Product for ethnic hair!</li>
            <li> When used consistently, this product really does work. I used to relax my hair and had a lot of breakage, but this, in combination with [[ASIN:B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Overnight Treatment, 3.4-Fluid Ounce]] was the only thing that stopped the breakage. Now that I&#x27;m natural, the mineral oil is too heavy for regular use but it still works for when I decide to press out my hair. It&#x27;s expensive, but worth the money. The everyday rose conditioning hairdress didn&#x27;t work half as well for me.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing.  Now that it&#x27;s winter I use it nightly to minimize the dryness!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Make sure you wash your hair weekly or twice a week because it is thick and can cause build up. Keeps my hair hydrated. Have been using for years now.</li>
            <li> A must have. and I&#x27;m spreading the word you must have this in your hair care product cabinet. It works miracles, keeps my hair soft and nourished</li>
            <li> One of the few things that keeps my natural hair hydrated</li>
            <li> very moisturizing, great smell, leaves hair feeling soft, shiny and does not need to be applied daily. my hair was overprocessed the last time i had it relaxed and this cream is helping it regain its body and bounce.</li>
            <li> Great product that helps immensely&lt;br /&gt;and smells wonderful! This product didn&#x27;t work for some; others didn&#x27;t like the smell and that&#x27;s okay. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Mizani product can be used at any time! I&#x27;ve used this during the day and at night - amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For first time users that is purchasing this nighttime treatment: start during the evening for the first few days, it will help greatly. Your hair will absorb the product  while you&#x27;re sleep and relaxed.  If you work 2nd/3rd shift/insomniac - apply in the morning/afternoon while you rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all means - DON&#x27;T restrict yourself to just using this at night for everyone&#x27;s schedules varies. If this works for your hair, but you&#x27;re not too keen about the fragrance, use a carrier souflee/oil/creame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to wear a silk/silk-like scarf, body heat heating/shower cap, or plastic bag (same difference, LOL) - that&#x27;ll keep moisture in when you lay down or do household chores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One author of a review is practically upset at other people because this treatment didn&#x27;t work for them, angry at some customers who wrote they had damaged hair and this product didn&#x27;t do wonders, agitated about another using this product with a roller set, vexed at one consumer who used this before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative people who judge other&#x27;s various and different home hair care regimens scares potential consumers away of buying from Mizani and Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE don&#x27;t let anyone deter you from trying this or any new product that you choose to spend your hard earned money on for what you feel is right for YOUR BEAUTIFUL HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mizani makes some of the BEST hair care products that&#x27;s lightweight, keeps moisture in the hair without being heavy and keeps hair of all textures from breaking off. I encourage to shop around for Mizani products, it&#x27;s a great line-up!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> This is a good product to put on your hair just before you get into the shower. The heat from the shower makes the product soak into yur scalp.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something less creamy and more hydrating.  I was thinking it might replace my regular routine of rosemary water and castor oil, however, it does not.</li>
            <li> product is ok but not for my hair</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been transitioning since Feb. 2012 and was having a lot of breakage due to dryness, so i purchased this product to see if i could stop the breakage without having to do the BIG CHOP and I must say my hair is stronger, has a healthy shine and is growing in the dry areas where the breakage had begun. I use this product maybe twice a week and I love it. I will be getting more :)</li>
            <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair and this keeps it straight after a good straightening and flat ironing. She suses it on her edges to keep them down and it doesn&#x27;t make it too greasy and she loves using it!</li>
            <li> I love what this hair strengthening Night-time treatment by Mizani does for my &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;-hair type.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is relaxed and color-treated. My hair has developed a noticeable strength. I always keep this product on hand and I make sure to re-order so that I do not run out of it. I also love the creamy consistency, it is blended perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product, it is Awesome!</li>
            <li> Mizani product is all I use. I use this product night and day.however you only need it a couple times a week or your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> It is light and leaves hair nice.  I use when hair is wet after shampooing.  Mizani products are good.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this after I was coerced into buying it from a friend. I use it once-twice a week after washing my hair and it works wonders on my split ends. Its a bit greasy if I put too much on, but when I put just enough on it leaves my hair feeling soft and full. Needless to say its now one of my main staples</li>
            <li> Hair is moisturized and strong after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transistioning to natural and like all transistioners, I started to experience breakage.  I purchased this product based on recommendations that I read online and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m a 4a with super thick long hair so I usually don&#x27;t sweat when my hair sheds; but once I stopped relaxing my hair, I started to see more breakage than usual.  After using a nickel amount of this product one night, I noticed about a 90% reduction in my breakage the very next day.  Between this product and my henna treatments, my transistion has been relatively easy.  In addition, after use, my hair is extremely soft.  For once, a product that meets all the hype!</li>
            <li> My hair has been super dry since moving to Texas so I was desperately in search of a product that wasn&#x27;t just greasy.  My search continues. This cream smells good but since the main ingredient is mineral oil it&#x27;s pretty much good old hair grease. Not worth the high price. My hair is dry and greasy. Still searching for some moisture in Texas</li>
            <li> I bought this to repair my damaged 4B type hair....this stuff is amazing! After ONE use my hair was so moisturized. My curls looked good and I didn&#x27;t wake up to hard, crunchy hair the next morning because of it. I&#x27;d suggest it to any and everyone. Go Mizani!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent hair cream, not much different than the next brand in the store. You&#x27;re only paying for the name. The downfall about this hair cream is the smell, no beautiful fragrance to it, If you have thick hair, all it will do is make it frizz up overnight, while it does leave it soft. If you can get past the smell I say go for it, if not it&#x27;s better to go with a product that you know will do the job and help your hair smell beautiful</li>
            <li> bought for a friend. She loves it</li>
            <li> yuck smells bad not sure  why everyone  is  giving  this great reviews didn&#x27;t do anything  but make hair feel heavy with oily build up. can get a  better product for less</li>
            <li> Very good.  Only Mizani product that seems to work with my hair.</li>
            <li> Softens my coarse dry hair. Works great.very good product.easy to use. Use once every two weeks over night.. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser warned me about over hydrating my fine oily hair. I heard such good reviews about this product, so I bought it even knowing it could possibly mess up my hair. I&#x27;ve had it several months now, and using it once or twice a week I believe my hair has become softer and less damaged. I use it at night and wash it out the next morning and haven&#x27;t noticed any more oil that normal even on days after the treatment. My hair really looks best on days after treating, so I may move up my treatments to three or four days a week if I get brave.</li>
            <li> I originally brought this product as a good leave in conditioner but it does a lot more.  My hair is 4B all natural; therefore this is the only product so far that loosens my curls along with adding shine with no greasy feel. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and silky. Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Also used it on my child, it works well and less crying when brushing her hair</li>
            <li> I like that I can put this on in the night and in the morning my hair feels light and hydrated without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Very good for your hair, stops the breaking.  Used it to before. Can&#x27;t wait to receive.</li>
            <li> I did not get to use this product as I had intended but gave it to a friend who loves it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about thus product but I gave it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did. When I wash my hair it generally gets dry and trashy. But after a night of this therapy my hair felt much softer.</li>
            <li> I really love this product it keeps the moisture in my hair thru out the day and smells good!</li>
            <li> wonderful light weight product no build up i would recommend this to all women will to maintain beautiful healthy hair</li>
            <li> Great for nighttime natural hair are regime. I have 4b hair and this product is great for my hair type. Smell did not bother me at all. You will have a I just got my hair done smell. Using this product daily will help your hair to be healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best overnight treament for AA hair. Prevents breakage and does not over moisturize so hair still has body.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, thick, coarse hair and I use this about twice a week. It goes on silky and, at least on my hair, soaks up fast so even if I do it right before bed, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it staining my pillowcase. I can see a noticeable difference the next day. And it smells pleasant, like I stepped out of a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who has thin or fine hair because it will be too thick and greasy. But for those with really thick, coarse hair, it works great.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so healthy and strong when this product is applied. It&#x27;s fragrance and weight  are wonderful for my thick hair!I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast ship.&lt;br /&gt;great price, one of the lowest on internet.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a few years, will continue to use it. I helps my hair become softer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone with all hair types and for thinning hair for treating your hair roots and keep the hair in good condition and healthy</li>
            <li> Great strengthening cream for damaged hair. I use it liberally on edges and throughout the scalp.  Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the Mizani line.</li>
            <li> Thanks for  stocking these products.</li>
