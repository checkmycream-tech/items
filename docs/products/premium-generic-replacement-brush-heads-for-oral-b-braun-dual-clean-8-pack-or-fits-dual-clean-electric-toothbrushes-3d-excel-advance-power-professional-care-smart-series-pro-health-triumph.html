            <li>great items and all prise with five stars!!!!</li>
            <li>I can not say that it is the best toothbrush in the world because I haven&#x27;t tried them all . . .</li>
            <li>Absolutely awesome quality and quantity.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly ... great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>These are excellent quality and just as good as the leading brand.  </li>
            <li>As good as the original!!!!</li>
            <li>Great value</li>
            <li>and it works great.  </li>
            <li>They are great quality</li>
            <li>Works really great</li>
            <li>and I am happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>These are a great value and work exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and perfectly fits my Oral-B 5000 Bluetooth toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and at such a good price!</li>
            <li>I use one for about 2 months honestly because i think they are better once they soften up quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Considering amount of money saved, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Not that I am complaining but a better marketing my be to sell a dozen at a time.</li>
            <li>The top bush quit rotating after the first/second time used.</li>
            <li>My wife still uses her Sonicare and is hesitant to use the Oral-B because we have so many heads for the Sonicare that she doesn&#x27;t want to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine liking one better.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find this refill since I can no longer get it on the retail shelf.</li>
            <li>buy more when available.</li>
            <li>Realy good product with fast delivery</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine by me, though.  </li>
            <li>and I liked them so much that when my first one &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; (after more than two years)</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Bristles harden quickly.  </li>
            <li>Economical and well worth price paid.</li>
            <li>However they had only had the replacement with the top part of the brush.  </li>
            <li>Will likely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>A bargain is always a gamble when you buy something for the first time.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and WELL worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>first thing that I had to learn is that you should pay attention to the red light on the toothbrush that indicates that you are applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I guess I had been applying too much pressure with my Sonicare as well</li>
            <li>Disappointed...doesn&#x27;t fit brush well, leaks mouth fluid into brush when brushing.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It just so happened that I had a dentist appointment the day that my second one &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; (here again it had lasted more than two years) and my dentist office had an Oral B Professional sitting on their counter that they were selling for $150.00.  </li>
            <li>love the Oral-B Professional and wish that I had found it before I bought my second Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Not built to as high a level of quality as the OEM version.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend these.</li>
            <li>I have used the double brush like this for some time and it cleans so much better than the single.</li>
            <li>This review is for a Oral-B Professional 5000 toothbrush . .</li>
            <li>and so I decided to save some money and buy an Oral-B Professional through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>any rate I have been using the Oral-B Professional for about 2 months</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t require any &#x27;break-in&#x27; period like others stated and the price is just a fraction of what Oral-B offers their replaceable brushes.</li>
            <li>These are what I have been searching High and low for at local stores.  </li>
            <li>and me being old may last me the rest of my life.  </li>

            <li> They are a little harsh at first</li>
            <li> However, the bristles are a bit stiff even though they are labeled soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid these break quite easily.</li>

            <li> If you are using a hard brush it can make your gums sore for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are much less expensive than the factory type but work well.</li>
            <li> Debating whether to return unused packets or to tough it out.  </li>
            <li> Awful.  </li>

            <li> Wow!!!! These Brush Heads are really great!</li>
            <li> Realy good product with fast delivery</li>
            <li> These are much less expensive than the factory type but work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid these break quite easily. I have gone through two in the last week when trying to get the back of my rear-most molars. It&#x27;s a tight squeeze to get the brush head back there and it seems that any amount of extra pressure breaks the small circular piece and it stops rotating. I&#x27;ve used the real Oral B brush heads for the last decade and not once has one of them failed like this. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> As good as the original!!!! Great value</li>
            <li> These are what I have been searching High and low for at local stores.  However they had only had the replacement with the top part of the brush.  I been using one now for about 2 weeks and it works great.  My only thought is 5 packs of 4  and me being old may last me the rest of my life.  Not that I am complaining but a better marketing my be to sell a dozen at a time. I have used the double brush like this for some time and it cleans so much better than the single.</li>
            <li> Not built to as high a level of quality as the OEM version.  They seem to be wearing faster.  The bristles seem noticeably firmer as well.  That&#x27;s fine by me, though.  Other than that, no complaints.  Considering amount of money saved, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the purchase.  Will likely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately 1 of the 4 brushes shed its bristles in my wife&#x27;s mouth the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> Great! Hope they last!</li>
            <li> Awful.  Don&#x27;t purchase.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The top bush quit rotating after the first/second time used.</li>
            <li> These are a great value and work exceptionally well.  If you&#x27;re needing to replace your Oral B toothbrush heads and don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a brand name product, definitely consider this option.</li>
            <li> great items and all prise with five stars!!!!</li>
            <li> I misunderstood what I was reviewing.  This review is for a Oral-B Professional 5000 toothbrush . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a big fan of Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes for years.  They are great quality and I liked them so much that when my first one &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; (after more than two years) I replaced it with another Sonicare. It just so happened that I had a dentist appointment the day that my second one &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; (here again it had lasted more than two years) and my dentist office had an Oral B Professional sitting on their counter that they were selling for $150.00.  I had just been given the news that I needed to go for a consultation with a Periodontist (not the fault of the Sonicare) and so I decided to save some money and buy an Oral-B Professional through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I had to learn is that you should pay attention to the red light on the toothbrush that indicates that you are applying too much pressure. There is a frowny face indication as well on the blue-tooth connected timer thing. I guess I had been applying too much pressure with my Sonicare as well but just didn&#x27;t know it.  If you are using a hard brush it can make your gums sore for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate I have been using the Oral-B Professional for about 2 months and I have to say that I am a big fan.  My wife still uses her Sonicare and is hesitant to use the Oral-B because we have so many heads for the Sonicare that she doesn&#x27;t want to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Oral-B Professional and wish that I had found it before I bought my second Sonicare.  I can not say that it is the best toothbrush in the world because I haven&#x27;t tried them all . . . but I can&#x27;t imagine liking one better.</li>
            <li> Disappointed...doesn&#x27;t fit brush well, leaks mouth fluid into brush when brushing.  Bristles harden quickly.  Debating whether to return unused packets or to tough it out.  Never again.  A bargain is always a gamble when you buy something for the first time.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly ... great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more when available.</li>
            <li> The brushes work just finel</li>
            <li> These are bulkier and a little bigger than the originals.</li>
            <li> Economical and well worth price paid.</li>
            <li> These are excellent quality and just as good as the leading brand.  Much cheaper and WELL worth the price.  I will definitely be purchasing these from now on. I HIGHLY recommend these.</li>
            <li> I was looking for replacement heads for my Oral B 9000. My search led me to this product.  I ordered and promptly received the order. As others have stated, the are a bit stiffer than the Oral B brand. But, I do not find that objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this refill since I can no longer get it on the retail shelf. However, the bristles are a bit stiff even though they are labeled soft.</li>
            <li> They are a little harsh at first but you get used to them and they soften up. I use one for about 2 months honestly because i think they are better once they soften up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Works really great and I am happy with my purchase.  My only negative is that the users manual is difficult to use and changing settings is not well explained.</li>
            <li> Received product as described shortly after ordered.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome quality and quantity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and at such a good price! Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and perfectly fits my Oral-B 5000 Bluetooth toothbrush. Didn&#x27;t require any &#x27;break-in&#x27; period like others stated and the price is just a fraction of what Oral-B offers their replaceable brushes. My teeth are worked double-time with the two brushes and will continue ordering these in the future.</li>
