            <li> Good price fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Gelish system and love their products.  A large array of colors to chose from.  Will def be purchasing more :)</li>
            <li> No more salons!  I&#x27;ve been able to let my own nails grow and do them myself with this polish and the light!  I&#x27;m saving so much money and my nails are finally healthy.  It lasts about 2 weeks before needing to paint them again and stays shiney! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice but the white is a little thick and not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working only for couple days ðŸ˜–</li>
            <li> What I liked about this product was it was easy to use, love the brush it&#x27;s round square which made it easier when you doing your own nails.</li>
            <li> this product also has come to my house damaged, I think that transport the merchandise I take things very abruptly and so damaged, I demand the return of my money. 3rd is the product that I have problems</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t express how much I hated this product.&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t give me everything I needed to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Even with my gel lightâ€¦It didn&#x27;t come out right.  And I always do good nails.</li>
            <li> love gelish products and this French manicure set is not exception. Just enough tint for under the white tips or to do without the white tips.</li>
            <li> Works well. Would not soak off. Had to leave some of the white on and do a color over it.  Other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> just like the manicure at the salons!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and stays on for two to three weeks!</li>
            <li> I love my new gel polish in French Manicure.  It looks so good and is pretty easy to use.  Be warned though, the white kind of shrinks as it dries.</li>
            <li> These polishes are amazing. I am on day 5 and it is not close to chipping. If you are looking for something cheap but classy this is it.</li>
            <li> Excellent white for manicures.  Pink color is actually almost totally clear, that was a little misleading by the bottle photo. Overall, no issues - good product.</li>
            <li> I chose 4 stars because the simply sheer color was very misrepresented in the picture. It looks like a pinkish tan color but in person it is more of a clear coat with a hint of pink. The nail polishes themselves are very nice, i love the thickness of this gel polish. It ened up lasting for a week, im sure it wouldve lasted longer but i dont baby my nails at all...Overall a good product and id deffinetly recomend.</li>
            <li> After 3 years of having my nails done, to save money I purchased all the tools necessary to do my nails myself. I have always been pleased with the Gelish brand the nails salon use so I stayed with it for home use.  My friends are very impressed when they see I do my own french manicure gels as they look as good and stay on as long as the salon.  I do miss Bea, my nail tech, but love saving money.</li>
