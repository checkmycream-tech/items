            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li>My tooth looks awesome following a good swish with and a vigorous brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice being able to purchase this as a pack of 2 so that it doesn&#x27;t have to be reordered every month.  </li>
            <li>I verified with my son&#x27;s dentist that it was ok for him to use and the dentist noted my son&#x27;s teeth were cleaner after he started to use it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased with how it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I was able to pull \\&quot;strings\\&quot; of what looked like a mix of mucus membranes and product residue from my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years already now and can&#x27;t do without it.  </li>
            <li>Even when we go overseas we make sure we take a couple of bottles with us.  </li>
            <li>So refreshing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mouthwash</li>
            <li>Listerine has discontinued this product so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>better mouth wash cheaper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;s favorite mouth wash</li>
            <li>Much better and easier that whitening strips.</li>
            <li>more you use it, the whiter your teeth become.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really and truly a great product line.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and I was very pleased to discover it on amazon, as it is always sold out locally.</li>
            <li>quit again 5 months ago, this time for good, so 3 weeks ago I bought a bottle and use it exactly as directed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my experience so far isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was finally able to move out, and I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>But I really think this is a super great product.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s more eco friendly from soaphope.  </li>
            <li>The taste leaves a bit to be desired-it&#x27;s more clean mint with a hint of battery acid</li>
            <li>He now recommends it to all of his patients and he&#x27;s not one to recommend a product lightly.</li>
            <li>and My teeth look freaking fantastic.</li>
            <li>The ingredient details list hydrogen peroxide as the primary whitening agent.</li>
            <li>I called the toll free number shown on the label because I wanted to know where the product was made.  </li>
            <li>I love the feeling of the pre-rinse that gets kind of foamy and bubbly in the mouth before you brush your teeth and rinse it out, versus the burning and more liquidy feeling of the regular post-brushing rinse.</li>
            <li>But the more I used it, the more I noticed that this product is really the cause for</li>
            <li>Absolutely TEN stars.. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>First off Listerine offers great products and even though this is a whitening product, it also freshens your breath.</li>
            <li>&quot; I couldn&#x27;t help but smile!</li>
            <li>I especially love that this product is not overwhelming in taste.  </li>
            <li>whitens and leaves my mouth feeling squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Works great and no peeling or dry mouth.</li>
            <li>It maintains the properties of a mouthwash, and my teeth did feel clean with prolonged use (along with brushing and flossing).</li>
            <li>Her teeth are the most beautiful natural white color.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this highly, because although the whitening is gradual, it is very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>I got my first really great report after using it for several months.  </li>
            <li>After dispensing the recommended amount (as per the bottle&#x27;s instructions -- 60ml or about 3/4 of a cap full of liquid), I swished the rinse for about 60 seconds before emptying my mouth of the rinse.</li>
            <li>I use this just before I brush, then after brushing I use cool mint listerine.  </li>
            <li>I had no bad breath, Even after hours of using the product.</li>
            <li>The taste of this is actually not bad compared to whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I am clean and minty fresh plus my teeth are bright and white.</li>
            <li>much higher now!</li>
            <li>It does whiten your teeth and clean your mouth pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Quite pleased, so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dental bleaching products before (from my dentist), and it is far easier to use the Listerine pre-brush rinse each day (and I think it&#x27;s better than Crest&#x27;s product as well).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny..</li>
            <li>(No I do not have braces, yet, but I figured I would try to brighten my smile before they get put on.)</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It kept me fresh until lunch time.</li>
            <li>I rarely review items....</li>
            <li>Some of the rinses are so &amp;#34;zingy&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t like that feeling, but this product is just right.</li>
            <li>sets my whole m08th tinglingly clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great luck with Crest Whitestrips, in the past so I don&#x27;t need this product.</li>
            <li>This product is great to maintain white teeth especially if you drink coffee or beverages that stain your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the first time I used this it made my teeth squeak and chatter.</li>
            <li>I suspect that a part of his improvement is that he&#x27;s now really scrubbing his teeth to get the flavor out as he&#x27;s not a fan of the minty flavor, but his teeth are cleaner!  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it any more hideous than regular listerine.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes your toothpaste extra foamy, and sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product before when it first came out a couple years ago</li>
            <li>I did not have this issue the first time I used it, and I used it for a longer period of time than this time around.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Really helps with gum health &amp; whitening!</li>
            <li>many people experience on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was just a coincidence that I didn&#x27;t get the morning breath after the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 and my teeth look better than they did in my 20s, and I&#x27;ve gotten a number of compliments specifically on how white they are since I started using this.  </li>
            <li>It does make the mouth feel clean and fresh, but so far haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement on the whitening side.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the foaming action is helping to loosen the plaque - we will see at my next dental apt.  </li>
            <li>He recommended this Listerine Pre-Rinse to me at my last visit, saying that even his smoking patients had good reports after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, simply put:  </li>
            <li>This stuff simply works - and easy.</li>
            <li>Accentuates the dentist&#x27;s orders for perfectly white, strong teeth.</li>
            <li>The rinse had a slightly pungent taste (which is most likely from the peroxide), but was not offensive or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I had these real looking fangs to wear, but I didn&#x27;t get a chance to celebrate that year...</li>
            <li>I really like the result of using the whole bottle</li>
            <li>and it really helped, but needed whitening.</li>
            <li>It used to be available at local stores for about $6.00.  </li>
            <li>it really does help me get rid of the \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice taste, After about a week of using this mouth wash everyday</li>
            <li>However, the unexpected side-effects were slightly overwhelming, and they contributed to an overall feeling on dissatisfaction with the product.</li>
            <li>I think the taste is fine - not the super intense of some, and I only noticed the white stringy things, that some have mentioned, once.  </li>
            <li>Just adds that extra bit of clean.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;re going to pay nearly $30 and wait 3 months to see the kind of results you&#x27;d get from using Crest Whitestrips for less than a week.</li>
            <li>It feels so cool and obviously, works!</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is not bad.</li>
            <li>further inspection I noticed the spots most sensitive on my tongue have no taste buds -- it&#x27;s completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure what to make of this, but I&#x27;m for sure not using this product again, which is really sad because it does work so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after using this stuff simply for the bubbly sensation and the super slick/amooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a whole environment of bacteria that are supposed to stay alive because they digest food and kill off infection, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste, Powerful Mint Gel, 4.2-Ounce]]</li>
            <li>The product did perform its intended function, and I did have a whiter smile after using the product for several weeks.</li>
            <li>I only take a very small sip, swish for a good  minute or so, and then leave in my mouth while I take a shower or put on my makeup, etc - to give it a little more time.  </li>
            <li>This product is very much like the total mouthwash.</li>
            <li>If you are afraid of the burning and such you can always try the old fashioned way of mixing baking soda with hydrogen peroxide into a pasty consistency and brush with that (its cheaper and to the best of my knowledge</li>
            <li>Not only that, for the next several hours, the entire inside of my mouth and tongue felt kind of swollen.  </li>
            <li>Most people are more familiar with the post rinse mouthwash but when a family member bought this product by accident, we were a little skeptical as to the benefits of rinsing our mouth with a mouthwash prior to brushing our teeth.</li>
            <li>Unlike other mouth washes including [[ASIN:B001KYS1D8 LISTERINE Multi Action Whitening Rinse, Clean Mint 32 fl oz (946 ml)]]</li>
            <li>For several hours after completing my brush routine, the top lair of my mouth and gum line began to shed slightly.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t confirm the whitening - but really don&#x27;t think any rinse can do much when it&#x27;s in contact with the teeth for such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>and I also have my 10 year old son using it twice a day to improve the quality of his brushing.  </li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to this rinse as the baking soda/hydrogen peroxide mix will make your brushing far foamer, but my teeth feel cleaner after using it.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t make your teeth sensitive)</li>
            <li>Some people think I get them whiten professionally, even my dentist and hygienist comment on my teeth.</li>
            <li>but since I resumed using the product my tongue has been getting increasingly sensitive (now to the point of pain)and</li>
            <li>Once my routine was complete, I noticed that my teeth appeared to have a filmy residue on the surface, which was thought to be residue from the rinse.</li>
            <li>I can really see the difference with daily use.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this locally anymore and really like this pre-rinse as part of my routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had positive feedback like that before and the only thing that&#x27;s different is my use of this product.</li>
            <li>I should probably add that I never held it in my mouth as long as suggested, often used it after I brushed (when it stings more) rather than before, and probably used it an average of three/four times a day (1-2x without brushing at all).  </li>
            <li>Only thing is that we normally buy it at local Walmart store; but, however, lately, we do not find this: Pre-Brush one.  </li>
            <li>The rinse maintains a distinct, peroxide-like smell, and seems to be a bit thicker than a typical, non-whitening mouthwash.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;There has been no other product I&#x27;ve used before that would get rid of the morning</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to rinsing BEFORE brushing and flossing, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I did not have a dentist appointment scheduled during the use of this product, and I am unable to validate my own anecdotal experience.   </li>
            <li>My teeth have become slightly sensitive again, not that much but a little.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first Listerine product, or any other mouthwash product for that matter, that I need to use prior to actually brushing my teeth!</li>
            <li>The overall process was very similar to using standard mouthwash, but with extra foaming action involved.   </li>
            <li>No long lasting residual taste.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> &quot; I couldn&#x27;t help but smile!</li>
            <li> I especially love that this product is not overwhelming in taste.  </li>
            <li> whitens and leaves my mouth feeling squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> Works great and no peeling or dry mouth.</li>
            <li> It maintains the properties of a mouthwash, and my teeth did feel clean with prolonged use (along with brushing and flossing).</li>
            <li> Her teeth are the most beautiful natural white color.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this highly, because although the whitening is gradual, it is very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I got my first really great report after using it for several months.  </li>
            <li> After dispensing the recommended amount (as per the bottle&#x27;s instructions -- 60ml or about 3/4 of a cap full of liquid), I swished the rinse for about 60 seconds before emptying my mouth of the rinse.</li>
            <li> I use this just before I brush, then after brushing I use cool mint listerine.  </li>
            <li> I had no bad breath, Even after hours of using the product.</li>
            <li> The taste of this is actually not bad compared to whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I am clean and minty fresh plus my teeth are bright and white.</li>
            <li> much higher now!</li>
            <li> It does whiten your teeth and clean your mouth pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Quite pleased, so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dental bleaching products before (from my dentist), and it is far easier to use the Listerine pre-brush rinse each day (and I think it&#x27;s better than Crest&#x27;s product as well).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny..</li>
            <li> (No I do not have braces, yet, but I figured I would try to brighten my smile before they get put on.)</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It kept me fresh until lunch time.</li>
            <li> I rarely review items....</li>
            <li> Some of the rinses are so &amp;#34;zingy&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t like that feeling, but this product is just right.</li>
            <li> sets my whole m08th tinglingly clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great luck with Crest Whitestrips, in the past so I don&#x27;t need this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great to maintain white teeth especially if you drink coffee or beverages that stain your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the first time I used this it made my teeth squeak and chatter.</li>
            <li> I suspect that a part of his improvement is that he&#x27;s now really scrubbing his teeth to get the flavor out as he&#x27;s not a fan of the minty flavor, but his teeth are cleaner!  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it any more hideous than regular listerine.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes your toothpaste extra foamy, and sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product before when it first came out a couple years ago</li>
            <li> I did not have this issue the first time I used it, and I used it for a longer period of time than this time around.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Really helps with gum health &amp; whitening!</li>
            <li> many people experience on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was just a coincidence that I didn&#x27;t get the morning breath after the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 and my teeth look better than they did in my 20s, and I&#x27;ve gotten a number of compliments specifically on how white they are since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> It does make the mouth feel clean and fresh, but so far haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement on the whitening side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the foaming action is helping to loosen the plaque - we will see at my next dental apt.  </li>
            <li> He recommended this Listerine Pre-Rinse to me at my last visit, saying that even his smoking patients had good reports after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, simply put:  </li>
            <li> This stuff simply works - and easy.</li>
            <li> Accentuates the dentist&#x27;s orders for perfectly white, strong teeth.</li>
            <li> The rinse had a slightly pungent taste (which is most likely from the peroxide), but was not offensive or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I had these real looking fangs to wear, but I didn&#x27;t get a chance to celebrate that year...</li>
            <li> I really like the result of using the whole bottle</li>
            <li> and it really helped, but needed whitening.</li>
            <li> It used to be available at local stores for about $6.00.  </li>
            <li> it really does help me get rid of the \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice taste, After about a week of using this mouth wash everyday</li>
            <li> However, the unexpected side-effects were slightly overwhelming, and they contributed to an overall feeling on dissatisfaction with the product.</li>
            <li> I think the taste is fine - not the super intense of some, and I only noticed the white stringy things, that some have mentioned, once.  </li>
            <li> Just adds that extra bit of clean.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re going to pay nearly $30 and wait 3 months to see the kind of results you&#x27;d get from using Crest Whitestrips for less than a week.</li>
            <li> It feels so cool and obviously, works!</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is not bad.</li>
            <li> further inspection I noticed the spots most sensitive on my tongue have no taste buds -- it&#x27;s completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure what to make of this, but I&#x27;m for sure not using this product again, which is really sad because it does work so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after using this stuff simply for the bubbly sensation and the super slick/amooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a whole environment of bacteria that are supposed to stay alive because they digest food and kill off infection, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste, Powerful Mint Gel, 4.2-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> The product did perform its intended function, and I did have a whiter smile after using the product for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I only take a very small sip, swish for a good  minute or so, and then leave in my mouth while I take a shower or put on my makeup, etc - to give it a little more time.  </li>
            <li> This product is very much like the total mouthwash.</li>
            <li> If you are afraid of the burning and such you can always try the old fashioned way of mixing baking soda with hydrogen peroxide into a pasty consistency and brush with that (its cheaper and to the best of my knowledge</li>
            <li> Not only that, for the next several hours, the entire inside of my mouth and tongue felt kind of swollen.  </li>
            <li> Most people are more familiar with the post rinse mouthwash but when a family member bought this product by accident, we were a little skeptical as to the benefits of rinsing our mouth with a mouthwash prior to brushing our teeth.</li>
            <li> Unlike other mouth washes including [[ASIN:B001KYS1D8 LISTERINE Multi Action Whitening Rinse, Clean Mint 32 fl oz (946 ml)]]</li>
            <li> For several hours after completing my brush routine, the top lair of my mouth and gum line began to shed slightly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t confirm the whitening - but really don&#x27;t think any rinse can do much when it&#x27;s in contact with the teeth for such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> and I also have my 10 year old son using it twice a day to improve the quality of his brushing.  </li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to this rinse as the baking soda/hydrogen peroxide mix will make your brushing far foamer, but my teeth feel cleaner after using it.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t make your teeth sensitive)</li>
            <li> Some people think I get them whiten professionally, even my dentist and hygienist comment on my teeth.</li>
            <li> but since I resumed using the product my tongue has been getting increasingly sensitive (now to the point of pain)and</li>
            <li> Once my routine was complete, I noticed that my teeth appeared to have a filmy residue on the surface, which was thought to be residue from the rinse.</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference with daily use.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this locally anymore and really like this pre-rinse as part of my routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had positive feedback like that before and the only thing that&#x27;s different is my use of this product.</li>
            <li> I should probably add that I never held it in my mouth as long as suggested, often used it after I brushed (when it stings more) rather than before, and probably used it an average of three/four times a day (1-2x without brushing at all).  </li>
            <li> Only thing is that we normally buy it at local Walmart store; but, however, lately, we do not find this: Pre-Brush one.  </li>
            <li> The rinse maintains a distinct, peroxide-like smell, and seems to be a bit thicker than a typical, non-whitening mouthwash.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;There has been no other product I&#x27;ve used before that would get rid of the morning</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to rinsing BEFORE brushing and flossing, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I did not have a dentist appointment scheduled during the use of this product, and I am unable to validate my own anecdotal experience.   </li>
            <li> My teeth have become slightly sensitive again, not that much but a little.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first Listerine product, or any other mouthwash product for that matter, that I need to use prior to actually brushing my teeth!</li>
            <li> The overall process was very similar to using standard mouthwash, but with extra foaming action involved.   </li>
            <li> No long lasting residual taste.</li>
            <li> Keeps teeth clean and doesn&#x27;t allow the discolor to get worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I also experienced this \\&quot;mouth shedding\\&quot; during the entire time that I used this product that became progressively worse with continued use.</li>
            <li> especially since I bought enough bottles of this to last me for an extended period of time in an area where products like this are not readily available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other whiteners have never worked for me, especially those gel things, which are really gross.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Crest 3d white as a pre-brush whitening rinse, then I brush with Colgate sensitive enamel protect, then I use Act.</li>
            <li> But not nearly as much as the man that cut me off mid sentence asking \\&quot;How&#x27;d</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of your time and money.</li>
            <li> I finally figured out dry mouth due to meds</li>
            <li> I knew this wouldn&#x27;t be easy because 30 seconds with regular Listerine is bad enough.  </li>
            <li> I started using Biotene dry mouth toothpaste and mouthwash</li>
            <li> B002KAOAZ4 Biotene Dry Mouth Mouthwash, 33.8 Bottle]]</li>
            <li> I have to say after buying JUST the PRE brush rinse, I can tell you I saw a noticeable difference, and my teeth actually looked several shades lighter, in just a few days!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the whitening, but no new staining since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> This actually whitens your teeth by a little, but is kind of annoying because there is always like goo in your mouth like couple hours later or like</li>
            <li> If you just take 30 seconds to slosh it around your mouth, when you get rid of it, you can actually look in the mirror and see and feel all the bubbles working to break down your tarter and discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m curious to know how someones mouth burns with the stuff)  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really paying close attention about the whitening aspect of this because I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed again, but all of a sudden, after about 3 months of using this daily, my teeth are WHITE!  </li>
            <li> I did not experience a reduction in the ability to taste food items, but I did have a slight metallic after taste in my mouth for a few hours following use.   </li>
            <li> Have never had to use any other whitening product.</li>
            <li> It  does help maintain where you&#x27;re at if you do whiten your teeth using other methods.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune at my periodontist&#x27;s office to keep my bad gums healthy in the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> I also felt a slight tingling sensation throughout my tongue.</li>
            <li> I think I will go back to the regular non-whiten mouth wash that is less expensive.</li>
            <li> (sometimes have to spit a little out because of expansion.)  </li>
            <li> But a little story: Holloween of &#x27;08</li>
            <li> even got little cut or blister (I don’t know what it is</li>
            <li> I had trouble with all the whiteners causing peeling, etc.</li>
            <li> This product works great....if you pre-rinse everyday for 1 minute...you will see a change in the color of your teeth within a few months.  </li>
            <li> Used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not supposed to STAY in your mouth, you are supposed to use it BEFORE you brush, as opposed to the usual way you use Listerine (AFTER you brush).  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why FDA approved it.&lt;br /&gt;Every after you use this, membrane of cheek and gum falls off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I totally suspected this product would be detrimental when I bought it, but I went ahead and experimented with it (stupid human risk taking type thinking).</li>
            <li> Even though my gums usually bleed like crazy from such neglect, they haven&#x27;t since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t clear out the lungs, too!</li>
            <li> I guess some people who do not know how to use it must have complained about burning mouth and what not; I haven&#x27;t had this problem.</li>
            <li> To say the least, this product rocks and there is one reason why:</li>
            <li> Not that Snow White artificial color you see so often.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained about the burning sensation and/or how long it supposedly takes, but my experience has been that it worked noticeably within a few weeks (my teeth weren&#x27;t that bad to begin with, though) and that the stinging sensation faded after a while.  </li>
            <li> It actually isn&#x27;t bad because this only happens at times, not always.</li>
            <li> Not good for your gums.</li>
            <li> I hated to waste the money, but I poured it down the drain.  </li>
            <li> The rinse did begin foaming heavily, and this did become unpleasant after about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> it was so bad that the smoke hung heavily in the air all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot of reviewers are slamming those with issues saying that if you encounter these issues, there&#x27;s something wrong with the user&#x27;s oral hygiene, but before I started using this again I had a orthodontic referral appointment and dental checkup/cleaning.</li>
            <li> Want to hear something weird?  </li>
            <li> This product is dangerous.</li>
            <li> This was an unpleasant side-effect, and it intensified as the day went on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed...</li>
            <li> to wake up now in the morning without having to wonder how bad your breath smells like!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t confirm the whitening - but really don&#x27;t think any rinse can do much when it&#x27;s in contact with the teeth for such a short period of time.  I use a whitening toothpaste - but figure it couldn&#x27;t hurt to use this also.  This product contains peroxide - thus it will foam / expand.  I only take a very small sip, swish for a good  minute or so, and then leave in my mouth while I take a shower or put on my makeup, etc - to give it a little more time.  (sometimes have to spit a little out because of expansion.)  Then brush &amp; rinse - thoroughly. I think the taste is fine - not the super intense of some, and I only noticed the white stringy things, that some have mentioned, once.  I&#x27;m hoping the foaming action is helping to loosen the plaque - we will see at my next dental apt.  Quite pleased, so far.</li>
            <li> I concur with the 1-star reviews here. I totally suspected this product would be detrimental when I bought it, but I went ahead and experimented with it (stupid human risk taking type thinking). I noticed the first time I used this it made my teeth squeak and chatter. I don&#x27;t like that feeling.</li>
            <li> Unlike other mouth washes including [[ASIN:B001KYS1D8 LISTERINE Multi Action Whitening Rinse, Clean Mint 32 fl oz (946 ml)]] the Listerine Pre-Brush Rinse is supposed to be used BEFORE you brush your teeth.  I agree that others likely didn&#x27;t read the directions, causing the problems they reported.  I&#x27;ve used this for well over a year, have noticed my teeth have been whiter and I also have my 10 year old son using it twice a day to improve the quality of his brushing.  I verified with my son&#x27;s dentist that it was ok for him to use and the dentist noted my son&#x27;s teeth were cleaner after he started to use it.  I suspect that a part of his improvement is that he&#x27;s now really scrubbing his teeth to get the flavor out as he&#x27;s not a fan of the minty flavor, but his teeth are cleaner!  It takes some getting used to this rinse as the baking soda/hydrogen peroxide mix will make your brushing far foamer, but my teeth feel cleaner after using it.  I&#x27;ve used dental bleaching products before (from my dentist), and it is far easier to use the Listerine pre-brush rinse each day (and I think it&#x27;s better than Crest&#x27;s product as well).</li>
            <li> Just gonna say, I didn&#x27;t origionally buy this through Amazon (I&#x27;m about to since they don&#x27;t sell it in my current area). But a little story: Holloween of &#x27;08 I had these real looking fangs to wear, but I didn&#x27;t get a chance to celebrate that year...work and such. I had gotten a perfect off-white match like teeth are. But after using this stuff simply for the bubbly sensation and the super slick/amooth feeling my teeth were left with.    Well the following year, October rolls around and the natural-like fangs were noticibly too yellow to blend with my teeth! Since using this product, I&#x27;ve been getting good exams from my dentist. That meant alot to me. But not nearly as much as the man that cut me off mid sentence asking \\&quot;How&#x27;d you get you teeth so white?\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t help but smile! This was this summer actually!    So, this stuff...good stuff with regular use. Every morning, I use it even before breakfast. No long lasting residual taste. (Perhaps that&#x27;s the toothpaste? I use [[ASIN:B003V01050 Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste, Powerful Mint Gel, 4.2-Ounce]] as well.) Also use it every day after I may have eaten or drank something staining like coffee or coke. It feels so cool and obviously, works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not supposed to STAY in your mouth, you are supposed to use it BEFORE you brush, as opposed to the usual way you use Listerine (AFTER you brush).  So I&#x27;m wondering if all these comments about burning mouth, etc., were because they didn&#x27;t use it properly.  I&#x27;m very happy with it, been using it a year, no problems, teeth are whier.</li>
            <li> After a week of use I notice my teeth are whiter and I&#x27;m really pleased with how it&#x27;s working. The taste leaves a bit to be desired-it&#x27;s more clean mint with a hint of battery acid but I don&#x27;t find it any more hideous than regular listerine. All in all can&#x27;t beat the results for the price!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying: I&#x27;ve never had it burn my mouth, I&#x27;ve never had it make my mouth peel, and I&#x27;ve never had it cause any swelling. It does have alcohol in it (8% according to the label on the one i have now) but the whitening comes from the hydrogen peroxide. (I&#x27;m curious to know how someones mouth burns with the stuff)  You rinse your mouth out with it BEFORE you brush and it seems to work for me.  If you are afraid of the burning and such you can always try the old fashioned way of mixing baking soda with hydrogen peroxide into a pasty consistency and brush with that (its cheaper and to the best of my knowledge won&#x27;t make your teeth sensitive)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pre-brush rinse for over a year. It has been a turbulent year, and I&#x27;ve slacked off on the flossing. Even though my gums usually bleed like crazy from such neglect, they haven&#x27;t since I&#x27;ve been using this. My dental hygienist said she couldn&#x27;t even tell I hadn&#x27;t been flossing. I&#x27;ve never had positive feedback like that before and the only thing that&#x27;s different is my use of this product. I love the way it makes your toothpaste extra foamy, and sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry I skip the toothpaste entirely and just use the residual bubbles left after using this rinse. I will keep buying it regardless of the price. Don&#x27;t know about the whitening, but no new staining since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> On the back of the battle in tiny print you will see a notice saying that you MIGHT see results after using 3 bottles of this stuff. One bottle should last you a month even if you use it twice a day. So you&#x27;re going to pay nearly $30 and wait 3 months to see the kind of results you&#x27;d get from using Crest Whitestrips for less than a week. This product is a complete waste of your time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  whitens and leaves my mouth feeling squeaky clean.  I get a lot of compliments on my white teeth.  Some people think I get them whiten professionally, even my dentist and hygienist comment on my teeth. Love it!</li>
            <li> Accentuates the dentist&#x27;s orders for perfectly white, strong teeth. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune at my periodontist&#x27;s office to keep my bad gums healthy in the past 15 years. I go every 3 months for a deep cleaning. He recommended this Listerine Pre-Rinse to me at my last visit, saying that even his smoking patients had good reports after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, simply put:  it works!!  It took a little getting used to rinsing BEFORE brushing and flossing, but it was worth it.  I got my first really great report after using it for several months.  He asked me what I&#x27;d been doing because my gums were in great shape and I told him I&#x27;d been using this rinse.  He now recommends it to all of his patients and he&#x27;s not one to recommend a product lightly. He said it actually dissolves plaque before it attaches itself to your teeth.  I&#x27;d give this product ten stars if I could.</li>
            <li> It does as it says: It kills bad-breath Germs, and whites teeth. It has a nice taste, After about a week of using this mouth wash everyday I had no bad breath, Even after hours of using the product. I really like the result of using the whole bottle, I&#x27;ve got through about six bottles of it..and My teeth look freaking fantastic. It&#x27;s worth every penny..Trust me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> It makes your gums fall piece by piece and you don&#x27;t even notice. Not good for your gums.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I was very pleased to discover it on amazon, as it is always sold out locally.</li>
            <li> This ad is for 2 prebush rinse I received 1 prebush and 1 mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this whitens.  The directions say to rinse your mouth with this for 60 seconds.  I knew this wouldn&#x27;t be easy because 30 seconds with regular Listerine is bad enough.  OWWWWWWW!  It felt like my mouth was burning!   Not only that, for the next several hours, the entire inside of my mouth and tongue felt kind of swollen.  I hated to waste the money, but I poured it down the drain.  I&#x27;ve had great luck with Crest Whitestrips, in the past so I don&#x27;t need this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!  Of course, I can read a label and use it properly.  At every check up my dentist asks if I&#x27;ve been using strips as he is so impressed with the color of my teeth. Will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with all the whiteners causing peeling, etc. I finally figured out dry mouth due to meds was my problem.  I started using Biotene dry mouth toothpaste and mouthwash and it really helped, but needed whitening. So now I rinse with Listerine(whitening) for 1 min., brush with Biotene and rinse with Biotene mouthwash.  Works great and no peeling or dry mouth. I recommend this highly, because although the whitening is gradual, it is very easy to maintain. [[ASIN:B002KAOAZ4 Biotene Dry Mouth Mouthwash, 33.8 Bottle]]</li>
            <li> Just adds that extra bit of clean.</li>
            <li> I especially love that this product is not overwhelming in taste.  Some of the rinses are so &amp;#34;zingy&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t like that feeling, but this product is just right.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and found it to be just another mouthwash. I was hoping to see a visible result, but didn&#x27;t. Went back to Crest</li>
            <li> First off Listerine offers great products and even though this is a whitening product, it also freshens your breath. The taste of this is actually not bad compared to whitening strips. This actually whitens your teeth by a little, but is kind of annoying because there is always like goo in your mouth like couple hours later or like after you sleep you will find like white goo that you can pull out of your mouth. I guess this is the whitening procedure. It actually isn&#x27;t bad because this only happens at times, not always. And the goo is to a minimum. Overall, this product is not bad. I would give it a shot if you want whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> This product works great....if you pre-rinse everyday for 1 minute...you will see a change in the color of your teeth within a few months.  My dentist asked me if I was bleaching my teeth.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product via Amazon, but I felt like I should share.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product before when it first came out a couple years ago and it worked amazingly!!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I took to smoking again and stopped using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quit again 5 months ago, this time for good, so 3 weeks ago I bought a bottle and use it exactly as directed.&lt;br /&gt;It still works well, but since I resumed using the product my tongue has been getting increasingly sensitive (now to the point of pain)and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why.&lt;br /&gt;Upon further inspection I noticed the spots most sensitive on my tongue have no taste buds -- it&#x27;s completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure what to make of this, but I&#x27;m for sure not using this product again, which is really sad because it does work so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed or something. I did not have this issue the first time I used it, and I used it for a longer period of time than this time around.  I&#x27;m really disappointed... especially since I bought enough bottles of this to last me for an extended period of time in an area where products like this are not readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot of reviewers are slamming those with issues saying that if you encounter these issues, there&#x27;s something wrong with the user&#x27;s oral hygiene, but before I started using this again I had a orthodontic referral appointment and dental checkup/cleaning. I was told my teeth (aside from the staining) and gums are in great form. (No I do not have braces, yet, but I figured I would try to brighten my smile before they get put on.)</li>
            <li> Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse is a mouthwash that is intended for use prior to the brushing of one&#x27;s teeth. The intention of the rinse is to ensure the gradual whitening of a person&#x27;s teeth over a given period of time with continuous use. This product has been approved for daily use by the FDA, and is backed by Listerine&#x27;s parent company, Johnson and Johnson.   The rinse appears to be a frothy white mixture of mouthwash and whitening agents. The ingredient details list hydrogen peroxide as the primary whitening agent. The rinse maintains a distinct, peroxide-like smell, and seems to be a bit thicker than a typical, non-whitening mouthwash.   After dispensing the recommended amount (as per the bottle&#x27;s instructions -- 60ml or about 3/4 of a cap full of liquid), I swished the rinse for about 60 seconds before emptying my mouth of the rinse. The rinse had a slightly pungent taste (which is most likely from the peroxide), but was not offensive or overwhelming. The rinse did begin foaming heavily, and this did become unpleasant after about 30 seconds. The overall process was very similar to using standard mouthwash, but with extra foaming action involved.   My mouth did feel cleaner immediately afterwards. I continued to brush and then floss my teeth. Once my routine was complete, I noticed that my teeth appeared to have a filmy residue on the surface, which was thought to be residue from the rinse. I attributed this to the rinse&#x27;s standard operating procedure, and the filmy feeling was tolerable.   For several hours after completing my brush routine, the top lair of my mouth and gum line began to shed slightly. This was an unpleasant side-effect, and it intensified as the day went on. I also felt a slight tingling sensation throughout my tongue. I am unsure if this sensation is directly related to the use of the mouthwash, but I did not experience this event after the cessation of the use of the product.   I committed to finishing the bottle in its entirety. I used the rinse once in the morning and once before going to bed, and I would brush my teeth immediately following the use of the rinse. The bottle lasted about 25 days.   I can confirm that my teeth did have a whiter appearance, and my teeth did feel cleaner. I did not have a dentist appointment scheduled during the use of this product, and I am unable to validate my own anecdotal experience.   Unfortunately, I also experienced this \\&quot;mouth shedding\\&quot; during the entire time that I used this product that became progressively worse with continued use. I was able to pull \\&quot;strings\\&quot; of what looked like a mix of mucus membranes and product residue from my mouth. I did not experience a reduction in the ability to taste food items, but I did have a slight metallic after taste in my mouth for a few hours following use.   The product did perform its intended function, and I did have a whiter smile after using the product for several weeks. It maintains the properties of a mouthwash, and my teeth did feel clean with prolonged use (along with brushing and flossing). However, the unexpected side-effects were slightly overwhelming, and they contributed to an overall feeling on dissatisfaction with the product. I do not recommend this product for continuous use.</li>
            <li> Pre-Brush Listerine whitening liquid is excellent.  I have been using it for many years already now and can&#x27;t do without it.  Even when we go overseas we make sure we take a couple of bottles with us.  It does whiten your teeth and clean your mouth pretty well.  It also helps to subdue my sinus-mucus problem.  Great product.  Only thing is that we normally buy it at local Walmart store; but, however, lately, we do not find this: Pre-Brush one.  They have plenty of after brush ones.  I do not understand.  Pre-Brush is the best.  I guess some people who do not know how to use it must have complained about burning mouth and what not; I haven&#x27;t had this problem. Perhaps they do not know that it is pre-brush and not after brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Really helps with gum health &amp; whitening!</li>
            <li> The hygienist at my dentist&#x27;s office recommended I use this a couple of years ago to help prevent plaque/staining on my teeth.  It used to be available at local stores for about $6.00.  Local stores no longer carry it, and I can only get it through amazon for about $15.00 or $16.00 a bottle.  It definitely helps to prevent and alleviate coffee stains.  It is well worth the money.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in the shades of my teeth within the three weeks since I&#x27;ve started using this product. I recommend this pre-rinse to anyone that wishes to increase the whiteness of their teeth.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, it works great. Have never had to use any other whitening product.</li>
            <li> This product is very much like the total mouthwash. My teeth appear to be a bit whiter but I also use a whitening mouthwash and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great.  So refreshing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mouthwash and I can&#x27;t find it any longer in the stores! It&#x27;s a perfect pre-brush or post-brush whitener!</li>
            <li> I feel this product helps improve the cleaning of my teeth along with the pro health toothpaste by I believe its crest.</li>
            <li> I called the toll free number shown on the label because I wanted to know where the product was made.  The lady at J &amp; J said&lt;br /&gt;this mouthwash was discontinued in 2014 and it has a 2 yr shelf life.  I guess that explains why the lot # and expiration # are blacked&lt;br /&gt;out in the picture.  I&#x27;m passing on this one.</li>
            <li> Listerine has discontinued this product so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  However, the price was outragious!</li>
            <li> Use twice a day. Keeps teeth clean and doesn&#x27;t allow the discolor to get worse.</li>
            <li> excellent quality and service</li>
            <li> This product is great to maintain white teeth especially if you drink coffee or beverages that stain your teeth.  I can really see the difference with daily use.</li>
            <li> As ordered and above expectations.</li>
            <li> I used 2 bottles, using it correctly every day and night for months, and it did nothing for whitening my teeth... good mouth wash though, but I have a feeling I can buy better mouth wash cheaper, that&#x27;s more eco friendly from soaphope.  I haven&#x27;t tried Rembrandt for whitening, but this stuff did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This is my husband and I&#x27;s favorite mouth wash and we can&#x27;t find it in-stores anymore. I love the feeling of the pre-rinse that gets kind of foamy and bubbly in the mouth before you brush your teeth and rinse it out, versus the burning and more liquidy feeling of the regular post-brushing rinse. The taste of this is very pleasant too.</li>
            <li> I use this rinse every day. It is good to keep coffee stains off of teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is dangerous. I am not sure why FDA approved it.&lt;br /&gt;Every after you use this, membrane of cheek and gum falls off.&lt;br /&gt;I even got little cut or blister (I don’t know what it is but it hurts and definitely caused by this product) on my tongue and I stop using it after 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles from Amazon so I hesitated but threw them out.&lt;br /&gt;I researched online and one dentist explained that it is an allergic reaction to this mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;JNJ should consider to change ingredients otherwise it is definitely harmful to consumers.</li>
            <li> I am clean and minty fresh plus my teeth are bright and white. It kept me fresh until lunch time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first Listerine product, or any other mouthwash product for that matter, that I need to use prior to actually brushing my teeth! Most people are more familiar with the post rinse mouthwash but when a family member bought this product by accident, we were a little skeptical as to the benefits of rinsing our mouth with a mouthwash prior to brushing our teeth. To say the least, this product rocks and there is one reason why: it really does help me get rid of the \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has been no other product I&#x27;ve used before that would get rid of the morning stink breath many people experience on a daily basis. Granted, the morning breath is not something I experience every day. Using this product has gotten rid of that stinky breath for good. At first, I thought it was just a coincidence that I didn&#x27;t get the morning breath after the first time I&#x27;ve used this product. But the more I used it, the more I noticed that this product is really the cause for the miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to wake up now in the morning without having to wonder how bad your breath smells like!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pre-brush rinse that would also help whiten my teeth.  So, I thought I would give this one a try.  It does make the mouth feel clean and fresh, but so far haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement on the whitening side.  Perhaps this will happen over time as I have only been using it for a couple of weeks.  Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Much better and easier that whitening strips.</li>
            <li> My tooth looks awesome following a good swish with and a vigorous brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My toenails too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time I spat at the dog, but my lip quivered and it all dribbled onto my big toenail.  That darn thing has never looked healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of whitening rinses and over-the-counter trays/bleaches and this is the only one that actually works. Some reviewers have complained about the burning sensation and/or how long it supposedly takes, but my experience has been that it worked noticeably within a few weeks (my teeth weren&#x27;t that bad to begin with, though) and that the stinging sensation faded after a while.  I should probably add that I never held it in my mouth as long as suggested, often used it after I brushed (when it stings more) rather than before, and probably used it an average of three/four times a day (1-2x without brushing at all).  I&#x27;m 62 and my teeth look better than they did in my 20s, and I&#x27;ve gotten a number of compliments specifically on how white they are since I started using this.  I&#x27;m totally sold on this product.</li>
            <li> I usually use Crest 3d white as a pre-brush whitening rinse, then I brush with Colgate sensitive enamel protect, then I use Act. I figured I would give Listerine a chance since it specifically states that it is for before you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well my experience so far isn&#x27;t that great. My teeth have become slightly sensitive again, not that much but a little. Also to me it has an off smell and taste. The taste that bothers me isn&#x27;t the peroxide (Crests 3d white has peroxide too and that doesn&#x27;t bother me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth this product might work well for you. For me I&#x27;ll finish this bottle but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I rarely review items.... But I really think this is a super great product. I have to say after buying JUST the PRE brush rinse, I can tell you I saw a noticeable difference, and my teeth actually looked several shades lighter, in just a few days!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just have to remember: This is a PRE Brush. If you just take 30 seconds to slosh it around your mouth, when you get rid of it, you can actually look in the mirror and see and feel all the bubbles working to break down your tarter and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more you use it, the whiter your teeth become. I stopped using it just out of laziness for a week, and my teeth started looking yellow again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really and truly a great product line. I cannot wait to use it properly in conjunction with the post brush rinse! Good luck!</li>
            <li> Since i have been using this product my dental hygienist has notice a big improvement in my dential health.  I have been using it for more than a year. this works wonderful</li>
            <li> Want to hear something weird?  Your mouth is just like your gut.  It&#x27;s got a whole environment of bacteria that are supposed to stay alive because they digest food and kill off infection, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, just like your gut, you should not be wiping out the entire environment.  Surprise, you are killing off all the good bacteria too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can help it, limit your anti-biotic use, and don&#x27;t use mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I use this just before I brush, then after brushing I use cool mint listerine.  This has helped maintain my white teeth, it&#x27;s not a noticeable difference when using it.  It  does help maintain where you&#x27;re at if you do whiten your teeth using other methods.  The taste needs some getting used to, it tastes as though you&#x27;re chewing on a whitening strip.  But a good regiment to add to a brushing repertoire .</li>
            <li> I have been using for about a year. my hygenist say i have excellant oral hygiene.i can attribute this to this product.</li>
            <li> Used it for a few months. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it actually whitens my teethes. I think I will go back to the regular non-whiten mouth wash that is less expensive.</li>
            <li> Great product, does whiten.  But I can&#x27;t get it at the same price anymore... much higher now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a smoker, but I had yellow teeth because I lived with people who chain smoked.. it was so bad that the smoke hung heavily in the air all the time. My doctor didn&#x27;t even believe me when I said I didn&#x27;t smoke because of my teeth. Fortunately I was finally able to move out, and I decided to try this. Other whiteners have never worked for me, especially those gel things, which are really gross.  This is pleasant and works great as a mouthwash.  I wasn&#x27;t really paying close attention about the whitening aspect of this because I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed again, but all of a sudden, after about 3 months of using this daily, my teeth are WHITE!  Too bad it doesn&#x27;t clear out the lungs, too! :)  I am sold and will keep purchasing this for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it&#x27;s nice being able to purchase this as a pack of 2 so that it doesn&#x27;t have to be reordered every month.  Absolutely TEN stars.. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this locally anymore and really like this pre-rinse as part of my routine. Whther it whitens or not, I can&#x27;t say, but it seems to be a good rinse before brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> This stuff simply works - and easy. Constant comments white teeth - use to be so yellow.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference within 4 days. My teeth are whiter by 1 shade after 4 days. Will buy this again</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;seemes&amp;#34; to whiten the teeth.</li>
            <li> I recently had my teeth whitened at my dentists office and the girl who whitened them recommended this product.  She said she used it every day twice a day.  Her teeth are the most beautiful natural white color.  Not that Snow White artificial color you see so often.  She said that the inside of my mouth would peel once I think until it got used to the mouthwash.  One side peeled today.  No biggie.  I will use this mouthwash from here on out to achieve that beautiful color that she has.  Great product!</li>
            <li> sets my whole m08th tinglingly clean.</li>
