            <li>EXCELLENT!  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed!</li>
            <li>I am very happy</li>
            <li>Thank you Passport to Organics for developing THE BEST ORGANIC TURMERIC CLEANSER!</li>
            <li>My oily/acne prone skin is flawless &amp; glowing!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to keep the cream in the fridge so it isn&#x27;t as runny.</li>
            <li>I looked at the ingredients that they seemed very good ...</li>
            <li>Great cleanser.</li>
            <li>Please NEVER CHANGE the great ingredients and quality of this turmeric cleanser because I plan to use your products forever.</li>
            <li>That said it smells great</li>
            <li>The turmeric lotion and serum are great too.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>and the inflammation has been greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that is good.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was wondering if the cleanser worked, and if I should quit using it, but I had heard turmeric did great things for your face and kept with it.  </li>
            <li>I was also happy that the company uses organic ingredients, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I am in my 40&#x27;s with combo skin and this makes it all look amazing.  </li>
            <li>with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Good luck :)</li>
            <li>this cream cleanser has very strong smell of turmeric</li>
            <li>After trying Passport to Organics&#x27; Charcoal Magic Cleanser, I was thrilled to try the Turmeric Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have tryed many skincare products over the years, and have struggled with off and on acne.</li>
            <li>I plan on trying many of there products.</li>
            <li>However,i more breakouts and made my face more oily.</li>
            <li>and I find it is ok.</li>
            <li>It does an ok job of cleaning my face but just doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup off.</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the years for my spot-prone skin (Murad, Dermalogica, Proactiv, NeoStrata, etc.)</li>
            <li>My complexion has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>love the tingly feeling it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li>In the beginning it seemed to assist in healing some blemishes, but over time it just didn&#x27;t cut it, and my skin seemed more irritated than ever.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product for keeping my skin healthy (poison free) and smooth!</li>
            <li>Good cleanser, but more for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>that first cup of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with not only this Turmeric Cleanser</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser primarily in the morning because it acts as a stimulant and wakes me up even before</li>
            <li>review posted in exchange for free sample</li>
            <li>(I originally ordered the set.)  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t clean my face, and I don&#x27;t have any differences on my face.</li>
            <li>My face feels amazing, soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>The smell is kinda too much but its wort it if my face will get better.</li>
            <li>so I quickly switched back.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Like Passport to Organics&#x27; other fine products in their line, the Turmeric cleanser comes in an attractive bottle with the same easy pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product does have quite a bit of Turmeric in it and it is powerful.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser leaves my face squeaky clean, smooth &amp; soft without affecting the pH of my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s excellent health benefits; and to have a very rich,chemical /paraben free organic turmeric cleanser is A BIG PLUS for my vegetarian, &amp; green life style!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a little surprising because it almost has the aroma of salad dressing.  </li>
            <li>My face feels soft after I wash it, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It seems like my skin (acne prone, t-zone oily) went through a bit of a detox breakout at first</li>
            <li>A lot of the junk underneath the surface has cleared out (that must have been the breakout) and my face is so smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands with regular soap afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this cleanser and at first thought it worked well...</li>
            <li>Cherries, Ginger, Lemon, and various other natural foods are all good but the most promising was Turmeric!  </li>
            <li>Plus the ingredients are clean and natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, refreshed, clear and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The entire texture is different and the \\&quot;deepness\\&quot; of the clarity of my skin is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>am really hoping that it will start to show some changes soon.</li>
            <li>I then apply the Turmeric cleanser with my fingers and gently massage face in circular motions.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about the ingredients I put in and on my body</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t work for me, but it very well could be the answer for someone else.</li>
            <li>I mean turmeric etc is said to be good for skin</li>
            <li>As an Esthetician I can tell you, every skin is different and unique.</li>
            <li>I am almost done with my first bottle of this, and WOW.  </li>
            <li>Its hard to find a good product that helps with adult acne and anti-aging as well.</li>
            <li>Turmeric is my main cooking spice because of</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Seems a little drying, but still ok.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight, you can tell it is natural.  </li>
            <li>My skin really likes this natural product.</li>
            <li>My skin never really feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I am a nutritionist and a vegetarian and eat only organic foods and use only organic/paraben free skincare and cosmetics.</li>
            <li>so I went back to my old tried and true product which is Olays sensitive foaming wash which removes all my makeup and leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It is also apparent there is a lot of turmeric in this cleanser, that is the main reason I bought it!  </li>
            <li>But, half a bottle later, I switched to something more hydrating.</li>
            <li>use it along with the clear face turmeric cream and serum.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have done a lot of research for natural remedies to reduce the inflammation.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see how soft your skin becomes</li>
            <li>tumeric and oil rub works on dry scalp (blondes test first)</li>
            <li>They have all helped with a major face transformation!  </li>
            <li>The more you worked it on your skin, the worse it smelled.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fine,did not dry out my skin.</li>

            <li> I use less than a pump to wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money, at least not for me.</li>

            <li> EXCELLENT!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have tryed many skincare products over the years, and have struggled with off and on acne. Its hard to find a good product that helps with adult acne and anti-aging as well. I have been using this cleanser for two weeks now and my acne is practically gone! I am very impressed! I was also happy that the company uses organic ingredients, which is very important to me. I am very happy I found passport to organics, I dont have to be embarrassd about my acne anymore! I plan on trying many of there products. Thank you passport to organics!!</li>
            <li> The smell is fine,did not dry out my skin. However,i more breakouts and made my face more oily.</li>
            <li> I like using this cleanser every evening.  It is very lightweight, you can tell it is natural.  It is also apparent there is a lot of turmeric in this cleanser, that is the main reason I bought it!  I have been using their turmeric cream, and just started using the cleanser.  My face feels soft after I wash it, and smooth.  It does not strip your skin.  I use less than a pump to wash my face.  Great cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since my second son (June 2010). I had crazy hormones and breakouts! Embarrassing! I have not had a breakout since then. Maybe an occasional bump (kids and their grubby hands); but nothing like prego breakout! Also I have been using it on my feet and it has been helping the occasional athletes toe itch I would get in some of my shoes.</li>
            <li> I found this to be drying. I tried to give it some time, hoping my skin was just trying to get used to it. But, half a bottle later, I switched to something more hydrating. I have oily skin that is dry in the T-zone during the winter months. This product was not effective for the dryness.</li>
            <li> I have started this clear face turmeric cream cleanser for about a few weeks now and I find it is ok. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like my other foam cleanser so that is good. It does an ok job of cleaning my face but just doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup off. It does have some sort of herbal smell. I guess that is the turmeric smell but it is not too bad. Don&#x27;t let it get into the eye cause it does sting somewhat. However since it doesn&#x27;t strip dry my face like other foam face wash cleanser I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Thank you Passport to Organics for developing THE BEST ORGANIC TURMERIC CLEANSER! I am a nutritionist and a vegetarian and eat only organic foods and use only organic/paraben free skincare and cosmetics. Turmeric is my main cooking spice because of it&#x27;s excellent health benefits; and to have a very rich,chemical /paraben free organic turmeric cleanser is A BIG PLUS for my vegetarian, &amp; green life style! Please NEVER CHANGE the great ingredients and quality of this turmeric cleanser because I plan to use your products forever. The cleanser leaves my face squeaky clean, smooth &amp; soft without affecting the pH of my skin. My oily/acne prone skin is flawless &amp; glowing!!! THANK YOU PASSPORT TO ORGANICS!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very thin in texture but a small amount goes a long way but it may not be as foamy as some cleansers that you may have used before. The pricepoint is a little high for me so I went back to my old tried and true product which is Olays sensitive foaming wash which removes all my makeup and leaves my face feeling soft. That said it smells great and if it&#x27;s in your price range try it.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with my first bottle of this, and WOW.  It seems like my skin (acne prone, t-zone oily) went through a bit of a detox breakout at first but I kept using it. To be honest, I was wondering if the cleanser worked, and if I should quit using it, but I had heard turmeric did great things for your face and kept with it.  WOW.  My skin has never looked like this, ever.  The entire texture is different and the \\&quot;deepness\\&quot; of the clarity of my skin is truly amazing.  It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s shining from the inside out. A lot of the junk underneath the surface has cleared out (that must have been the breakout) and my face is so smooth and clear.  The turmeric lotion and serum are great too.  (I originally ordered the set.)  They have all helped with a major face transformation!  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I know the benefits of turmeric when ingested, so I thought I would see if there are any external use benefits.  To tell you the truth, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements in my skin, although I must admit it keeps your skin from feeling dry after using.  The fragrance is a little surprising because it almost has the aroma of salad dressing.  It might work well for other people, but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and this caused her to break out in painful acne.  The more you worked it on your skin, the worse it smelled.  Will not buy this product again and will throw out unused portion.</li>
            <li> great product. use it along with the clear face turmeric cream and serum. can already tell a difference in my skin. just have to get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> Maybe this works for others but my skin did not like this product. I looked at the ingredients that they seemed very good ... I mean turmeric etc is said to be good for skin but I had to discontinue using it</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years for my spot-prone skin (Murad, Dermalogica, Proactiv, NeoStrata, etc.) My skin really likes this natural product. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost four weeks. My skin is clear and glowing. As an added bonus, my wrinkles have disappeared. I leave the cleanser on for at least a minute. I recommend the serum at night time and cream during the day. It&#x27;s best to keep the cream in the fridge so it isn&#x27;t as runny.</li>
            <li> My complexion has never looked better.  I am in my 40&#x27;s with combo skin and this makes it all look amazing.  Plus the ingredients are clean and natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one week now and I don&#x27;t see any changes in my face.&lt;br /&gt;I am really hoping that it will start to show some changes soon. The smell is kinda too much but its wort it if my face will get better. I still keep breaking out</li>
            <li> LOVE this product for keeping my skin healthy (poison free) and smooth! It&#x27;s not over drying! I just put in my second order.</li>
            <li> Seems a little drying, but still ok. I have sensitive combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li> After trying Passport to Organics&#x27; Charcoal Magic Cleanser, I was thrilled to try the Turmeric Cleanser.  I recenty have been diagnosed with a medical condition that causes external and internal inflammation.  I have done a lot of research for natural remedies to reduce the inflammation.  Cherries, Ginger, Lemon, and various other natural foods are all good but the most promising was Turmeric!  So, I have been drinking a Turmeric Lemon Ginger tea I make myself for over a month now and the inflammation has been greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of Turmeric in a facial cleanser just makes sense for me.  Like Passport to Organics&#x27; other fine products in their line, the Turmeric cleanser comes in an attractive bottle with the same easy pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start by removing my eye makeup with coconut oil (I don&#x27;t like petrolatum products).  Then thoroughly wet my face and neck (don&#x27;t forget your necks ladies!) with warm water.  I then apply the Turmeric cleanser with my fingers and gently massage face in circular motions.  Word of Caution:  Avoid your eye area.  This product does have quite a bit of Turmeric in it and it is powerful.  Don&#x27;t burn your eyes.  Rinse thoroughly and pat area dry.  Be sure to wash your hands with regular soap afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the tingly feeling it leaves on my skin.  Tingly without a dry feeling.  I use this cleanser primarily in the morning because it acts as a stimulant and wakes me up even before that first cup of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with not only this Turmeric Cleanser but with the entire Passport to Organics line.  I am very picky about the ingredients I put in and on my body and I will definitely recommend this line to anyone who will listen to me about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Honest review posted in exchange for free sample*</li>
            <li> this cream cleanser has very strong smell of turmeric but it doesn&#x27;t clean my face, and I don&#x27;t have any differences on my face.</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing, soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;1 pump is enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  After this I tried a different moisturizing soap but I needed to add lotion every day anyway so I quickly switched back.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasted 2.5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re skeptical try tumeric and water (paste) on hands and you&#x27;ll see how soft your skin becomes&lt;br /&gt;a tumeric and oil rub works on dry scalp (blondes test first)</li>
            <li> Good cleanser, but more for normal to oily skin. My sensative skin just couldn&#x27;t handle it. Ended up switching to Prescriptives cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my face is grateful.  My skin is soft, refreshed, clear and healthy.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried this cleanser and at first thought it worked well...On my second bottle I quit out not even a quarter of the way through. This cleanser is mediocre. I&#x27;m unimpressed. My skin never really feels clean after using it. In the beginning it seemed to assist in healing some blemishes, but over time it just didn&#x27;t cut it, and my skin seemed more irritated than ever. Not worth the money, at least not for me. As an Esthetician I can tell you, every skin is different and unique. This product didn&#x27;t work for me, but it very well could be the answer for someone else. As with all skin care I find that you have to experiment. Good luck :)</li>
