            <li>I only have one thing to say in regards to this product; If you are looking for an awesome pair of personal care scissors, click the ADD TO CART button right now!!</li>
            <li>They are great for safely trimming baby&#x27;s little fingernails, so the baby doesn&#x27;t end up scratching his/her face!  </li>
            <li>They seem fine, but have not used them very much yet.</li>

            <li>I have the new ones &amp; love them.</li>

            <li>They cut precisely and are very durable.  </li>
            <li>Just the right tightness in the scissors.</li>
            <li>I use this to keep my moustach from touching my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>And since these scissors are of such good quality, they cut smoothly, with enough room for adult fingers to hold.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to purchase new Tweezerman scissors because they perform so much better, both in ability to get close to the skin as well as the sharpness of the blade.  </li>
            <li>Oh we are such a happy little family here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>These scissors are well-made and they do the job they are designed to do very well.</li>

            <li>Lightweight but very durable.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like the scissors I got.</li>
            <li>really, I am discussing my nose hairs with complete strangers.</li>
            <li>I told her I hadn&#x27;t paid nearly that much, and she said, &amp;#34;Well</li>
            <li>Love the round tip for safety purpose, the sharpness of the blades, and the traveling case.</li>

            <li>Scissors are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>I did not find it good for cutting nose hair.</li>
            <li>Using scissors that are either too tight or too loose is unpleasant, but these are perfect.</li>

            <li> I know scissors, and those are the highest quality you are going to find.&amp;#34; Needless to say, when I told her how much I paid, she nearly passed out.</li>
            <li> Bought them to replace a pair that I lost but which were no longer sharp..</li>
            <li> The scissors work well and are sharp.  </li>
            <li> Basic scissors, a bit small</li>
            <li> Because they are straight, difficult to use</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Scissors are precision made and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I use them for the little hairs around my Shih Tzu puppies eyes as they tend to get the hairs in their eyes.</li>
            <li> Poor build quality compared to the tweezers I bought of the same brand.</li>
            <li> In fact cutting any hair, the scissors were not particularly sharp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these type of scissors for about 15 yrs until they got too dull.</li>
            <li> I would say they are little expensive</li>
            <li> Will often &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; and pull at hairs instead of cutting, which is painful.</li>

            <li> Exactly what was expected and very nice.</li>
            <li> OK,  it can still cut you.</li>
            <li> These scissors are well-made and they do the job they are designed to do very well.</li>
            <li> So Far....love these scissors...they are performing very well and I trust they will continue to do so!....Bought them to replace a pair that I lost but which were no longer sharp.. Better than those battery operated nose hair trimmers!</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the reviews that I read saying they are &amp;#34;the highest quality scissors ever owned&amp;#34; by multiple reviewers and they were meant to replace a pair of Tweezerman scissors that I lost.  The Bodyline scissors are good quality, but aren&#x27;t able to get as close to the skin as the Tweezerman scissors.  I&#x27;m back to purchase new Tweezerman scissors because they perform so much better, both in ability to get close to the skin as well as the sharpness of the blade.  I will keep these as a spare pair.</li>
            <li> It fulfills its purpose and the fact that has rounded point, helps avoid harm. I would say they are little expensive</li>
            <li> Seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li> I use these to clip my nose hairs. Now as i sit and write this I am thinking ...really, I am discussing my nose hairs with complete strangers. Oh we are such a happy little family here at Amazon. but I&#x27;m drawing the line if I ever by something for Hemorrhoids on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of scissors.  Lightweight but very durable.  Excellent quality.  Much better quality than my others I purchased from a beauty supply store.  The rounded tip is also a plus for safety.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim the mats from my elderly cat.  Works great.  Has rounded tips.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Just the right tightness in the scissors. Using scissors that are either too tight or too loose is unpleasant, but these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a pair of blunt tipped scissors for quite some time. So glad I found these. The quality is great and they do the job well without cutting the skin.</li>
            <li> The scissors work well and are sharp.  They came quickly and were as discribed.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my moustach from touching my upper lip. Scissors are pretty sharp. Just disenfect it with rubbing alcholol to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Great for detailed trimming.</li>
            <li> Love my new scissors! Great for trimming. Very sharp. Fits great in my Bodyline Tweezers case and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> They seem fine, but have not used them very much yet.</li>
            <li> Because they are straight, difficult to use</li>
            <li> Great pair of scissors! Love the round tip for safety purpose, the sharpness of the blades, and the traveling case. Very effective and quick shipping! Overall, I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> These are excellent quality for the money.  You can tell that it was built to precise tolerances.  The only advise I would have for the manufacturer of these would be to change the brand name.  &amp;#34;Bodyline Basics&amp;#34; gave me the initial impression that it was an entry-level low quality product.  Only after reading the reviews did I decide to take a chance on it.  I think the name should reflect the precision and quality of the product.  Just my two cents, but these scissors are very easy to use.  I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about the product itself.</li>
            <li> I only have one thing to say in regards to this product; If you are looking for an awesome pair of personal care scissors, click the ADD TO CART button right now!! I absolutely LOVE them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These personal care grooming scissors are top notch!! (Unlike my more expensive Tweezerman set) My mother has been a cosmetologist for almost 30 years, so scissors are part of her niche. After one glance, she asked why I paid $30-$40 for professional-grade grooming scissors, when she could have given me a pair. I told her I hadn&#x27;t paid nearly that much, and she said, &amp;#34;Well I know scissors, and those are the highest quality you are going to find.&amp;#34; Needless to say, when I told her how much I paid, she nearly passed out. Haha! Everyone in the family now has a pair :D</li>
            <li> Purchased to cut hair out of the dog&#x27;s ears, a very touchy job.  Excellent product!  Exactly what I was looking for. Very quickly shipped, excellent communication from the seller.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I did not find it good for cutting nose hair. In fact cutting any hair, the scissors were not particularly sharp</li>
            <li> Scissors are precision made and very sharp.  Excelent purchase in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great quality!  They cut precisely and are very durable.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these type of scissors for about 15 yrs until they got too dull. I have the new ones &amp; love them. I use them for the little hairs around my Shih Tzu puppies eyes as they tend to get the hairs in their eyes. These are wonderful &amp; I&#x27;m not afraid to use them for that purpose. Thank you for carrying them.</li>
            <li> Basic scissors, a bit small</li>
            <li> These are the quality scissors I have been looking for!  They are great for safely trimming baby&#x27;s little fingernails, so the baby doesn&#x27;t end up scratching his/her face!  The blunt ends prevent finger pokes.  And since these scissors are of such good quality, they cut smoothly, with enough room for adult fingers to hold.  Speed of delivery was amazing!  This will make a great baby shower gift!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give 0 star</li>
            <li> I really like the scissors I got. They cut with precision and the rounded safety tips are definetely a plus. I love the fact they perfectly fit in my Bodyline tweezers case I purchased a while back. This is an excellent buy and cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> Poor build quality compared to the tweezers I bought of the same brand. Will often &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; and pull at hairs instead of cutting, which is painful. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Their 1st selling point was &amp;#34;ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY! - Never deal with low quality scissors again!&amp;#34;.  I can&#x27;t disagree more.  It feels like a very basic pair of scissors.  BTW, the package says, &amp;#34;Made in Pakistan&amp;#34;.</li>
