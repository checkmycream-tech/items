            <li>Pores look smaller, skin looks smoother and my makeup looks perfect all day.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find that I could order it on Amazon and get a bigger bottle at a much better</li>
            <li>but I am pleased I have it for nights out and special occasions...highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but what I dont like light shine the product leaves .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really one of a kind..</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>

            <li>My makeup stayed fresh looking all day with no touchups needed.</li>
            <li>and my makeup seems to stay fresh looking for hours.</li>
            <li>Now my make-up looks fresh from morning until I wash it off at night.</li>
            <li>It just sprays on and suddenly everything looks better.</li>
            <li>I love Skindinavia Finishing Spray, but decided to try the 10 Years Younger.</li>
            <li>so  I highly recommend it ..!!</li>
            <li>I first bought this</li>
            <li>I was expecting this product to help my makeup stay put for the day, however, it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference when compared to putting nothing on at all.</li>
            <li>Would really like company to replace it for me.</li>
            <li>it  really works to you.</li>
            <li>This product definitely gives a dewy finish to your foundation and as a 40 year old it helps it stay in place and not sink into those pesky fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to live with out it!</li>
            <li>This setting spray is just as good as Urban Decay if not better.</li>
            <li>I love to wear it everyday!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, on this bottle, the pump mechanism broke and I had to transfer the liquid to a travel-sized pump bottle, which doesn&#x27;t spray the fine mist I would get from the original bottle.</li>
            <li>I originally bought a very small bottle of this for my daughter at a wedding store.</li>
            <li>yes, makes visible slight skin lift , and keep makeup in place for whole day-</li>

            <li> I was expecting this product to help my makeup stay put for the day, however, it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference when compared to putting nothing on at all. I followed all directions! I was disappointed however, I&#x27;m going to give the rest to a friend to see if she notices a difference. Maybe it was just my type of skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product to brighten up your makeup.  It just sprays on and suddenly everything looks better.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews that say this product will melt your make up. I can tell you, it does not do that. Quite the contrary. It will keep it in place for many hours. ALWAYS apply it before mascara. You run the risk of your mascara running all over your face if you decided to do it after. Other than that, it gives a seamless appearance that I did not get before using this product.</li>
            <li> Repurchased this in a bigger size....its great!!! I fell in love with it after purchasing it while on a quest to find something to stop my makeup from shifting around during the course of a day. I was thrilled at how well it helps my makeup stay in place. It even holds it in place while dancing the night away when i go out with my friends. definitely one of my beauty must haves!!!</li>
            <li> Helps set me makeup so it wears all day.</li>
            <li> makeup stayed in place. takes two seconds to spray on after makeup is applied. I am happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Hello- I was curious to use this product -so I ordered 2 kinds - 10 years younger - yes, makes visible slight skin lift , and keep makeup in place for whole day- I will continue use it  - but what I dont like light shine the product leaves . other may say skin glow - but to my skin it looks as I am oily . not healthy glowing . THE SECOND type regular - I bought for my teen and he did not notice big difference - I dont think I would buy it again-  but just to try I dont regret</li>
            <li> This product definitely gives a dewy finish to your foundation and as a 40 year old it helps it stay in place and not sink into those pesky fine lines.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday but I am pleased I have it for nights out and special occasions...highly recommend!</li>
            <li> OMG it is really magic , I will order more. I like the the finishing , I fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love Skindinavia Finishing Spray, but decided to try the 10 Years Younger. I&#x27;m all for anything that makes me look younger! I love the dewy look my skin takes on. Pores look smaller, skin looks smoother and my makeup looks perfect all day. Even my friends noticed the difference. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> This setting spray is just as good as Urban Decay if not better. My makeup stayed fresh looking all day with no touchups needed.</li>
            <li> My makeup stayed on all night and I even woke up the next morning looking the same! Insane! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am not sure it takes 10 years off my looks but it does add a nice healthy glow and my makeup seems to stay fresh looking for hours.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Sets my makeup for all-day hold, through sweat and grime from my job. Everyone says my complexion looks great! This is my 3rd bottle. Unfortunately, on this bottle, the pump mechanism broke and I had to transfer the liquid to a travel-sized pump bottle, which doesn&#x27;t spray the fine mist I would get from the original bottle. Would really like company to replace it for me.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims to do, sets my makeup (as I am a healthcare worker, I wear a mask all day) and gives my face a smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> My makeup stays in place - all day!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love it!  It gives my face a nice glow.  If I am going out at night, I usually apply another squirt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really one of a kind..&lt;br /&gt;and it  really works to you. so  I highly recommend it ..!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> I originally bought a very small bottle of this for my daughter at a wedding store. I was very happy to find that I could order it on Amazon and get a bigger bottle at a much better price!&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought this I thought it was only for special occasions, but I was wrong. I love to wear it everyday! My make-up use to be almost non existent by evening. Now my make-up looks fresh from morning until I wash it off at night. Love this stuff! Don&#x27;t want to live with out it!</li>
            <li> Very good product. My makeup remained flawless for hours.</li>
