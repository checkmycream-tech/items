            <li>This is yet another product I have been ordering and using for a number of years, and I have always found it very effective.</li>
            <li>again, good since we have 5 more bottles!!</li>
            <li>I found the spray to be very effective if you&#x27;re going to be sweating and want to smell good.</li>
            <li>It also makes a good travel bottle, for re-application throughout the day, or if you accidentally forget to put on deodorant before leaving the house.</li>
            <li>oh well, they probably thought it&#x27;s a good idea to not mention</li>
            <li>Good price on line.  </li>
            <li>Holds up fairly well</li>
            <li>This is a quality product and a really good valve.</li>
            <li>No chemicals, no side effects (except good ones), no problems.</li>
            <li>Good price and self-explanatory to use.</li>
            <li>Three sprays of this product under each arm in the morning, and I am good for the day.  </li>
            <li>I read a review from a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; blogger, who stated that she loved the roll-on variety of this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>(Because of fear, I ALMOST reapplied, but decided not to, to give it a fair chance.)  </li>
            <li>roll on is great for when you want to make sure you get good coverage of your underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great</li>
            <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m so grateful that amazon has it in bulk!  </li>
            <li>This thing is like magic!</li>
            <li>I never had to endure an adjustment phase when I quit using antiperspirant a decade or so ago--this was the first kind I tried and it worked perfectly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Works great for me and my wife and it&#x27;s chemical free.  </li>
            <li>After each use we remove the nozzle and run warm water over it to prevent any crystallization.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using about 4 of the 6 I bought on Amazon, the 5th sprayer gets clogged and does not mist so nicely.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent deodorant, it feels like a spritz of water when applied, and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>and it is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Effective without the chemicals and additives in most deodorants.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It covers odors well and, best of all, it is all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>If you cant deal with stick deodorant for whatever reason, this is one of the best natural alternatives.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST NATURAL DEODORANT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to rinse the solid versions of salt deodorant after using them, so it&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to do that with the spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found the product that really does what it says it does!</li>
            <li>Love this product - came very quickly, efficiently and safely!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than I can say for some of the non-natural deodorants I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>of my favorite things about this deodorant is that it leaves no residue, so theirs</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use regular deodorant so this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This one and the crystal of the same brand are excellent.</li>
            <li>For some reason it has it&#x27;s own light &amp;#34;B.O.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>No problem with that since using this product : )</li>
            <li>so I buy it at Amazon to make sure I do not run out</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>And it goes without saying that it&#x27;s cheaper this way. :)</li>
            <li>It is a great deodorant, has no flowery odor, and it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Is that ok with you?</li>
            <li>no nasty chemicals!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very well satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truly HG for me  :)</li>
            <li>(it seems like you need to reapply more often though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this deodorant in the spray.  </li>
            <li>Way better than the salt balls/eggs because it&#x27;s more sanitary.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff though.</li>
            <li>I love this product more than anything I&#x27;ve tried for deo purposes.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and the price is very low.  </li>
            <li>The company is conscientious about making sure their customers are pleased.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>HAVE USED PRODUCT FOR QUITE SOME TIME.VERY SATISFIED WITH THE WAY</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and love the product in liquid form.</li>
            <li>More convenient, but remember to close your eyes when you spray it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I run most days</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I searched extensively for a deodorant that was non-toxic and this fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I tried this one.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I trusted the reviews, and tried it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I tried this product.</li>
            <li>Then she asked a supervisor who was most unhelpful and did not want to know anything.  </li>
            <li>This is better, but I have to combine it with alcohol to keep everything in check.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly even in for sports and day long activities.</li>
            <li>Beside the fact is very cheap this spray works perfectly , keeps my arm pits dry &amp; no smell !!</li>
            <li>in all, I am happy to find a natural product that works!</li>
            <li>spray on is great for immediately after shaving or when your underarms may be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>This product is great and natural.</li>
            <li>Most importantly neither of us has had any reactions to this product</li>
            <li>I also love how it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible and I do really like what it does when first applied, but it&#x27;s not a one-time per day application.  </li>
            <li>Much of the time I just didn&#x27;t use any deodorant - not always a good solution.  </li>
            <li>I was already familiar with potassium alum from the crystal blocks I bought to rub on my face after wet-shaving, but I didn&#x27;t know this stuff had so many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I sweat easily.</li>
            <li>There is one thing I had to get used to, but it was an easy trade-off.</li>
            <li>great product for those of us fortunate enough for it to work (as i&#x27;m told, its not for everybody)</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>I can no longer find this at local stores, so we are happy Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>It goes on as light as water</li>
            <li>Keeps you odor free all day.</li>
            <li>Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s free of cancer causing aluminum.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves me odor free for 16 - 24 hours depending on my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I have remained odor free while using it</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Great product, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but there are too many issues with the pump, many times they simply don&#x27;t work, even when new.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Review originally posted on NaturalFamilyToday.com</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for MANY years and really like it !  </li>
            <li>It is one of those rare times, when you get  considerably better product at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The original Rep wanted me to check the remaining bottles</li>
            <li>In defense of Naturally Fresh Deoderant, every DO I have ever tried has given me a huge rash under my arms.</li>
            <li>I feel I have a good grasp on how well the different kinds</li>
            <li>Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Roll On is available in stores across the country, including Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works for me :)</li>
            <li>Odor control is good, you may have to re-apply if you tend to be a sweaty individual.  </li>
            <li>Its safe and gentle to skin.</li>
            <li>It really feels fresh, lasts, and is safe to use.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>Much healthier alternative to the commercial brands which contain like a million ingredients and yet very… very effective by itself.</li>
            <li>It is effective and safe without aluminum and other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I got 6 bottles for pretty good price compared to how each cost individually at the health food store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and fast to apply.</li>
            <li>The fine mist really improves application.</li>
            <li>Also AMAZING about this -- even the NEXT MORNING I don&#x27;t smell (yes,</li>
            <li>In our home we call &amp;#34;Naturally Fresh Crystal Spray Mist&amp;#34; the miracle deodorant.</li>
            <li>The spray is also nice for use by multiple family members to prevent the spread of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never did like deodorants that announced their presence with powerful scents.</li>
            <li>I have been using this naturally fresh deodorant crystal spray mist for 7 yrs.</li>
            <li>It works (does need to be reapplied midday as most natural products).</li>
            <li>have used Naturally Fresh for over a decade.</li>
            <li>Tell your friends that itt is really worth a try.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;d have to spray this on multiple times a day to be effective.</li>
            <li>I  bught the unscented and added my own essential oil (3 drops)</li>
            <li>Finally, I came across the Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray Mist Body Deodorant and it&#x27;s by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>After years of trying different antiperspirants, searching for one that wouldn&#x27;t make me itch, I was thrilled to find this.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny, folks.</li>
            <li>And the smell is amazing - very fresh but not intense.</li>
            <li>I have tried other \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; deodorants and this one works just as well, and even maybe better than most.</li>
            <li>Good for those who have allergies and other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>However, right around my 30th birthday I became allergic to ALL of them.</li>
            <li>My first reaction upon reading the ingredients was, \\&quot;Well, it doesn&#x27;t get much more natural than that.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I didnt have high expectations ,but I wanted to tried it because I wanted an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>I think the spray isn&#x27;t as effective in the long run, I&#x27;ll aim to post an update.</li>
            <li>…it&#x27;s clear, easy to use both at or away from home.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I was so happy with the spray, I decided to go back to the store to buy the roll-on of the same brand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The distributor of this product was VERY fast in delivering to my doorstep (thank god).</li>
            <li>It typically lasts all day and night under normal use (excluding workouts and mountain climbing), and is very effective at eliminating - not just masking - odors.</li>
            <li>Works great - if you sweat too much might still need to add a small bit of deodorant but most days this is enough!</li>
            <li>I no longer have to worry about unpleasent body odor because it really works!  </li>
            <li>Love these, especially that they are unscented.</li>
            <li>First, you do not smell like the deodorant and doesn&#x27;t clash with your favorate cologne or perfume.</li>
            <li>It works better than regular deodorant</li>
            <li>After years of trying to find a product for my son, this is the only deodorant that I was able to find that does not irritate his skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed some dryness under my arms at first</li>
            <li>This is used in hospital restrooms and is where I first came across the product.  </li>
            <li>The spray bottle does tend to get plugged up towards the end, so I find myself having to run it under hot water.</li>
            <li>My husband and I used this product in a hot and humid locale and it seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>He tells me all the time how much he likes the Naturally Fresh Spray Mist.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the solid.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend both the product and the seller, who provided quick and efficient packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also Eco friendly and made of natural products.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing for me is that it&#x27;s  non aggressive and keeps me fresh all</li>
            <li>I have tried several kinds of natural deodorant, including purple prairie botanicals deodorant stick and my own homemade deodorant paste.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re POSITIVE it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>The Rep at first seemed very helpful and understood there was no way a customer could know about all 12 bottles until they are used, which would be a while.  </li>
            <li>For many years I have searched for high quality deodorants without all of the extra ingredients that may or may not clog our pores, that may or may not cause us allergic reactions, and that may or may not WORK well.  </li>
            <li>Natural, quick, does the job of controlling odor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough traveling overseas with...</li>
            <li>They each held up throughout the day, but the spray side was still going strong the next morning, not so with the roll-on side.  </li>
            <li>It works like a champ -- does not leave me dry, but certainly odor free!</li>
            <li>This is for certain a product that every woman should be using.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no room for companies like this on Amazon, who has a very high level of customer service.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the little black dress too!</li>
            <li>Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal is made of water and natural mineral salts.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I use it very liberally.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone - because it works!</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>I am very stinky and really searched to find a deodorant that takes care of that.</li>
            <li>Really works well for odor.</li>
            <li>and I bought the lavender scented version so it had added fragrance that was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really well.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that if it was so \\&quot;natural\\&quot; it might not work very well.</li>
            <li>Very well priced, this item works wonders</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>so very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the scented versions, but really prefer the unscented one.</li>
            <li>but overall I freely give it a 5-star for function, application and performance.</li>
            <li>Works really well, doesn&#x27;t stain cloths, dries fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It gets clogged very often.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well, all day.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend .</li>
            <li>also bought the roll on version, and it&#x27;s very practical.</li>
            <li>It may do the job for someone that does not sweat much but it did not do the job for me.</li>
            <li>But it eventually dries, and otherwise it really works - and works well.</li>
            <li>fast delivery I like it</li>
            <li>I order a whole case of it.</li>
            <li>Applying it took care of the smell immediately &amp; that really impresses me, but I don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to apply deodorant three times per day.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several natural options and this one makes my top three favs:</li>
            <li>To be honest it didn’t work for me because it was uncomfortably cold when applying, it wasn’t effective 100% because I had sprinkle some baking soda over my armpits after applying the crystal in order to be odorless 24</li>
            <li>Effective and odorless deodorant for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Because it is unscented, I look forward to experimenting with essential oils to create my own personal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine being without so found on Amazon and decided to pay the extra shipping... worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It will not keep you deodorized for long if you are doing yard work or cooking in a warm kitchen, but I recommend it as a daily deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and odor free no matter what the weather is.  </li>
            <li>This works for me identically to Crystal Body Deodorant Spray, has the exact ingredients in the exact same order:  HALLELUJAH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for effectiveness and environmental and health safety reasons.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGLY RECOMMENDED.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that I sweat slightly more than the average person, but not excessively.</li>
            <li>I feel safe using this deodorant, I just wish it kept body odor away a little longer.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, smells lovely when you first put on and immediately after it dries the subtle scent disappears.</li>
            <li>Is very efficient in removing odor in a natural way.</li>
            <li>For all natural deodorant try Alvera brand it really does work well.</li>
            <li>It was only a one day test, but for what it&#x27;s worth, that&#x27;s what happened.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I googled the main ingredient potassium alum and found out what it is:</li>
            <li>To be clear, typical deodorants do work better.</li>
            <li>spray, when applied liberally to your \\&quot;offending area,\\&quot; right after a shower will keep you smelling \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; for a solid 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>Only deodorant that is free of chemicals that actually works on me!</li>
            <li>so I feel like it&#x27;s refreshing :) got stocks for this because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m gonna run out of it one day,</li>
            <li>Certain people&#x27;s skin will break out into rash with this style of deodorant, especially if its not truly natural, and certain versions are not.</li>
            <li>I have alot of allergy problems, and my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Very surprised by the uncaring and unhelpful attitude by Amazon supervisor.  </li>
            <li>The oncologist gave me a bottle of the Naturally Fresh Deodorant Spray and told me to never use any other kind of deodorant, due to the harshness of regular deodorants.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied the deodorant I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t last me throughout the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, after a couple of weeks of daily use during hot summer weather, I am convinced of it&#x27;s odor fighting power.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Coming to Amazon.com, I noticed the reviews of the spray were a bit higher than the roll-on, so a bought a spray at a local store.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a deodorant stone, it is the only type of natural deodorant that has worked for me and works even better than conventional deodorant, and I wanted to see how the spray version of a deodorant stone would work out.</li>
            <li>I had a very hard time finding an odorless deodorant that I liked...</li>
            <li>or it goes on in a heavy stream rather than the fine mist I like to spray all over the arm pit and</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough for me to notice other than sniffing it in the bottle.</li>
            <li>end up wasting product to clear the clog</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for some &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants, but this did not deliver for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>water and natural mineral salts...</li>
            <li>After years of going through all the natural deodorants</li>
            <li>I used natural deodorants before but none of them worked so</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>I used to have to buy it at organic natural food stores, but now that I can get it on Amazon, I don&#x27;t buy it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>For allergy sufferers and chemically sensitive people, this product can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;contains natural mineral salts\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>If you are still using the old fashioned type of deodorant, educate yourself of the harmful effects and get on board with this pure/safe/effective deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I use it in several areas where too much sweat &#x3D; odor.  </li>
            <li>If you want a product that is natural, this is it.  </li>
            <li>If someone is sensitive to perfumes, you can wear this and, they won&#x27;t have a reaction.</li>
            <li>All natural and no aluminum.</li>
            <li>I find myself saving old pumps to replace those that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>because it is natural and despite my skin sensitivity I have no issues and do not smell when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>But so far we like it...</li>
            <li>At first 3 of the 12 seemed to have slightly loose caps with crusty stuff around the bottom of the cover.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been comfortable spraying harsh chemicals on a daily basis on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The pump action on some of the bottles in the 6 pack are annoying, but others were not, so I just used the pump top from the bottles that were no problem on the bottles where the pump top was sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I spray on the Naturally Fresh, I sprinkle on a mixture of 2/3 cornstarch and 1/3 baking soda if I want a little extra deodorant protection that day; the powder also keeps my clothes from getting wet from the deodorant if I&#x27;m getting dressed right away.</li>
            <li>One time usage in the morning keeps us going all day, night, and into the next early morning cardio-kickboxing class.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from deodorants that make me red and sore all my adult life.   </li>
            <li>Second, it doesn&#x27;t stain your shirts and 3rd, it last all day no matter how much you perspire.</li>
            <li>I got it this morning and couldn&#x27;t wait to try as it&#x27;s such a natural product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only negatives are that sometimes it is hard to accurately spray and feel thoroughly protected.</li>
            <li>I had wanted to get away from parabens and aluminum for some time, so finally I bought several natural deodorants at once to try them one at a time.</li>

            <li> again, good since we have 5 more bottles!!</li>
            <li> I found the spray to be very effective if you&#x27;re going to be sweating and want to smell good.</li>
            <li> It also makes a good travel bottle, for re-application throughout the day, or if you accidentally forget to put on deodorant before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> oh well, they probably thought it&#x27;s a good idea to not mention</li>
            <li> Good price on line.  </li>
            <li> Holds up fairly well</li>
            <li> This is a quality product and a really good valve.</li>
            <li> No chemicals, no side effects (except good ones), no problems.</li>
            <li> Good price and self-explanatory to use.</li>
            <li> Three sprays of this product under each arm in the morning, and I am good for the day.  </li>
            <li> I read a review from a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; blogger, who stated that she loved the roll-on variety of this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> (Because of fear, I ALMOST reapplied, but decided not to, to give it a fair chance.)  </li>
            <li> roll on is great for when you want to make sure you get good coverage of your underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great</li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m so grateful that amazon has it in bulk!  </li>
            <li> This thing is like magic!</li>
            <li> I never had to endure an adjustment phase when I quit using antiperspirant a decade or so ago--this was the first kind I tried and it worked perfectly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Works great for me and my wife and it&#x27;s chemical free.  </li>
            <li> After each use we remove the nozzle and run warm water over it to prevent any crystallization.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using about 4 of the 6 I bought on Amazon, the 5th sprayer gets clogged and does not mist so nicely.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deodorant, it feels like a spritz of water when applied, and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> and it is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Effective without the chemicals and additives in most deodorants.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It covers odors well and, best of all, it is all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> If you cant deal with stick deodorant for whatever reason, this is one of the best natural alternatives.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST NATURAL DEODORANT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to rinse the solid versions of salt deodorant after using them, so it&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to do that with the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found the product that really does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> Love this product - came very quickly, efficiently and safely!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than I can say for some of the non-natural deodorants I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of my favorite things about this deodorant is that it leaves no residue, so theirs</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use regular deodorant so this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This one and the crystal of the same brand are excellent.</li>
            <li> For some reason it has it&#x27;s own light &amp;#34;B.O.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> No problem with that since using this product : )</li>
            <li> so I buy it at Amazon to make sure I do not run out</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> And it goes without saying that it&#x27;s cheaper this way. :)</li>
            <li> It is a great deodorant, has no flowery odor, and it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Is that ok with you?</li>
            <li> no nasty chemicals!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very well satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truly HG for me  :)</li>
            <li> (it seems like you need to reapply more often though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this deodorant in the spray.  </li>
            <li> Way better than the salt balls/eggs because it&#x27;s more sanitary.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff though.</li>
            <li> I love this product more than anything I&#x27;ve tried for deo purposes.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and the price is very low.  </li>
            <li> The company is conscientious about making sure their customers are pleased.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for many years</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> HAVE USED PRODUCT FOR QUITE SOME TIME.VERY SATISFIED WITH THE WAY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and love the product in liquid form.</li>
            <li> More convenient, but remember to close your eyes when you spray it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I run most days</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I searched extensively for a deodorant that was non-toxic and this fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I tried this one.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I trusted the reviews, and tried it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I tried this product.</li>
            <li> Then she asked a supervisor who was most unhelpful and did not want to know anything.  </li>
            <li> This is better, but I have to combine it with alcohol to keep everything in check.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly even in for sports and day long activities.</li>
            <li> Beside the fact is very cheap this spray works perfectly , keeps my arm pits dry &amp; no smell !!</li>
            <li> in all, I am happy to find a natural product that works!</li>
            <li> spray on is great for immediately after shaving or when your underarms may be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> This product is great and natural.</li>
            <li> Most importantly neither of us has had any reactions to this product</li>
            <li> I also love how it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible and I do really like what it does when first applied, but it&#x27;s not a one-time per day application.  </li>
            <li> Much of the time I just didn&#x27;t use any deodorant - not always a good solution.  </li>
            <li> I was already familiar with potassium alum from the crystal blocks I bought to rub on my face after wet-shaving, but I didn&#x27;t know this stuff had so many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I sweat easily.</li>
            <li> There is one thing I had to get used to, but it was an easy trade-off.</li>
            <li> great product for those of us fortunate enough for it to work (as i&#x27;m told, its not for everybody)</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this at local stores, so we are happy Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> It goes on as light as water</li>
            <li> Keeps you odor free all day.</li>
            <li> Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s free of cancer causing aluminum.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves me odor free for 16 - 24 hours depending on my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> such a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I have remained odor free while using it</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but there are too many issues with the pump, many times they simply don&#x27;t work, even when new.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Review originally posted on NaturalFamilyToday.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for MANY years and really like it !  </li>
            <li> It is one of those rare times, when you get  considerably better product at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The original Rep wanted me to check the remaining bottles</li>
            <li> In defense of Naturally Fresh Deoderant, every DO I have ever tried has given me a huge rash under my arms.</li>
            <li> I feel I have a good grasp on how well the different kinds</li>
            <li> Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Roll On is available in stores across the country, including Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works for me :)</li>
            <li> Odor control is good, you may have to re-apply if you tend to be a sweaty individual.  </li>
            <li> Its safe and gentle to skin.</li>
            <li> It really feels fresh, lasts, and is safe to use.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> Much healthier alternative to the commercial brands which contain like a million ingredients and yet very… very effective by itself.</li>
            <li> It is effective and safe without aluminum and other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I got 6 bottles for pretty good price compared to how each cost individually at the health food store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy and fast to apply.</li>
            <li> The fine mist really improves application.</li>
            <li> Also AMAZING about this -- even the NEXT MORNING I don&#x27;t smell (yes,</li>
            <li> In our home we call &amp;#34;Naturally Fresh Crystal Spray Mist&amp;#34; the miracle deodorant.</li>
            <li> The spray is also nice for use by multiple family members to prevent the spread of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never did like deodorants that announced their presence with powerful scents.</li>
            <li> I have been using this naturally fresh deodorant crystal spray mist for 7 yrs.</li>
            <li> It works (does need to be reapplied midday as most natural products).</li>
            <li> have used Naturally Fresh for over a decade.</li>
            <li> Tell your friends that itt is really worth a try.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;d have to spray this on multiple times a day to be effective.</li>
            <li> I  bught the unscented and added my own essential oil (3 drops)</li>
            <li> Finally, I came across the Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray Mist Body Deodorant and it&#x27;s by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different antiperspirants, searching for one that wouldn&#x27;t make me itch, I was thrilled to find this.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny, folks.</li>
            <li> And the smell is amazing - very fresh but not intense.</li>
            <li> I have tried other \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; deodorants and this one works just as well, and even maybe better than most.</li>
            <li> Good for those who have allergies and other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> However, right around my 30th birthday I became allergic to ALL of them.</li>
            <li> My first reaction upon reading the ingredients was, \\&quot;Well, it doesn&#x27;t get much more natural than that.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I didnt have high expectations ,but I wanted to tried it because I wanted an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> I think the spray isn&#x27;t as effective in the long run, I&#x27;ll aim to post an update.</li>
            <li> …it&#x27;s clear, easy to use both at or away from home.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I was so happy with the spray, I decided to go back to the store to buy the roll-on of the same brand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The distributor of this product was VERY fast in delivering to my doorstep (thank god).</li>
            <li> It typically lasts all day and night under normal use (excluding workouts and mountain climbing), and is very effective at eliminating - not just masking - odors.</li>
            <li> Works great - if you sweat too much might still need to add a small bit of deodorant but most days this is enough!</li>
            <li> I no longer have to worry about unpleasent body odor because it really works!  </li>
            <li> Love these, especially that they are unscented.</li>
            <li> First, you do not smell like the deodorant and doesn&#x27;t clash with your favorate cologne or perfume.</li>
            <li> It works better than regular deodorant</li>
            <li> After years of trying to find a product for my son, this is the only deodorant that I was able to find that does not irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed some dryness under my arms at first</li>
            <li> This is used in hospital restrooms and is where I first came across the product.  </li>
            <li> The spray bottle does tend to get plugged up towards the end, so I find myself having to run it under hot water.</li>
            <li> My husband and I used this product in a hot and humid locale and it seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> He tells me all the time how much he likes the Naturally Fresh Spray Mist.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the solid.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend both the product and the seller, who provided quick and efficient packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also Eco friendly and made of natural products.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing for me is that it&#x27;s  non aggressive and keeps me fresh all</li>
            <li> I have tried several kinds of natural deodorant, including purple prairie botanicals deodorant stick and my own homemade deodorant paste.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re POSITIVE it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The Rep at first seemed very helpful and understood there was no way a customer could know about all 12 bottles until they are used, which would be a while.  </li>
            <li> For many years I have searched for high quality deodorants without all of the extra ingredients that may or may not clog our pores, that may or may not cause us allergic reactions, and that may or may not WORK well.  </li>
            <li> Natural, quick, does the job of controlling odor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough traveling overseas with...</li>
            <li> They each held up throughout the day, but the spray side was still going strong the next morning, not so with the roll-on side.  </li>
            <li> It works like a champ -- does not leave me dry, but certainly odor free!</li>
            <li> This is for certain a product that every woman should be using.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no room for companies like this on Amazon, who has a very high level of customer service.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for the little black dress too!</li>
            <li> Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal is made of water and natural mineral salts.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I use it very liberally.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone - because it works!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> I am very stinky and really searched to find a deodorant that takes care of that.</li>
            <li> Really works well for odor.</li>
            <li> and I bought the lavender scented version so it had added fragrance that was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really well.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that if it was so \\&quot;natural\\&quot; it might not work very well.</li>
            <li> Very well priced, this item works wonders</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> so very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the scented versions, but really prefer the unscented one.</li>
            <li> but overall I freely give it a 5-star for function, application and performance.</li>
            <li> Works really well, doesn&#x27;t stain cloths, dries fast</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It gets clogged very often.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well, all day.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend .</li>
            <li> also bought the roll on version, and it&#x27;s very practical.</li>
            <li> It may do the job for someone that does not sweat much but it did not do the job for me.</li>
            <li> But it eventually dries, and otherwise it really works - and works well.</li>
            <li> fast delivery I like it</li>
            <li> I order a whole case of it.</li>
            <li> Applying it took care of the smell immediately &amp; that really impresses me, but I don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to apply deodorant three times per day.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural options and this one makes my top three favs:</li>
            <li> To be honest it didn’t work for me because it was uncomfortably cold when applying, it wasn’t effective 100% because I had sprinkle some baking soda over my armpits after applying the crystal in order to be odorless 24</li>
            <li> Effective and odorless deodorant for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Because it is unscented, I look forward to experimenting with essential oils to create my own personal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine being without so found on Amazon and decided to pay the extra shipping... worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It will not keep you deodorized for long if you are doing yard work or cooking in a warm kitchen, but I recommend it as a daily deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and odor free no matter what the weather is.  </li>
            <li> This works for me identically to Crystal Body Deodorant Spray, has the exact ingredients in the exact same order:  HALLELUJAH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for effectiveness and environmental and health safety reasons.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGLY RECOMMENDED.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that I sweat slightly more than the average person, but not excessively.</li>
            <li> I feel safe using this deodorant, I just wish it kept body odor away a little longer.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, smells lovely when you first put on and immediately after it dries the subtle scent disappears.</li>
            <li> Is very efficient in removing odor in a natural way.</li>
            <li> For all natural deodorant try Alvera brand it really does work well.</li>
            <li> It was only a one day test, but for what it&#x27;s worth, that&#x27;s what happened.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I googled the main ingredient potassium alum and found out what it is:</li>
            <li> To be clear, typical deodorants do work better.</li>
            <li> spray, when applied liberally to your \\&quot;offending area,\\&quot; right after a shower will keep you smelling \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; for a solid 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> Only deodorant that is free of chemicals that actually works on me!</li>
            <li> so I feel like it&#x27;s refreshing :) got stocks for this because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m gonna run out of it one day,</li>
            <li> Certain people&#x27;s skin will break out into rash with this style of deodorant, especially if its not truly natural, and certain versions are not.</li>
            <li> I have alot of allergy problems, and my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Very surprised by the uncaring and unhelpful attitude by Amazon supervisor.  </li>
            <li> The oncologist gave me a bottle of the Naturally Fresh Deodorant Spray and told me to never use any other kind of deodorant, due to the harshness of regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied the deodorant I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t last me throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, after a couple of weeks of daily use during hot summer weather, I am convinced of it&#x27;s odor fighting power.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Coming to Amazon.com, I noticed the reviews of the spray were a bit higher than the roll-on, so a bought a spray at a local store.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a deodorant stone, it is the only type of natural deodorant that has worked for me and works even better than conventional deodorant, and I wanted to see how the spray version of a deodorant stone would work out.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time finding an odorless deodorant that I liked...</li>
            <li> or it goes on in a heavy stream rather than the fine mist I like to spray all over the arm pit and</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough for me to notice other than sniffing it in the bottle.</li>
            <li> end up wasting product to clear the clog</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants, but this did not deliver for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> water and natural mineral salts...</li>
            <li> After years of going through all the natural deodorants</li>
            <li> I used natural deodorants before but none of them worked so</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> I used to have to buy it at organic natural food stores, but now that I can get it on Amazon, I don&#x27;t buy it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> For allergy sufferers and chemically sensitive people, this product can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;contains natural mineral salts\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> If you are still using the old fashioned type of deodorant, educate yourself of the harmful effects and get on board with this pure/safe/effective deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I use it in several areas where too much sweat &#x3D; odor.  </li>
            <li> If you want a product that is natural, this is it.  </li>
            <li> If someone is sensitive to perfumes, you can wear this and, they won&#x27;t have a reaction.</li>
            <li> All natural and no aluminum.</li>
            <li> I find myself saving old pumps to replace those that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> because it is natural and despite my skin sensitivity I have no issues and do not smell when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> But so far we like it...</li>
            <li> At first 3 of the 12 seemed to have slightly loose caps with crusty stuff around the bottom of the cover.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been comfortable spraying harsh chemicals on a daily basis on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The pump action on some of the bottles in the 6 pack are annoying, but others were not, so I just used the pump top from the bottles that were no problem on the bottles where the pump top was sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I spray on the Naturally Fresh, I sprinkle on a mixture of 2/3 cornstarch and 1/3 baking soda if I want a little extra deodorant protection that day; the powder also keeps my clothes from getting wet from the deodorant if I&#x27;m getting dressed right away.</li>
            <li> One time usage in the morning keeps us going all day, night, and into the next early morning cardio-kickboxing class.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from deodorants that make me red and sore all my adult life.   </li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t stain your shirts and 3rd, it last all day no matter how much you perspire.</li>
            <li> I got it this morning and couldn&#x27;t wait to try as it&#x27;s such a natural product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negatives are that sometimes it is hard to accurately spray and feel thoroughly protected.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to get away from parabens and aluminum for some time, so finally I bought several natural deodorants at once to try them one at a time.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s not very particular about whether it&#x27;s natural or not as long as it works.  </li>
            <li> It does the job for 24 to 48 hours without fail, and I believe that it is far better for you than conventional  deodorants.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent natural product that is made in the USA and does what it says it will while costing 30-50% less than traditional commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li> Works well, no irritation, last a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as you wash before ( obviously ) apply , there should not be a problem.</li>
            <li> Does not stain your clothing, it keeps you dry, and it last all day.</li>
            <li> I also use a blow dryer to dry the areas I apply just because my skin can react to moisture left to accumulate</li>
            <li> Yet, if I didn&#x27;t reapply this spray at least once in the middle of the day and again before bed, the B.O. became very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, but every single bottle clogged, even the ones I didn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so most deodorants I have used in the past caused uncomfortable irritation.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, if I am having a bad aim day, I distribute the spray with my hand to make sure I am covered, but I don&#x27;t find that to be a big deal.  </li>
            <li> It lasts me a long time too.  </li>
            <li> I will continue the use of this product, as long is being produce.</li>
            <li> few months ago I tested out a natural deodorant fr an etsy vendor.</li>
            <li> It was found that 2 of the remaining 4 bottles had all this crusty stuff falling out as I opened them and one had a strange odor as well.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I was using a solid deodorant from Tom&#x27;s of Maine and it simply didn&#x27;t work all day.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try it, due to the fact that it is only a deodorant, and I perspire a lot.  </li>
            <li> found it kept my underarms fairly dry, but not over dry.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll have to let dry a bit before putting on your shirt.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, I stay dry using this even though it isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Naturally Fresh is the only alternative that works that doesn&#x27;t make me completely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day you have active work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single clogged sprayer since I started shaking it every time I use it.</li>
            <li> natural deodorants have not held up in the past</li>
            <li> I have tried the knock off one from GNC (pink bottle)</li>
            <li> After how well it worked on him after a day of being at work and going about his routine with absolutely no oder, I tried it myself and now I am hooked.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find, so</li>
            <li> No extra kick needed, it’s comparable to those heavy duty trucker deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding it a regular drugstore, so buying the 6 pack worked for me.</li>
            <li> I also hate to see deodorant under people&#x27;s arms including my own when you were sleeveless shirts.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s been a couple of times that over the course of a long, hard day it ran short on me</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in this after having high expectations from reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I was at first quite skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li> I usually use the solid crystal version, but this works well too</li>
            <li> Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, and I usually end up throwing the last bit out.</li>
            <li> I sent them an email, they claim they didn&#x27;t get it, when I followed up later, I was told as I was now past their warranty period (7 days), they would do nothing.  </li>
            <li> But, there&#x27;s no aluminum and other metals</li>
            <li> The other powders and sprays for feel do not help what so ever.  </li>
            <li> I applied the roll-on to one side and the spray to the other.  </li>
            <li> Also, this has no &#x27;after smell&#x27; that other deodorants have, NO STAIN causing ingredients.</li>
            <li> Tossing out my other deo!</li>
            <li> Then as each is used, at the 8th bottle, there was a slightly off odor.  </li>
            <li> We are almost through an entire bottle and we have not experienced the clogging that some of the other customers reported.</li>
            <li> I protects from oder for 24 hours, has no scent and a little 4-ounce bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li> Wait a few hours after shaving before applying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t cause an irritating rash.  </li>
            <li> When I found this deodorant a few years ago, I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> (like a dead animal)</li>
            <li> For some reason I cannot use the plain rock crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY brand Ill ever use.</li>
            <li> Be wary however, that you are getting the proper type.  </li>
            <li> As this is water-based and not alcohol-based, the underarms seem excessively moist upon application.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it ever since.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from aluminum in deodorants, and have had difficulty with the hard mineral stick deodorants.  </li>
            <li> It was late arriving, but it was probably because of the holiday season.</li>
            <li> At least, for me it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and my husband did not like it because it was too thick on the hair under his arms.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I mean you can use this spray ANYWHERE on your body that you&#x27;d like to</li>
            <li> No more irritation!</li>
            <li> NEVER, EVER fails me no matter how hot &amp; nasty it is outside.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an aluminum-free deodorant this is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this one would be different, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hubby works in hot attics as an a/c guy and would come home smelling awful!</li>
            <li> struggling w/ BO in any area, be advised this stuff keeps it from occurring (at least for me)!  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s back to the deodorant-stained undershirts for me. :(</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain any nasty ingredients.</li>
            <li> I hate regular deodorants that get on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> But I was also skeptical of how well it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Target stopped stocking it</li>
            <li> Useless product.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the crystal rocks for years but since a shoulder injury I&#x27;ve found it difficult to raise my arm to apply.  </li>
            <li> After continued use, the odor became worse and worse until it smelled so bad  </li>
            <li> In addition, I noticed that the bottle in question had the wrong cover on it.  </li>
            <li> they would let me order at one time) and the fact that it was also the least expensive i could find at the time was another reason to stock-up!!</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy....</li>
            <li> Apply once after bathing and forget about bad armpit odor, even during and after exercise… trust me, I’ve tested it.</li>
            <li> It keeps my shoes and feet from smelling bad.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> All deodorants give me a horrible rash.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband is allergic to other deodorants. He has used this spray with excellent results in controlling perspiration odor, with no skin breakouts or discomfort.  I can no longer find this at local stores, so we are happy Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> For many years I have searched for high quality deodorants without all of the extra ingredients that may or may not clog our pores, that may or may not cause us allergic reactions, and that may or may not WORK well.  In our home we call &amp;#34;Naturally Fresh Crystal Spray Mist&amp;#34; the miracle deodorant. One time usage in the morning keeps us going all day, night, and into the next early morning cardio-kickboxing class. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried several kinds of natural deodorant, including purple prairie botanicals deodorant stick and my own homemade deodorant paste. I feel I have a good grasp on how well the different kinds work.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve never tried something quite like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal is made of water and natural mineral salts. That&#x27;s it! My first reaction upon reading the ingredients was, \\&quot;Well, it doesn&#x27;t get much more natural than that.\\&quot; But I was also skeptical of how well it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied the deodorant I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t last me throughout the day. It goes on as light as water and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve put anything on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, after a couple of weeks of daily use during hot summer weather, I am convinced of it&#x27;s odor fighting power.&lt;br /&gt;I found it kept my underarms fairly dry, but not over dry. Even on the hottest days, when some sweat would get through the barrier of the deodorant, my armpits never got stinky enough where I felt that I needed to reapply. That&#x27;s more than I can say for some of the non-natural deodorants I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite things about this deodorant is that it leaves no residue, so theirs no chance you&#x27;ll smear deodorant all over your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray Mist and Roll On&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a bottle of spray mist and a roll on. I like both equally and for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The roll on is great for when you want to make sure you get good coverage of your underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray on is great for immediately after shaving or when your underarms may be a bit sensitive. It also makes a good travel bottle, for re-application throughout the day, or if you accidentally forget to put on deodorant before leaving the house. The spray is also nice for use by multiple family members to prevent the spread of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Roll On is available in stores across the country, including Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review originally posted on NaturalFamilyToday.comn stores across the country, including Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review originally posted on NaturalFamilyToday.com</li>
            <li> Great for anyone with skin sensitvity</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been comfortable spraying harsh chemicals on a daily basis on sensitive skin. I searched for years looking for a replacement for traditional under arm deodorant. I tried powders, and talcs but nothing seemed to work. One day I saw this product at Target and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. This product is amazing. I protects from oder for 24 hours, has no scent and a little 4-ounce bottle lasts for months. My wife and I both use it and would never go back to traditional sprays. This is one of those \\&quot;finds\\&quot; you just have to share with others. Unfortunately Target stopped stocking it and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it ever since. I can&#x27;t imagine being without so found on Amazon and decided to pay the extra shipping... worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use regular deodorant so this one is perfect.  Keeps you odor free all day.</li>
            <li> Would use this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for MANY years and really like it !  It works very well for me.  No scent to mix with my soap or perfume.  It lasts me a long time too.  I use it very liberally.  I tried the roll on once, but went back to the spray after it was gone.</li>
            <li> Works great - if you sweat too much might still need to add a small bit of deodorant but most days this is enough!</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product!  It works for me since I have problems with cysts under my arms.</li>
            <li> Works well, no irritation, last a long time. However both bottles I got crystallized around the spray nozzle and no longer work.  I have to pour a bit into my hands to apply.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace a product that avon discontinued. I have alot of allergy problems, and my skin is very sensitive. This product is great and natural.So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> At last I have a deodorant that I&#x27;m not allergic to!  I have suffered from deodorants that make me red and sore all my adult life.   Much of the time I just didn&#x27;t use any deodorant - not always a good solution.  Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray is fantastic! I no longer have to worry about unpleasent body odor because it really works!  Furthermore it has no scent, which I think is great!  I never did like deodorants that announced their presence with powerful scents. I highly recommend this product to everyone - because it works!</li>
            <li> Effective without the chemicals and additives in most deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The severity of my allergies &amp; chemical sensitivities make it necessary for me to constantly search for products that are non toxic to me, but also do what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant that is free of chemicals that actually works on me!</li>
            <li> In defense of Naturally Fresh Deoderant, every DO I have ever tried has given me a huge rash under my arms. I had hoped this one would be different, but I was disappointed. Rash took about 1 week to dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems this works for some people, just not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care (as per reviews) what&#x27;s in it. It is salt and water -WHATEVER it is IT WORKS for me and has for 1 5 years. This is the ONLY brand Ill ever use. I have tried the knock off one from GNC (pink bottle) NO  it doesn&#x27;t work like this brand.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain any nasty ingredients. Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> Love these, especially that they are unscented.</li>
            <li> I have been using this naturally fresh deodorant crystal spray mist for 7 yrs. I will continue the use of this product, as long is being produce. The best three things that I like. First, you do not smell like the deodorant and doesn&#x27;t clash with your favorate cologne or perfume. Second, it doesn&#x27;t stain your shirts and 3rd, it last all day no matter how much you perspire.</li>
            <li> It works well. I do not have any dampness or odor&lt;br /&gt;in the armpits. It works better than regular deodorant&lt;br /&gt;that has the harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to find a product for my son, this is the only deodorant that I was able to find that does not irritate his skin. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is yet another product I have been ordering and using for a number of years, and I have always found it very effective.</li>
            <li> I am very stinky and really searched to find a deodorant that takes care of that. for years I used the toxic Degree, but finally it began to make my pits itch. I had wanted to get away from parabens and aluminum for some time, so finally I bought several natural deodorants at once to try them one at a time. This one and the crystal of the same brand are excellent. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants, but this did not deliver for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a month or so, I still don&#x27;t think it worked at all. Not only that, but every single bottle clogged, even the ones I didn&#x27;t use. None of them will even spray anymore. Useless product.</li>
            <li> This works well for me when coupled with baby powder.  For some reason it has it&#x27;s own light &amp;#34;B.O.&amp;#34; smell...it doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough for me to notice other than sniffing it in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I feel safe using this deodorant, I just wish it kept body odor away a little longer.</li>
            <li> Really works well for odor. My hubby works in hot attics as an a/c guy and would come home smelling awful! No problem with that since using this product : )</li>
            <li> I normally use a deodorant stone, it is the only type of natural deodorant that has worked for me and works even better than conventional deodorant, and I wanted to see how the spray version of a deodorant stone would work out. This works as well as a deodorant stone and I bought the lavender scented version so it had added fragrance that was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the spray because you can also spray it on your shirt underarms, as well as skin, to prevent sweat odor in your clothes. I found the spray to be very effective if you&#x27;re going to be sweating and want to smell good.</li>
            <li> I have no clue how this works as well as it does.....water and natural mineral salts...and that&#x27;s all.  No chemicals, fragrance, or propellants.  Looks like water and you&#x27;re POSITIVE it won&#x27;t work.  Except it does.  Really well.  After  playing tennis in the summer for several hours......people still hang out with me afterwards!  My husband ran out of his giant spray in the bronze can and asked if he could borrow my Crystal Spray. He LOVES it. I order the six-pack and we split it. I get 4 and he gets 2.  Try it.  You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> The only one which works for me so I buy it at Amazon to make sure I do not run out, otherwise it&#x27;s a case of the &amp;#34;billies&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> It works (does need to be reapplied midday as most natural products). I noticed some dryness under my arms at first but that was the only drawback. I&#x27;ve tried several natural options and this one makes my top three favs: Lavanilla, this product, &amp; Melvita&#x27;s roll on.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product and I&#x27;ll be using this forever. All I have to do is spray it and i&#x27;m all set. It is odorless ....doesn&#x27;t give you any smell at all so I feel like it&#x27;s refreshing :) got stocks for this because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m gonna run out of it one day, couldn&#x27;t exchange it with any product. It really works for me :)</li>
            <li> I was at first quite skeptical of this product. I am a sweaty woman who enjoys working out and the outdoors. It works like a champ -- does not leave me dry, but certainly odor free! I have worked out, gone to the beach, lake and pool with this on and it definitely does the job! Tossing out my other deo!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years now.  I order them online as I can get a 6 pack and be set for a while.  I hate regular deodorants that get on your clothes.  I also hate to see deodorant under people&#x27;s arms including my own when you were sleeveless shirts.  This is perfect as it is effective and you don&#x27;t see any residue.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant. It&#x27;s the only one that won&#x27;t give him a rash under his arms.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that my husband with sens. skin can use. Keeps him smelling good even in the Albuquerque heat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy and it works. After years of going through all the natural deodorants this is the one. I have used twelve bottles and just bought my third six pack.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product works so well! I got it this morning and couldn&#x27;t wait to try as it&#x27;s such a natural product. I used natural deodorants before but none of them worked so I&#x27;m so happy to have found the product that really does what it says it does! And the smell is amazing - very fresh but not intense.</li>
            <li> I had chemotherapy and radiation treatments at M.D. Anderson for breast cancer. The oncologist gave me a bottle of the Naturally Fresh Deodorant Spray and told me to never use any other kind of deodorant, due to the harshness of regular deodorants. I was worried that if it was so \\&quot;natural\\&quot; it might not work very well. I was wrong. It works great, with no irritation at all. I would definitely recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this...she is a breast cancer survivor and her doctor suggests deodorant with no aluminum chlorhydrade....this deodorant works well, and I work out every day and I&#x27;m very pleased!  This is one of the only places I can get this type of deodorant...Wal Mart does not carry it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I never had to endure an adjustment phase when I quit using antiperspirant a decade or so ago--this was the first kind I tried and it worked perfectly so I never looked elsewhere. No chemicals. All natural. NO body odor. I started with the rock, then switched to the roll-on, and now exclusively use the spray. And at the risk of grossing people out, I&#x27;ve also used it as a feminine deodorizer and it worked for that too. I used to have to buy it at organic natural food stores, but now that I can get it on Amazon, I don&#x27;t buy it anywhere else. And it goes without saying that it&#x27;s cheaper this way. :)</li>
            <li> great product for those of us fortunate enough for it to work (as i&#x27;m told, its not for everybody)…it&#x27;s clear, easy to use both at or away from home.  i highly recommend both the product and the seller, who provided quick and efficient packaging.</li>
            <li> For allergy sufferers and chemically sensitive people, this product can&#x27;t be beat. It is a great deodorant, has no flowery odor, and it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I googled the main ingredient potassium alum and found out what it is: Potassium alum, potash alum or tawas is the potassium double sulfate of aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;On the back of the bottle it says: \\&quot;contains natural mineral salts\\&quot;, oh well, they probably thought it&#x27;s a good idea to not mention which salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing. If you are looking for an aluminum-free deodorant this is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> works even in the south.  Have used this product for years.  Good price on line.  Is that ok with you?</li>
            <li> Natural, quick, does the job of controlling odor.  Don&#x27;t expect it to be an antiperspirant (use corn starch for that after the mist dries).  No fear of aluminum absorption from antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Holds up fairly well and well enough considering no toxic aluminums!!!!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Very well priced, this item works wonders</li>
            <li> If you are still using the old fashioned type of deodorant, educate yourself of the harmful effects and get on board with this pure/safe/effective deodorant.  Works perfectly even in for sports and day long activities.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product and a really good valve. I have tried other \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; deodorants and this one works just as well, and even maybe better than most. It can and will protect me for up to about 20-24 hours....and I like the convenience of it being a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BIG plus.............no nasty chemicals!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very good product and it really works. Does not stain your clothing, it keeps you dry, and it last all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mist instead of regular deodorants  for about 10 years now. It&#x27;s free of cancer causing aluminum. This is for certain a product that every woman should be using. Your body will get used to it in time &amp; you will begin to see the results.</li>
            <li> This works for me identically to Crystal Body Deodorant Spray, has the exact ingredients in the exact same order:  HALLELUJAH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone struggling w/ BO in any area, be advised this stuff keeps it from occurring (at least for me)!  I use it in several areas where too much sweat &#x3D; odor.  I also use a blow dryer to dry the areas I apply just because my skin can react to moisture left to accumulate (intertrigo is the official name).  This stuff leaves me odor free for 16 - 24 hours depending on my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this (or Crystal depending on access, price) for years now &#x3D; so very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly HG for me  :)</li>
            <li> I usually use the solid crystal version, but this works well too (it seems like you need to reapply more often though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Naturally Fresh for over a decade. To be clear, typical deodorants do work better. However, right around my 30th birthday I became allergic to ALL of them. All deodorants give me a horrible rash. Naturally Fresh is the only alternative that works that doesn&#x27;t make me completely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time.  This product is great.</li>
            <li> On my quest for a non toxic way of getting not so stinky pits I tried this deodorant... It didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> We love the smell of this product.  It covers odors well and, best of all, it is all natural ingredients.  This is used in hospital restrooms and is where I first came across the product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant in the spray.  I have used it for years.  Scent-free and does not discolor clothing or have harmful chemicals.  I tried it in the &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; (rock-like) form but did not like that.</li>
            <li> If you want a product that is natural, this is it.  It is a spray on, so you&#x27;ll have to let dry a bit before putting on your shirt.  Odor control is good, you may have to re-apply if you tend to be a sweaty individual.  If someone is sensitive to perfumes, you can wear this and, they won&#x27;t have a reaction.</li>
            <li> Way better than the salt balls/eggs because it&#x27;s more sanitary. It&#x27;s best to rinse the solid versions of salt deodorant after using them, so it&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to do that with the spray bottle. The spray bottle does tend to get plugged up towards the end, so I find myself having to run it under hot water. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, and I usually end up throwing the last bit out. I love this stuff though. I&#x27;ve tried the scented versions, but really prefer the unscented one.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s been a couple of times that over the course of a long, hard day it ran short on me but overall I freely give it a 5-star for function, application and performance.</li>
            <li> No chemicals, no side effects (except good ones), no problems. I love this product more than anything I&#x27;ve tried for deo purposes.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  It is effective and safe without aluminum and other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is excellent! Works really well, doesn&#x27;t stain cloths, dries fast n doesn&#x27;t leave residue on the skin. Perfect for the little black dress too!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and the price is very low.  It does the job for 24 to 48 hours without fail, and I believe that it is far better for you than conventional  deodorants.  Tell your friends that itt is really worth a try. It is one of those rare times, when you get  considerably better product at a much more reasonable price. The company is conscientious about making sure their customers are pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product. Is very efficient in removing odor in a natural way. Does not cause any redness or itching of the armpits. Wait a few hours after shaving before applying it.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for many years and I can attest to the fact that it works.  :)</li>
            <li> such a great deal.  great deodorant</li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m so grateful that amazon has it in bulk!  Now I don&#x27;t have to travel to the specialty store and I can use the necessary amount!  I highly recommend this product! Its safe and gentle to skin.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great and has no chemical additives.  All natural and no aluminum.</li>
            <li> Have used this type of deodorant for years, and I am a big guy who delivered mail in the heat for 30 plus years! Works great!</li>
            <li> the deodorant is excellent, even my husband uses it, but the spray is horrible. It gets clogged very often.</li>
            <li> Great as always.  If you cant deal with stick deodorant for whatever reason, this is one of the best natural alternatives.  Be wary however, that you are getting the proper type.  Certain people&#x27;s skin will break out into rash with this style of deodorant, especially if its not truly natural, and certain versions are not.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time finding an odorless deodorant that I liked... This is it! It does the job and doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin or clothes. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it and always keep some extras in my cabinet just in case.</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  This stuff actually works.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple others and this is the only one that my wife will use and she&#x27;s not very particular about whether it&#x27;s natural or not as long as it works.  It works so well i bought 3 6-packs (the max they would let me order at one time) and the fact that it was also the least expensive i could find at the time was another reason to stock-up!!</li>
            <li> This thing is like magic! My husband is allergic to regular deodorants so this was a purchase for him. After how well it worked on him after a day of being at work and going about his routine with absolutely no oder, I tried it myself and now I am hooked. We are almost through an entire bottle and we have not experienced the clogging that some of the other customers reported. After each use we remove the nozzle and run warm water over it to prevent any crystallization. Most importantly neither of us has had any reactions to this product</li>
            <li> Love this product - came very quickly, efficiently and safely!</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in this after having high expectations from reading other reviews.  I feel like I&#x27;d have to spray this on multiple times a day to be effective.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED PRODUCT FOR QUITE SOME TIME.VERY SATISFIED WITH THE WAY IT WORKS AND DOES NOT CAUSE ANY IRRITATION. RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but there are too many issues with the pump, many times they simply don&#x27;t work, even when new.  They clog often.  I find myself saving old pumps to replace those that don&#x27;t work. For that reason I would give the product a solid 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this 1 star is the vendor.  Their customer service is non-existent.  I sent them an email, they claim they didn&#x27;t get it, when I followed up later, I was told as I was now past their warranty period (7 days), they would do nothing.  There&#x27;s no room for companies like this on Amazon, who has a very high level of customer service.  AVOID THIS VENDOR.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> For some reason I cannot use the plain rock crystal deodorant. It just doesn&#x27;t work and makes me stinky. This stuff works very well, all day. For both me, my husband, and my daughter. I  bught the unscented and added my own essential oil (3 drops) so i could customize the scent. Great product, will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I didnt have high expectations ,but I wanted to tried it because I wanted an aluminum free deodorant. Beside the fact is very cheap this spray works perfectly , keeps my arm pits dry &amp; no smell !!As long as you wash before ( obviously ) apply , there should not be a problem. absolutely recommend .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and love the product in liquid form. Much easier to apply than solid crystal which needs to be rinsed and dried after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using about 4 of the 6 I bought on Amazon, the 5th sprayer gets clogged and does not mist so nicely. The fine mist really improves application. I switched the srayer from another bottle that was working and it still gets clogged frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I end up wasting product to clear the clog or it goes on in a heavy stream rather than the fine mist I like to spray all over the arm pit and surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even apply in evenings, after showers, etc. because it is natural and despite my skin sensitivity I have no issues and do not smell when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend for effectiveness and environmental and health safety reasons.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I also love how it is fragrance free. I think the spray has fewer ingredients than the same brand in roll-on form. After I spray on the Naturally Fresh, I sprinkle on a mixture of 2/3 cornstarch and 1/3 baking soda if I want a little extra deodorant protection that day; the powder also keeps my clothes from getting wet from the deodorant if I&#x27;m getting dressed right away. I shake the bottle before I use it every time; that mixes in all the salts and prevents settled salts on the bottom from clogging the spray. I haven&#x27;t had a single clogged sprayer since I started shaking it every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and I sweat easily. So far I like it, I think it helps and I like that I got 6 bottles for pretty good price compared to how each cost individually at the health food store.</li>
            <li> I was already familiar with potassium alum from the crystal blocks I bought to rub on my face after wet-shaving, but I didn&#x27;t know this stuff had so many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray, when applied liberally to your \\&quot;offending area,\\&quot; right after a shower will keep you smelling \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; for a solid 24 hours.  When I say \\&quot;offending area,\\&quot; I mean you can use this spray ANYWHERE on your body that you&#x27;d like to \\&quot;tame.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also taken to using this spray on my face after wet-shaving in place of the alum block I have. More convenient, but remember to close your eyes when you spray it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent natural product that is made in the USA and does what it says it will while costing 30-50% less than traditional commercial deodorants. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and odor free no matter what the weather is.  It is getting harder to find, so I hope you will continue to keep it in stock.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought the rock and it was a bit unpractical to apply. To be honest it didn’t work for me because it was uncomfortably cold when applying, it wasn’t effective 100% because I had sprinkle some baking soda over my armpits after applying the crystal in order to be odorless 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the roll on version, and it&#x27;s very practical. Finally, I came across the Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray Mist Body Deodorant and it&#x27;s by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far. It&#x27;s so easy and fast to apply. Much healthier alternative to the commercial brands which contain like a million ingredients and yet very… very effective by itself. No extra kick needed, it’s comparable to those heavy duty trucker deodorants. Apply once after bathing and forget about bad armpit odor, even during and after exercise… trust me, I’ve tested it. I run most days and I sweat a lot, even still my armpit smells nothing at all. What a great brand! Keep tuned for my reviews on their products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant I can use without having an allergic reaction to. No scent so that&#x27;s a bummer. But, there&#x27;s no aluminum and other metals so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me. Good price and self-explanatory to use.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that I have used for years. It works extemely well at keeping oder at bay and is the onle deodorant that does not breakout my underarms. If could&#x27;nt get this product I don&#x27;t know what I could use.</li>
            <li> My husband and I used this product in a hot and humid locale and it seemed to work pretty well. It&#x27;s easy enough traveling overseas with...no leaks.  I also couldn&#x27;t notice any smelliness on us, which is good!  As advertised, we sprayed this also on areas like the back that could also get sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I think the spray isn&#x27;t as effective in the long run, I&#x27;ll aim to post an update. But so far we like it...again, good since we have 5 more bottles!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  I searched extensively for a deodorant that was non-toxic and this fits the bill perfectly.  As for how it works, it works perfectly.  Previously, I was using a solid deodorant from Tom&#x27;s of Maine and it simply didn&#x27;t work all day.  That is to say, by the end of the day, I was experiencing underarm odor. :-(  Three sprays of this product under each arm in the morning, and I am good for the day.  Made in the USA, non-toxic.  Score!</li>
            <li> DOes not work by evening I am stinking!  It may do the job for someone that does not sweat much but it did not do the job for me. I would not recommend.  For all natural deodorant try Alvera brand it really does work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t cause an irritating rash.  It was late arriving, but it was probably because of the holiday season.</li>
            <li> Even &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; deoderants caused me to break out in a rash, but since I found this several years ago, I&#x27;ve had no problems. And no one had mentioned body oder so I guess it works.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so most deodorants I have used in the past caused uncomfortable irritation. When I found this deodorant a few years ago, I had to give it a try. And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. No more irritation! It typically lasts all day and night under normal use (excluding workouts and mountain climbing), and is very effective at eliminating - not just masking - odors. There is one thing I had to get used to, but it was an easy trade-off. As this is water-based and not alcohol-based, the underarms seem excessively moist upon application. But it eventually dries, and otherwise it really works - and works well.</li>
            <li> Effective and odorless deodorant for everyday use.  It even deodorizes if you spray it on smelly clothes.</li>
            <li> The pump action on some of the bottles in the 6 pack are annoying, but others were not, so I just used the pump top from the bottles that were no problem on the bottles where the pump top was sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the deodorant product is wonderful.  It really feels fresh, lasts, and is safe to use.  I got the tip to buy this from the environmental work group skin deep database and I am glad I tried this one.  I bought another all natural/organic deodorant that was in a stick and my husband did not like it because it was too thick on the hair under his arms.  He tells me all the time how much he likes the Naturally Fresh Spray Mist.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day you have active work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years and years and I can&#x27;t find any better.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s delicate,gentle on the skin and prevents any BO. It&#x27;s also Eco friendly and made of natural products.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing for me is that it&#x27;s  non aggressive and keeps me fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I can find it on amazon so I never run out now and get paranoid as to where I&#x27;m going to find my next bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using the roll on for years, and it is so effective!!!  I wanted the spray for my feet!  It keeps my shoes and feet from smelling bad.  It is great stuff.  The other powders and sprays for feel do not help what so ever.  This does.  I know this sounds crazy....but I needed something for my feet...and if it works for under arms...why not feet?  Let it dry...and on the socks and shoes.  GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deodorant, it feels like a spritz of water when applied, and dries fast.  It will not clog your pores, as it is not an antiperspirant.  It will not keep you deodorized for long if you are doing yard work or cooking in a warm kitchen, but I recommend it as a daily deodorant.  Comes in a pump spray bottle, so there is no propellant, and container can be recycled.  I have trouble finding it a regular drugstore, so buying the 6 pack worked for me.</li>
            <li> fast delivery I like it&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> After years of trying different antiperspirants, searching for one that wouldn&#x27;t make me itch, I was thrilled to find this.  I was hesitant to try it, due to the fact that it is only a deodorant, and I perspire a lot.  For some reason, I stay dry using this even though it isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant.  I have not had itchy underarms, or a rash either.  I am so glad that I trusted the reviews, and tried it.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I read a review from a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; blogger, who stated that she loved the roll-on variety of this deodorant.  Coming to Amazon.com, I noticed the reviews of the spray were a bit higher than the roll-on, so a bought a spray at a local store.  I was a bit leery...natural deodorants have not held up in the past but I thought I&#x27;d keep hope and try out this one.  I applied it in the morning after my shower and went to my Zumba class in the evening.  (Because of fear, I ALMOST reapplied, but decided not to, to give it a fair chance.)  It passed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was so happy with the spray, I decided to go back to the store to buy the roll-on of the same brand.  I applied the roll-on to one side and the spray to the other.  They each held up throughout the day, but the spray side was still going strong the next morning, not so with the roll-on side.  It was only a one day test, but for what it&#x27;s worth, that&#x27;s what happened.  I returned the roll-on and plan to buy a 6-pack of the spray.  Because it is unscented, I look forward to experimenting with essential oils to create my own personal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives are that sometimes it is hard to accurately spray and feel thoroughly protected. (I do 4 sprays covering the corners, overlapping in the middle.)  Occasionally, if I am having a bad aim day, I distribute the spray with my hand to make sure I am covered, but I don&#x27;t find that to be a big deal.  Also, if you have any cuts from shaving, it stings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am happy to find a natural product that works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the crystal rocks for years but since a shoulder injury I&#x27;ve found it difficult to raise my arm to apply.  I have been using this spray for a week now and am so impressed!! I have remained odor free while using it and it is very easy to apply.  I am so glad that I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray mist for quite some time now.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great, doesn&#x27;t ruin or stain my clothers.  I also spray it on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;No more stinky feet!  Yay!</li>
            <li> As always, natural,unscented and it always works!  I like it better than the solid.  Will purchase again and again. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Good for those who have allergies and other skin conditions.  Works well with kids too.  Item just as described.  Quick shipping.  Arrived intact.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST deodorant. PERIOD. I have been using it for a few years now. NEVER, EVER fails me no matter how hot &amp; nasty it is outside. Also, this has no &#x27;after smell&#x27; that other deodorants have, NO STAIN causing ingredients. It dries fast, smells lovely when you first put on and immediately after it dries the subtle scent disappears. This is a GOOD thing -- no scent to mix with one&#x27;s sweat &amp; make something funky (Ewww!). Also AMAZING about this -- even the NEXT MORNING I don&#x27;t smell (yes, sometimes on a Saturday/Sunday I laze in bed in the a.m.).&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I tested out a natural deodorant fr an etsy vendor. Big mistake. I repeat THIS IS THE BEST NATURAL DEODORANT THERE IS OUT THERE. HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGLY RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;The distributor of this product was VERY fast in delivering to my doorstep (thank god). I order a whole case of it. Worth every penny, folks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible and I do really like what it does when first applied, but it&#x27;s not a one-time per day application.  At least, for me it isn&#x27;t. I find that I sweat slightly more than the average person, but not excessively. Yet, if I didn&#x27;t reapply this spray at least once in the middle of the day and again before bed, the B.O. became very noticeable.  Applying it took care of the smell immediately &amp; that really impresses me, but I don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to apply deodorant three times per day.  So, it&#x27;s back to the deodorant-stained undershirts for me. :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I made purchasing these in bulk from Amazon.com  LLC.  At first 3 of the 12 seemed to have slightly loose caps with crusty stuff around the bottom of the cover.  Then as each is used, at the 8th bottle, there was a slightly off odor.  After continued use, the odor became worse and worse until it smelled so bad  (like a dead animal) I decided to call Amazon.  The Rep at first seemed very helpful and understood there was no way a customer could know about all 12 bottles until they are used, which would be a while.  Then she asked a supervisor who was most unhelpful and did not want to know anything.  In addition, I noticed that the bottle in question had the wrong cover on it.  The original Rep wanted me to check the remaining bottles and I did so while on the phone with her.  It was found that 2 of the remaining 4 bottles had all this crusty stuff falling out as I opened them and one had a strange odor as well.  These bottles had NO expiration date on them.  They had a manufacturing date of 12/2012.  They were purchased in 2013.  I would expect them to last long enough to use,  Apparently defective from the start.  They were sold by Amazon.com LLC, not a third party.  Very surprised by the uncaring and unhelpful attitude by Amazon supervisor.  I purchase quite a bit on Amazon.  So, CONSUMER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this.  I wanted to get away from aluminum in deodorants, and have had difficulty with the hard mineral stick deodorants.  This is better, but I have to combine it with alcohol to keep everything in check.  But, if I use both, I don&#x27;t have underarm odor.</li>
            <li> Works great for me and my wife and it&#x27;s chemical free.  Three of four squirts under each arm lasts all day if you work indoors.</li>
