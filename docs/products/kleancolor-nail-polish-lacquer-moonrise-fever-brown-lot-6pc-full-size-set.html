            <li>First, I just want to say that I change up my nail polish a LOT, so these are perfect for me, but if you want a week-long manicure, expect to touch this up</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>colors in this set are amazing...</li>
            <li>I love the attractive colors however this polish peels off even after a top coat.</li>
            <li>worriee thst I may need more than one coat ofnpolish but its perfect with the first coat.</li>
            <li>Chips easy, but the colors are nice and if you use a good quality top coat it stays on longer.</li>
            <li>This set is ok though.</li>
            <li>The Silver, copper, and light cream are kind of nifty.</li>
            <li>I love the way these polishes look and how even it coats.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are wonderful and just simply gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>

            <li>, this is a pretty good set.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality polish for price.</li>
            <li>Coverage is pretty good, expect to use two coats.</li>
            <li>However, it chips off way too easy, even with a top coat protectant.</li>
            <li>The Americano metallic changes color when clear coat is applied, but it still looks great.</li>
            <li>It lasts weeks without chipping,and is easy to remove when you want another color.</li>
            <li>chips easy...</li>
            <li>Colors are OK, nothing special</li>
            <li>The polish itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>CHEAP AND STICKY GOES ON</li>
            <li>For the value, you can really have fun mixing and matching the colors to make your own unique nail art.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d try again with a couple top coats because I really like the colors.</li>
            <li>Especially the copper, copper really looks good on shorter nails.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I received my order earlier than expected and the colors are great!</li>
            <li>The colors were vibrant, shining and non watery, unlike the cheap brands like Spoiled.</li>
            <li>The gold is kind of an odd color, but not bad.</li>
            <li>The pricing was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Great price for these &amp;#34; hard to find&amp;#34; shades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only able to get a day wear after a polishing.</li>
            <li>exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>fast SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>cheaper kind not bad bad though pretty good</li>
            <li>Will chip after 1-2 days of wearing, but is easily reapplied as it only needs about 2 coats.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors from this company are kind of dull and gross.</li>
            <li>IT was fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I recieved my product fast and I am a satified customer.</li>
            <li>Glitter fleck silver, bronze, &amp; gold, deep chocolate brown, true garnet, and a shimmery pink that is very feminine &amp; looks great over other colors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got the whole set for the price of one bottle of high end nail polish...</li>
            <li>When i recieved the product, i was surprised to find out that no one had ever reviewed it.</li>
            <li>The colors were really classy</li>
            <li>/&gt;The color goes on thick &amp; glossy, but even with a top coat</li>
            <li>The last two I could live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even when using my hands all day the polish still stayed on completely throughout my entire shift.</li>

            <li> For my first &amp;#34;experiment,&amp;#34; I used the sandy color as a base, then made an ombre from the dark brown near the cuticle, to the reddish, to the copper, and finally the yellow/gold closest to the tip.</li>
            <li> Not really anythimg bad just put it back on</li>
            <li> Swapping out the brown with a lighter brown or a different color to base under the other metallics would have rated the collection 5 stars.</li>
            <li> LIKE CRAP AND</li>

            <li> Most of the colors from this company are kind of dull and gross. This set is ok though. The Silver, copper, and light cream are kind of nifty. The gold is kind of an odd color, but not bad. The last two I could live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for some inexpensive metallic shades though, this is a pretty good set.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars was because some of the colors were not what they looked like on the monitor.  The polish itself is fantastic. It lasts weeks without chipping,and is easy to remove when you want another color.</li>
            <li> I love these colors! Especially the copper, copper really looks good on shorter nails.</li>
            <li> I love the way these polishes look and how even it coats. However, it chips off way too easy, even with a top coat protectant. I&#x27;m only able to get a day wear after a polishing. for this I only give it three stars</li>
            <li> Does not last long...chips easy...colors are good</li>
            <li> These six colors are perfect for my skin tone. For my first &amp;#34;experiment,&amp;#34; I used the sandy color as a base, then made an ombre from the dark brown near the cuticle, to the reddish, to the copper, and finally the yellow/gold closest to the tip. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments! For the value, you can really have fun mixing and matching the colors to make your own unique nail art.</li>
            <li> They come with all the colors you ordered none left out none added and they work oretty well but sometimes the handle pops off. Not really anythimg bad just put it back on and it will still work. Oh and the polish itself is the stickyer cheaper kind not bad bad though pretty good</li>
            <li> CHEAP AND STICKY GOES ON LIKE CRAP AND LOOKS WAVEY AND GROSS.</li>
            <li> When i was searching for nailpolish, in my price range, i laid my eyes on this one. Although, no one had reviewed it, i took chance with it. When i recieved the product, i was surprised to find out that no one had ever reviewed it. The colors were vibrant, shining and non watery, unlike the cheap brands like Spoiled. The colors were really classy and i am recomming this brand to everyone who loves the Beige shades. Go for it!</li>
            <li> All of the colors are wonderful and just simply gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Im a waitress, and even when using my hands all day the polish still stayed on completely throughout my entire shift. I absolutely love the colors and it stays on wonderfully with just one coat.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves the shades of them .</li>
            <li> IT was fast shipping. I love the colors. Well worth it. I paint my nails on a regular bases. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> these were listed as a gift set - I expected them to come in a box not just wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Polish is really good.</li>
            <li> I received my order earlier than expected and the colors are great! Iwas worriee thst I may need more than one coat ofnpolish but its perfect with the first coat.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors.....fast deliveey.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great price for these &amp;#34; hard to find&amp;#34; shades. Love these colors for winter. Pretty good quality polish for price.</li>
            <li> First, I just want to say that I change up my nail polish a LOT, so these are perfect for me, but if you want a week-long manicure, expect to touch this up A LOT!&lt;br /&gt;The color goes on thick &amp; glossy, but even with a top coat, chips easily.&lt;br /&gt;The colors in this set are amazing... Glitter fleck silver, bronze, &amp; gold, deep chocolate brown, true garnet, and a shimmery pink that is very feminine &amp; looks great over other colors.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans up easily, with no lingering discoloration, and I especially love the price!</li>
            <li> Coverage is pretty good, expect to use two coats. The Americano metallic changes color when clear coat is applied, but it still looks great. The red and the brown are very similar and the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Swapping out the brown with a lighter brown or a different color to base under the other metallics would have rated the collection 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Chips easy, but the colors are nice and if you use a good quality top coat it stays on longer.</li>

            <li> Great assortment of colors. Will chip after 1-2 days of wearing, but is easily reapplied as it only needs about 2 coats. Bottles are regular sized, and will last a long time.</li>
