    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Its ergonomic design fits beautifully in one&#x27;s hand making trimming a pleasure, and its titanium cutter needs no lubrication(yippie!).  </li>
            <li>I trim wiht the lowest 2 levels and it is perfect for beard and moustache.</li>
            <li>I have looked at others since buying the Remington and am convinced that this is the best.</li>

            <li>It is great at that!  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>For the price, this is one of, if not, the best trimmer out there in terms of value to performance.</li>
            <li>the reliable (although not the greatest beard guard) Wahl.    </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, at a very good price.  </li>
            <li>The trim was great at the lowest setting, the perfect length for me.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find, however, is that the shave experience was absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the MB-300 as a replacement, and is it ever a joy to use.......</li>
            <li>Great for beards.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>The sides have a tacky surface to help you hold the trimmer which helps greatly.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer worked out great for me.  </li>
            <li>Its nine levels of trimming lengths are great for a close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall and happy with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, i am happy \\&quot;now\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>A dual voltage option would have been great .</li>
            <li>I bought this for my goateed husband and it does a great job keeping his whiskers well-trimmed.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>But in the meanwhile, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.    </li>
            <li>I found this tool very effective.    </li>
            <li>Newer isn&#x27;t always better and this is an excellent feature they should have kept.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s served me well and the rechargeable battery still holds a good charge, but I never bothered to lubricate the cutter(lazy me)</li>
            <li>Good number of settings.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t imagine that it would not be good.  </li>
            <li>I have had a NORELCO T860 for years and loved it.</li>
            <li>What good is the trimmer if you can not plug it in and use it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend who absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>a fairly close beard trim, you need to set it on the next-to-last close setting--</li>
            <li>Feels good in my hand</li>
            <li>Its pop-up trimmer is another good feature.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a good product, for the price.</li>
            <li>Exceptional trimmer for the cost.  </li>
            <li>The mb-300 feel great in my hand, the length selector is never in the way and switched like on the t-980, the pop up attachment is great, the price is fantastic too.  </li>
            <li>but this item is exceptional)</li>
            <li>Am very pleased w/ this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>This is also great for touching up home haircuts around the ears and neck.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this trimmer -</li>
            <li>Good power, stays recharged for a good amount of time, exterior of product feels very smooth</li>
            <li>Feels good in the hand, it&#x27;s light-weight, trimming-length adjuster very easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>If you liked the MB-40 or 50, you will like this much better!</li>
            <li>Corded and cordless, great adjustability, comfortable to handle, econimical and never needs oiling (which no one does).</li>
            <li>The clipper is located more toward the front causing more hair to fly.  </li>
            <li>quality of the trimming accessories - it holds together nicely.</li>
            <li>But it does a good job all things considered, and is certainly better than no vaccuum at all.  </li>
            <li>It fits nicely into my hand and provides me with a nice even trim of my mustache.  </li>
            <li>The pop-out detail/moustache trimmer is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I used to own a $50 all in one (norelco?)</li>
            <li>This trimmer  has my enthusiastic endorsment.</li>
            <li>Well made with good trim length settings, it&#x27;s also easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Feels great in your hand, not awkward to use.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best trimmers I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>A powerful trimmer that does a great job on my goatee.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, feels good in your hands, and most of all does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of the years and this is by far the best yet.  </li>
            <li>The teeth on the front do much more digging into your face.  </li>
            <li>I finally found the REMINGTON PRECISION PRO MB 300 and I am very happy.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did a bit more research and made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times now and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I bought the Remington Precision Pro MB-400 Titanium Vaccuum Mustache and Beard Trimmer after having tried the Norelco T-970 Accuvac Trimmer, and there is no comparison - the Remington is better in every way.  </li>
            <li>A great cut - the trimmer is very even for me.</li>
            <li>so this is ok.  </li>
            <li>Its better now.</li>
            <li>The adjustment is sturdy, I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to slip to another setting.</li>
            <li>The piece that moves up has the slots for the hair to come through, but the bars to make the slots aren&#x27;t connected from top to bottom, and so when I threw it in the travel bag, it snagged on the mesh and the plastic snapped off...</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>This product was great and performed very well.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent trimmer - this is what I have been needing all of these years.  </li>
            <li>I love the adjustments, and the removeable head.  </li>
            <li>If you have read all this you must know I love it.(never</li>
            <li>He has a gorgeous full beard and keeps it precisely trimmed.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge, cuts evenly, and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It was the most comfortable experience I have ever had with a groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He could not be more pleased with the results and speed in trimming his full beard and moustache.  </li>
            <li>Also, the adjustment wheel is easily \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; adjusted by brushing up against it.</li>
            <li>Great for trimming goatees, much better than the last Norelco</li>
            <li>, the Remington is a good choice for a trimmer and superior to the other vaccuum alternative, the Norelco T970.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and maneuvers easily.</li>
            <li>To get a close shave and fine lines, I have to whip out my Mach 3 and finish off the job.</li>
            <li>the five-star reviews, here, are totally justified....</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Bulky and not too comfortable for mustache use.</li>
            <li>I hope replacement guides are available.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, you cannot over charge it (according to Remington)</li>
            <li>Works really great, although I&#x27;ve only used it for a month or so.  </li>
            <li>One of the annoyances, besides the sound it makes, is that it sends your hair flying everywhere across the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>or so I have only had to return a couple of items (a great ratio)</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with this new.</li>
            <li>The blades are smooth and stay clean.</li>
            <li>I originally ruled out the 300 after reading a post that it could not be used while plugged in.</li>
            <li>Long battery life, great for business week travel.</li>
            <li>The blades cut cleanly and with ease.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, that does not bother me a lot since it takes about 20-30 seconds to clean up after myself so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this shaver has received so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The battery remains very strong and only requires charging once a month at most.  </li>
            <li>Out of the box , this is true, even with the setting set to 1(Lowest) .</li>
            <li>wish they would come up with a trimmer that would catch the hairs a good solid model without problems.</li>
            <li>Does a good job timming head and facial hair.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean, cover slides off easily and trimmer flips open.</li>
            <li>After a quick trim, none of that.  </li>
            <li>Charges quick and lasts a while before being charged again.</li>
            <li>and MB300 by Remington came out as one of the best overall from the reviews I read around the net.    </li>
            <li>This is a powerful unit that did a remarkably quick and efficient job.  </li>
            <li>And trimming is fast and smooth as butter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using beard &amp; mustache trimmers for nearly 8 years and this is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>I must admit my old Wahl and Remington were more sturdy than either of these newer products though.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love that it runs on cord or battery, because my old one stopped holding it&#x27;s charge and then what?  </li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is much better than my old one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth twice the money.  </li>
            <li>that had the dial going around right underneath the cutter.   </li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>Most certainly, with any new electric razor, this is a trial-and-error process.  </li>
            <li>Excellent trimmer, nine length choices which cover almost the entire range that your average beard-trimming fellow could desire.</li>
            <li>The adjustable setting is located in the middle and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This new one is awesome if nothing else than it has new very sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s even superior to my previous one.</li>
            <li>this baby is a real class act!  </li>
            <li>only wish there were more settings for that close stubbly look.</li>
            <li>I actually chose this one over the latest Remington MB-400 model because I believe they have done away with the mini-trimmer.  </li>
            <li>it definitely cuts hair better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.      </li>
            <li>Also, being able to use it while plugged in is a key feature.    </li>
            <li>just couldn&#x27;t wait to use this baby, so while plugged in and charging, I did my first test shave.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my first experience was an error.</li>
            <li>the plus side, this is a quality product that should be amongst your first picks when considering a cordless unit for your grooming needs.within your beard.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, this is a quality product that should be amongst your first picks when considering a cordless unit for your grooming needs.</li>
            <li>The norelco has   several flaws and too many features</li>
            <li>What I should have done is go with a model like my first trimmer</li>
            <li>&quot; you have to take the top off, no big deal</li>
            <li>A real bargain!</li>
            <li>It trims neatly and gets all of the hair thanks to the powerful motor.</li>
            <li>It has a much more powerful motor than the Norelco and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Great high -quality beard trimmer, that goes low enough to give you that five o&#x27;clock shadow look, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought this one on all the positive recommendations.</li>
            <li>Luckily we hadn&#x27;t thrown the old one awa.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for regular use.</li>
            <li>He really likes the \\&quot;dial-a-level\\&quot; that lets him do different lengths easily.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The truth is that no vaccuum is really going to catch all the hair when it is as compact as these items are.</li>
            <li>While I do not have any past trimmers to compare to, I am very satisfied as this trimmer seems to give me all the options I needed and all works well.</li>
            <li>I bought the Remington MB-300 Mustache and Beard trimmer for my husband and was holding my breath as he is very picky.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I also use the pop out mini-trimmer to do shaping and that also works very well.      </li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>Cons: Does \\&quot;shave\\&quot; very closely.    </li>
            <li>though fortunately, the construction seems solid.  </li>
            <li>I found this tool very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After much research, I purchased this product to replace an ancient   Wahl for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Really like the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I bought it without expecting much</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t get much easier.</li>
            <li>and you kind of have to hold it in place with your thumb to get it to stay firm.  </li>
            <li>The smaller trimmer is noisy, and the blades don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp or as clean-cutting as the large blades, but since I don&#x27;t use it for anything but detail stuff, it has been good.     </li>
            <li>Charges up fast and runs along for several trimmings at full speed.</li>
            <li>Considering all, I can say it is much better than a Wahl, and about average to the comparable Norelco.</li>
            <li>If you completely remove the attachment you can trim pretty close to the skin if you need to (you know, for body hair removal).      </li>
            <li>Sent it back and received a full refund</li>
            <li>It was short enough and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first few times that i used it , i experienced slight skin irritation .I</li>
            <li>This trimmer is decent quality.</li>
            <li>This trimmer seems almost identical to the old MB-50, except that it is MUCH quieter and trims much neater.</li>
            <li>This particular Remington model works whether it is plugged in or running on battery, so if you forget to charge it you can still use it without fear of a half-finished job.      </li>
            <li>Smooth running, easy to grip, easy to adjust cutting length, rechargeable, even useable while plugged in for charging, and on and on.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to discover how light this groomer actually is,</li>
            <li>Good product and on amazon no tax or shipping saves a few bucks from buying at the local Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this trimmer to anyone who has a beard no matter what the length.</li>
            <li>High marks.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The length adjustment is easy to use, unlike a lot of other beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>The MB-300 also doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum on it like the MB-400 does, but that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me because clean up is pretty simple.      </li>
            <li>Not a big deal really, but something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>No big deal right?</li>
            <li>I researched left and right</li>
            <li>Smooth operation and stays sharp.  </li>
            <li>I did throw away the box for the new one.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the new NORELCO models are CORDLESS RECHARGEABLE.</li>
            <li>It keeps his new beard neat so that his mom approves.</li>
            <li>My opinion... very professional and neat after use.</li>
            <li>Charge lasts a long time- detail trimmer is actually useful, and the length adjustment stays where you set it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have the first 3 features</li>
            <li>The battery finally died after years of service with the first one.  </li>
            <li>but I went with the same brand as my first trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wahl trimmers for the past 20+ years and have been satisfied with their function and value</li>
            <li>This is a true pain, as you have to hold the adjustment wheel to ensure that the adjuster doesn&#x27;t turn when removing the guard - or do as I do and just remove the guard and when putting it back on recheck and adjust the adjusting wheel as necessary.</li>
            <li>This is a CHEAP shaver - plastic guard breaks with use (parts are unavailable); battery runs down which decreases performance even when plugged in; battery can&#x27;t be replaced, making this not a green product in any way.</li>
            <li>Finally, the pop trimmer gave me the look that i wanted , a smart 2-3 days look stubble.</li>
            <li>The length settings are a little different than my old one, but I like them better.     </li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a little more quiet than my old Wahl razor, but that was not to be the case</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a little more quiet than my old Wahl razor, but that was not to be the case here.    </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and looking forward to several years of usage.</li>
            <li>I had an old Norelco (I think) that did not have this problem.</li>
            <li>Thanks Remington, and my wife for the Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my wife threw my charger away for my old one.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer died so I bought a $15 Vidal Sassoon trimmer at Marshall&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It (the length guard) simply slides up and down via a scroll wheel with numbers easily visible to allow you to remember which setting is the preferred trimming length setting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is also a small pop-up blade that allows you to trim your moustache or create fine edges within your beard.  </li>
            <li>I like this trimmer a lot its decent and has solid body, egronomic handle.  </li>
            <li>but I do not want to be heading somewhere important and not able to use my trimmer.</li>
            <li>I plugged the charger cord into the MB-300 as a small light on the bottom indicated charging had begun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike the Wahl blade units I have used in the past that feel as if you are pulling hairs, the Remington MB-300 smoothly glided across my goutee.  </li>
            <li>and it does a very tight, clean, and even trim.  </li>
            <li>It trims close enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave him completely shaven and doesn&#x27;t pull his hair.</li>
            <li>If the battery is low, you cannot run on electricity by directly plugging in.</li>
            <li>One complete charge would last me close to 2-3 shavings of 20-25 minutes each.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but my old Norelco had a twist grip type of adjustment that stayed put.</li>
            <li>My old MB30 would slip constantly.    </li>
            <li>I replaced a Braun trimmer, which expired after 5 years of use, and apparently has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>If the guard is completely off (removed), it trims even closer obviously.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>The adjustment on the last one he had would slip to a shorter setting if he pressed on it too hard while trimming his beard or sideburns, but the attachment on this one is secure and has not yet slipped.  </li>
            <li>At first I grumped about trimming my mustache with the head that was larger than my previous trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It cut my thick beard so cleanly and with only a once over.  </li>
            <li>searched all over and had trouble finding a trimmer with the first three features I listed above.</li>
            <li>After trying two beard trimmers over the past 2 years to just have them not work properly and die, I decided to look for a much better trimmer so I can save myself a few dollars by not going to the barber.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Its ergonomic design fits beautifully in one&#x27;s hand making trimming a pleasure, and its titanium cutter needs no lubrication(yippie!).  </li>
            <li> I trim wiht the lowest 2 levels and it is perfect for beard and moustache.</li>
            <li> I have looked at others since buying the Remington and am convinced that this is the best.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> For the price, this is one of, if not, the best trimmer out there in terms of value to performance.</li>
            <li> the reliable (although not the greatest beard guard) Wahl.    </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, at a very good price.  </li>
            <li> The trim was great at the lowest setting, the perfect length for me.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted to find, however, is that the shave experience was absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I purchased the MB-300 as a replacement, and is it ever a joy to use.......</li>
            <li> Great for beards.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> The sides have a tacky surface to help you hold the trimmer which helps greatly.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer worked out great for me.  </li>
            <li> Its nine levels of trimming lengths are great for a close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall and happy with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, i am happy \\&quot;now\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> A dual voltage option would have been great .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my goateed husband and it does a great job keeping his whiskers well-trimmed.  </li>
            <li> and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> But in the meanwhile, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.    </li>
            <li> I found this tool very effective.    </li>
            <li> Newer isn&#x27;t always better and this is an excellent feature they should have kept.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s served me well and the rechargeable battery still holds a good charge, but I never bothered to lubricate the cutter(lazy me)</li>
            <li> Good number of settings.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t imagine that it would not be good.  </li>
            <li> I have had a NORELCO T860 for years and loved it.</li>
            <li> What good is the trimmer if you can not plug it in and use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> a fairly close beard trim, you need to set it on the next-to-last close setting--</li>
            <li> Feels good in my hand</li>
            <li> Its pop-up trimmer is another good feature.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good product, for the price.</li>
            <li> Exceptional trimmer for the cost.  </li>
            <li> The mb-300 feel great in my hand, the length selector is never in the way and switched like on the t-980, the pop up attachment is great, the price is fantastic too.  </li>
            <li> but this item is exceptional)</li>
            <li> Am very pleased w/ this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This is also great for touching up home haircuts around the ears and neck.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this trimmer -</li>
            <li> Good power, stays recharged for a good amount of time, exterior of product feels very smooth</li>
            <li> Feels good in the hand, it&#x27;s light-weight, trimming-length adjuster very easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li> If you liked the MB-40 or 50, you will like this much better!</li>
            <li> Corded and cordless, great adjustability, comfortable to handle, econimical and never needs oiling (which no one does).</li>
            <li> The clipper is located more toward the front causing more hair to fly.  </li>
            <li> quality of the trimming accessories - it holds together nicely.</li>
            <li> But it does a good job all things considered, and is certainly better than no vaccuum at all.  </li>
            <li> It fits nicely into my hand and provides me with a nice even trim of my mustache.  </li>
            <li> The pop-out detail/moustache trimmer is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I used to own a $50 all in one (norelco?)</li>
            <li> This trimmer  has my enthusiastic endorsment.</li>
            <li> Well made with good trim length settings, it&#x27;s also easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Feels great in your hand, not awkward to use.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> A powerful trimmer that does a great job on my goatee.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made, feels good in your hands, and most of all does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the years and this is by far the best yet.  </li>
            <li> The teeth on the front do much more digging into your face.  </li>
            <li> I finally found the REMINGTON PRECISION PRO MB 300 and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did a bit more research and made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it many times now and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington Precision Pro MB-400 Titanium Vaccuum Mustache and Beard Trimmer after having tried the Norelco T-970 Accuvac Trimmer, and there is no comparison - the Remington is better in every way.  </li>
            <li> A great cut - the trimmer is very even for me.</li>
            <li> so this is ok.  </li>
            <li> Its better now.</li>
            <li> The adjustment is sturdy, I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to slip to another setting.</li>
            <li> The piece that moves up has the slots for the hair to come through, but the bars to make the slots aren&#x27;t connected from top to bottom, and so when I threw it in the travel bag, it snagged on the mesh and the plastic snapped off...</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> This product was great and performed very well.</li>
            <li> Overall an excellent trimmer - this is what I have been needing all of these years.  </li>
            <li> I love the adjustments, and the removeable head.  </li>
            <li> If you have read all this you must know I love it.(never</li>
            <li> He has a gorgeous full beard and keeps it precisely trimmed.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge, cuts evenly, and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was the most comfortable experience I have ever had with a groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He could not be more pleased with the results and speed in trimming his full beard and moustache.  </li>
            <li> Also, the adjustment wheel is easily \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; adjusted by brushing up against it.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming goatees, much better than the last Norelco</li>
            <li> , the Remington is a good choice for a trimmer and superior to the other vaccuum alternative, the Norelco T970.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and maneuvers easily.</li>
            <li> To get a close shave and fine lines, I have to whip out my Mach 3 and finish off the job.</li>
            <li> the five-star reviews, here, are totally justified....</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Bulky and not too comfortable for mustache use.</li>
            <li> I hope replacement guides are available.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, you cannot over charge it (according to Remington)</li>
            <li> Works really great, although I&#x27;ve only used it for a month or so.  </li>
            <li> One of the annoyances, besides the sound it makes, is that it sends your hair flying everywhere across the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> or so I have only had to return a couple of items (a great ratio)</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with this new.</li>
            <li> The blades are smooth and stay clean.</li>
            <li> I originally ruled out the 300 after reading a post that it could not be used while plugged in.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, great for business week travel.</li>
            <li> The blades cut cleanly and with ease.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, that does not bother me a lot since it takes about 20-30 seconds to clean up after myself so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this shaver has received so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The battery remains very strong and only requires charging once a month at most.  </li>
            <li> Out of the box , this is true, even with the setting set to 1(Lowest) .</li>
            <li> wish they would come up with a trimmer that would catch the hairs a good solid model without problems.</li>
            <li> Does a good job timming head and facial hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean, cover slides off easily and trimmer flips open.</li>
            <li> After a quick trim, none of that.  </li>
            <li> Charges quick and lasts a while before being charged again.</li>
            <li> and MB300 by Remington came out as one of the best overall from the reviews I read around the net.    </li>
            <li> This is a powerful unit that did a remarkably quick and efficient job.  </li>
            <li> And trimming is fast and smooth as butter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using beard &amp; mustache trimmers for nearly 8 years and this is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li> I must admit my old Wahl and Remington were more sturdy than either of these newer products though.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love that it runs on cord or battery, because my old one stopped holding it&#x27;s charge and then what?  </li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is much better than my old one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth twice the money.  </li>
            <li> that had the dial going around right underneath the cutter.   </li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> Most certainly, with any new electric razor, this is a trial-and-error process.  </li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, nine length choices which cover almost the entire range that your average beard-trimming fellow could desire.</li>
            <li> The adjustable setting is located in the middle and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This new one is awesome if nothing else than it has new very sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s even superior to my previous one.</li>
            <li> this baby is a real class act!  </li>
            <li> only wish there were more settings for that close stubbly look.</li>
            <li> I actually chose this one over the latest Remington MB-400 model because I believe they have done away with the mini-trimmer.  </li>
            <li> it definitely cuts hair better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.      </li>
            <li> Also, being able to use it while plugged in is a key feature.    </li>
            <li> just couldn&#x27;t wait to use this baby, so while plugged in and charging, I did my first test shave.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my first experience was an error.</li>
            <li> the plus side, this is a quality product that should be amongst your first picks when considering a cordless unit for your grooming needs.within your beard.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, this is a quality product that should be amongst your first picks when considering a cordless unit for your grooming needs.</li>
            <li> The norelco has   several flaws and too many features</li>
            <li> What I should have done is go with a model like my first trimmer</li>
            <li> &quot; you have to take the top off, no big deal</li>
            <li> A real bargain!</li>
            <li> It trims neatly and gets all of the hair thanks to the powerful motor.</li>
            <li> It has a much more powerful motor than the Norelco and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great high -quality beard trimmer, that goes low enough to give you that five o&#x27;clock shadow look, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this one on all the positive recommendations.</li>
            <li> Luckily we hadn&#x27;t thrown the old one awa.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it for regular use.</li>
            <li> He really likes the \\&quot;dial-a-level\\&quot; that lets him do different lengths easily.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The truth is that no vaccuum is really going to catch all the hair when it is as compact as these items are.</li>
            <li> While I do not have any past trimmers to compare to, I am very satisfied as this trimmer seems to give me all the options I needed and all works well.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington MB-300 Mustache and Beard trimmer for my husband and was holding my breath as he is very picky.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I also use the pop out mini-trimmer to do shaping and that also works very well.      </li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> Cons: Does \\&quot;shave\\&quot; very closely.    </li>
            <li> though fortunately, the construction seems solid.  </li>
            <li> I found this tool very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After much research, I purchased this product to replace an ancient   Wahl for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Really like the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought it without expecting much</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t get much easier.</li>
            <li> and you kind of have to hold it in place with your thumb to get it to stay firm.  </li>
            <li> The smaller trimmer is noisy, and the blades don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp or as clean-cutting as the large blades, but since I don&#x27;t use it for anything but detail stuff, it has been good.     </li>
            <li> Charges up fast and runs along for several trimmings at full speed.</li>
            <li> Considering all, I can say it is much better than a Wahl, and about average to the comparable Norelco.</li>
            <li> If you completely remove the attachment you can trim pretty close to the skin if you need to (you know, for body hair removal).      </li>
            <li> Sent it back and received a full refund</li>
            <li> It was short enough and very smooth.  </li>
            <li> The first few times that i used it , i experienced slight skin irritation .I</li>
            <li> This trimmer is decent quality.</li>
            <li> This trimmer seems almost identical to the old MB-50, except that it is MUCH quieter and trims much neater.</li>
            <li> This particular Remington model works whether it is plugged in or running on battery, so if you forget to charge it you can still use it without fear of a half-finished job.      </li>
            <li> Smooth running, easy to grip, easy to adjust cutting length, rechargeable, even useable while plugged in for charging, and on and on.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover how light this groomer actually is,</li>
            <li> Good product and on amazon no tax or shipping saves a few bucks from buying at the local Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this trimmer to anyone who has a beard no matter what the length.</li>
            <li> High marks.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The length adjustment is easy to use, unlike a lot of other beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> The MB-300 also doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum on it like the MB-400 does, but that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me because clean up is pretty simple.      </li>
            <li> Not a big deal really, but something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> No big deal right?</li>
            <li> I researched left and right</li>
            <li> Smooth operation and stays sharp.  </li>
            <li> I did throw away the box for the new one.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the new NORELCO models are CORDLESS RECHARGEABLE.</li>
            <li> It keeps his new beard neat so that his mom approves.</li>
            <li> My opinion... very professional and neat after use.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time- detail trimmer is actually useful, and the length adjustment stays where you set it.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have the first 3 features</li>
            <li> The battery finally died after years of service with the first one.  </li>
            <li> but I went with the same brand as my first trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl trimmers for the past 20+ years and have been satisfied with their function and value</li>
            <li> This is a true pain, as you have to hold the adjustment wheel to ensure that the adjuster doesn&#x27;t turn when removing the guard - or do as I do and just remove the guard and when putting it back on recheck and adjust the adjusting wheel as necessary.</li>
            <li> This is a CHEAP shaver - plastic guard breaks with use (parts are unavailable); battery runs down which decreases performance even when plugged in; battery can&#x27;t be replaced, making this not a green product in any way.</li>
            <li> Finally, the pop trimmer gave me the look that i wanted , a smart 2-3 days look stubble.</li>
            <li> The length settings are a little different than my old one, but I like them better.     </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little more quiet than my old Wahl razor, but that was not to be the case</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little more quiet than my old Wahl razor, but that was not to be the case here.    </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and looking forward to several years of usage.</li>
            <li> I had an old Norelco (I think) that did not have this problem.</li>
            <li> Thanks Remington, and my wife for the Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my wife threw my charger away for my old one.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer died so I bought a $15 Vidal Sassoon trimmer at Marshall&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It (the length guard) simply slides up and down via a scroll wheel with numbers easily visible to allow you to remember which setting is the preferred trimming length setting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is also a small pop-up blade that allows you to trim your moustache or create fine edges within your beard.  </li>
            <li> I like this trimmer a lot its decent and has solid body, egronomic handle.  </li>
            <li> but I do not want to be heading somewhere important and not able to use my trimmer.</li>
            <li> I plugged the charger cord into the MB-300 as a small light on the bottom indicated charging had begun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike the Wahl blade units I have used in the past that feel as if you are pulling hairs, the Remington MB-300 smoothly glided across my goutee.  </li>
            <li> and it does a very tight, clean, and even trim.  </li>
            <li> It trims close enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave him completely shaven and doesn&#x27;t pull his hair.</li>
            <li> If the battery is low, you cannot run on electricity by directly plugging in.</li>
            <li> One complete charge would last me close to 2-3 shavings of 20-25 minutes each.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but my old Norelco had a twist grip type of adjustment that stayed put.</li>
            <li> My old MB30 would slip constantly.    </li>
            <li> I replaced a Braun trimmer, which expired after 5 years of use, and apparently has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> If the guard is completely off (removed), it trims even closer obviously.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The adjustment on the last one he had would slip to a shorter setting if he pressed on it too hard while trimming his beard or sideburns, but the attachment on this one is secure and has not yet slipped.  </li>
            <li> At first I grumped about trimming my mustache with the head that was larger than my previous trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It cut my thick beard so cleanly and with only a once over.  </li>
            <li> searched all over and had trouble finding a trimmer with the first three features I listed above.</li>
            <li> After trying two beard trimmers over the past 2 years to just have them not work properly and die, I decided to look for a much better trimmer so I can save myself a few dollars by not going to the barber.  </li>
            <li> I hear that the only way around that is a vacuum model, but I haven&#x27;t found one of those with the smaller trimmer.</li>
            <li> R MOORTHY also mentions a vacuum and again that is with the 400) &lt;br /&gt;2) Lub for Life blades that never need oiling &lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> ( This is a nice added feature for those that want to shape up small tough to reach places) &lt;br</li>
            <li> It has my old and more expensive trimmer beat hands down.  </li>
            <li> The size, seems a little large and can be difficult to maneuver for fine trimming (moustache area).  </li>
            <li> Also charges silently and can not overcharge if left too long.</li>
            <li> doing extensive research, i ruled out the \\&quot;vaccum\\&quot; models , since i didnt expect to keep a long beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day to replace an old battery powered black and decker beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I spent a few hours reading reviews on various websites and found the Remington MB-300 to be rated consistently high.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer without having high hopes since I just like to keep a small 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and some reviews said this one didn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> We had trouble with a couple of our old ones grabbing skin and drawing blood without the attachment on, but this one has not done it yet.  </li>
            <li> It combines the obvious advantages of portability with long battery life and strong cutting power.</li>
            <li> I had purposely let my goutee grow rather bushy over the past week in anticipation of this new groomer.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer used to leave hairs partially trimmed and for the 2-3 days after trimming I&#x27;d be plucking broken ends off of my beard (sounds bizarre...figured it was normal).  </li>
            <li> its a very minor con.  </li>
            <li> Rather than the limited number of 9 settings, it should have a continuous dial that could be locked at whatever setting you want.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time searching for a shaver that promised me a 5 o clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> The piece that moves up and down to adjust the trim height does not \\&quot;hold\\&quot; in place very well when pressed, so you may get varying lengths if you press too hard.   </li>
            <li> To the point where I was slightly disappointed because I had it on a setting a little shorter than I would&#x27;ve liked and there was no turning back.  </li>
            <li> Well , one of the reviewers had said that the Remington MB300 is not suitable for very short facial hair</li>
            <li> This MB-3oo trimmir has everything anybody could want in such an item: efficient-clean-fast-two clipping blades,one small enough to get into tight spots requiring narrow trimming and the other usable either directly or thru the graded baffel.</li>
            <li> And the real reason I purchased this model is because it can run off of the wall current when the battery eventually fails.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned...and it was certainly no fault of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the tines that keep the beard up for trimming are very delicate and were bent the first time he put it in his suitcase for travel.  </li>
            <li> I thought this item had adjustable settings that were much lower; meaning: (it could keep my scruff looking like I hadn&#x27;t shaven for a few days,) but when the product arived, I found that it was made for people with much longer facial hair.</li>
            <li> I had initially looked to buy the more expensive MB-400 with built-in vacuum to handle loose clippings, but read that it suffers from flimsy</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not sharp...</li>
            <li> However, when I want to make sharp lines and shave off the rest of the hair, this thing just isn&#x27;t that \\&quot;sharp\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviews on the grip, the trim, no pulling/pinching, etc., etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few minor cons here.  </li>
            <li> There are a few minor cons here.  </li>
            <li> None of the pulling that I have read about in reviews of other trimmers.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the trimmings go everywhere.</li>
            <li> It turns out when you put ANY type of pressure on it, like against your face trimming, it would slide the dial down to whatever it wanted, leaving your face uneven and trying to guess what the other side was</li>
            <li> The vacuum is so big and bulky that it made it difficult for me to get the trimmer close to my beard and mustache to shape it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a thick beard and hated trimming it with my old cheap ConAir trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I find that if I am trimming every other day, I must plug in at least every other week.</li>
            <li> A waste of money -- lasted less than five months before the battery died, won&#x27;t even run when plugged in.</li>
            <li> Some other cordless models do not work while plugged in, which is a problem we have also run into in the past.  </li>
            <li> With a little practice even that became easier.</li>
            <li> the little jumjick broke, but i still use it.</li>
            <li> adjustable head stays firmly at the setting one selects throughout the trimming process.</li>
            <li> I may have used it on my legs a few times.  </li>
            <li> that I had where my battery went dead</li>
            <li> We wondered if there was perhaps a cover in the packaging that was not obvious when we opened it (the packaging was one of those hard plastic ones that is almost impossible to open).  </li>
            <li> My last cordless beard trimmer had a very weak battery and was \\&quot;gutless\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Remington beard trimmer for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> Considering the small price tag, purchasing a $10 decorative box (for those without drawers in bathroom) in something you may wish to consider.</li>
            <li> There is a small number dial on the front of the unit that adjusts the trimmer guard.</li>
            <li> If that one fails too, it&#x27;s back to</li>
            <li> First, there is no charger base.  </li>
            <li> First, there is no charger base.  </li>
            <li> I purchased one of the new NORELCO models with the vacuum and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is because no matter how hard you try to keep the trimmer charged there may be a time it dies on you.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say about his unit.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Just be delicate with it I guess.</li>
            <li> Remington could have at least provided a stand of sorts to accommodate this unit.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Conair makes one that is less expensive and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> the negative side, clean-up is difficult, escpecially if you plan on everyday use.</li>
            <li> I noticed that there is just a thin piece of plastic holding the blade on the trimmer.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought this item had adjustable settings that were much lower; meaning: (it could keep my scruff looking like I hadn&#x27;t shaven for a few days,) but when the product arived, I found that it was made for people with much longer facial hair. Besides that it is a gret product for those with facial hair that is 1/4\\&quot; and longer. The adjustable setting is located in the middle and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Exceptional trimmer for the cost.  It has my old and more expensive trimmer beat hands down.  Would highly recommend this trimmer to anyone who has a beard no matter what the length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Remington beard trimmer for the past 5 years. It&#x27;s served me well and the rechargeable battery still holds a good charge, but I never bothered to lubricate the cutter(lazy me) so it now snags and chatters. &lt;br /&gt;I purchased the MB-300 as a replacement, and is it ever a joy to use.......it&#x27;s everything one could want in a beard trimmer! And it&#x27;s even superior to my previous one. &lt;br /&gt;The adjustable head stays firmly at the setting one selects throughout the trimming process. And trimming is fast and smooth as butter.  Its ergonomic design fits beautifully in one&#x27;s hand making trimming a pleasure, and its titanium cutter needs no lubrication(yippie!).  &lt;br /&gt;All the five-star reviews, here, are totally justified....this baby is a real class act!  If you need a beard trimmer, go for this one. You won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> Great for beards. Good number of settings. &lt;br /&gt;Bulky and not too comfortable for mustache use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Conair makes one that is less expensive and easier to handle. &lt;br /&gt;(trouble with the conair is that it died after 2 years)</li>
            <li> I like the product, however one of the guides at the tip broke off while using it.  I hope replacement guides are available.</li>
            <li> This product is everything that is advertised. The length adjustment is easy to use, unlike a lot of other beard trimmers. High marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day to replace an old battery powered black and decker beard trimmer.  He occasionally shaves his head also.  This Remington was awful, it did not cut well at all.  Luckily we hadn&#x27;t thrown the old one awa.  I did throw away the box for the new one.  I didn&#x27;t imagine that it would not be good.  I wish I could return it, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Smooth operation and stays sharp.  I trim wiht the lowest 2 levels and it is perfect for beard and moustache.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time- detail trimmer is actually useful, and the length adjustment stays where you set it.</li>
            <li> Remington MB-300 faults.  1. The teeth on the front do much more digging into your face.  2. The clipper is located more toward the front causing more hair to fly.  Considering all, I can say it is much better than a Wahl, and about average to the comparable Norelco.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this shaver has received so many positive reviews. This is a CHEAP shaver - plastic guard breaks with use (parts are unavailable); battery runs down which decreases performance even when plugged in; battery can&#x27;t be replaced, making this not a green product in any way. This is a planned obsolescence shaver - expect a year or two if you use it regularly for beards, and I would never use this thing on my head.</li>
            <li> I have had a NORELCO T860 for years and loved it. I purchased one of the new NORELCO models with the vacuum and was very disappointed. The vacuum is so big and bulky that it made it difficult for me to get the trimmer close to my beard and mustache to shape it up. In addition, the new NORELCO models are CORDLESS RECHARGEABLE. Meaning that you can NOT use the trimmer while it is plugged in. That is not acceptable to me. This is because no matter how hard you try to keep the trimmer charged there may be a time it dies on you. What good is the trimmer if you can not plug it in and use it. I don&#x27;t know about you but I do not want to be heading somewhere important and not able to use my trimmer. The REMINGTON PRECISION PRO MB 300 seems to have it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) It is CORD / CORDLESS RECHARGEABLE.  ( I believe the reviewer R MOORTHY who posted below mistakenly posted about his REMINGTON MB 400. The 400 is CORDLESS RECHARGEABLE and can NOT be used while plugged in. R MOORTHY also mentions a vacuum and again that is with the 400) &lt;br /&gt;2) Lub for Life blades that never need oiling &lt;br /&gt;3) Zoom wheel with 9 settings &lt;br /&gt;4) Pop up detail trimmer ( This is a nice added feature for those that want to shape up small tough to reach places) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I searched all over and had trouble finding a trimmer with the first three features I listed above. I finally found the REMINGTON PRECISION PRO MB 300 and I am very happy. Not only does it have the first 3 features but it has the added detail trimmer. I originally ruled out the 300 after reading a post that it could not be used while plugged in. I am glad I did a bit more research and made the purchase. Hope this review helped. Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, nine length choices which cover almost the entire range that your average beard-trimming fellow could desire. Very sturdy and looking forward to several years of usage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, clean-up is difficult, escpecially if you plan on everyday use. Just plan ahead and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who absolutely loved it. It trims close enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave him completely shaven and doesn&#x27;t pull his hair. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my Norelco when its battery died. I&#x27;ve used it many times now and am quite pleased. It has a much more powerful motor than the Norelco and holds a charge for a very long time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For a fairly close beard trim, you need to set it on the next-to-last close setting--that will give you a Wolf Blitzer trim.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Remington Cordless Mustache &amp; Beard Trimmer. The battery finally died after years of service with the first one.  &lt;br /&gt;I only wish there were more settings for that close stubbly look. Rather than the limited number of 9 settings, it should have a continuous dial that could be locked at whatever setting you want.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington Precision Pro MB-400 Titanium Vaccuum Mustache and Beard Trimmer after having tried the Norelco T-970 Accuvac Trimmer, and there is no comparison - the Remington is better in every way.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Great things about the Remington:  &lt;br /&gt;1) quality of the trimming accessories - it holds together nicely. It is well built, especially compared to the Norelco.  I must admit my old Wahl and Remington were more sturdy than either of these newer products though. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;2) A great cut - the trimmer is very even for me. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Downsides:  &lt;br /&gt;1) If the battery is low, you cannot run on electricity by directly plugging in. I find that if I am trimming every other day, I must plug in at least every other week. Fortunately, you cannot over charge it (according to Remington) so this is ok.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;2) I think all these companies set you up for disappiontment when it comes to the vaccuum... The truth is that no vaccuum is really going to catch all the hair when it is as compact as these items are. But it does a good job all things considered, and is certainly better than no vaccuum at all.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Remington is a good choice for a trimmer and superior to the other vaccuum alternative, the Norelco T970.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, great for business week travel. Never catches hair. Doesn&#x27;t slide from the position you set. Very easy to clean, cover slides off easily and trimmer flips open. Feels great in your hand, not awkward to use. Compact base. Nothing negative to say about his unit.</li>
            <li> Terrific beard groomer. I read reveiws before buying and noted some complaints. I found none of these to be valid when using the beard trimmer. I have looked at others since buying the Remington and am convinced that this is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beard trimmers over the years, corded and cordless.  This product is the best. It combines the obvious advantages of portability with long battery life and strong cutting power.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased w/ this trimmer. Feels good in my hand &amp; I like the variable trimmer head positionings. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for over 2 years.  The battery remains very strong and only requires charging once a month at most.  Trims my sideburns, mustache and goatie to my satisfaction.  The sides have a tacky surface to help you hold the trimmer which helps greatly.  I would recommend this trimmer and buy another if I ever have to.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked out great for me.  While I do not have any past trimmers to compare to, I am very satisfied as this trimmer seems to give me all the options I needed and all works well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers I have used thus far. It has nine different setting and the click-wheel to adjust these setting locks in place while trimming. The only problem is I prefer a different length to my goatee then it allows me to do but you can&#x27;t except it to satisfy everyong.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington MB-300 Mustache and Beard trimmer for my husband and was holding my breath as he is very picky. He has a gorgeous full beard and keeps it precisely trimmed. The Remington has several adjustments for length,that pleases him the most,it trims whatever he aims it at,and does it well. It is light weight and maneuvers easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product close to a month now and it works very well.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product. One complete charge would last me close to 2-3 shavings of 20-25 minutes each. Its nine levels of trimming lengths are great for a close shave. Its pop-up trimmer is another good feature. I strongly recommend it for regular use.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is decent quality. The battery hold a charge well, and the trimmer trims well. My only two gripes are as follows: &lt;br /&gt;1. You have to remove the trim guard to use the pop-up trimmer. This is a true pain, as you have to hold the adjustment wheel to ensure that the adjuster doesn&#x27;t turn when removing the guard - or do as I do and just remove the guard and when putting it back on recheck and adjust the adjusting wheel as necessary. I had an old Norelco (I think) that did not have this problem. Also, the adjustment wheel is easily \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; adjusted by brushing up against it. Not a big deal, but my old Norelco had a twist grip type of adjustment that stayed put. &lt;br /&gt;2. The size, seems a little large and can be difficult to maneuver for fine trimming (moustache area).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall and happy with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has it all. Corded and cordless, great adjustability, comfortable to handle, econimical and never needs oiling (which no one does). Yes, this one is a winner and a bargain to boot! Considering the small price tag, purchasing a $10 decorative box (for those without drawers in bathroom) in something you may wish to consider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using beard &amp; mustache trimmers for nearly 8 years and this is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.  I have been using this one for 2 months now to trim my goatee with the guard set at 1 and it does a very tight, clean, and even trim.  I also use the pop out mini-trimmer to do shaping and that also works very well.      The only problem with the mini-trimmer is you have to pop off the guard to use it and you kind of have to hold it in place with your thumb to get it to stay firm.  Not a big deal really, but something to be aware of.  I actually chose this one over the latest Remington MB-400 model because I believe they have done away with the mini-trimmer.  Newer isn&#x27;t always better and this is an excellent feature they should have kept.      The MB-300 also doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum on it like the MB-400 does, but that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me because clean up is pretty simple.      You won&#x27;t regret buying this trimmer...I&#x27;d buy another one in a second.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve used many of the years and this is by far the best yet.  It fits nicely into my hand and provides me with a nice even trim of my mustache.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my four-year-old Remington MB-50, which was wearing out. This trimmer seems almost identical to the old MB-50, except that it is MUCH quieter and trims much neater. If you liked the MB-40 or 50, you will like this much better!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my hairy boyfriend.  Hair control is a never-ending battle in our house, so we have gone through an arsenal of trimming products.      The adjustment on the last one he had would slip to a shorter setting if he pressed on it too hard while trimming his beard or sideburns, but the attachment on this one is secure and has not yet slipped.  If you completely remove the attachment you can trim pretty close to the skin if you need to (you know, for body hair removal).      This is also great for touching up home haircuts around the ears and neck.  We had trouble with a couple of our old ones grabbing skin and drawing blood without the attachment on, but this one has not done it yet.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not sharp...it definitely cuts hair better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.      Some other cordless models do not work while plugged in, which is a problem we have also run into in the past.  This particular Remington model works whether it is plugged in or running on battery, so if you forget to charge it you can still use it without fear of a half-finished job.      He&#x27;s been using it for about 6 months now several times weekly without any problems.  I may have used it on my legs a few times.  We both would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Pros: The best trimmer I have ever used.  Highly recommended!  Also, being able to use it while plugged in is a key feature.    Cons: Does \\&quot;shave\\&quot; very closely.    I use this trimmer to, well, trim my beard.  It is great at that!  However, when I want to make sharp lines and shave off the rest of the hair, this thing just isn&#x27;t that \\&quot;sharp\\&quot;.  To get a close shave and fine lines, I have to whip out my Mach 3 and finish off the job.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time searching for a shaver that promised me a 5 o clock shadow look. &lt;br /&gt;After doing extensive research, i ruled out the \\&quot;vaccum\\&quot; models , since i didnt expect to keep a long beard. I wanted, just enough for a 2-3 day stubble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) Build quality - The MB300 felt solid in my hand . &lt;br /&gt;2) Efficiency - Well , one of the reviewers had said that the Remington MB300 is not suitable for very short facial hair and i agree with him . Out of the box , this is true, even with the setting set to 1(Lowest) . Though reminton says that the 1-2 settings gives a 5 o clock shadow, i dont agree . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But if one removes the protector , then one can get a close trim. I wanted an even shorter trim. Finally, the pop trimmer gave me the look that i wanted , a smart 2-3 days look stubble. Were it not for the pop up trimmer, i might have returned this one. &lt;br /&gt;Guys who plan to buy the MB400 should not that , it doesn&#x27;t have a pop up trimmer. &lt;br /&gt;3) The first few times that i used it , i experienced slight skin irritation .I attribute this to my inability to use the trimmer correctly.Its better now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, i am happy \\&quot;now\\&quot;. A dual voltage option would have been great . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my Remington MB30. I have used it for about three weeks now, and I trim about twice a week. The blades cut cleanly and with ease. The adjustment is sturdy, I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to slip to another setting. My old MB30 would slip constantly.    The smaller trimmer is noisy, and the blades don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp or as clean-cutting as the large blades, but since I don&#x27;t use it for anything but detail stuff, it has been good.     The blades are smooth and stay clean. The only complaint I have is the trimmings go everywhere. I hear that the only way around that is a vacuum model, but I haven&#x27;t found one of those with the smaller trimmer. The length settings are a little different than my old one, but I like them better.     This seems to be a good product, for the price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, at a very good price.  I replaced a Braun trimmer, which expired after 5 years of use, and apparently has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> A waste of money -- lasted less than five months before the battery died, won&#x27;t even run when plugged in.</li>
            <li> What is there not to like?  Smooth running, easy to grip, easy to adjust cutting length, rechargeable, even useable while plugged in for charging, and on and on.  At first I grumped about trimming my mustache with the head that was larger than my previous trimmer.  With a little practice even that became easier.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviews on the grip, the trim, no pulling/pinching, etc., etc. so I&#x27;ll just get to what I didn&#x27;t like about it:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) The piece that moves up and down to adjust the trim height does not \\&quot;hold\\&quot; in place very well when pressed, so you may get varying lengths if you press too hard.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) The piece that moves up has the slots for the hair to come through, but the bars to make the slots aren&#x27;t connected from top to bottom, and so when I threw it in the travel bag, it snagged on the mesh and the plastic snapped off... weh woh. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just be delicate with it I guess.</li>
            <li> A powerful trimmer that does a great job on my goatee.  The pop-out detail/moustache trimmer is a nice touch. One downfall is not having a base to put it into after use instead of just lying it on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Feels good in the hand, it&#x27;s light-weight, trimming-length adjuster very easy to adjust.  It (the length guard) simply slides up and down via a scroll wheel with numbers easily visible to allow you to remember which setting is the preferred trimming length setting.  For example, number one is the closest trim (stubble) with the guard on.  It goes up to number 9.  If the guard is completely off (removed), it trims even closer obviously.  Good power, stays recharged for a good amount of time, exterior of product feels very smooth, it&#x27;s light-weight, and overall, a solid purchase with 0 problems or concerns.   Recommended.</li>
            <li> For years I have bought various Wahl blade groomers whose blades need constant oiling and ultimately stop working because of rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year I wanted to try something different.  I wanted to find a groomer that would be a \\&quot;cut\\&quot; above the rest in terms of ease of use and trimming comfort.  I spent a few hours reading reviews on various websites and found the Remington MB-300 to be rated consistently high.  I had initially looked to buy the more expensive MB-400 with built-in vacuum to handle loose clippings, but read that it suffers from flimsy construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my Remington groomer yesterday and immediately put it use.  I was surprised to discover how light this groomer actually is, though fortunately, the construction seems solid.  I plugged the charger cord into the MB-300 as a small light on the bottom indicated charging had begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just couldn&#x27;t wait to use this baby, so while plugged in and charging, I did my first test shave.  I had purposely let my goutee grow rather bushy over the past week in anticipation of this new groomer.  The big question was just how low I needed to set the trimmer guard.  There is a small number dial on the front of the unit that adjusts the trimmer guard. Most certainly, with any new electric razor, this is a trial-and-error process.  Unfortunately, my first experience was an error. I set the dial to \\&quot;2\\&quot; and was horrified as the groomer cut my goutee way too short.  I estimate that \\&quot;3\\&quot; would be the number to use at next attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was delighted to find, however, is that the shave experience was absolutely wonderful.  This is a powerful unit that did a remarkably quick and efficient job.  Unlike the Wahl blade units I have used in the past that feel as if you are pulling hairs, the Remington MB-300 smoothly glided across my goutee.  It was the most comfortable experience I have ever had with a groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a small pop-up blade that allows you to trim your moustache or create fine edges within your beard.  I found this tool very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few minor cons here.  First, there is no charger base.  This means that you have to lay the charger somewhere on your counter when not in use.  Remington could have at least provided a stand of sorts to accommodate this unit.  Secondly, they could also have provided a travel pouch which is nowhere to be found.  Third, the unit is noisy.  I was hoping for something a little more quiet than my old Wahl razor, but that was not to be the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this is a quality product that should be amongst your first picks when considering a cordless unit for your grooming needs.within your beard.

            <li> I recently purchased the norelco t-980 and wish I had not.  The norelco has   several flaws and too many features but I went with the same brand as my first trimmer.  What I should have done is go with a model like my first trimmer no matter what the brand was, lesson learned.  The mb-300 feel great in my hand, the length selector is never in the way and switched like on the t-980, the pop up attachment is great, the price is fantastic too.  I used it once and knew it was a keeper, the t-980 has been donated.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my goateed husband and it does a great job keeping his whiskers well-trimmed.  He really likes the \\&quot;dial-a-level\\&quot; that lets him do different lengths easily.  The only complaint is that the tines that keep the beard up for trimming are very delicate and were bent the first time he put it in his suitcase for travel.  There should be a cover to protect these plastic \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; or they should be of stronger material.  We wondered if there was perhaps a cover in the packaging that was not obvious when we opened it (the packaging was one of those hard plastic ones that is almost impossible to open).  If there was not a cover, one should be included by Remington in the future.</li>
            <li> the little jumjick broke, but i still use it. charge last 2 months. i am a hairy man.</li>
            <li> I had wanted a beard trimmer for some time, but was reluctant as I did not know anyone that used one. After reading several favorable reviews, I ordered one and I am glad I did.Very easy to use and it does a great job. Best of all, it operates while being plugged in. Some units won&#x27;t work while charging, this one does. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used to own a $50 all in one (norelco?) that had the dial going around right underneath the cutter.   No big deal right? It turns out when you put ANY type of pressure on it, like against your face trimming, it would slide the dial down to whatever it wanted, leaving your face uneven and trying to guess what the other side was (I ended up using Duct Tape to hold it in place)    This one is PERFECT for trimming, it stays in place and I have had ZERO problems.    One suggestion for the next model though, to use the \\&quot;blade\\&quot; you have to take the top off, no big deal but it is an extra step</li>
            <li> After much research, I purchased this product to replace an ancient   Wahl for my husband.  He could not be more pleased with the results and speed in trimming his full beard and moustache.  My opinion... very professional and neat after use.</li>
            <li> Works really great, although I&#x27;ve only used it for a month or so.  Great for trimming goatees, much better than the last Norelco that I just had to throw away cause it died after year of using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these trimmers for years.  This new one is awesome if nothing else than it has new very sharp blades.  The charge seems to last forever.  And the real reason I purchased this model is because it can run off of the wall current when the battery eventually fails.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 18 yr. son and he loves it. It keeps his new beard neat so that his mom approves. Priced right.</li>
            <li> This product was great and performed very well. I purchased it as a replacement for the MB-100 that I had where my battery went dead and I could not locate my battery charger. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer a lot its decent and has solid body, egronomic handle.  Like the popup mini trim feature and solid battery life.  I would reccomend this to anyone. &lt;br /&gt;I wish they would come up with a trimmer that would catch the hairs a good solid model without problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a thick beard and hated trimming it with my old cheap ConAir trimmer.  I bought this one on all the positive recommendations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just out of the box, plugged this thing in and it rocks.  My old trimmer used to leave hairs partially trimmed and for the 2-3 days after trimming I&#x27;d be plucking broken ends off of my beard (sounds bizarre...figured it was normal).  After a quick trim, none of that.  It cut my thick beard so cleanly and with only a once over.  To the point where I was slightly disappointed because I had it on a setting a little shorter than I would&#x27;ve liked and there was no turning back.  Lesson learned...and it was certainly no fault of the trimmer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love it.  Love that it runs on cord or battery, because my old one stopped holding it&#x27;s charge and then what?  No trimming.  I had a bushy ol&#x27; beard for a week until this one arrived.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good stuff...well worth it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Overall an excellent trimmer - this is what I have been needing all of these years.  Finally a piece of equipment that does it all.  I have been very pleased with this trimmer - it is solid, and cuts without problem.  I love the adjustments, and the removeable head.  Thanks Remington, and my wife for the Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Really like the trimmer. Still getting used to it but it is much better than my old one</li>
            <li> Does a good job timming head and facial hair. Charges quick and lasts a while before being charged again. Good product and on amazon no tax or shipping saves a few bucks from buying at the local Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> This MB-3oo trimmir has everything anybody could want in such an item: efficient-clean-fast-two clipping blades,one small enough to get into tight spots requiring narrow trimming and the other usable either directly or thru the graded baffel.The last electronic device I bought I also researched extensively.It was an electric razer and cost over $300, was totally not what I wanted.Sent it back and received a full refund so I&#x27;m not naming that company. This trimmer  has my enthusiastic endorsment. Charges up fast and runs along for several trimmings at full speed. None of the pulling that I have read about in reviews of other trimmers. Also charges silently and can not overcharge if left too long. If you have read all this you must know I love it.(never bothered writing a review for anything before but this item is exceptional)</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  Well made with good trim length settings, it&#x27;s also easy to hold.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my wife threw my charger away for my old one. It wasn&#x27;t a total lost because my last one lasted about 6 years. I have been very satisfied with this new. It does all that it promises!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  It&#x27;s very well made, feels good in your hands, and most of all does a great job.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> After trying two beard trimmers over the past 2 years to just have them not work properly and die, I decided to look for a much better trimmer so I can save myself a few dollars by not going to the barber.  I researched left and right and MB300 by Remington came out as one of the best overall from the reviews I read around the net.    I bought this trimmer without having high hopes since I just like to keep a small 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and some reviews said this one didn&#x27;t do the job.  Well, after trying it out, it does one hell of a job.  At the level \\&quot;2\\&quot; on the trimmer, it does one hell of a job giving me the shadow that I want and it does it in seconds, too. I bought it without expecting much but this thing has saved me lots of money already by not going to the barber so he can trim it for me.    One of the annoyances, besides the sound it makes, is that it sends your hair flying everywhere across the bathroom.  Thankfully, that does not bother me a lot since it takes about 20-30 seconds to clean up after myself so its a very minor con.  For the price, this is one of, if not, the best trimmer out there in terms of value to performance.</li>
            <li> My last cordless beard trimmer had a very weak battery and was \\&quot;gutless\\&quot;. This (MB-300) was a definite upgrade. It holds a charge, cuts evenly, and is very easy to clean. And it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. A real bargain!</li>
            <li> My old trimmer died so I bought a $15 Vidal Sassoon trimmer at Marshall&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s pathetic.  So I got this one instead.  It&#x27;s well worth twice the money.  It trims neatly and gets all of the hair thanks to the powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Great high -quality beard trimmer, that goes low enough to give you that five o&#x27;clock shadow look, which is what I wanted. If this was stolen, I&#x27;d buy another in a second.</li>
            <li> Received it a couple of days ago and charged er up.  The trim was great at the lowest setting, the perfect length for me.  It was short enough and very smooth.  I&#x27;ve used Wahl trimmers for the past 20+ years and have been satisfied with their function and value but they changed their adjustable clipper last time around.      This trimmer would have received 5 stars until I started cleaning the darn thing.  I brushed it off then lifted the blade up as instructed.  The blade fell off and I had quite a time getting it back on.  I noticed that there is just a thin piece of plastic holding the blade on the trimmer.  I&#x27;m concerned that this will, with time, be a problem.  But in the meanwhile, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.    1/22/2008 Update:  I returned this product because it would not charge the second time I tried.  In the meantime I had purchased the same trimmer at TJ Maxx on clearance.  If that one fails too, it&#x27;s back to the reliable (although not the greatest beard guard) Wahl.    BTW, the Amazon returns process definitely gets a 5 star rating.  In 4 years or so I have only had to return a couple of items (a great ratio) but it doesn&#x27;t get much easier.</li>
