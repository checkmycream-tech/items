            <li>/&gt;Enter Geo Trumper into my life - - I use this before and after a shave (alongside a good shaving cream),</li>
            <li>I use this for aftershave and it does a good job of soothing razor burns and bumps.</li>
            <li>(I rated it five stars because most guys will have a great result with it.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing pre and post shave product.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing -</li>
            <li>Sandalwood smell is not overpowering, which is nice, but is also dissipates within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>There are much better values out there for good skin care after a shave.  </li>
            <li>feels great to put on right after shaving keeps my face feeling good all day.</li>
            <li>It does a much better just working on the skin and provides an awesome masculine scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost too good to be true.    </li>
            <li>It feels good on my face after shaving, dries quickly and soothes any \\&quot;razor</li>
            <li>The sandalwood formulation feels just as great after a shave, with the addition of a bit of a skin-tightening feeling that I really like.</li>
            <li>The product may have sandalwood in it (perhaps synthetic?), but to me it mostly smells like a bug spray my parents used in the &#x27;80s.</li>
            <li>I wonder how they do it, it&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li>I had resorted to trying to skip a day (or sometimes two) between shaves because I noticed that my skin reacted better when there was more growth.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Not as refreshing as Trumpers Lemon</li>
            <li>This is more of a balm</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be getting any more.</li>
            <li>Only drawback:  the wonderful sandalwood scent&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use cologne, that&#x27;s okay, though.</li>
            <li>Your face will love you for using this.</li>
            <li>Just ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li>My favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased GFT&#x27;s Extract of Limes Skin Food after seeing it used in many shaving videos by some popular &amp;#34;teachers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>One of the best aftershaves money can buy, very soothing, and very good smelling, and also works really well on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I got this item because I was looking for a good shaving balm with straight sandalwood fragrance.</li>
            <li>He is very picky but he loved this.</li>
            <li>It is easily removed with water, if desired.     </li>
            <li>so it is a thicker gel like and that makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This one seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent of Sandalwood on this aftershave lotion.  </li>
            <li>As far as performance, it&#x27;s good if you like glycerine like I do.</li>
            <li>Since I liked it so much, I ordered the GFT Sampler to try a range of their products before buying full sizes.</li>
            <li>I use it only in summer months and very rarely because It seems to not replenish moisture as good as Proraso.</li>
            <li>If you like smoothness and the sandlewood scent I full heatedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and perfumey.</li>
            <li>I think others might enjoy this product regardless of whether they use one of the many choices of men&#x27;s shaving razors available today or a straight razor, like mine, that is almost 100 years old.</li>
            <li>It smells great and a little goes a long way which is good cause</li>
            <li>It does feel nice on the face, and leaves it smooth and dry as advertised.</li>
            <li>since purchased a shave soap from another company that uses straight sandalwood, and using that before this product actually makes for a slightly better combination (luckily--as I&#x27;m not going to just throw out this $29 bottle when it does work perfectly fine).</li>
            <li>After application: there is no stinging feeling of something evaporating on your irritated skin, the razor burn goes away, the skin feels soft and clean to the touch, and finally the smell is addictively good, but not quite strong enough to spread around and offend others who may not agree (although I doubt these people exist).    </li>
            <li>I have a thick beard and after a good safety razor baby smooth shave this stuff goes on and smells like pure sandlewood heaven.</li>
            <li>and I can now - for the first time in my life - shave every day and not have the slightest bit of irritation.  </li>
            <li>However, Geo F. Trumper Sandalwood Skin Food doesn&#x27;t do anything more for my skin than a standard aftershave splash.  </li>
            <li>While primariliy motivated by the high cost, in my opinion, of replacement cartridge razor blades these days, I was also intrigued by the idea of doing something many men did on a regular basis over a 100 years ago.     </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t comment on how it works as a pre-shave lubricant because I use an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does help my skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, just a dab about the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of aftershaves for straight razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>Try Musgo Real Aftershave Classic Scent.  </li>
            <li>In the early stages of learning how to wield a straight razor and also how to create and maintain a sharp edge, I realized that a good face balm would be helpful to relieve some of the initial rawness I inflicted on my face.      </li>
            <li>If I could go three or four days in between, my skin would be almost &#x27;normal&#x27; ....</li>
            <li>you have normal skin</li>
            <li>I like the general feeling of it and the scent is decent and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasing, but not particularly unique, and the lotion goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me a lot of Afta, original scent, which costs much less.  </li>
            <li>This makes your skin feel so soft after shaving.</li>
            <li>If your like me and like the feeling of having soft skin even in the winter, this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li>About six months ago I decided to take a step back in time and learn to shave with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I am a bit of an anomaly as far as skin is concerned)</li>
            <li>Definitely cuts the shaving irritation down by a significant amount.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, everybody&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different products, so I guess you should still play it safe and try it out first.  </li>
            <li>I have very literally tried at least 50 different things (after shaves, pre shaves, oils, ointments, different shaving creams, different shaving blades, different shaving styles, overnight creams, you name it) - some of them helped more than others, but none of them solved my problem.  </li>
            <li>The price is very steep, but this does go along way and will last you for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have dry sensitive skin, or psoriasis (like myself)</li>
            <li>my dry sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of the price at first, but a little goes a long way, very worth it!</li>

            <li> I cannot get past that; it&#x27;s the only thing I can think of when smelling it--either in the bottle, or on my face for a few hours after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, you either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> so, I had been forced to be at work with lots of red irritation on my skin ...not</li>
            <li> And while it&#x27;s not inexpensive, a little does go along ways.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I get bad razor burn every single time I shave.  </li>
            <li> Small bottle</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive, but it last for months!&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li> ..makes for an extremely slick shave put on preshave and maximum comfort post shave...</li>
            <li> But the scent isn&#x27;t the least bit woody.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one.</li>

            <li> Sandalwood&#x27;s been growing on me recently. I originally purchased GFT&#x27;s Extract of Limes Skin Food after seeing it used in many shaving videos by some popular &amp;#34;teachers&amp;#34;. Since I liked it so much, I ordered the GFT Sampler to try a range of their products before buying full sizes. The sandalwood formulation feels just as great after a shave, with the addition of a bit of a skin-tightening feeling that I really like.</li>
            <li> I got this item because I was looking for a good shaving balm with straight sandalwood fragrance. This one seemed to fit the bill. It does feel nice on the face, and leaves it smooth and dry as advertised. Only the tiniest drop from the bottle is needed to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the smell is not what I&#x27;d expected. The product may have sandalwood in it (perhaps synthetic?), but to me it mostly smells like a bug spray my parents used in the &#x27;80s. I cannot get past that; it&#x27;s the only thing I can think of when smelling it--either in the bottle, or on my face for a few hours after I put it on. My SO says it smells of lemon-grass or something similarly zingy, with only the barest hint of sandalwood underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since purchased a shave soap from another company that uses straight sandalwood, and using that before this product actually makes for a slightly better combination (luckily--as I&#x27;m not going to just throw out this $29 bottle when it does work perfectly fine).</li>
            <li> This makes your skin feel so soft after shaving. All it needs it 1-2 drops per applications. Small bottle and it&#x27;s expensive, but it last for months!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great. Definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have a thick beard and after a good safety razor baby smooth shave this stuff goes on and smells like pure sandlewood heaven. If you like smoothness and the sandlewood scent I full heatedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, I gave it to my granddad for Christmas and he loves it.  He is very picky but he loved this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Big fan of the aroma and so is the wife. Makes me sort of look forward to shaving now.</li>
            <li> Everything that needs to be said about this product has been said by other reviewers. Bottom line, you either love it or hate it. The price is very steep, but this does go along way and will last you for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sandalwood smell is not overpowering, which is nice, but is also dissipates within a couple of minutes. I consider this as a lightweight moisturizer, which I use after getting out of the shower. I really can&#x27;t comment on how it works as a pre-shave lubricant because I use an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for something to soothe razor burn, please look elsewhere. As I stated earlier, you will either love this or hate it. If your like me and like the feeling of having soft skin even in the winter, this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li> Amazing pre and post shave product. ..makes for an extremely slick shave put on preshave and maximum comfort post shave...very nice scent too!</li>
            <li> Mixed feelings about the fragrance.  Seems to dry out my skin too.</li>
            <li> About six months ago I decided to take a step back in time and learn to shave with a straight razor.  While primariliy motivated by the high cost, in my opinion, of replacement cartridge razor blades these days, I was also intrigued by the idea of doing something many men did on a regular basis over a 100 years ago.     In the early stages of learning how to wield a straight razor and also how to create and maintain a sharp edge, I realized that a good face balm would be helpful to relieve some of the initial rawness I inflicted on my face.      I am a subscriber to a wonderful online forum located at [...].  Trump&#x27;s \\&quot;face food\\&quot; was mentioned in several posts as a soothing aftershave \\&quot;skin food\\&quot; and I decided to try the product, choosing the sandalwood fragrance.     Although this product is relatively expensive, in my opinion, I was not disappointed.  The product has approximately the consistency of a hand lotion with a light fragrance of sandalwood.  It feels good on my face after shaving, dries quickly and soothes any \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; I might have inflicted on myself. It is easily removed with water, if desired.     I think others might enjoy this product regardless of whether they use one of the many choices of men&#x27;s shaving razors available today or a straight razor, like mine, that is almost 100 years old.</li>
            <li> I wonder how they do it, it&#x27;s like magic.  It&#x27;s almost too good to be true.    After application: there is no stinging feeling of something evaporating on your irritated skin, the razor burn goes away, the skin feels soft and clean to the touch, and finally the smell is addictively good, but not quite strong enough to spread around and offend others who may not agree (although I doubt these people exist).    If you already know you like sandalwood, I might even suggest you go ahead and buy the 200ml or larger varieties, because I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d regret it.  Unfortunately, everybody&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different products, so I guess you should still play it safe and try it out first.  It may seem expensive, but I use only 2 or 3 drops each day, so I think this will last a year or more.</li>
            <li> I have ordered hundreds of things from Amazon over the years and have not yet (until now) written a review.  This product compelled me to write about it.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and I get bad razor burn every single time I shave.  I have very literally tried at least 50 different things (after shaves, pre shaves, oils, ointments, different shaving creams, different shaving blades, different shaving styles, overnight creams, you name it) - some of them helped more than others, but none of them solved my problem.  I had resorted to trying to skip a day (or sometimes two) between shaves because I noticed that my skin reacted better when there was more growth.  If I could go three or four days in between, my skin would be almost &#x27;normal&#x27; ....but, going without shaving for a day or two sometimes isn&#x27;t an option ...so, I had been forced to be at work with lots of red irritation on my skin ...not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Geo Trumper into my life - - I use this before and after a shave (alongside a good shaving cream), and I can now - for the first time in my life - shave every day and not have the slightest bit of irritation.  It is absolutely amazing - I would give it 6 stars if it were possible.  I immediately ordered another two bottles and will be on this stuff going forward.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent of Sandalwood on this aftershave lotion.  However, Geo F. Trumper Sandalwood Skin Food doesn&#x27;t do anything more for my skin than a standard aftershave splash.  My skin is oily.  Skin Food is very expensive and for that amount of money it should do more for your face than an aftershave splash. It also caused me to break out with some acne, but this might just be my oily skin.  There are much better values out there for good skin care after a shave.  Try Musgo Real Aftershave Classic Scent.  It does a much better just working on the skin and provides an awesome masculine scent!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great and a little goes a long way which is good cause it is a bit pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry sensitive skin, or psoriasis (like myself) this is not the best product for you. I use it only in summer months and very rarely because It seems to not replenish moisture as good as Proraso. Proraso seems to be the best product out there for the money for my dry sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal skin you will not regret buying this aftershave. (I rated it five stars because most guys will have a great result with it. I am a bit of an anomaly as far as skin is concerned)</li>
            <li> Definitely cuts the shaving irritation down by a significant amount. Smells great. Feels great. Buy it and experience the opulence you deserve.</li>
            <li> Not as refreshing as Trumpers Lemon</li>
            <li> I use this for aftershave and it does a good job of soothing razor burns and bumps. I like the general feeling of it and the scent is decent and not overpowering. This is more of a balm so it is a thicker gel like and that makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> As far as performance, it&#x27;s good if you like glycerine like I do. But the scent isn&#x27;t the least bit woody. It&#x27;s sweet and perfumey. I won&#x27;t be getting any more.</li>
            <li> It really does help my skin.  I started using it as a pre-shave and after shave.  I&#x27;m impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face after a shave. It doesn&#x27;t take much, just a dab about the size of a dime.  Only drawback:  the wonderful sandalwood scent&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t last long. If you&#x27;re going to use cologne, that&#x27;s okay, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of aftershaves for straight razor shaving.  This is the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  Smells great, feels great.  I was skeptical of the price at first, but a little goes a long way, very worth it!</li>
            <li> Just awesome on the face after a good shave. Feels really great. You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one. And while it&#x27;s not inexpensive, a little does go along ways. Your face will love you for using this.</li>
            <li> The best post shave lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, I feel like I just left the barber.  Great scent and wife loves it. Just ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> One of the best aftershaves money can buy, very soothing, and very good smelling, and also works really well on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My favorite aftershave. Smells great all day while soothing your face</li>
            <li> I probably would not have purchased this product if I&#x27;d taken the time to consider how small the bottle is: 100ml is not verry big.  The scent is pleasing, but not particularly unique, and the lotion goes on smooth.  It reminds me a lot of Afta, original scent, which costs much less.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks as post-electric shave lotion.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> feels great to put on right after shaving keeps my face feeling good all day.</li>
