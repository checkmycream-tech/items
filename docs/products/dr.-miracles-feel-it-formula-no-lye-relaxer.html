            <li>My aunt just loved this product.</li>
            <li>and i cut off  a good inch or two by December.</li>

            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>really do believe that Dr. Miracle&#x27;s is the best relaxer that you can buy yourself.</li>
            <li>(rinse the oil out with warm water, apply shampoo, rinse, shampoo again, rinse, condition, then style.</li>
            <li>I really do believe that Dr. Miracle&#x27;s is the best relaxer that you can buy yourself.</li>
            <li>and i always relax my own hair</li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt like Indian hair, honestly.</li>
            <li>I applied the conditioner packet inside the kit and Vatika which does feel nice and my heat cap.  </li>
            <li>my first use was around May 2014 and my hair did great</li>
            <li>it is perfect for me, my hair is soft curly strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use my ORS relaxer until I find something that s better.</li>
            <li>I love DR.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE MY HAIR WAS STILL VERY NAPPY (LOL).  </li>
            <li>im go back to what i know the best</li>
            <li>And my hair looks and feels better than it ever has.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even see my split ends, although I&#x27;m sure they are still there.  </li>
            <li>This is thinner than ORS and goes on more evenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I noticed that this relaxer is very drying to the hair (I can feel the dryness of it almost immediately), I have experienced no breakage, no shedding, nothing.</li>
            <li>The relaxers would always work for a week, at the most.</li>
            <li>But, this relaxer could not have done a better job; people keep asking me which relaxer I used because my hair looks like Pocahontas&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I must say though the day after I used this I felt build up of the relaxer on top of my head.</li>
            <li>the more you use it though, the straighter it will be.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t leave this on the hair more than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Carols Daughters Healthy Hair Butter and did a roller set.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than BB when it came to smoothing out unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the Soft &amp; Beautiful</li>
            <li>i love my results  salon results but a cheap price it did my hair justice</li>
            <li>It made her hair more manageable and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>have tried other relaxers on my brothers hair now for about a year and this one is one of the best for straightening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This relaxer obviously works great for many people, but not for me.</li>
            <li>It might work for you, but it was too strong for me</li>
            <li>and I decide to stop coloring and have a fair amount of new growth (1&#x27;+).  </li>
            <li>our hair looks like we stuck our fingers in a light socket.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Dr. Miracle&#x27;s regular relaxer is great</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain for a product that is so cheap.</li>
            <li>This is all that I use since I tried it after it was recommended to me by a friend, and all I expect to ever use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out getting my hair relaxed by a stylist (or Mom herself) who used FabuLaxer, which always did a good job, but always burned my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, the damage it does is minimal to nonexistent, and it leaves your hair in better condition than it was before you started using it.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, the damage it does is minimal to nonexistent, and it leaves your hair in better condition than it was before you started using it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Honestly the only con I have is that I wish the shampoo was more</li>
            <li>I tried Optimum, and, prior to switching over to Dr. Miracle&#x27;s, was a steady and faithful Soft and Beautiful user.</li>
            <li>and, honestly, on a weekly basis), is to give myself a pure, hot olive oil treatment.</li>
            <li>That said, a good chunk of my hair ended up in my comb for the next day or two and that always makes me sigh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I used this product for the very first time and</li>
            <li>I massage the oil into my scalp and hair, cover my head with a plastic bag, leave it in for 20 to 30 minutes, then shampoo it back out with two shampoo applications (rinse the oil out with warm water, apply shampoo, rinse, shampoo again, rinse, condition, then style.</li>
            <li>I was so excited because it litterally lays your hair out, straight hair</li>
            <li>I find that much of what she&#x27;d told me about Dr. Miracle&#x27;s No Lye Cream Relaxer Kit holds true for me, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any of his products.</li>
            <li>I have already order more for next month.</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Well i think this product just did ok for me in my eyes, but i only tried it once</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I do not have any scabs on my head after relaxing it.  </li>
            <li>First of all, all relaxers smell.  </li>
            <li>Looks like I can keep my real hair!</li>
            <li>So the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li>FOR FIRST TIMERS: if it gets on your hands, wash it off ASAP.</li>
            <li>it will work the first time u use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some of this was down to user error on my part, but there are certainly better options for relaxers if you&#x27;re willing to spend a little more money.</li>
            <li>on a positive note this stuff DOES NOT INFACT</li>
            <li>Used for the second time on my very curly hair and most of my hair ended up straight.</li>
            <li>I love that minty cool Deep Conditioner but overall a 4...out of 5.</li>
            <li>STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>Processed my hair and turned it from coarse to relatively smooth.</li>
            <li>I really regret not getting it for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I noted his hair was much drier looking than when we used ORS, straighter but much drier, if you use this product buy an INTENSIVE after conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Smooth relaxer on with the wooden stick</li>
            <li>so this product really changed our hairs.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>My friend, who has very kinky hair referred dr miracles to me</li>
            <li>Last year i picked up Dr. Miracles and everything about what i read made me feel comfortable using it</li>
            <li>it WILL IN FACT burn you after 5 to 10 mins, and no one wants that.</li>
            <li>I do think that I might have put on too much</li>
            <li>my edges, add a considerable amount of olive oil in the mixture and only keep it in my hair for about 2-3 minutes at most.</li>
            <li>You will not see the build up through a mirror, but if you obviously feel around on top of your head, you&#x27;ll be able to tell that you need to seriously scrub</li>
            <li>My older brother</li>
            <li>I pour about half a cup of 100% pure olive oil into a cup, microwave it until just warm (about 2 minutes at 40% power), then use a coffee scoop to pour it over my hair at the hairline, middle of my head, and around the sides.</li>
            <li>, I make a conscious and concerted effort NOT to scratch my scalp for at least a good three to five days before I plan to relax my new growth.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft, straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was blown away by how soft and silky and STRAIGHT my hair is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how useful my review is to others because I only use it to &amp;#34;texlax&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>After drying my hair, it was gunky, and yes-straight-but not a good kind of straight.</li>
            <li>and/or left it on too long because my hair still feels like there&#x27;s product still in it, hopefully it will feel better after a few more washes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Mulatto (mom&#x27;s Black, dad&#x27;s White), and have been relaxing my own hair for almost twenty years now.</li>
            <li>Something really light that still burned my scalp and left my hair brittle with massive split ends and breaking like everything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Really, our hair is so much straighter that we don&#x27;t even have to use our flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Back in 2011, this relaxer burned my hair to a crisp.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair dry and kind of stiff.</li>
            <li>I can also tell that it stripped a bit of my all over black dye, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this relaxer is mild, and doesn&#x27;t burn or do anywhere NEAR the damage that I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to when using other cream relaxers.</li>
            <li>Yes, those sensitive spots on my scalp do still develop burns, but I truly don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s any way around that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That process completely restores my hair from chemical damage, and I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.</li>
            <li>That process completely restores my hair from chemical damage, and I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.</li>
            <li>This made the hairs on the back of his neck very course, (dare</li>
            <li>I lost so much hair that I had to cut it really short</li>
            <li>we need a soft relaxer for our type of hair.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp and it doesnt even burn me, or itch.</li>
            <li>Was totally blown away by how straight my hair is.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near this relaxer ever again.</li>
            <li>(obviously becomes straighter, curly (becomes straight if you leave it in for like 20 to 30 mins......</li>
            <li>I was surprised since I had read so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>The relaxer smelled like any other relaxer and all the other products have a refreshing smell, similar to Big Red chewing gum, or Winterfresh chewing gum, it is a strong scent</li>
            <li>(we both have the same texture hair) and Dr. Miracle&#x27;s relaxer was right next to it.  </li>
            <li>This is very important if you want the sleek straight look and will not damage the hair as long as you use a comb without very small teeth.</li>
            <li>last 3 months, it will start to fade out half way through the 3rd month (depending on how well you spread the stuff on top of your head) but it does work.</li>
            <li>edges are still full and fluffy, my hair still looks &amp;#34;kinky&amp;#34; and blends with the rest of my natural hair</li>
            <li>So while I was relaxer free I am also dark blonde.  </li>
            <li>I have always been told I dont have hair like most african americans because my hair is naturally strait, with a very small wave in it.</li>
            <li>I always thought this was the reason why no other relaxers would hold in my hair.</li>
            <li>I first started using this product a few months ago after searching near and far online for reviews.</li>
            <li>Our hair has always been very curly and without flat irons, gels, mousses, or African hair products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just 10x easier for me to wear different natural hairstyles, slick my hair into ponytails without worrying about it fuzzing up because my edges are so much shorter than the rest of my hair not because of breakage but do to a generally shorter terminal length thats pretty noticeable when not wearing the hair</li>
            <li>MAYBE 3 TO 4 INCH NORMALLY MY HAIR PERMS STRAIGHT IN LITTLE TIME.  </li>
            <li>With the ors relaxer my hair is left soft and silky unlike the results from the dr miracle relaxer.</li>
            <li>I constantly get compliments on how soft, shiny, and silky my hair is, and I fully attribute it to the olive oil treatments I use.</li>
            <li>I constantly get compliments on how soft, shiny, and silky my hair is, and I fully attribute it to the olive oil treatments I use.</li>
            <li>I recommend this especially to females that are deployed and can&#x27;t get a professional perm.</li>
            <li>SO FAR IT HAS ONLY BEEN A DREAM..</li>
            <li>It does not smell at all, barely if any.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure some of this was down to user error on my part, but there are certainly better options for relaxers if you&#x27;re willing to spend a little more money.</li>
            <li> on a positive note this stuff DOES NOT INFACT</li>
            <li> Used for the second time on my very curly hair and most of my hair ended up straight.</li>
            <li> I love that minty cool Deep Conditioner but overall a 4...out of 5.</li>
            <li> STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> Processed my hair and turned it from coarse to relatively smooth.</li>
            <li> I really regret not getting it for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I noted his hair was much drier looking than when we used ORS, straighter but much drier, if you use this product buy an INTENSIVE after conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Smooth relaxer on with the wooden stick</li>
            <li> so this product really changed our hairs.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> My friend, who has very kinky hair referred dr miracles to me</li>
            <li> Last year i picked up Dr. Miracles and everything about what i read made me feel comfortable using it</li>
            <li> it WILL IN FACT burn you after 5 to 10 mins, and no one wants that.</li>
            <li> I do think that I might have put on too much</li>
            <li> my edges, add a considerable amount of olive oil in the mixture and only keep it in my hair for about 2-3 minutes at most.</li>
            <li> You will not see the build up through a mirror, but if you obviously feel around on top of your head, you&#x27;ll be able to tell that you need to seriously scrub</li>
            <li> My older brother</li>
            <li> I pour about half a cup of 100% pure olive oil into a cup, microwave it until just warm (about 2 minutes at 40% power), then use a coffee scoop to pour it over my hair at the hairline, middle of my head, and around the sides.</li>
            <li> , I make a conscious and concerted effort NOT to scratch my scalp for at least a good three to five days before I plan to relax my new growth.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft, straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was blown away by how soft and silky and STRAIGHT my hair is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how useful my review is to others because I only use it to &amp;#34;texlax&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After drying my hair, it was gunky, and yes-straight-but not a good kind of straight.</li>
            <li> and/or left it on too long because my hair still feels like there&#x27;s product still in it, hopefully it will feel better after a few more washes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Mulatto (mom&#x27;s Black, dad&#x27;s White), and have been relaxing my own hair for almost twenty years now.</li>
            <li> Something really light that still burned my scalp and left my hair brittle with massive split ends and breaking like everything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Really, our hair is so much straighter that we don&#x27;t even have to use our flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Back in 2011, this relaxer burned my hair to a crisp.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair dry and kind of stiff.</li>
            <li> I can also tell that it stripped a bit of my all over black dye, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this relaxer is mild, and doesn&#x27;t burn or do anywhere NEAR the damage that I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to when using other cream relaxers.</li>
            <li> Yes, those sensitive spots on my scalp do still develop burns, but I truly don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s any way around that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That process completely restores my hair from chemical damage, and I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.</li>
            <li> That process completely restores my hair from chemical damage, and I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.</li>
            <li> This made the hairs on the back of his neck very course, (dare</li>
            <li> I lost so much hair that I had to cut it really short</li>
            <li> we need a soft relaxer for our type of hair.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp and it doesnt even burn me, or itch.</li>
            <li> Was totally blown away by how straight my hair is.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near this relaxer ever again.</li>
            <li> (obviously becomes straighter, curly (becomes straight if you leave it in for like 20 to 30 mins......</li>
            <li> I was surprised since I had read so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The relaxer smelled like any other relaxer and all the other products have a refreshing smell, similar to Big Red chewing gum, or Winterfresh chewing gum, it is a strong scent</li>
            <li> (we both have the same texture hair) and Dr. Miracle&#x27;s relaxer was right next to it.  </li>
            <li> This is very important if you want the sleek straight look and will not damage the hair as long as you use a comb without very small teeth.</li>
            <li> last 3 months, it will start to fade out half way through the 3rd month (depending on how well you spread the stuff on top of your head) but it does work.</li>
            <li> edges are still full and fluffy, my hair still looks &amp;#34;kinky&amp;#34; and blends with the rest of my natural hair</li>
            <li> So while I was relaxer free I am also dark blonde.  </li>
            <li> I have always been told I dont have hair like most african americans because my hair is naturally strait, with a very small wave in it.</li>
            <li> I always thought this was the reason why no other relaxers would hold in my hair.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product a few months ago after searching near and far online for reviews.</li>
            <li> Our hair has always been very curly and without flat irons, gels, mousses, or African hair products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just 10x easier for me to wear different natural hairstyles, slick my hair into ponytails without worrying about it fuzzing up because my edges are so much shorter than the rest of my hair not because of breakage but do to a generally shorter terminal length thats pretty noticeable when not wearing the hair</li>
            <li> MAYBE 3 TO 4 INCH NORMALLY MY HAIR PERMS STRAIGHT IN LITTLE TIME.  </li>
            <li> With the ors relaxer my hair is left soft and silky unlike the results from the dr miracle relaxer.</li>
            <li> I constantly get compliments on how soft, shiny, and silky my hair is, and I fully attribute it to the olive oil treatments I use.</li>
            <li> I constantly get compliments on how soft, shiny, and silky my hair is, and I fully attribute it to the olive oil treatments I use.</li>
            <li> I recommend this especially to females that are deployed and can&#x27;t get a professional perm.</li>
            <li> SO FAR IT HAS ONLY BEEN A DREAM..</li>
            <li> It does not smell at all, barely if any.  </li>
            <li> Section hair starting at the back of the neck to prevent over processing the front and sides, go in long rows across.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with kinky, nappy, hard to manage (I think type 4c) hair and after I applied this relaxer following the directions exactly, my hair was slick, soft, and silky.</li>
            <li> I USED MY FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> I usually relax my hair with ORS olive oil relaxer but decided to try something new since the dr miracle relaxer was the same price.</li>
            <li> It completely fried/dried out my hair to the point where my ends are completely patched and dead now, very coarse and stiff in feeling.</li>
            <li> i was suprised to see that my hair was so soft and the texture was so silky that i felt like i had found my little mirical in a box</li>
            <li> People high and low complained about the commercials</li>
            <li> Really there was nothing negative to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> FOR YEARS I WANTED TO HAVE LONG HAIR, OR HAIR</li>
            <li> AGAIN AS A REMINDER: the longer its in, The straighter it will be as well, but not too long</li>
            <li> She said that this was all that she ever used, that it didn&#x27;t burn her scalp, and that even when her relaxer started to grow out, her hair didn&#x27;t revert back to \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; condition the way that it had with other chemical relaxers.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other relaxer.</li>
            <li> WAS SO DRY AND BRITTLE</li>
            <li> So I picked this at CVS since I am an utter failure at going natural.  </li>
            <li> You do have to maintain it by conditioning often so that your scalp doesnt become dry, but that is to be expected with anything you use.</li>
            <li> It only took less than 9 mins.</li>
            <li> lye, no lye, mizani, silk elements, ors, dark and lovely, etc) that I was considering cutting my hair and just getting a weave.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I know about the above mentioned products because I have paid hair stylists to use them in my hair for years and usually when 5 weeks is up my hair turns back into a bush.</li>
            <li> Reconsider purchasing this product-go for the salon&#x27;s more expensive option to prevent destroying your hair!</li>
            <li> I LEFT THIS PERM ON FOR A LITTLE LONGER THAN SPECIFIED</li>
            <li> Not to mention, my scalp used to be so dry and itchy using those other products and they always burned my scalp even when I did not scratch.</li>
            <li> Just For Me regular since everything else I have tried would burn and destroy my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever expect to stop using this product, nor do I expect to switch over to any other brand.tions</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever expect to stop using this product, nor do I expect to switch over to any other brand.</li>
            <li> Not sure why since I had never seen the commercial or even heard of it, but it intrigued me.  </li>
            <li> Especially because I attempted to texlax my edges in the past with another relaxer that led to extreme breakage.</li>
            <li> and I see nothing wrong with them because my hair was wild and unmanageable just like the woman in the commercials prior to my trying this product</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to using this relaxer, and some were negative</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions step by step and was really hoping this would be a cheaper alternative to an expensive Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li> My natural hair can be slightly frustrating to deal with</li>

            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I went to get a haircut recently that my hair lady asked me if I had ever put a relaxer on those baby strands that are hard to tame.  </li>
            <li> purchased this in regular strength (I usually use super) and was hoping it would keep my crazy roots from looking too horrible and becoming slightly manageable.</li>
            <li> , MY ENDS DID NOT TAKE AT ALL, NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.  </li>
            <li> I WASHED OUT PERM USED CONDITIONER AND BLEW DRIED MY HAIR AND MY LITTLE BIT OF HAIR</li>
            <li> The neutralizing shampoo did not turn pink as ORS an was hardly visible.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The box was opened and the products were wasted all over rendering them unusable.</li>
            <li> I use to use a one and only texturizer to loosen my hair but a bad experience left the back of my hair broken off all the way</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny, strait, and even helps my ends, which without it look dry, broken, and brittle.</li>
            <li> was so frustrated by other relaxers barely even taming my roots (and I have tried all kinds-</li>

            <li> I read all sorts of negative reviews about this product making people&#x27;s hair fall out, people saying that is smells bad and people complaining about the commercials on tv for the product.</li>
            <li> After years of trying store bought relaxer kits and even trying expensive relaxers like Mizani Butter Blend, I was really frustrated that my very thick, resistant, curly hair was not being straightened like my friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bad smell,</li>
            <li> My hair did not fall out, the relaxer did not even burn my scalp, and the smell was not that bad.</li>

            <li> I usually relax my hair with ORS olive oil relaxer but decided to try something new since the dr miracle relaxer was the same price. Well it didn&#x27;t turn out too well. It made my hair dry and kind of stiff. With the ors relaxer my hair is left soft and silky unlike the results from the dr miracle relaxer. I will continue to use my ORS relaxer until I find something that s better. dr miracle doesn&#x27;t quite cut the cake for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Mulatto (mom&#x27;s Black, dad&#x27;s White), and have been relaxing my own hair for almost twenty years now. This is all that I use since I tried it after it was recommended to me by a friend, and all I expect to ever use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out getting my hair relaxed by a stylist (or Mom herself) who used FabuLaxer, which always did a good job, but always burned my sensitive scalp. I tried Optimum, and, prior to switching over to Dr. Miracle&#x27;s, was a steady and faithful Soft and Beautiful user. And then, a friend of mine told me about this product. She said that this was all that she ever used, that it didn&#x27;t burn her scalp, and that even when her relaxer started to grow out, her hair didn&#x27;t revert back to \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; condition the way that it had with other chemical relaxers. I find that much of what she&#x27;d told me about Dr. Miracle&#x27;s No Lye Cream Relaxer Kit holds true for me, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s coming up on time for me to relax my hair, I make a conscious and concerted effort NOT to scratch my scalp for at least a good three to five days before I plan to relax my new growth. I have sensitive skin, so my scalp tends to burn badly even without scratches on it. I&#x27;ve found that this relaxer is mild, and doesn&#x27;t burn or do anywhere NEAR the damage that I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to when using other cream relaxers. Yes, those sensitive spots on my scalp do still develop burns, but I truly don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s any way around that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I&#x27;ve always done to restore my scalp and hair after a relaxer (and, honestly, on a weekly basis), is to give myself a pure, hot olive oil treatment. I pour about half a cup of 100% pure olive oil into a cup, microwave it until just warm (about 2 minutes at 40% power), then use a coffee scoop to pour it over my hair at the hairline, middle of my head, and around the sides. I massage the oil into my scalp and hair, cover my head with a plastic bag, leave it in for 20 to 30 minutes, then shampoo it back out with two shampoo applications (rinse the oil out with warm water, apply shampoo, rinse, shampoo again, rinse, condition, then style. I do that weekly). That process completely restores my hair from chemical damage, and I&#x27;ve been doing it for years. I constantly get compliments on how soft, shiny, and silky my hair is, and I fully attribute it to the olive oil treatments I use. The Dr. Miracle&#x27;s relaxers are just the icing on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do believe that Dr. Miracle&#x27;s is the best relaxer that you can buy yourself. The smell is pleasant, the damage it does is minimal to nonexistent, and it leaves your hair in better condition than it was before you started using it. I don&#x27;t ever expect to stop using this product, nor do I expect to switch over to any other brand.tions (rinse the oil out with warm water, apply shampoo, rinse, shampoo again, rinse, condition, then style.

            <li> I love DR. Miracle&#x27;s products. This is my first time using any of his products. My hair is very thick. The perm straighten my hair really good. I have already order more for next month. I recommend this especially to females that are deployed and can&#x27;t get a professional perm.</li>
            <li> FOR YEARS I WANTED TO HAVE LONG HAIR, OR HAIR TO TOUCH MY SHOULDERS...SO FAR IT HAS ONLY BEEN A DREAM..AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I DECIDED TO BITE THE BULLET AND BUY THIS PERM..TO MY SURPRISE IT DID NOT WORK ON MY HAIR..I HAVE VERY SHORT HAIR MAYBE 3 TO 4 INCH NORMALLY MY HAIR PERMS STRAIGHT IN LITTLE TIME.  I LEFT THIS PERM ON FOR A LITTLE LONGER THAN SPECIFIED BECAUSE MY HAIR WAS STILL VERY NAPPY (LOL).  I WASHED OUT PERM USED CONDITIONER AND BLEW DRIED MY HAIR AND MY LITTLE BIT OF HAIR WAS SO DRY AND BRITTLE, MY ENDS DID NOT TAKE AT ALL, NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.  I USED MY FLAT IRON AND IT GOT MY HAIR STRAIGHT BUT THE ENDS STILL BRITTLE.  I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> I used this relaxer last night and i was also a skeptic by the reviews but took a chance on this product i was suprised to see that my hair was so soft and the texture was so silky that i felt like i had found my little mirical in a box i love my results  salon results but a cheap price it did my hair justice and i vouch to use this the next time around  please try it the conditioner is amazing</li>
            <li> Great product which I&#x27;ve used before.  Leaves hair feeling soft, straight and shiny. Would recommend this product to women that choose permed hair.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it was supposed to do. Processed my hair and turned it from coarse to relatively smooth. I didn&#x27;t want to pull out my hair towards the end of the procedure and all of my hair didn&#x27;t fall out after the relaxer. That said, a good chunk of my hair ended up in my comb for the next day or two and that always makes me sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and I love that minty cool Deep Conditioner but overall a 4...out of 5.</li>
            <li> Well i think this product just did ok for me in my eyes, but i only tried it once but i think im go back to what i know the best</li>
            <li> I started relaxing my hair as a teenager.  I&#x27;ve always used the Soft &amp; Beautiful Just For Me regular since everything else I have tried would burn and destroy my scalp and hair.  Even when visiting my parents&#x27; country (Dominican Republic) a salon lady convinced me she had a perfect relaxer for my hair.  Something really light that still burned my scalp and left my hair brittle with massive split ends and breaking like everything else I have tried.  Well this past weekend I was at the store buying my usual \\&quot;Just for Me\\&quot; relaxers for my teenage daughter and myself (we both have the same texture hair) and Dr. Miracle&#x27;s relaxer was right next to it.  Not sure why since I had never seen the commercial or even heard of it, but it intrigued me.  I went into the isle twice after leaving with my \\&quot;Just for me\\&quot; relaxers to read the entire Dr. Miracle box.  I ended up buying it for myself while buying the Just for Me for my daughter just in case.  Didn&#x27;t want to experiment with her hair.    After trying many I have to say this is the BEST relaxer I have ever tried.  I really regret not getting it for my daughter.  You can actually see the difference in both relaxer comparing our hairs since they are the same textures.  For the first time in my life I do not have any scabs on my head after relaxing it.  My daughter does though.  My hair is also a lot prettier and healthier looking than it has ever been.    I&#x27;m honestly not sure what all the bad reviews are about as they make no sense to me.  First of all, all relaxers smell.  Actually a lot stronger than this.  And my hair looks and feels better than it ever has.  You can&#x27;t even see my split ends, although I&#x27;m sure they are still there.  Just not noticeable after using everything as directed that was in the box.  I am very happy with this product and happy I didn&#x27;t read reviews before buying.  All I can say is buy it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> My brother and I are of Irish heritage and have possible mixed heritage as well. Our hair has always been very curly and without flat irons, gels, mousses, or African hair products our hair looks like we stuck our fingers in a light socket.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other relaxers on my brothers hair now for about a year and this one is one of the best for straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros and cons and tips are listed below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Does straighten frizzy kinky hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;2. Has an amazing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;3. Ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;4. This is thinner than ORS and goes on more evenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I noted his hair was much drier looking than when we used ORS, straighter but much drier, if you use this product buy an INTENSIVE after conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;2. The neutralizing shampoo did not turn pink as ORS an was hardly visible.&lt;br /&gt;3. This made the hairs on the back of his neck very course, (dare I said like public hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Section hair starting at the back of the neck to prevent over processing the front and sides, go in long rows across.&lt;br /&gt;2. Put relaxer on after you use the gel to protect the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. Smooth relaxer on with the wooden stick provided.&lt;br /&gt;4. COMB THOUGH HAIR! This is very important if you want the sleek straight look and will not damage the hair as long as you use a comb without very small teeth.</li>
            <li> I used it and chunks of my hair started breaking off. I lost so much hair that I had to cut it really short and whatever was left, they were severely damaged. My hair is all damaged for this product alone. I hate it. It might work for you, but it was too strong for me</li>
            <li> Wow!  My older brother and I used this product for the very first time and we were soooo impressed with the results!  Really, our hair is so much straighter that we don&#x27;t even have to use our flat iron.  We both have course hair so this product really changed our hairs.  It does not smell at all, barely if any.  Really there was nothing negative to say about this product.  We&#x27;ll definitely rebuy this product again whenever we decide to redo this all over again.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how useful my review is to others because I only use it to &amp;#34;texlax&amp;#34; my edges, add a considerable amount of olive oil in the mixture and only keep it in my hair for about 2-3 minutes at most. Though I noticed that this relaxer is very drying to the hair (I can feel the dryness of it almost immediately), I have experienced no breakage, no shedding, nothing. It is amazing. Especially because I attempted to texlax my edges in the past with another relaxer that led to extreme breakage. So I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My edges are still full and fluffy, my hair still looks &amp;#34;kinky&amp;#34; and blends with the rest of my natural hair and I still have a bit of curl. It&#x27;s just 10x easier for me to wear different natural hairstyles, slick my hair into ponytails without worrying about it fuzzing up because my edges are so much shorter than the rest of my hair not because of breakage but do to a generally shorter terminal length thats pretty noticeable when not wearing the hair straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot and have been using it for a while. Note: I always do a Joico K-pak treatment mixed with hydrolyzed wheat protein and then follow it up with the joico moisture balm immediately after washing out the relaxer. I also use s-curl and jamaican castor oil daily and I have experienced no thinning or breakage. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> this product my daughter uses it. I started to use it too. we need a soft relaxer for our type of hair.</li>
            <li> GREAT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to using this relaxer, and some were negative but I decided to try it anyway. I have always been told I dont have hair like most african americans because my hair is naturally strait, with a very small wave in it. I always thought this was the reason why no other relaxers would hold in my hair. The relaxers would always work for a week, at the most. My friend, who has very kinky hair referred dr miracles to me so I tried it. It is the ONLY relaxer that works for my hair. It makes my hair shiny, strait, and even helps my ends, which without it look dry, broken, and brittle. I dont know what I would do without this relaxer!   I have a sensitive scalp and it doesnt even burn me, or itch. Of course you cant just use this relaxer and not do anything else to your hair. You do have to maintain it by conditioning often so that your scalp doesnt become dry, but that is to be expected with anything you use. I would recommend that women use this relaxer. My hair has grown a good amount, of course not overnight. Just remember not to give up after using this once, you cant expect results overnight.</li>
            <li> Made my hair fall out and i always relax my own hair</li>
            <li> My aunt just loved this product. It made her hair more manageable and silky smooth. It only took less than 9 mins. to do the job.</li>
            <li> Purchased this at Walmart for about 8 bucks. Was totally blown away by how straight my hair is. After years of trying store bought relaxer kits and even trying expensive relaxers like Mizani Butter Blend, I was really frustrated that my very thick, resistant, curly hair was not being straightened like my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in regular strength (I usually use super) and was hoping it would keep my crazy roots from looking too horrible and becoming slightly manageable. I was blown away by how soft and silky and STRAIGHT my hair is. I could have left it on longer (after I smoothed the last part of my hair, I washed it off in about 3 minutes) and gotten even straighter results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bad smell, no burn, no damage to my hair. I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so frustrated by other relaxers barely even taming my roots (and I have tried all kinds- lye, no lye, mizani, silk elements, ors, dark and lovely, etc) that I was considering cutting my hair and just getting a weave. Looks like I can keep my real hair!</li>
            <li> The box was opened and the products were wasted all over rendering them unusable.</li>
            <li> My natural hair can be slightly frustrating to deal with so i have been texturizing for a while. I use to use a one and only texturizer to loosen my hair but a bad experience left the back of my hair broken off all the way and i stopped using it. Last year i picked up Dr. Miracles and everything about what i read made me feel comfortable using it and it is amazing. It purposely under processed because i never want to fully relax my hair. it is perfect for me, my hair is soft curly strong and healthy. I am stretching the relaxer out my first use was around May 2014 and my hair did great but my lack of care left split ends and i cut off  a good inch or two by December. I have not used it since December 2014 and will not use it again until December 2015 but it is the only one i will use for now on.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product a few months ago after searching near and far online for reviews. I read all sorts of negative reviews about this product making people&#x27;s hair fall out, people saying that is smells bad and people complaining about the commercials on tv for the product. Let me tell you, this is the best relaxer I have ever used. I would put it up against Designers Touch, Nairobi or even Motions any day and it will beat them every time. Trust me, I know about the above mentioned products because I have paid hair stylists to use them in my hair for years and usually when 5 weeks is up my hair turns back into a bush. Not to mention, my scalp used to be so dry and itchy using those other products and they always burned my scalp even when I did not scratch. I am an African American female with kinky, nappy, hard to manage (I think type 4c) hair and after I applied this relaxer following the directions exactly, my hair was slick, soft, and silky. My hair looked and felt like Indian hair, honestly. I was surprised since I had read so many negative reviews. My hair did not fall out, the relaxer did not even burn my scalp, and the smell was not that bad. The relaxer smelled like any other relaxer and all the other products have a refreshing smell, similar to Big Red chewing gum, or Winterfresh chewing gum, it is a strong scent but, it does not stink. People high and low complained about the commercials and I see nothing wrong with them because my hair was wild and unmanageable just like the woman in the commercials prior to my trying this product and I did not like my hair nappy. I suppose if you have never had hair so nappy that you can&#x27;t even comb it like I have had then you would find the commercials offensive. But, this relaxer could not have done a better job; people keep asking me which relaxer I used because my hair looks like Pocahontas&#x27;s. Dr. Miracle&#x27;s regular relaxer is great and I had never before seen results like that. I will never go back to any other relaxer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a beginner when it comes to applying box relaxers. Been doing it for over 20 years.  Back in 2011, this relaxer burned my hair to a crisp.  And it was NOT already burned, because I applied this relaxer after being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for almost three years.  I had to cut off half of the hair that it took me three years to grow out. I was heart-broken.  This relaxer obviously works great for many people, but not for me. I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near this relaxer ever again. In fairness, I will admit that I did not do a strand test.  I let my guard down, because I never had a problem with a relaxer before. LESSONED LEARNED!!!</li>
            <li> So the first time I used this product. I was so excited because it litterally lays your hair out, straight hair (obviously becomes straighter, curly (becomes straight if you leave it in for like 20 to 30 mins......TANGLED!? no match for the relaxer (of course id suggest having it in for 45 mins if your hair is rediculously tangled) BUT! i would pick the crap out of your hair before using this product REMEMBER:( The longer its in....the straighter it willl become). I must say though the day after I used this I felt build up of the relaxer on top of my head. I would DEFINITELY suggest scrubbbing like there is no day tomorrow. But if you find build up after that just keep scrubbing, it will dissappear within a couple of weeks. You will not see the build up through a mirror, but if you obviously feel around on top of your head, you&#x27;ll be able to tell that you need to seriously scrub better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on a positive note this stuff DOES NOT INFACT last 3 months, it will start to fade out half way through the 3rd month (depending on how well you spread the stuff on top of your head) but it does work. FOR FIRST TIMERS: if it gets on your hands, wash it off ASAP. it WILL IN FACT burn you after 5 to 10 mins, and no one wants that. (2) if you cover all of your hair and leave it in for the maximum time like it says on the instructions (I always do it for one hour because i have dominican nappy as hell hair) it will work the first time u use it. the more you use it though, the straighter it will be. AGAIN AS A REMINDER: the longer its in, The straighter it will be as well, but not too long cause then you&#x27;ll burn and damage your scalp DO NOT EXCEED 1 HOUR THOUGH!</li>
            <li> So I picked this at CVS since I am an utter failure at going natural.  For the summer I decided I would stop relaxing (last relaxer was April 2012) but I did color my hair.  So while I was relaxer free I am also dark blonde.  September rolls around and I decide to stop coloring and have a fair amount of new growth (1&#x27;+).  I also picked up the Dr. M conditioning packet (included in the kit) since I have very thick hair.  Please follow directions don&#x27;t leave this on the hair more than 15 minutes.  I have maybe 20 hair strands fall out when the process was completed.  I applied the conditioner packet inside the kit and Vatika which does feel nice and my heat cap.  After 30 minutes I rinsed and put in the leave in conditioner (supplied in the kit) and Carols Daughters Healthy Hair Butter and did a roller set.  Honestly the only con I have is that I wish the shampoo was more, I have very thick hair and one bottle was not enough.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am a white female (of French/Dutch/Irish descent) and I used this to straighten my curly hair. I followed all the directions step by step and was really hoping this would be a cheaper alternative to an expensive Brazilian Blowout. After drying my hair, it was gunky, and yes-straight-but not a good kind of straight. It completely fried/dried out my hair to the point where my ends are completely patched and dead now, very coarse and stiff in feeling. I am going to have to get it cut off because it is that bad. Reconsider purchasing this product-go for the salon&#x27;s more expensive option to prevent destroying your hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and Mexican.  I have some unruly baby hairs by my hairline and widow&#x27;s peak, that I absolutely HATE.  It&#x27;s always a struggle to straighten them.  I have gotten a brazilian blowout twice plus done it myself once.  This product works better than BB when it came to smoothing out unruly hair.  It wasn&#x27;t until I went to get a haircut recently that my hair lady asked me if I had ever put a relaxer on those baby strands that are hard to tame.  She was charging me 20 bucks but I passed and bought this product online.  It works! The conditioner smells awesome.  I do think that I might have put on too much and/or left it on too long because my hair still feels like there&#x27;s product still in it, hopefully it will feel better after a few more washes.  I can also tell that it stripped a bit of my all over black dye, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain for a product that is so cheap. Used for the second time on my very curly hair and most of my hair ended up straight. I&#x27;m sure some of this was down to user error on my part, but there are certainly better options for relaxers if you&#x27;re willing to spend a little more money.</li>
