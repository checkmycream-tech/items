            <li>Wonderful stuff!  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>it is as good as hair topic</li>
            <li>but it is a good product</li>
            <li>so far he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love this hair thickner.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is ok, however, I prefer Aveda&#x27;s volumizer spray.  </li>
            <li>It seems to &amp;#34;fatten&amp;#34; and fill out my hair better.  </li>
            <li>Works quite well to temporarily give hair texture and more fullness with or without heat or blow-drying.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It was mailed very promptly and included a very nice note from them thanking me for my order.  </li>
            <li>and I believe it may work better on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use ..</li>
            <li>so it was fine for me.</li>
            <li>and I have been a huge fan since..</li>
            <li>I had to use a bit more so the bangs feel slightly &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; but they look AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I am an older lady with very fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy this again, but for someone with thicker hair, it might be more appreciated.</li>
            <li>Excellent for fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li>even stays put for the most part swimming and is so natural looking</li>
            <li>Its okay, but really doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would try this brand because it was so reasonably priced and since I really like their Hair Fibers that they might have an &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; on hair &amp;#34;fattener&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me, probably because my hair is so fine.  </li>
            <li>and it actually makes my hair seem fuller :)</li>
            <li>It not only provides coverage, it also gives your hair more volume.  </li>
            <li>I would use the atomizer because the product goes a lot further and you can apply it more evenly.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>There are some products that work better, but they usually leave a residue in the hair that accumulates if you don&#x27;t use a clarifying shampoo, so this is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I have very thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li>It really does make your hair thicker.</li>
            <li>My husband says He can really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>Really works</li>
            <li>Great product for thin hair and to cover bald spots.  </li>
            <li>I sent for this particular product by mistake as I thought it was bald spot cover.  </li>
            <li>I would not order this particular product again</li>
            <li>Wow this really works.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, it did not change the appearance of my hair nearly enough for it to be worth how unclean it made me feel.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it actually does work pretty well at thickening hair.</li>
            <li>it works well, not any better then other products on the market for the same purpose</li>
            <li>The back still looks full enough but my bangs are embarrassingly thin.&lt;br /&gt;What  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised - I don&#x27;t like &#x27;product&#x27; in my hair, but this doesn&#x27;t leave a &#x27;gunky&#x27; feel</li>
            <li>I am very grateful to have this product along with the same brand&#x27;s keratin fibers.</li>
            <li>I may be slightly biased given that this product spilled all over the box in which it was shipped, but more than enough was left for me to try it out.</li>
            <li>I was just about ready to get a perm to help my baby fine thin hair with volume.  </li>
            <li>but I certainly would look for other products from them</li>
            <li>the product was exactly what I expected and works just as I expected.</li>
            <li>It thickened my thin, fine hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Stuff did nothing to thicken by thin hair at all.</li>
            <li> It was goopy, messy, and made me feel like I&#x27;d just dunked my head into a vat of oily disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have horrible thin, frizzy, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very thin/fine hair. Thought this would, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference with my hair feeling or looking any thicker. Disappointed...yes...shocked...not at all since everything I have tried for my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> the hair salon where I get my hair cut touted me on this and I have been a huge fan since..it is easy to use ..stays put after you hair oils lock it in...even stays put for the most part swimming and is so natural looking no one ever says a thing about how thin my hair is</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling like it has a film over it and i cant tell where it did anything.</li>
            <li> The product came in with a portion of the liquid/gel having spilled out of the can. I decided to try out the product even though some of the gel spilled out because it was only 6 bucks. Stuff did nothing to thicken by thin hair at all. Would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> Its okay, but really doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  I have course and I believe it may work better on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> It really does make your hair thicker.</li>
            <li> It thickened my thin, fine hair.  My husband says He can really tell the difference.  It makes it look fuller and thick.  I will order it again</li>
            <li> I sent for this particular product by mistake as I thought it was bald spot cover.  However, it was my error and I have used it as a thickener. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the bald spots.  It was mailed very promptly and included a very nice note from them thanking me for my order.  I would not order this particular product again but I certainly would look for other products from them</li>
            <li> I may be slightly biased given that this product spilled all over the box in which it was shipped, but more than enough was left for me to try it out. It was goopy, messy, and made me feel like I&#x27;d just dunked my head into a vat of oily disappointment. It left my scalp feeling a bit itchy, but my scalp is prone to that, so it may not be the fault of the product. Regardless, it did not change the appearance of my hair nearly enough for it to be worth how unclean it made me feel.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product ans so far he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> it is as good as hair topic so it was fine for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really works</li>
            <li> I am an older lady with very fine wavy hair. The back still looks full enough but my bangs are embarrassingly thin.&lt;br /&gt;What  difference this made! I had to use a bit more so the bangs feel slightly &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; but they look AMAZING!</li>

            <li> Seems to work if I could just remember to use it.</li>
            <li> Works quite well to temporarily give hair texture and more fullness with or without heat or blow-drying. There are some products that work better, but they usually leave a residue in the hair that accumulates if you don&#x27;t use a clarifying shampoo, so this is great for everyday use.</li>

            <li> I have horrible thin, frizzy, dry hair.  Every thickener I put in it makes it frizzier.  This stuff makes my hair thicker and actually silky.  I can&#x27;t believe how this stuff is working.  I do use pantene fortifying conditioner which is helping tame the frizz some as well.</li>
            <li> Daughter states she has not noticed a difference</li>
            <li> I like this product. It increases the volume in my hair quite well. I would certainly recommend this product. Love it.</li>
