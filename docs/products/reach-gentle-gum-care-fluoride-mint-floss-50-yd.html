            <li>This floss does the best job of getting it out.</li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>/&gt;We were happy to see it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>It also has a great taste.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great.  </li>
            <li>Great check ups from the hygienist and the dentist since I started using this floss.</li>
            <li>Was happy to find it on Amazon and purchased a pack of 6</li>
            <li>I really liked the Reach Cleanpaste the best of all</li>
            <li>Great product and happy to find again.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist and very effective</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like very fine sand paper which is awesome because it gets rid of everything you are using if for (aka plaque).  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I have been successful at containing my gum disease for 23 years now.  </li>
            <li>What I like best is that it is not waxed, does not break easy and</li>
            <li>This is easily the best floss on the market, if you can find it.</li>
            <li>About 10 years ago I had a dentist recommend this floss, because the woven unwaxed floss provides a good texture for scrubbing between teeth.</li>
            <li>Each night when I start flossing with this non-waxed floss, I think that it&#x27;s so good that I need to write a review on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is sooo good.  </li>
            <li>Good quality floss for your teeth when you need it.</li>
            <li>Flavor is good.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as the Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss.  </li>
            <li>I loved the fluoride floss</li>
            <li>Still, availability is what makes it a good buy.</li>
            <li>so I was very glad I could get it online.</li>
            <li>Sure if you have gaps in your teeth where floss can go great, however.</li>
            <li>Great floss for use twice or more per day without any harm to gums.  </li>
            <li>Love woven floss!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>The price is perfect on Amazon and fast shipping is nice.</li>
            <li>Keep some Dentotape handy to remove the torn floss.</li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>What makes this product awesome is you get 6 packs which should last you a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>This soft woven rope floss is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is my far the best.  </li>
            <li>The string floss is very easy to handle and feels better on my gums.</li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Woven floss is more stretchy so isn&#x27;t as painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I feel the woven can better trap the detritus stuck between teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased more since then.  </li>
            <li>I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush, which I am quite pleased with.  </li>
            <li>The wax floss works much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I am picky about my floss :) .  </li>
            <li>I have been using this floss for many years.</li>
            <li>I have receded gums and was concerned about not incurring any more recession.  </li>
            <li>The difference is this floss has &#x27;gripping ability&#x27; vs. floss that is smooth/slippery.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>for some reason most markets don&#x27;t carry it though it works better than waxed or tape flosses.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite floss ever.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut my gums and I think it cleans better.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I feel that it does a better job than waxed floss.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is woven as I find it helps in removing any plaque plus being mint flavored is a plus.</li>
            <li>I cannot find Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss on Amazon any more.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>This is the woven floss and my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Since it is my favorite</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It has good thickness, contains fluoride, has a nice scent, cleans your teeth really well.</li>
            <li>And because it&#x27;s a series of strands it more easily captures and removes more junk between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have used these for several years and I consider them to be the best available on the market.  </li>
            <li>The also easily cut in to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>woven floss is gentler on my gums and seems to me and my hygienist to clean better.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is most effective at removing plaque and being gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li>Easy to get between teeth, doesn&#x27;t rip, and gets the job</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Reach Floss to anyone who strives for good oral health</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re dedicated to good oral hygiene, I highly recommend this floss.</li>
            <li>I have tried many dental flosses and after years of searching this is the only one that really does the best cleaning job and doesn&#x27;t hurt or make your gums bleed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sometimes hard to fine, though, so I&#x27;m always happy to be able to purchase it in bulk at a good price.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s impregnated with fluoride is a huge plus because you&#x27;re administering right where most patients need it most: between teeth</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy flossing nowadays because of this</li>
            <li>But that is precisely why any person should pick up this floss.</li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon gave me the opportunity to get it.  </li>
            <li>Coated with fluoride for smooth motions</li>
            <li>This is erratically available in stores.</li>
            <li>Good cleaning action, once you get it between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>so that I avoid it less! :D</li>
            <li>The woven texture feels old school, but you get a much better grip, and in my opinion, a better, more thorough clean out of it.  </li>
            <li>The major thing that I noticed, however, was its superior plaque removal abilities.</li>
            <li>This lasts a long time and slides really great over your teeth.</li>
            <li>My hygenist originally recomended this floss.</li>
            <li>The floss arrived in a timely manner in its original packaging.</li>
            <li>Love this gentle dental floss!  </li>
            <li>This floss is a little thicker than most floss and has a great taste.  </li>
            <li>it &amp;#34;squeeks&amp;#34; when the tooth is clean.</li>
            <li>It hurts my gums and I feel i don&#x27;t clean as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, gets the job done and leave your mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>This woven floss is easy  to use and is more effective than any other floss I have tried.</li>
            <li>This floss does a great job of cleaning, is easy to slip into tight spaces and doesn&#x27;t shred.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly coarse and makes good scrubbing contact with my teeth.</li>
            <li>Sure, it takes more work to use woven floss instead of the smooth satiny tape flosses, but that&#x27;s because it actually cleans in between your teeth!</li>
            <li>And the mint, while not essential,  tastes good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had at least two dental hygienists tell me that this is the best floss for removing plaque.</li>
            <li>Keep a tight tension on it to minimize shredding, use the &#x27;C&#x27; wrap method, both sides of each tooth, and your tongue will do a happy dance -- gum lines, tooth-to-tooth seams, sliding all around, all smooth and slippery.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s woven, meaning many tiny threads, meaning more ways to capture and remove plaques and food particles.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I always got the quick &amp;#34;great, see you in 6 month.&amp;#34; This time, the hygienist accused me of slacking on my flossing.</li>
            <li>I like the feeling of this floss a lot more than the cheap flosses I used to get, and it seems to be helping restore some of the soft spots I was getting in the enamel.</li>
            <li>Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint Floss offers the tooth cleaning feel at a good value.  </li>
            <li>Well worth mail ordering to get the right item for me!</li>
            <li>This floss does a better job of cleaning my teeth than normal floss.  </li>
            <li>We vastly prefer the woven floss over waxed alternatives, it works so much better!  </li>
            <li>done very well !!</li>
            <li>Though I live in a big city with lots of options for drugstores, I can not find this type of floss, so it is great that Amazon has it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not too strong on the mint, which is important for me with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Works great and does not hurt the tight teeth situation.</li>
            <li>It is still available as Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss.  </li>
            <li>Instantly after trying it, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also best for people who are serious about flossing!</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended fluoride dental floss, but it is no longer available in the stores due to acute fluoride toxicity.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this product better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried it all.</li>
            <li>I have tried every floss you can imagine looking for the right one.</li>
            <li>Because most of my molars are tightly packed, it&#x27;s challenging to get floss in there.</li>
            <li>My dental hygenist recommended this type of floss for me because it&#x27;s woven and apparently is more effective than the wax floss that is so common.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on gums</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like having to floss every day, but I do like the result with Reach Woven -- my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Great floss, hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>I used to rarely floss because it was so time consuming and didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>Buying a pack of 6 saves me time and money since these individually go for 4 dollars a piece at most stores.</li>
            <li>I have deep spaces in between my teeth and many crowns.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, J&amp;J will be more vigilant about advising consumers the next time that they decide to change the packaging design.</li>
            <li>I have been using this floss for several years and am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different tyes of dental floss.  </li>
            <li>No tartar buildup and really healthy gums at my last checkup...</li>
            <li>Buy this product first.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite floss and my local stores no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth shred a lot of floss, but really narrow glossy floss doesn&#x27;t do much good.  </li>
            <li>I like how easily I can hold it in my fingers without slipping, and how clean it gets between my teeth.</li>
            <li>You can actually hear your teeth getting &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean!</li>
            <li>J&amp;J Reach Gum Care is soft and gentle but has enough surface texture to effectively loosen and remove dental plague.  </li>
            <li>The individual fibers mold themselves around the tooth and provide a much greater contact surface area, and because it&#x27;s not waxed or extremely smooth (like Glide), you get a sense of \\&quot;feedback\\&quot; that it&#x27;s actually cleaning the tooth.  </li>
            <li>This floss is great for anyone that&#x27;s obsessed with clean teeth.</li>
            <li>I am old enough that my teeth do not fit very closely together, and the woven unwaxed floss does an excellent job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li>No other floss makes my mouth feel as clean.</li>
            <li>I can now stop triple flossing certain spots, this floss does it in one pass.  </li>
            <li>Thick, double weaved floss that tastes good and is easy to glide between teeth.  </li>
            <li>It slides into tight spots easily, but spreads out to clean thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I hope Johnson &amp; Johnson will reconsider this decision, and bring back the original Reach Fresh Mint Woven Floss for Sensitive Gums, which was a far superior product to any other floss on the market.</li>
            <li>I prefer this floss to Glide because it really is gentle on gums.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate that this floss is woven</li>
            <li>The fibers seem to really help grab things and remove food or debris from in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much work.      </li>
            <li>And when I&#x27;m too aggressive around the gum line, this floss is gentle as opposed to the waxed stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just hope it&#x27;s still available on Amazon months from now when I finish the last pack.</li>
            <li>I thought that it had been taken off the market until I received a free sample from my dentist at my last cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I believe my gums are much healthier by using it.</li>
            <li>Much gentler on the gums too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seller was lightning fast.  </li>
            <li>This floss works really well with no snags.</li>
            <li>Really feels like you&#x27;re accomplishing something when you floss, and stretching it out</li>
            <li>It is thicker and really cleans between the teeth.</li>
            <li>My husband needs to use the gentle gum care because of problems with his gums and with his fingers.  </li>
            <li>Johnson and Johnson has discontinued the Reach Fresh Mint Woven Floss for Sensitive Gums and replaced it with this inferior product.  </li>
            <li>At the recommendation of my dental hygienist, I looked for Reach Gentle Gum Care</li>
            <li>I will switch to Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint Floss exclusively.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have really &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; teeth because of enamel loss (caused by whitening products).</li>
            <li>This really gets the gunk out of and off of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It also helps the kids to want to floss more since it doesn&#x27;t cut the gums like other floss.</li>
            <li>Does not get stuck in my teeth any more than other flosses.  </li>
            <li>This one does the job better than other waxed flosses..</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s thicker than normal floss, and it&#x27;s also somewhat soft and gentle on your gums, not cutting in to them.</li>
            <li>Unlike most of the other flosses I have used</li>
            <li>These are impossible to find at retail, but they are the absolute best for flossing.</li>
            <li>I have gums that have receded and this floss is sensitive for those but strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>It gets food out from between my teeth like nothing else, while nonetheless being really gentle and easier to grip than normal, thinner floss.</li>
            <li>I live overseas and could not find it anywhere so ordered it off of Amazon!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the woven floss is more gentle on the gums, less bleeding for people new to flossing.</li>
            <li>I first got to try this floss when I was out of my regular floss (Oral-B &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34;) and scrounging around for something to use.</li>
            <li>I ordered this 6-pack at what I believe is a better price than buying them locally (when in-stock), and now am stocked up for the future!</li>
            <li>It works very well, but quite gentle for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>It does the job it was intended to do, is \\&quot;waxed\\&quot; and soft and is extremely comfortable even through the process necessary after three ears of corn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if I DO get somestuck in a couple of my tight fitting  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this floss based on the high reviews.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.      </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for beginner flossers and those who don&#x27;t floss often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a fine piece of yarn that thins as it stretches</li>
            <li>so it will clean out gaps, but slide right through tight spaces too.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy such a large pack of 6, not knowing exactly what I would be getting.  </li>
            <li>This kind of floss can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and soft and tastes pleasantly minty, and does a fantastic job sweeping up visible and hidden detritus.  </li>
            <li>(the Glide was so slippery that sometimes I was unsure if the flossing action was really removing everything or just gliding over the plaque as well as the gums and teeth).      </li>
            <li>Great floss for a difficult mouth.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have purchased it on the internet and have gotten about a yrs worth at a time.  </li>
            <li>I simply can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot to be said for personal preference, but I&#x27;ve found the flat or &#x27;tape&#x27; style floss snaps or breaks too easily.</li>
            <li>I had been using some of the satin/nylon stuff, which \\&quot;worked\\&quot;, but never really gave me a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This soft floss is gentle on my sensitive gums, and the fluoride helps strengthen those hard-to-reach crevices between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Plus, the woven texture makes it easy on my fingers, which are sensitive to being strangled and turn blue with regular floss.</li>
            <li>I was crushed when this floss free of poison fluoride was discontinued until its forcing me to try others helped me find even better--the original dental floss, P.O.H. (Personal Oral Hygiene), on Amazon too, including fluoride-free &amp; wax-free (dentist advises v. wax build up) &amp; in super thin yet strong #420, medium &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; #490, &amp; thick #630, all streamlined strong woven fibers making flossing faster &amp; easier than ever</li>
            <li>It was very soft on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>This floss is very soft on the gums.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The floss is actually woven together with many individual, blue and white fibers, that can spread out freely, which means that all those fibers have the ability to make individual contact with the tooth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are tightly spaced, and this floss easily slips between them.  </li>
            <li>It has little fibers that really clean between teeth but are gentle on gums.  </li>
            <li>I bought this floss not knowing if it was EXACTLY what I wanted because Johnson and Johnson has recently changed the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I have a small bridge and many capped teeth.</li>
            <li>I have found it at my local Walgreen&#x27;s and Target, but at a much higher price than this 6-pack.</li>
            <li>First, my local Publix stopped carryig it, then Walmart joined in.</li>
            <li>This floss is gentle enough to get in between the tight spaces at the tops of teeth, but thorough enough to clean big spaces and crown margins better than my old floss.  </li>
            <li>It easily shreds and stuck between your teeth in little pieces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will work when I get braces put on, but I&#x27;m a little worried it might get caught on them and fray too easily.  </li>
            <li>And on top of that, they were thin enough they were more likely to just slice into my gums.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a batch will tear easily but other than that I love these over all other types I tried so far - ribbon, single string, picks, etc.</li>
            <li>only issue is that I wish this was available for purchase in stores, but as long as I can keep ordering from Amazon (and use Prime shipping), no issues here.  </li>
            <li>I like this floss because it is many small strands strung together, and it is soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While what I wrote was true, the Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint that I bought previous to this was 4 strands woven together; this is two!</li>
            <li>This is not as comfortable as what I got in the old packaging from previous orders.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in most stores</li>
            <li>Plus, I feel like this floss gets out WAY more plaque from in between teeth (at least twice as much in my opinion) vs. traditional waxed floss or Glide floss.  </li>
            <li>Because this floss is not one solid strand, but a series of numerous individual strands, it can form to fit through the narrowest passages between teeth.  </li>
            <li>It also used to say \\&quot;Gentle Gum Care\\&quot; whereas it now only says \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Next trip to dentist will be the real test.</li>
            <li>I love this floss and for some reason all the stores in my area have stopped carrying it-at least, all the stores I have checked, which is a lot.  </li>
            <li>and I tend to get soft spots in between my teeth.</li>
            <li>My local drug store stopped selling this, so buying 6 packs at a time is the only economical way for me to get it anymore.</li>
            <li>It definitely took a few days to get used to, but I really love it now.  </li>
            <li>Woven floss is superior to any other floss because it actually cleans between your teeth rather than just harsh scraping.</li>
            <li>Nice to know I can save at least some money here at Amazon by ordering 6 at a time, enough to last me for 8 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great floss + decent price &#x3D;</li>
            <li>(my back teeth in particular are like this)</li>
            <li>It gets high up into my gums without feeling like it&#x27;s slicing them open like the tape type of floss does.</li>
            <li>After my dentist gave me a sample of this, I search high and low for it.  </li>
            <li>It is a little tougher to fit between some of my teeth, and indeed, does sometimes leave threads behind or more rarely rip in half, but it never cuts into my gums</li>
            <li>My hygienist turned me on to this, and I&#x27;ll never go back to regular floss, which doesn&#x27;t even do much.</li>
            <li>While this may be acceptable to some, many people with sensitive gums prefer to avoid all unnecessary chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and the edges of the Glide floss were a bit sharp at times and would sometimes irritate my gums in certain spots.  </li>
            <li>No other company makes one like it.</li>
            <li>I love this product but it is very hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>The floss is very soft to the touch and goes down between the teeth gently.</li>
            <li>Simply put, once you try this floss, you&#x27;ll realize how inferior your old floss was, and this is why...</li>
            <li>but my dentist was clued in enough to direct me to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s just expensive, but what kind of life does one have without teeth?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble finding the right floss.  </li>
            <li>I find that it shreds less than other flosses that I have used with the possible exception of Glide, which is nothing more than a strip of plastic and as such,</li>
            <li>This floss doesn&#x27;t cut into his fingers like other flosses do and it is much easier on his mouth.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see I could purchase it online as it&#x27;s difficult to find it around where I live in the drug store chains and often not enough of it hanging on display as I like to buy in quantity so as not to be bothered shopping for it--plus</li>
            <li>This floss has definitely made it easier to keep up a daily flossing routine (since I know that my gums won&#x27;t ache and feel overly sensitive afterward).  </li>
            <li>I tend to wrap the floss around my fingers tightly, basically wrap the entire length around my left and right index fingers and use the gap in between to floss my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I had been a Glide user, but it often felt a little too easy or it would just break because a contact was too tight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores anymore, so I was delighted to find it here.</li>

            <li> Great product...</li>
            <li> /&gt;We were happy to see it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It also has a great taste.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great.  </li>

            <li> I really liked the Reach Cleanpaste the best of all</li>
            <li> Great product and happy to find again.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist and very effective</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like very fine sand paper which is awesome because it gets rid of everything you are using if for (aka plaque).  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been successful at containing my gum disease for 23 years now.  </li>
            <li> What I like best is that it is not waxed, does not break easy and</li>
            <li> This is easily the best floss on the market, if you can find it.</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago I had a dentist recommend this floss, because the woven unwaxed floss provides a good texture for scrubbing between teeth.</li>
            <li> Each night when I start flossing with this non-waxed floss, I think that it&#x27;s so good that I need to write a review on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is sooo good.  </li>
            <li> Good quality floss for your teeth when you need it.</li>
            <li> Flavor is good.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss.  </li>
            <li> I loved the fluoride floss</li>
            <li> Still, availability is what makes it a good buy.</li>
            <li> so I was very glad I could get it online.</li>
            <li> Sure if you have gaps in your teeth where floss can go great, however.</li>
            <li> Great floss for use twice or more per day without any harm to gums.  </li>
            <li> Love woven floss!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> The price is perfect on Amazon and fast shipping is nice.</li>
            <li> Keep some Dentotape handy to remove the torn floss.</li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> What makes this product awesome is you get 6 packs which should last you a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> This soft woven rope floss is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is my far the best.  </li>
            <li> The string floss is very easy to handle and feels better on my gums.</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Woven floss is more stretchy so isn&#x27;t as painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I feel the woven can better trap the detritus stuck between teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased more since then.  </li>
            <li> I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush, which I am quite pleased with.  </li>
            <li> The wax floss works much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am picky about my floss :) .  </li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for many years.</li>
            <li> I have receded gums and was concerned about not incurring any more recession.  </li>
            <li> The difference is this floss has &#x27;gripping ability&#x27; vs. floss that is smooth/slippery.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> for some reason most markets don&#x27;t carry it though it works better than waxed or tape flosses.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss ever.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut my gums and I think it cleans better.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I feel that it does a better job than waxed floss.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is woven as I find it helps in removing any plaque plus being mint flavored is a plus.</li>
            <li> I cannot find Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss on Amazon any more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years.</li>
            <li> This is the woven floss and my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Since it is my favorite</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> It has good thickness, contains fluoride, has a nice scent, cleans your teeth really well.</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s a series of strands it more easily captures and removes more junk between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have used these for several years and I consider them to be the best available on the market.  </li>
            <li> The also easily cut in to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> woven floss is gentler on my gums and seems to me and my hygienist to clean better.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is most effective at removing plaque and being gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li> Easy to get between teeth, doesn&#x27;t rip, and gets the job</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Reach Floss to anyone who strives for good oral health</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re dedicated to good oral hygiene, I highly recommend this floss.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dental flosses and after years of searching this is the only one that really does the best cleaning job and doesn&#x27;t hurt or make your gums bleed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard to fine, though, so I&#x27;m always happy to be able to purchase it in bulk at a good price.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s impregnated with fluoride is a huge plus because you&#x27;re administering right where most patients need it most: between teeth</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy flossing nowadays because of this</li>
            <li> But that is precisely why any person should pick up this floss.</li>
            <li> Fortunately Amazon gave me the opportunity to get it.  </li>
            <li> Coated with fluoride for smooth motions</li>
            <li> This is erratically available in stores.</li>
            <li> Good cleaning action, once you get it between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> so that I avoid it less! :D</li>
            <li> The woven texture feels old school, but you get a much better grip, and in my opinion, a better, more thorough clean out of it.  </li>
            <li> The major thing that I noticed, however, was its superior plaque removal abilities.</li>
            <li> This lasts a long time and slides really great over your teeth.</li>
            <li> My hygenist originally recomended this floss.</li>
            <li> The floss arrived in a timely manner in its original packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this gentle dental floss!  </li>
            <li> This floss is a little thicker than most floss and has a great taste.  </li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;squeeks&amp;#34; when the tooth is clean.</li>
            <li> It hurts my gums and I feel i don&#x27;t clean as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, gets the job done and leave your mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> This woven floss is easy  to use and is more effective than any other floss I have tried.</li>
            <li> This floss does a great job of cleaning, is easy to slip into tight spaces and doesn&#x27;t shred.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly coarse and makes good scrubbing contact with my teeth.</li>
            <li> Sure, it takes more work to use woven floss instead of the smooth satiny tape flosses, but that&#x27;s because it actually cleans in between your teeth!</li>
            <li> And the mint, while not essential,  tastes good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least two dental hygienists tell me that this is the best floss for removing plaque.</li>
            <li> Keep a tight tension on it to minimize shredding, use the &#x27;C&#x27; wrap method, both sides of each tooth, and your tongue will do a happy dance -- gum lines, tooth-to-tooth seams, sliding all around, all smooth and slippery.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s woven, meaning many tiny threads, meaning more ways to capture and remove plaques and food particles.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I always got the quick &amp;#34;great, see you in 6 month.&amp;#34; This time, the hygienist accused me of slacking on my flossing.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of this floss a lot more than the cheap flosses I used to get, and it seems to be helping restore some of the soft spots I was getting in the enamel.</li>
            <li> Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint Floss offers the tooth cleaning feel at a good value.  </li>
            <li> Well worth mail ordering to get the right item for me!</li>
            <li> This floss does a better job of cleaning my teeth than normal floss.  </li>
            <li> We vastly prefer the woven floss over waxed alternatives, it works so much better!  </li>
            <li> done very well !!</li>
            <li> Though I live in a big city with lots of options for drugstores, I can not find this type of floss, so it is great that Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not too strong on the mint, which is important for me with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Works great and does not hurt the tight teeth situation.</li>
            <li> It is still available as Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss.  </li>
            <li> Instantly after trying it, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also best for people who are serious about flossing!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended fluoride dental floss, but it is no longer available in the stores due to acute fluoride toxicity.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this product better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried it all.</li>
            <li> I have tried every floss you can imagine looking for the right one.</li>
            <li> Because most of my molars are tightly packed, it&#x27;s challenging to get floss in there.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended this type of floss for me because it&#x27;s woven and apparently is more effective than the wax floss that is so common.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on gums</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like having to floss every day, but I do like the result with Reach Woven -- my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Great floss, hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li> I used to rarely floss because it was so time consuming and didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> Buying a pack of 6 saves me time and money since these individually go for 4 dollars a piece at most stores.</li>
            <li> I have deep spaces in between my teeth and many crowns.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, J&amp;J will be more vigilant about advising consumers the next time that they decide to change the packaging design.</li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for several years and am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different tyes of dental floss.  </li>
            <li> No tartar buildup and really healthy gums at my last checkup...</li>
            <li> Buy this product first.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss and my local stores no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth shred a lot of floss, but really narrow glossy floss doesn&#x27;t do much good.  </li>
            <li> I like how easily I can hold it in my fingers without slipping, and how clean it gets between my teeth.</li>
            <li> You can actually hear your teeth getting &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean!</li>
            <li> J&amp;J Reach Gum Care is soft and gentle but has enough surface texture to effectively loosen and remove dental plague.  </li>
            <li> The individual fibers mold themselves around the tooth and provide a much greater contact surface area, and because it&#x27;s not waxed or extremely smooth (like Glide), you get a sense of \\&quot;feedback\\&quot; that it&#x27;s actually cleaning the tooth.  </li>
            <li> This floss is great for anyone that&#x27;s obsessed with clean teeth.</li>
            <li> I am old enough that my teeth do not fit very closely together, and the woven unwaxed floss does an excellent job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li> No other floss makes my mouth feel as clean.</li>
            <li> I can now stop triple flossing certain spots, this floss does it in one pass.  </li>
            <li> Thick, double weaved floss that tastes good and is easy to glide between teeth.  </li>
            <li> It slides into tight spots easily, but spreads out to clean thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I hope Johnson &amp; Johnson will reconsider this decision, and bring back the original Reach Fresh Mint Woven Floss for Sensitive Gums, which was a far superior product to any other floss on the market.</li>
            <li> I prefer this floss to Glide because it really is gentle on gums.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate that this floss is woven</li>
            <li> The fibers seem to really help grab things and remove food or debris from in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much work.      </li>
            <li> And when I&#x27;m too aggressive around the gum line, this floss is gentle as opposed to the waxed stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just hope it&#x27;s still available on Amazon months from now when I finish the last pack.</li>
            <li> I thought that it had been taken off the market until I received a free sample from my dentist at my last cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I believe my gums are much healthier by using it.</li>
            <li> Much gentler on the gums too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seller was lightning fast.  </li>
            <li> This floss works really well with no snags.</li>
            <li> Really feels like you&#x27;re accomplishing something when you floss, and stretching it out</li>
            <li> It is thicker and really cleans between the teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband needs to use the gentle gum care because of problems with his gums and with his fingers.  </li>
            <li> Johnson and Johnson has discontinued the Reach Fresh Mint Woven Floss for Sensitive Gums and replaced it with this inferior product.  </li>
            <li> At the recommendation of my dental hygienist, I looked for Reach Gentle Gum Care</li>
            <li> I will switch to Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint Floss exclusively.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have really &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; teeth because of enamel loss (caused by whitening products).</li>
            <li> This really gets the gunk out of and off of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It also helps the kids to want to floss more since it doesn&#x27;t cut the gums like other floss.</li>
            <li> Does not get stuck in my teeth any more than other flosses.  </li>
            <li> This one does the job better than other waxed flosses..</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thicker than normal floss, and it&#x27;s also somewhat soft and gentle on your gums, not cutting in to them.</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the other flosses I have used</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find at retail, but they are the absolute best for flossing.</li>
            <li> I have gums that have receded and this floss is sensitive for those but strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> It gets food out from between my teeth like nothing else, while nonetheless being really gentle and easier to grip than normal, thinner floss.</li>
            <li> I live overseas and could not find it anywhere so ordered it off of Amazon!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the woven floss is more gentle on the gums, less bleeding for people new to flossing.</li>
            <li> I first got to try this floss when I was out of my regular floss (Oral-B &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34;) and scrounging around for something to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 6-pack at what I believe is a better price than buying them locally (when in-stock), and now am stocked up for the future!</li>
            <li> It works very well, but quite gentle for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> It does the job it was intended to do, is \\&quot;waxed\\&quot; and soft and is extremely comfortable even through the process necessary after three ears of corn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if I DO get somestuck in a couple of my tight fitting  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this floss based on the high reviews.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.      </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for beginner flossers and those who don&#x27;t floss often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a fine piece of yarn that thins as it stretches</li>
            <li> so it will clean out gaps, but slide right through tight spaces too.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy such a large pack of 6, not knowing exactly what I would be getting.  </li>
            <li> This kind of floss can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and soft and tastes pleasantly minty, and does a fantastic job sweeping up visible and hidden detritus.  </li>
            <li> (the Glide was so slippery that sometimes I was unsure if the flossing action was really removing everything or just gliding over the plaque as well as the gums and teeth).      </li>
            <li> Great floss for a difficult mouth.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased it on the internet and have gotten about a yrs worth at a time.  </li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot to be said for personal preference, but I&#x27;ve found the flat or &#x27;tape&#x27; style floss snaps or breaks too easily.</li>
            <li> I had been using some of the satin/nylon stuff, which \\&quot;worked\\&quot;, but never really gave me a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This soft floss is gentle on my sensitive gums, and the fluoride helps strengthen those hard-to-reach crevices between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Plus, the woven texture makes it easy on my fingers, which are sensitive to being strangled and turn blue with regular floss.</li>
            <li> I was crushed when this floss free of poison fluoride was discontinued until its forcing me to try others helped me find even better--the original dental floss, P.O.H. (Personal Oral Hygiene), on Amazon too, including fluoride-free &amp; wax-free (dentist advises v. wax build up) &amp; in super thin yet strong #420, medium &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; #490, &amp; thick #630, all streamlined strong woven fibers making flossing faster &amp; easier than ever</li>
            <li> It was very soft on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This floss is very soft on the gums.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The floss is actually woven together with many individual, blue and white fibers, that can spread out freely, which means that all those fibers have the ability to make individual contact with the tooth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are tightly spaced, and this floss easily slips between them.  </li>
            <li> It has little fibers that really clean between teeth but are gentle on gums.  </li>
            <li> I bought this floss not knowing if it was EXACTLY what I wanted because Johnson and Johnson has recently changed the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I have a small bridge and many capped teeth.</li>
            <li> I have found it at my local Walgreen&#x27;s and Target, but at a much higher price than this 6-pack.</li>
            <li> First, my local Publix stopped carryig it, then Walmart joined in.</li>
            <li> This floss is gentle enough to get in between the tight spaces at the tops of teeth, but thorough enough to clean big spaces and crown margins better than my old floss.  </li>
            <li> It easily shreds and stuck between your teeth in little pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will work when I get braces put on, but I&#x27;m a little worried it might get caught on them and fray too easily.  </li>
            <li> And on top of that, they were thin enough they were more likely to just slice into my gums.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a batch will tear easily but other than that I love these over all other types I tried so far - ribbon, single string, picks, etc.</li>
            <li> only issue is that I wish this was available for purchase in stores, but as long as I can keep ordering from Amazon (and use Prime shipping), no issues here.  </li>
            <li> I like this floss because it is many small strands strung together, and it is soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While what I wrote was true, the Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint that I bought previous to this was 4 strands woven together; this is two!</li>
            <li> This is not as comfortable as what I got in the old packaging from previous orders.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in most stores</li>
            <li> Plus, I feel like this floss gets out WAY more plaque from in between teeth (at least twice as much in my opinion) vs. traditional waxed floss or Glide floss.  </li>
            <li> Because this floss is not one solid strand, but a series of numerous individual strands, it can form to fit through the narrowest passages between teeth.  </li>
            <li> It also used to say \\&quot;Gentle Gum Care\\&quot; whereas it now only says \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Next trip to dentist will be the real test.</li>
            <li> I love this floss and for some reason all the stores in my area have stopped carrying it-at least, all the stores I have checked, which is a lot.  </li>
            <li> and I tend to get soft spots in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> My local drug store stopped selling this, so buying 6 packs at a time is the only economical way for me to get it anymore.</li>
            <li> It definitely took a few days to get used to, but I really love it now.  </li>
            <li> Woven floss is superior to any other floss because it actually cleans between your teeth rather than just harsh scraping.</li>
            <li> Nice to know I can save at least some money here at Amazon by ordering 6 at a time, enough to last me for 8 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great floss + decent price &#x3D;</li>
            <li> (my back teeth in particular are like this)</li>
            <li> It gets high up into my gums without feeling like it&#x27;s slicing them open like the tape type of floss does.</li>
            <li> After my dentist gave me a sample of this, I search high and low for it.  </li>
            <li> It is a little tougher to fit between some of my teeth, and indeed, does sometimes leave threads behind or more rarely rip in half, but it never cuts into my gums</li>
            <li> My hygienist turned me on to this, and I&#x27;ll never go back to regular floss, which doesn&#x27;t even do much.</li>
            <li> While this may be acceptable to some, many people with sensitive gums prefer to avoid all unnecessary chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and the edges of the Glide floss were a bit sharp at times and would sometimes irritate my gums in certain spots.  </li>
            <li> No other company makes one like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it is very hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> The floss is very soft to the touch and goes down between the teeth gently.</li>
            <li> Simply put, once you try this floss, you&#x27;ll realize how inferior your old floss was, and this is why...</li>
            <li> but my dentist was clued in enough to direct me to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s just expensive, but what kind of life does one have without teeth?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble finding the right floss.  </li>
            <li> I find that it shreds less than other flosses that I have used with the possible exception of Glide, which is nothing more than a strip of plastic and as such,</li>
            <li> This floss doesn&#x27;t cut into his fingers like other flosses do and it is much easier on his mouth.  </li>
            <li> Glad to see I could purchase it online as it&#x27;s difficult to find it around where I live in the drug store chains and often not enough of it hanging on display as I like to buy in quantity so as not to be bothered shopping for it--plus</li>
            <li> This floss has definitely made it easier to keep up a daily flossing routine (since I know that my gums won&#x27;t ache and feel overly sensitive afterward).  </li>
            <li> I tend to wrap the floss around my fingers tightly, basically wrap the entire length around my left and right index fingers and use the gap in between to floss my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had been a Glide user, but it often felt a little too easy or it would just break because a contact was too tight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores anymore, so I was delighted to find it here.</li>
            <li> I had an older container of woven floss by Reach with green font on the container.</li>
            <li> Both slide slickly over my teeth, without the feeling that they are really cleaning the surfaces.</li>
            <li> but I have to tear of new pieces every few teeth because of shredding.</li>
            <li> Once I am out of my present floss (I alternate using Reach and the other floss now)</li>
            <li> : The old product was in a white box with the Johnson &amp; Johnson logo in pink and all the other words in black, except for the words, \\&quot;with Fluoride\\&quot;, which were in blue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as I can.  </li>
            <li> I have used this floss for a long time and like for</li>
            <li> Feb. 2015: I just opened a new Reach Floss from this shipment, and I now know how they get 50 yards in a small case.</li>
            <li> But I definitely prefer woven floss over the other types.</li>
            <li> It is really gentle but a little thicker then plain floss.</li>
            <li> I could not live without it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I stopped being able to find this stuff in retailer outlets, which made me very sad.</li>
            <li> My dental cleanings are a breeze since using this floss with little to none plaque or tartar present.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this floss and I was having trouble finding it locally.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I tried the tape stuff and find it too flimsy to do anything, and the regular floss is a bit to harsh for my gums.</li>
            <li> Each pack of floss comes in closed packages (as pictured).</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with this: it can hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> Additionally, for reasons that are beyond me, this type of floss is getting harder and harder to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> However, other types of dental floss only become terrible once you know how good dental floss can be, so give this floss a shot, I doubt you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the last year I&#x27;ve been using a plain wax floss (also J&amp;J I think)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had a small sample of this floss that he received from his last trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> The other floss I use is Glide.  </li>
            <li> And probably throw out the Reach floss (or use it for some other purpose).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s no longer in any of my usual local stores.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the shiny, sharp flosses, nor the waxed ones.</li>
            <li> Even though I thought it was really expensive, and because I thought this was fluoride floss, I was willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li> I doubt any other floss removes even a 1/4 of what this floss can, and all the while doing it very gently, at no cost to the gums.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it will tear and lodge between teeth which are very close to each other.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe the folks who reviewed it actually used the floss.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the approx.</li>
            <li> They reduced the thickness by a third (at least).</li>
            <li> If you floss your teeth with any other floss then use this one you will think you didn&#x27;t floss to begin with!</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful if your teeth are very tight together</li>
            <li> Once you have used it, you will be assured that your previous floss was quite inferior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a daily flosser and find it difficult to get through my entire regimen without the floss breaking up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly flavored with mint, which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s less chance of bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> The floss is thinner than the previous woven floss, and it is now laced with fluoride.  </li>
            <li> that makes less friction.</li>
            <li> It is about half price on the internet from what you would pay in the store.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends this floss, but often the stores in our little town are sold out.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed, when we could not get this product anywhere, because we really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Then, a few years ago I got a sample of this from my dentist.</li>
            <li> The texture helps capture trapped food particles.</li>
            <li> I am having trouble finding this in brick-&amp;-mortar stores</li>
            <li> I have a few places between my teeth that always collect small bits of food.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s thick or thin depending on the distance between the teeth, which is the key to its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> b/c it can be difficult to pull the floss back out.  </li>
            <li> I spent one night having to pick out broken pieces of flow out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> For those that have used this floss in the past, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>
            <li> This product is no better than $1 Kroger floss.</li>
            <li> Was unable to find locally so purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wax floss just slides past food particles.</li>
            <li> &quot; reduced dramatically in just the past six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find woven floss?</li>
            <li> Pulling through wets the floss, making it slippery and hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> Work hard</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find, so once, I gave up and used something else.</li>
            <li> amazes me that this floss is hard to find or none existent in stores.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why the J&amp;J sales rep leaves samples of stuff that&#x27;s hard to find</li>
            <li> But hard to find.</li>
            <li> , I cannot say why this floss is so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to find in the stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> I try to buy these at 12 packages at a time as I fear they may be discontinued, This is not a fact just a concern since they are so hard to find.</li>
            <li> It has been hard to find.  </li>
            <li> At least for me, after trying SO MANY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, so you don&#x27;t put pressure on just one area and damage that part of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it wasn&#x27;t going to be too thick.  </li>
            <li> I am slowly ordering the 6 pack</li>
            <li> All the other kinds are too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Not all people can use the woven as it is thicker and if you have tight spaces it could be difficult.</li>
            <li> This floss can be very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> And very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> but it is tough to find these without fluoride.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> It turns out that the manufacturer made the idiot decision to simply change the packaging.  </li>
            <li> and I was not happy with the product at all.</li>
            <li> My wife and friends are sick of hearing me talk about it, and think I&#x27;m a little weird.  </li>
            <li> is virtually useless in trying to dislodge plague.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that it&#x27;s so hard to get!</li>
            <li> This was an unpleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it to be impossible to get between my teeth without it shredding - and leaving floss bits stuck between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> However, it is getting nearly impossible to find it in grocery stores and pharmacies.</li>
            <li> If you floss twice a day with this floss you will never have bad breath.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fearful that it will no longer be made.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t scrub as well, but once the nasty stuff is loosened, I think brushing finishes the job.  </li>
            <li> Horrible</li>
            <li> When I ran out of this dental floss and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, I used \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; and even some waxed products; they were terrible!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I agree with everyone that it is the best.  It is still available as Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss.  Don&#x27;t pay these inflated prices for the same thing.</li>
            <li> Because most of my molars are tightly packed, it&#x27;s challenging to get floss in there. I had been using some of the satin/nylon stuff, which \\&quot;worked\\&quot;, but never really gave me a clean feeling. And on top of that, they were thin enough they were more likely to just slice into my gums. Then, a few years ago I got a sample of this from my dentist. I instantly fell in love. It&#x27;s fairly coarse and makes good scrubbing contact with my teeth. It is a little tougher to fit between some of my teeth, and indeed, does sometimes leave threads behind or more rarely rip in half, but it never cuts into my gums and I just haven&#x27;t before used a floss that cleans so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I stopped being able to find this stuff in retailer outlets, which made me very sad. For the last year I&#x27;ve been using a plain wax floss (also J&amp;J I think) but I just don&#x27;t think it cleans as well as this. So imagine my excitement to find this multi-year supply here on amazon. Yay!</li>
            <li> Anyone has its preferred floss. I know people that hates this. I simply can&#x27;t live without. I have tried every floss you can imagine looking for the right one. I would marry this floss. It&#x27;s simply the best. I actually enjoy flossing nowadays because of this item.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my teeth the sensation that I brushed between them. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I first got to try this floss when I was out of my regular floss (Oral-B &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34;) and scrounging around for something to use. My boyfriend had a small sample of this floss that he received from his last trip to the dentist. Instantly after trying it, I really liked it. It was very soft on my teeth and gums. The major thing that I noticed, however, was its superior plaque removal abilities. Things I had never seen before were being scraped off my teeth with this floss. Gross? Yes. But that is precisely why any person should pick up this floss. Once you have used it, you will be assured that your previous floss was quite inferior. I doubt any other floss removes even a 1/4 of what this floss can, and all the while doing it very gently, at no cost to the gums. It&#x27;s too bad that it&#x27;s so hard to get! Could not find it in any of my local retailers, nor on any Canadian online retailers...</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t compare to waxed or plasticky floss.  This is like having a toothbrush that goes in between the teeth.  The price is perfect on Amazon and fast shipping is nice. Why is it so hard to find woven floss? Guess it&#x27;s just expensive, but what kind of life does one have without teeth?  Love this product.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends this floss, but often the stores in our little town are sold out. I ordered this 6-pack at what I believe is a better price than buying them locally (when in-stock), and now am stocked up for the future! This soft floss is gentle on my sensitive gums, and the fluoride helps strengthen those hard-to-reach crevices between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I tend to wrap the floss around my fingers tightly, basically wrap the entire length around my left and right index fingers and use the gap in between to floss my teeth.  With waxed floss, it can cut off the circulation at the last knuckle.  Woven floss is more stretchy so isn&#x27;t as painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I feel the woven can better trap the detritus stuck between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the woven floss is more gentle on the gums, less bleeding for people new to flossing.</li>
            <li> I prefer this floss to Glide because it really is gentle on gums.  I have sensitive gums and the edges of the Glide floss were a bit sharp at times and would sometimes irritate my gums in certain spots.  I really appreciate that this floss is woven and I can feel it on my gums as I floss (the Glide was so slippery that sometimes I was unsure if the flossing action was really removing everything or just gliding over the plaque as well as the gums and teeth).      Plus, I feel like this floss gets out WAY more plaque from in between teeth (at least twice as much in my opinion) vs. traditional waxed floss or Glide floss.  The fibers seem to really help grab things and remove food or debris from in between teeth.  I love it.  This floss has definitely made it easier to keep up a daily flossing routine (since I know that my gums won&#x27;t ache and feel overly sensitive afterward).  You do have to be careful if your teeth are very tight together (my back teeth in particular are like this) b/c it can be difficult to pull the floss back out.  But it&#x27;s not so troublesome that it deters me from wanting to floss.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this floss and I was having trouble finding it locally.  Fortunately Amazon gave me the opportunity to get it.  This woven floss is easy  to use and is more effective than any other floss I have tried.</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago I had a dentist recommend this floss, because the woven unwaxed floss provides a good texture for scrubbing between teeth. Think of flossing as brushing the sides of your teeth. The fluoride is an added bonus, as I&#x27;ve had problems with cavities between teeth before. My local drug store stopped selling this, so buying 6 packs at a time is the only economical way for me to get it anymore. 6 50-yard packs of floss will last me a loooong time.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a dentist six months ago with a sample.  I purchased more since then.  Here&#x27;s what I think:    Time consuming!  Good cleaning action, once you get it between your teeth.  Pulling out is another battle.  Pulling through wets the floss, making it slippery and hard to hold.  I only use this floss once a day.  It&#x27;s just too much work.      The other floss I use is Glide.  It doesn&#x27;t scrub as well, but once the nasty stuff is loosened, I think brushing finishes the job.  I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush, which I am quite pleased with.  I have been successful at containing my gum disease for 23 years now.  Work hard and you can do it too!</li>
            <li> I bought this floss based on the high reviews. Hard to believe the folks who reviewed it actually used the floss. I found it to be impossible to get between my teeth without it shredding - and leaving floss bits stuck between my teeth.  I was using Glide and will go back to using that. And probably throw out the Reach floss (or use it for some other purpose).</li>
            <li> I like this floss because it is many small strands strung together, and it is soft. Don&#x27;t like the fluoride coating but it is tough to find these without fluoride. Sometimes a batch will tear easily but other than that I love these over all other types I tried so far - ribbon, single string, picks, etc.</li>
            <li> Though it does not say so in the product description, this floss is made from wool. I&#x27;m a daily flosser and find it difficult to get through my entire regimen without the floss breaking up. The wax floss works much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dental flosses and after years of searching this is the only one that really does the best cleaning job and doesn&#x27;t hurt or make your gums bleed.</li>
            <li> Thick, double weaved floss that tastes good and is easy to glide between teeth.  The texture helps capture trapped food particles.</li>
            <li> I used to rarely floss because it was so time consuming and didn&#x27;t seem to do much. My dentist recommended woven floss and now I&#x27;m addicted. Sure, it takes more work to use woven floss instead of the smooth satiny tape flosses, but that&#x27;s because it actually cleans in between your teeth! The woven texture grabs everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore. I&#x27;ve bought about 6 different types of floss and nothing comes close to the results I get with woven. I&#x27;m ordering in bulk.</li>
            <li> This floss satisfies my mouth.  Keep a tight tension on it to minimize shredding, use the &#x27;C&#x27; wrap method, both sides of each tooth, and your tongue will do a happy dance -- gum lines, tooth-to-tooth seams, sliding all around, all smooth and slippery.  Yum.  I don&#x27;t particularly like having to floss every day, but I do like the result with Reach Woven -- my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> The dentist office always give me dental tape, no matter where I go. BUT, this is THE floss to use. At least for me, after trying SO MANY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s thick, so you don&#x27;t put pressure on just one area and damage that part of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s woven, meaning many tiny threads, meaning more ways to capture and remove plaques and food particles.&lt;br /&gt;3. Coated with fluoride for smooth motions&lt;br /&gt;4. Coated with fluoride for extra fluoride protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find, so once, I gave up and used something else. I always got the quick &amp;#34;great, see you in 6 month.&amp;#34; This time, the hygienist accused me of slacking on my flossing. I wasn&#x27;t. Just different floss.</li>
            <li> I initially received this product as a sample from my dentist and like it.  I could not find it in the area stores so I was very glad I could get it online. I especially like the double string and minty taste that remains after flossing.</li>
            <li> Each night when I start flossing with this non-waxed floss, I think that it&#x27;s so good that I need to write a review on Amazon.  This stuff is sooo good.  I was hesitant to buy such a large pack of 6, not knowing exactly what I would be getting.  I was hoping it wasn&#x27;t going to be too thick.  Because this floss is not one solid strand, but a series of numerous individual strands, it can form to fit through the narrowest passages between teeth.  So it&#x27;s thick or thin depending on the distance between the teeth, which is the key to its effectiveness.  And because it&#x27;s a series of strands it more easily captures and removes more junk between the teeth.  It&#x27;s slightly flavored with mint, which is a bonus.  And when I&#x27;m too aggressive around the gum line, this floss is gentle as opposed to the waxed stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It amazes me that this floss is hard to find or none existent in stores.  I just hope it&#x27;s still available on Amazon months from now when I finish the last pack.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I will use. (I buy them constantly or in bulk so to keep a constant supply.) It&#x27;s very gentle on gums so there&#x27;s less chance of bleeding gums. After turning 30 I&#x27;ve found I have to floss daily or risk gingivitis. It also helps the kids to want to floss more since it doesn&#x27;t cut the gums like other floss. It&#x27;s the only floss I use for my family.</li>
            <li> I am picky about my floss :) .  I have been using this floss for many years. What I like best is that it is not waxed, does not break easy and it &amp;#34;squeeks&amp;#34; when the tooth is clean. I am slowly ordering the 6 pack just so I can have a lot on hand in case they stop making it.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended this type of floss for me because it&#x27;s woven and apparently is more effective than the wax floss that is so common.  Buying a pack of 6 saves me time and money since these individually go for 4 dollars a piece at most stores.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me samples of this because even daily flossing was not doing enough.  I have deep spaces in between my teeth and many crowns.  This floss is gentle enough to get in between the tight spaces at the tops of teeth, but thorough enough to clean big spaces and crown margins better than my old floss.  I can now stop triple flossing certain spots, this floss does it in one pass.  It&#x27;s also not too strong on the mint, which is important for me with sensitive teeth.  I would recommend it highly.      [....]</li>
            <li> I could not get this at my local drug store. Went to 4 of them but AMazon carried it and a lot cheaper too</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this floss for months.  I thought that it had been taken off the market until I received a free sample from my dentist at my last cleaning.  It turns out that the manufacturer made the idiot decision to simply change the packaging.  This is the only floss that I&#x27;ll use...ever.  My teeth are tightly spaced, and this floss easily slips between them.  I find that it shreds less than other flosses that I have used with the possible exception of Glide, which is nothing more than a strip of plastic and as such, is virtually useless in trying to dislodge plague.  J&amp;J Reach Gum Care is soft and gentle but has enough surface texture to effectively loosen and remove dental plague.  I&#x27;ve been flossing on a regular basis for 40 years, often several times a day.  I hope that I never again have to try a different brand or style of floss.  Hopefully, J&amp;J will be more vigilant about advising consumers the next time that they decide to change the packaging design.</li>
            <li> I spent one night having to pick out broken pieces of flow out of my mouth.  Sure if you have gaps in your teeth where floss can go great, however. If you have teeth close together beware of getting floss stuck  in between your teeth.  Horrible</li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for several years and am completely satisfied.  I have receded gums and was concerned about not incurring any more recession.  This floss is very soft on the gums.  I believe my gums are much healthier by using it.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s no longer in any of my usual local stores.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as I can.  It gets food out from between my teeth like nothing else, while nonetheless being really gentle and easier to grip than normal, thinner floss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the shiny, sharp flosses, nor the waxed ones. Both slide slickly over my teeth, without the feeling that they are really cleaning the surfaces. The also easily cut in to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This woven floss is gentler on my gums and seems to me and my hygienist to clean better. These six packs save a lot of money, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this floss not knowing if it was EXACTLY what I wanted because Johnson and Johnson has recently changed the packaging.  It turns out that this IS the dental floss that I&#x27;ve been looking for and no matter where I&#x27;ve lived in the U.S., I almost never see it in the store (so I always buy it in bulk).  For those that have used this floss in the past, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.  Simply put, once you try this floss, you&#x27;ll realize how inferior your old floss was, and this is why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss is actually woven together with many individual, blue and white fibers, that can spread out freely, which means that all those fibers have the ability to make individual contact with the tooth.  The individual fibers mold themselves around the tooth and provide a much greater contact surface area, and because it&#x27;s not waxed or extremely smooth (like Glide), you get a sense of \\&quot;feedback\\&quot; that it&#x27;s actually cleaning the tooth.  When I ran out of this dental floss and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, I used \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; and even some waxed products; they were terrible!  However, other types of dental floss only become terrible once you know how good dental floss can be, so give this floss a shot, I doubt you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson, please don&#x27;t stop ever making this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: The old product was in a white box with the Johnson &amp; Johnson logo in pink and all the other words in black, except for the words, \\&quot;with Fluoride\\&quot;, which were in blue.  It also used to say \\&quot;Gentle Gum Care\\&quot; whereas it now only says \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this Reach Dental Floss. Since we couldn&#x27;t find it in our local drug stores or food stores I always order it on line via Amazon.com.  I can count on the products I order arriving promptly and in excellent condition.  I highly recommend this Reach Floss to anyone who strives for good oral health</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different tyes of dental floss.  This woven floss does the best job of any, in my opinion.  I like the mint flavor too.  Great product...</li>
            <li> This floss does a great job of cleaning, is easy to slip into tight spaces and doesn&#x27;t shred.  It&#x27;s the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> We vastly prefer the woven floss over waxed alternatives, it works so much better!  It&#x27;s sometimes hard to fine, though, so I&#x27;m always happy to be able to purchase it in bulk at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss my wife will use.&lt;br /&gt;We were happy to see it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Good price considering we cannot find it in our local stores.</li>
            <li> I believe this floss helped turn-around some gingivitis - my dentist is now recommending it to all his patients as well.  The difference is this floss has &#x27;gripping ability&#x27; vs. floss that is smooth/slippery.  The key is to remove all food particles, not just large-ish ones.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gradually picked up my flossing over the years.  I had been a Glide user, but it often felt a little too easy or it would just break because a contact was too tight.  Anyway, I got a recommendation for Reach and decided to try it.  It definitely took a few days to get used to, but I really love it now.  The woven texture feels old school, but you get a much better grip, and in my opinion, a better, more thorough clean out of it.  Much gentler on the gums too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was lightning fast.  Give it a whirl if you&#x27;re looking for a solid floss.</li>
            <li> This product is no better than $1 Kroger floss. It easily shreds and stuck between your teeth in little pieces. I use Glide floss to floss them out when this happens. A total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s thick and soft and tastes pleasantly minty, and does a fantastic job sweeping up visible and hidden detritus.  My wife and friends are sick of hearing me talk about it, and think I&#x27;m a little weird.  Oh well, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that I wish this was available for purchase in stores, but as long as I can keep ordering from Amazon (and use Prime shipping), no issues here.  I&#x27;m hoping it will work when I get braces put on, but I&#x27;m a little worried it might get caught on them and fray too easily.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The floss is very soft to the touch and goes down between the teeth gently. It also has a great taste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why the J&amp;J sales rep leaves samples of stuff that&#x27;s hard to find but my dentist was clued in enough to direct me to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommend this floss.  I recommend this floss.  What further motivation do you need?</li>
            <li> Saved a bundle buying online...for some reason most markets don&#x27;t carry it though it works better than waxed or tape flosses.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss ever. It has good thickness, contains fluoride, has a nice scent, cleans your teeth really well.</li>
            <li> No tartar buildup and really healthy gums at my last checkup... I&#x27;ve been doing everything the same EXCEPT I switched to this brand of floss in the last year. What a difference!! You can actually hear your teeth getting &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean!</li>
            <li> I had an older container of woven floss by Reach with green font on the container. It seems to be thicker. But I definitely prefer woven floss over the other types. It doesn&#x27;t cut my gums and I think it cleans better.</li>
            <li> Best floss ever. But hard to find.</li>
            <li> This floss is a little thicker than most floss and has a great taste.  I feel than my teeth are cleaner when I use it.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s dentist recommended this floss. Was unable to find locally so purchased on Amazon. I have a small bridge and many capped teeth. This floss works really well with no snags. Next trip to dentist will be the real test.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Love it.  Shipping was great.  This lasts a long time and slides really great over your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I will buy, it cleans the entire tooth at the same time it cleans between your teeth.If you floss twice a day with this floss you will never have bad breath.</li>
            <li> My wife goes through dental floss like water. Good quality floss for your teeth when you need it. Buy this product first.</li>
            <li> Great floss for a difficult mouth.</li>
            <li> Great floss, hard to find in stores.  Really feels like you&#x27;re accomplishing something when you floss, and stretching it out makes it easier to get between teeth.</li>
            <li> This floss can be very hard to find in stores. I carry packs in all my bags. I have it in every room of my house. I am a big flosser.</li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for probably five to six years after my dental hygienist recommended it. I have gums that have receded and this floss is sensitive for those but strong enough to do the job. I tried the tape stuff and find it too flimsy to do anything, and the regular floss is a bit to harsh for my gums. This soft woven rope floss is perfect. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores anymore, so I was delighted to find it here. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am old enough that my teeth do not fit very closely together, and the woven unwaxed floss does an excellent job of cleaning between my teeth. And the mint, while not essential,  tastes good.</li>
            <li> It gets high up into my gums without feeling like it&#x27;s slicing them open like the tape type of floss does. Flavor is good. Only problem is I go through it faster. But I bet my dentist wouldn&#x27;t call that a problem. Great check ups from the hygienist and the dentist since I started using this floss. Highly recommend for beginner flossers and those who don&#x27;t floss often.</li>
            <li> If you want to impress your dentist, tell them you not only floss daily but you mail-order a specific floss. Oh yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I cannot say why this floss is so hard to find in stores. What makes this product awesome is you get 6 packs which should last you a good amount of time. If I had a bomb-shelter, I&#x27;d stock it with hundreds of them.</li>
            <li> This floss is thicker and the dual strands get everything out from between your teeth and make your teeth feel like you just left the dentist office.  No other floss makes my mouth feel as clean.</li>
            <li> I do not like the feel of waxed floss. It hurts my gums and I feel i don&#x27;t clean as well. The string floss is very easy to handle and feels better on my gums. I feel that it does a better job than waxed floss.</li>
            <li> This is the type of floss I find results with for my teeth and it is hard to find in the stores in my area.  Was happy to find it on Amazon and purchased a pack of 6 so it will last me the year. Love the fact that it is woven as I find it helps in removing any plaque plus being mint flavored is a plus.</li>
            <li> Best floss. Grips everything between your teeth and rips it out. Wax floss just slides past food particles.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best floss on the market, if you can find it. I have found it at my local Walgreen&#x27;s and Target, but at a much higher price than this 6-pack. Each pack of floss comes in closed packages (as pictured).</li>
            <li> Glad to see I could purchase it online as it&#x27;s difficult to find it around where I live in the drug store chains and often not enough of it hanging on display as I like to buy in quantity so as not to be bothered shopping for it--plus it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> This floss does a better job of cleaning my teeth than normal floss.  Easy to use.  Hard to find in the stores, so I order online now. I hope Johnson keeps making this floss, it is terrific.</li>
            <li> I love this floss and for some reason all the stores in my area have stopped carrying it-at least, all the stores I have checked, which is a lot.  This floss is as pictured, the 50 yd. containers.  My only complaint is the approx. $5.00 price tag per container (including shipping).  I hope Johnson and Johnson restocks this stuff in stores soon!</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss.  I cannot find Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss on Amazon any more.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss that should be sold. No other company makes one like it. If you floss your teeth with any other floss then use this one you will think you didn&#x27;t floss to begin with! I have been using this for many years. It is hard to find in most stores so i order online and buy a case at a time. I could not live without it. My hygenist originally recomended this floss.</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find at retail, but they are the absolute best for flossing. Unfortunately, it will tear and lodge between teeth which are very close to each other. Keep some Dentotape handy to remove the torn floss.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended it.  Easy to use, gets the job done and leave your mouth feeling fresh.  Best floss ever!</li>
            <li> Finally, this product seems to be back in the stores.  Probably best for people with evenly spaced teeth.  Also best for people who are serious about flossing!</li>
            <li> This floss is great for anyone that&#x27;s obsessed with clean teeth. This is not those &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; type of floss. It is thicker and really cleans between the teeth. If you don&#x27;t like that, don&#x27;t buy this. Though I live in a big city with lots of options for drugstores, I can not find this type of floss, so it is great that Amazon has it. Love woven floss!</li>
            <li> After my dentist gave me a sample of this, I search high and low for it.  Target carries it, but Amazon is cheaper, and the 6 pack will last me for a while.  Try it; it&#x27;s the best floss ever.</li>
            <li> My husband needs to use the gentle gum care because of problems with his gums and with his fingers.  This floss doesn&#x27;t cut into his fingers like other flosses do and it is much easier on his mouth.  A must-have for our dental hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> Great floss for use twice or more per day without any harm to gums.  It is really gentle but a little thicker then plain floss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floss.  You stick it between your teeth.  It works.  You then have cleaner teeth.  This is an inexpensive way to get it.</li>
            <li> This is the woven floss and my favorite. However, it is getting nearly impossible to find it in grocery stores and pharmacies. I try to buy these at 12 packages at a time as I fear they may be discontinued, This is not a fact just a concern since they are so hard to find. My dentist claims that the slicker floss does not remove plaque as well as the woven. Not all people can use the woven as it is thicker and if you have tight spaces it could be difficult. My dental cleanings are a breeze since using this floss with little to none plaque or tartar present.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble finding the right floss.  My teeth shred a lot of floss, but really narrow glossy floss doesn&#x27;t do much good.  This floss is woven, coated in flouride, and perfect for my teeth.  It slides into tight spots easily, but spreads out to clean thoroughly.  Well worth mail ordering to get the right item for me!</li>
            <li> This floss has grit.  Literally.  It&#x27;s like very fine sand paper which is awesome because it gets rid of everything you are using if for (aka plaque).  It also gives your teeth a dose of fluoride as it goes, almost like mouthwash. Awesome!  Best dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially got it as a sample at the dentist&#x27;s office.  I live overseas and could not find it anywhere so ordered it off of Amazon!  That&#x27;s how awesome it is!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended fluoride dental floss, but it is no longer available in the stores due to acute fluoride toxicity. I loved the fluoride floss but I could not find it anywhere... but Amazon. Even though I thought it was really expensive, and because I thought this was fluoride floss, I was willing to pay the price. This is NOT, I repeat- NOT FLUORIDE mint floss. This is regular floss and I was not happy with the product at all.</li>
            <li> Does not get stuck in my teeth any more than other flosses.  I really liked the Reach Cleanpaste the best of all but they stopped making that.  This one does the job better than other waxed flosses..and if I DO get somestuck in a couple of my tight fitting  teeth I just use some Glide to get that floss out.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I use this product.  I love it!  It works very well, but quite gentle for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss for me.  It has Fluoride in it for added protection to your teeth.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist and I absolutely love this product better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried it all. The fact that it&#x27;s impregnated with fluoride is a huge plus because you&#x27;re administering right where most patients need it most: between teeth</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist and very effective</li>
            <li> Johnson and Johnson has discontinued the Reach Fresh Mint Woven Floss for Sensitive Gums and replaced it with this inferior product.  The floss is thinner than the previous woven floss, and it is now laced with fluoride.  While this may be acceptable to some, many people with sensitive gums prefer to avoid all unnecessary chemicals.  I hope Johnson &amp; Johnson will reconsider this decision, and bring back the original Reach Fresh Mint Woven Floss for Sensitive Gums, which was a far superior product to any other floss on the market.</li>
            <li> Says \\&quot;woven floss\\&quot; - what they actually sent was waxed.  Nice.  (not!)  I never use waxed.  They shouldn&#x27;t advertise what they&#x27;re not selling.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I get this floss because it is coated in fluoride and I tend to get soft spots in between my teeth. I like the feeling of this floss a lot more than the cheap flosses I used to get, and it seems to be helping restore some of the soft spots I was getting in the enamel.</li>
            <li> At the recommendation of my dental hygienist, I looked for Reach Gentle Gum Care floss.&lt;br /&gt;It is most effective at removing plaque and being gentle on the gums.  Avoid&lt;br /&gt;wax covered floss....that makes less friction.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this floss. Because it&#x27;s woven of 2 strands, it&#x27;s thicker than normal floss, and it&#x27;s also somewhat soft and gentle on your gums, not cutting in to them. It works well and has improved my gum health.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss and my local stores no longer carry it.  I like the feel and taste of woven floss, and me teeth feel cleaner after using it.  The floss arrived in a timely manner in its original packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it is very hard to find in the stores.  This is the second time I have purchased it on the internet and have gotten about a yrs worth at a time.  It is about half price on the internet from what you would pay in the store.</li>
            <li> Feb. 2015: I just opened a new Reach Floss from this shipment, and I now know how they get 50 yards in a small case. They reduced the thickness by a third (at least). This is not as comfortable as what I got in the old packaging from previous orders. You have to be careful with this: it can hurt your gums. I may have to go back to the pharmacy and buy my next floss purchase. This was an unpleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ever you wanted to floss, but all the products - even those given to you by your dentist - seem to \\&quot;cut\\&quot; the gums, then this is the floss for you! It does the job it was intended to do, is \\&quot;waxed\\&quot; and soft and is extremely comfortable even through the process necessary after three ears of corn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Between my Sonicare and this floss, I did not need a cleaning and my gum \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; reduced dramatically in just the past six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While what I wrote was true, the Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint that I bought previous to this was 4 strands woven together; this is two!</li>
            <li> I was crushed when this floss free of poison fluoride was discontinued until its forcing me to try others helped me find even better--the original dental floss, P.O.H. (Personal Oral Hygiene), on Amazon too, including fluoride-free &amp; wax-free (dentist advises v. wax build up) &amp; in super thin yet strong #420, medium &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; #490, &amp; thick #630, all streamlined strong woven fibers making flossing faster &amp; easier than ever so that I avoid it less! :D</li>
            <li> I like how easily I can hold it in my fingers without slipping, and how clean it gets between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed, when we could not get this product anywhere, because we really liked it.  Then we learned that the internet had it again...the rest is history!</li>
            <li> I have used these for several years and I consider them to be the best available on the market.  Hope the manufacturer never stops making them.</li>
            <li> Woven floss is superior to any other floss because it actually cleans between your teeth rather than just harsh scraping. The fibers create a sort of brush that leaves a smooth minty freshness behind. I am having trouble finding this in brick-&amp;-mortar stores so I&#x27;m fearful that it will no longer be made. Stock up while you can!</li>
            <li> Love this gentle dental floss!  Very good for sensitive teeth and gums.  And very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least two dental hygienists tell me that this is the best floss for removing plaque. There&#x27;s a lot to be said for personal preference, but I&#x27;ve found the flat or &#x27;tape&#x27; style floss snaps or breaks too easily. Additionally, for reasons that are beyond me, this type of floss is getting harder and harder to find in retail stores. First, my local Publix stopped carryig it, then Walmart joined in. And now, only my local Walgreens carries the stuff, but at the jaw-dropping price of $3.99 a package. Nice to know I can save at least some money here at Amazon by ordering 6 at a time, enough to last me for 8 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great floss + decent price &#x3D; Another rock-solid Amazon deal!</li>
            <li> This kind of floss can be hard to find in stores. Since it is my favorite I was glad to find it at Amazon.com. I have a few places between my teeth that always collect small bits of food. This floss does the best job of getting it out. It&#x27;s like a fine piece of yarn that thins as it stretches so it will clean out gaps, but slide right through tight spaces too. If you&#x27;re dedicated to good oral hygiene, I highly recommend this floss.</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the other flosses I have used Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint Floss offers the tooth cleaning feel at a good value.  It has been hard to find.  Once I am out of my present floss (I alternate using Reach and the other floss now) I will switch to Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint Floss exclusively.</li>
            <li> I have used this floss for a long time and like for it&#x27;s cleaning ability and it&#x27;s taste but I have to tear of new pieces every few teeth because of shredding.</li>
            <li> I have tried all brands and kinds of dental floss.  This is my far the best.  It has little fibers that really clean between teeth but are gentle on gums.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I will actually use anymore. All the other kinds are too uncomfortable. This has a bit of texture, so I feel like it&#x27;s actually working. Plus, the woven texture makes it easy on my fingers, which are sensitive to being strangled and turn blue with regular floss.</li>
            <li> I have really &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; teeth because of enamel loss (caused by whitening products). This really gets the gunk out of and off of my teeth. My hygienist turned me on to this, and I&#x27;ll never go back to regular floss, which doesn&#x27;t even do much. I feel like all dentists should be promoting this floss to their patients.</li>
            <li> I just like this floss.  Easy to get between teeth, doesn&#x27;t rip, and gets the job done very well !!</li>
            <li> A bit more expensive than if you buy it at your local Walmart or store. Still, availability is what makes it a good buy. This is erratically available in stores.</li>
            <li> Works great and does not hurt the tight teeth situation. I would recommend these just maybe not in a pack of 6. I have enough floss to last me months with this package deal.</li>
            <li> Dentists have been using this for years. All of a sudden they disappeared from store shelves.Great product and happy to find again.</li>
