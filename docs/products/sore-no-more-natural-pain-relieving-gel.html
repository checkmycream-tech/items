            <li> True to the name, Sore No More really worked on my low back pain.  </li>
            <li> fragrance is very strong and the coldness/chill on my skin last approximately 30 minutes&lt;</li>
            <li> At first it seems like it&#x27;s not really doing anything, give it a few minutes</li>
            <li> At rest, a small amount relieved the tightness and made life much much easier.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the other product with the same name.  </li>
            <li> It helped me and relieved some pain in a very short time, but unfortunately it only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the other guys brand, but, not as effective.</li>
            <li> No More Natural Pain Relieving Gel, for me, does not provide any relief what-so-ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no more is the same product only packaged for consumer purchase and use.  </li>
            <li> I used to wake up crying thru the night several times.  </li>
            <li> Cream does seems to lessen the pain...be careful not to touch your face with the cream on it...</li>
            <li> I was using other products to take the pain away, but it only lasted a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Have tried other products and do not get relief like Sore</li>
            <li> Rubbing Sore no More on the pain area is the only thing that gives me any relief.</li>
            <li> Despite an unusual gel consistency, it created heat (or cold, I could never decide), which made my neck pain diminish for several hours.</li>
            <li> When I went to reorder, I kept noticing other &#x27;sore no more&#x27; jars with different labels &amp; they say cold or hot.  </li>
            <li> I twisted my knee pretty badly a few months ago at work.  </li>
            <li> but it was the other one I received!</li>
            <li> He says it makes his knees stop aching and hurting, which is saying something because he has been on medication since he was little for his arthritis.</li>
            <li> Helps ease the pain of a perpetually stiff and sore neck.</li>
            <li> There is no strong smell either.</li>
            <li> No More usually just plain stops that pain</li>
            <li> My wife has neck and back pain from time to time, so despite being skeptical, I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I was given this by a friend and for me it is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My boss gave me a container of SORE NO MORE</li>
            <li> No More gives.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of Sore No More on Amazon and decided for the small price to give it shot.  </li>
            <li> no More helps with sore muscles.  </li>
            <li> It lasted almost all day and now I hardly notice any pain in my knee at all.  </li>
            <li> No More is the bomb!</li>
            <li> No More works like a charm!</li>
            <li> It helps loosen up the tense muscles.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;and is a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have a very painful lower back problem for years.</li>

            <li> Bought this for an elderly friend who has since passed away, but she swore by this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it helps me a lot. I have a lot of pain in my hips and arms and this product doesn&#x27;t make it go away completely but it certainly helps to ease the pain for awhile. I use it every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works awesome.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well at easing pain. Not anywhere as effective as Topricin for my plantar fasciitis. Smells like a mild Vicks Vaporub and helped clear my nasal congestion.</li>
            <li> This is made from all natural herbs and plants. I have back, shoulder and neck problems.This product works to relieve&lt;br /&gt;my pain quickly. I just purchased 2 more 8oz jars. One is for my son as he uses it for his back also. I have given samples&lt;br /&gt;to alot of friends and they love it. Try it you will love it to :)))&lt;br /&gt;This product deserves 5 stars and more</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for neuropathy in his feet. It makes a difference. It was recommended by his physical therapist.  When I went to reorder, I kept noticing other &#x27;sore no more&#x27; jars with different labels &amp; they say cold or hot.  This is a different company &amp; a different product.  I had to call both companies to find this out.  Amazon features the hot/cold one more often, but since we had tried &amp; liked this one, we decided to stay with it.  It has a pleasant smell that goes away after a little while.</li>
            <li> Helps ease the pain of a perpetually stiff and sore neck. Pleasant small. Despite an unusual gel consistency, it created heat (or cold, I could never decide), which made my neck pain diminish for several hours.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have neuropathy and arthritis in my feet and hands and use this very night...works wonders with pain and burning!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that eased my sore, achy feet (I am on them 8 hrs daily).  Our neighbor has used this product for many, many years and recommended it.  We have recommended it to others as well.  It is our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; when anything aches....and IT DOES WORK.</li>
            <li> Rubs in and is grease-less.  Stays hot a long time.  Washes off of you hands with soap and warm water .</li>
            <li> Absolutely this cream is fabulous!!! I have Fibromyalgia all over.  I rub it on me when I get up and when I go to bed. (A world of difference) I have two knees that are bone on bone. I am losing weight to have the surgery. They almost are more pain than one can bear. I rub it all in on my knees and in the bend of my legs. I can sleep most all night. I used to wake up crying thru the night several times.  It helps stop the aching in my hands. Well, it works all over, even the bottom of my feet. I cannot say enough good about it, it is the best of anything I have ever tried. It helps me stay off pain pills. If you are hurting and have lost hope, this is the thing to get, as it will work! If it happened not to on you, you haven&#x27;t lost much, but if it works on you as it does on me you will be forever thankful. TRY it, for yourself.  Blessings to you, June</li>
            <li> good that work I bough my dad he like it thanks</li>
            <li> We have used this product before and we love it. It beats anything else that we have ever used for pain.</li>
            <li> Great product for arthritic joints, Amazing! I also bought &amp;#34;Sombra Warm Therapy&amp;#34; at the same time. Obviously made in the same place. Same jar, ingredients, texture, effects, color, ect. I now have two jars of the same stuff. I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the other guys brand, but, not as effective.</li>
            <li> This was the best I have tried &amp; I&#x27;ve tried many.I have a very painful lower back problem for years.It has a combination of some of the best ingredients to ease pain.</li>
            <li> really helps with muscle and joint pain</li>
            <li> Cream does seems to lessen the pain...be careful not to touch your face with the cream on it...I liked to put an ACE bandage on to keep warmeth in.</li>
            <li> Great product! It heals my wrist.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product - but be aware that the there are two similar products both with the same name. The other is good but not as good as this one. This is the one I ordered but it was the other one I received!</li>
            <li> I love the fast shipping</li>
            <li> I should say off the bat that this product was recommended to my wife and I by my aunt, who is a chiropractor and expert in herbal medicine. My wife has neck and back pain from time to time, so despite being skeptical, I gave it a shot. It really works! The relief is temporary, but the stuff works almost instantly when applied, relaxing muscles and easing stiffness and pain. Being all-natural is just a bonus. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Sore No More is the bomb! It works great and I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for years to ease joint and muscle pain.  It generates a soothing warmth and is pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> Great stuff that works!</li>
            <li> Really good stuff. I&#x27;ve got an arthritic thumb joint that sometimes takes my right hand out of commission. Lotsa pain. Sore No More usually just plain stops that pain and I&#x27;m good to go again. Almost instantly!</li>
            <li> My mom swears by this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was given this by a friend and for me it is unbelievable. I always have some in my purse.</li>
            <li> Works great. Reliieves pain</li>
            <li> Great product ... I keep a jar at both of my places</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it all the time for sore muscles . I will be ordering in the future. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Eases the pain in the knees.  Not greasy and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> We love this product.  First started using it when recommended by chiropractor, called Sombra.  Sore no more is the same product only packaged for consumer purchase and use.  Works great on sore muscles and tendonitis.  Highly recommend the vendor and the product.  Great service, great packaging.</li>
            <li> We really love this product and it works. At first it seems like it&#x27;s not really doing anything, give it a few minutes then you can feel the heat. The heat is something that can be handled, not too hot. It helps loosen up the tense muscles. Always buy 2-3 jars at a time, give some away to someone who needs it. People thank us for it. Give it try.</li>
            <li> The odor is strong at first but it quickly dissipates. Sore No More works like a charm! Absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best joint pain relief on the market</li>
            <li> Sore No More Natural Pain Relieving Gel, for me, does not provide any relief what-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very strong and the coldness/chill on my skin last approximately 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;and is a little uncomfortable.  I used it on my neck, shoulders, and arms for my arthritis.</li>
            <li> I twisted my knee pretty badly a few months ago at work.  I was using other products to take the pain away, but it only lasted a few hours.  My boss gave me a container of SORE NO MORE and I was astounded at how great it works!  Took the pain right away and I was able to move much better too.  It lasted almost all day and now I hardly notice any pain in my knee at all.  I do use this every morning before work or before I leave for the day and I would highly recommend it.  There is no strong smell either.</li>
            <li> Great gel for relieving pain without the odor of most other products.</li>
            <li> We have used this produced for years. It is thee best. Have tried other products and do not get relief like Sore No More gives.</li>
            <li> I have chronic migraines brought on by cervical dystonia. This and some DMSO makes a wonderful combination to relieve muscle spasms. I use it on my temples, neck, shoulders, leg muscles after running. Its just so good. It doesn&#x27;t get super hot or super cold. It really is the perfect balance.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be caught at home without it.</li>
            <li> This worked the best for relieving and relaxing my lower back muscles.  The all natural ingredients are a plus.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Help a lot for my pain help me relaxed and sleep well.</li>
            <li> Really effective for diminishing my aunt&#x27;s arthritis pain in her knees.  A great product!!!</li>
            <li> I had the almighty  pain in the periformis muscle for three weeks.  I read the reviews of Sore No More on Amazon and decided for the small price to give it shot.  At rest, a small amount relieved the tightness and made life much much easier.  After two days I decided to try a run of four miles. This product kept me pain free throughout and I&#x27;m convinced  it made recovery time a lot shorter.</li>
            <li> Sore no More helps with sore muscles.  I use it every day with a sore knee from skiing.  It does provide relief.</li>
            <li> My son has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and is constantly aching especially in his knees, so we decided to try this cream and see if it really helped alleviate some of his pain. We received this cream very quickly after we ordered it. When you first open the container you will be able to smell the cream, it is not really a bad smell just a strong one. My son swears by this cream! He says it makes his knees stop aching and hurting, which is saying something because he has been on medication since he was little for his arthritis. He has also used it for arthritis in his elbow and said it helped also. As I said, it does have a liniment smell and it is a must to wash your hands after applying (you do NOT want to get this stuff in your eyes, it WILL burn them), but my son is so happy to find a cream to help the pain subside (and so am I)! My grandfather also uses this cream for arthritis in his knees and loves it. They both use it on a regular basis. It is a lot better to apply a cream to the area of pain than to have to put pain medication in their body. My grandfather recommends this cream to everyone who has an ache and a pain. He never lets his run out, when he gets low he tells me to order some more! Worth every penny! I have even used it before for my shoulder when I pulled a muscle and let me tell you, it will sure make the pain ease off!</li>
            <li> One of the best products for pain.  I use it for back pain and it works better than other products.</li>
            <li> It helped the pain on my skin...</li>
            <li> This gel is wonderful and I recommend it to everyone who has pain in their back, shoulders, knee&#x27;s, feet.  It is very good and relieves my pain within 1 hour of rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  My husband has had severe back pain for over 13 years and has tried everything you&lt;br /&gt;can imagine. This is the only thing that helps after he takes off his lidoderm patches.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never heard him rave about anything like he does this gel or cream.</li>
            <li> was reccomended to me by a friend at work. works great ...would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have pain in my leg and ankle. Rubbing Sore no More on the pain area is the only thing that gives me any relief. I&#x27;ve used it for several years and never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> It helped me and relieved some pain in a very short time, but unfortunately it only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> A friend in the neighborhood brought a sample over and I hesitantly tried it on my sore back muscles.  True to the name, Sore No More really worked on my low back pain.  I have since recommended this product to my mother who has arthritis and she truly finds relief in her finger knuckles.  All natural and smells pretty good!  A word of caution however, this product gets really hot on my body when I shower.  Just be aware.  It does not keep me from using the product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels. Works quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;mediciny&amp;#34;. I will buy more when I need it.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the other product with the same name.  This is the one to get.  It is great even for burns because it has aloe in it.  If you look at the ingredients it&#x27;s full of great stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t stink offensively, has a nice odor.  Relief comes quickly.  I have a sore shoulder.  This is also a very generous size.  So should last a bit.</li>
            <li> What can I say....it works!  I&#x27;ve used this for years and it definitely helps with sore joints.</li>
