            <li>I love the colors!</li>
            <li>This is a great product that is easy to apply and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I love the coppery, brown color and the top highlight color!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best formula that Revlon has ever made for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The colors blend nicely and I&#x27;m pleased with the variation.</li>
            <li>I have been using this color and brand for many years.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that there are still some out there</li>
            <li>I love this eye shadow, I can never find it in stores</li>
            <li>I love the color palate</li>
            <li>I love this eye shadow just have to replace the applicator before I use it</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this color stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Looks great with my fair skin and freckles and brownish red hair !</li>
            <li>and all they said was they changed the packaging and not the formula...not true!</li>
            <li>product came very quickly and not damaged.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this line of Revlon eye shadows because they are easy to use and stay on for a long time without fading or streaking.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than the new colorstay quads (square ones).</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear</li>
            <li>It works well on my Asian skin, nice for summer, but I can see it working in the fall as well.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely heart stricken!</li>
            <li>and I am trying to buy as many as possible before they disappear forever!</li>
            <li>The colors in the pallet blend very well, and it wears all day!</li>
            <li>so much I came back and bought 4 more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended,  just don&#x27;t get too attached as they will not be around forever!</li>
            <li>I am very please with this whole experience.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased one as a back up.</li>
            <li>I love the brown shades of eye shadow and these have been chosen very carefully into one compact.  </li>
            <li>The service was fast -- and the product arrived in the same condition as when it was shipped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has tons of fallout, fades after only a few hours, yet leaves sparkly bits all over my face (which isn&#x27;t appropriate for work).</li>
            <li>The shadow goes on nicely, the darkest shade gives a slight bit of fallout, but no more so than other top brands such as Dior and Chanel, if the truth be known.  </li>
            <li>I had four different color sets of Revlon&#x27;s new 16 hour quad and wound up throwing them all away.</li>
            <li>I have red hair and was using a product for my eyebrows and after a few years it was discontinued; I was fortunate enough to find this product which worked very well for my red hair and guess what It was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Was disappointed as to why Revlon discontinued it, but I am glad I was able to finally purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of days, but so far the product has lived up to it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>I rated this less than five stars only because it isn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted,  just the closest colors to what I was looking for.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this eye palette! Ever since I got this I have been using it and I am in love with it! All the colors go so well with one another and you can make eye looks go from everyday to dramatic. I love the coppery, brown color and the top highlight color! I will definitely be picking up a couple of backups and recommending them to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I love the brown shades of eye shadow and these have been chosen very carefully into one compact.  I&#x27;ve always used this&lt;br /&gt;brand as it never lets me down.  The service was fast -- and the product arrived in the same condition as when it was shipped.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t break up since it was wrapped in bubble wrap inside the box.  Great product and great service!  Works for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this color and brand for many years. I wear it every day and when I realized they discontinued it I was absolutely heart stricken! This is by far the best formula that Revlon has ever made for eyeshadow. I emailed the company asking them why they discontinued it and all they said was they changed the packaging and not the formula...not true! I am so glad that there are still some out there and I am trying to buy as many as possible before they disappear forever! The applicator these come with also makes it wonderful to apply, I just wish they lasted a little longer and that they could be bought seperately. Highly recommended,  just don&#x27;t get too attached as they will not be around forever!</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow, I can never find it in stores and it&#x27;s such a bummer. But atleast it lasts a while. I am a big fan of the Revlon Color stay eye shadow!</li>
            <li> Wife loved it could not find it anywhere. The boss women uses it every day for work and play. Great</li>
            <li> This is a terrific eyeshadow set-I read about it on a blogger&#x27;s site. Was disappointed as to why Revlon discontinued it, but I am glad I was able to finally purchase it.  It works well on my Asian skin, nice for summer, but I can see it working in the fall as well. The shadow goes on nicely, the darkest shade gives a slight bit of fallout, but no more so than other top brands such as Dior and Chanel, if the truth be known.  The shadows work best as do most, with the use of an eye shadow primer however.  I did not test it without using primer.  The product came in on time and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I can not buy this in the store anymore. I originally purchased one as a back up. I love the color palate so much I came back and bought 4 more.</li>
            <li> Color palate is great. Wear is great. Difficult finding the product as we were told it was discontinued at several stores and needed it for dance competition!</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow just have to replace the applicator before I use it all is my only complaint</li>

            <li> Love this color stays on all day. Looks great with my fair skin and freckles and brownish red hair !</li>
            <li> I have been using this same color for about 5 years! The colors in the pallet blend very well, and it wears all day!</li>
            <li> Service was excellent!!  Just not the colors it was suppose to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this line of Revlon eye shadows because they are easy to use and stay on for a long time without fading or streaking.  I rated this less than five stars only because it isn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted,  just the closest colors to what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this Quad! Great for everyday wear but it can also be used for smoky eyes. Amazing quality! I like this better than the new colorstay quads (square ones).</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find my favorite shadow quad. I love the colors!</li>
            <li> I have red hair and was using a product for my eyebrows and after a few years it was discontinued; I was fortunate enough to find this product which worked very well for my red hair and guess what It was discontinued.

            <li> The title says it all. This is a great product that is easy to apply and stays on all day. Revlon&#x27;s new 16 hour quad is awful. It has tons of fallout, fades after only a few hours, yet leaves sparkly bits all over my face (which isn&#x27;t appropriate for work). I had four different color sets of Revlon&#x27;s new 16 hour quad and wound up throwing them all away. Revlon, please bring back the 12 hour quad!!!</li>
