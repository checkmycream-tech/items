            <li>The clips are a wonderful size &amp; I think our granddaughter will like themðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>In a great array of colors.  </li>
            <li>THese are great.</li>
            <li>These work great.  </li>
            <li>The girls of the house use these for all kinds of things, lol.  </li>
            <li>I love that this contains every color (which is perfect for matching my baby&#x27;s outfits).</li>
            <li>These are good.</li>
            <li>Very cute and easier to use than the ones I picked up fromI</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cute, bright, nice IF you are using for one-time wear.  </li>
            <li>and they are so cute</li>
            <li>My daughter &amp; I just love these ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It looks like you would get cute heart shaped hair snaps</li>
            <li>This cute little heart shape clip is awesome...</li>
            <li>So cute and just the right size!</li>
            <li>My LO was blessed with a head full of hair from birth and when we were no longer able to style it into a fauxhawk I needed something to keep her hair out of her eyes.  </li>
            <li>But overall I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but I got cheap looking palmtree/strawberry hair snaps.  </li>
            <li>They slip right out right now, but I&#x27;m sure they will work once her hair isn&#x27;t as fine.  </li>
            <li>And it seems that certain colors clip on better than others.</li>
            <li>It was cheap but it wasn&#x27;t even worth the price.</li>
            <li>It took a while for them to ship to the US, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>They break the first time wearing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like something with hearts on it, as I like things simple, but these are really cute and clip/grip</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when the stash needs replenishing.</li>
            <li>Okay for older girls but too big for toddlers.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t close very well on my daughters head.</li>
            <li>Small enough to clip back my daughter&#x27;s fine hair, cute, and easy to match any outfit as needed, or as you have time for in the morning.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t mind them (so far) and hasn&#x27;t tried to pull them out.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my 6 month old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted some purple and yellow</li>
            <li>We purchased it for our 20 months old daughter and after one day, the color peeled off.</li>
            <li>They snap easily without hurting her head (or at least she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind or be bothered by them).  </li>
            <li>They did throw in some butterfly clips as well, which were small so work a little bit better in her hair.  </li>
            <li>My baby has thin hair, so sometimes they fall out easily.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping and they are so cute</li>
            <li> Too big for the toddler. Not happy with the product</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I just love these ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Cute, bright, nice IF you are using for one-time wear.  They break the first time wearing.</li>
            <li> In a great array of colors.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like something with hearts on it, as I like things simple, but these are really cute and clip/grip well.  My LO was blessed with a head full of hair from birth and when we were no longer able to style it into a fauxhawk I needed something to keep her hair out of her eyes.  Voila, these snap clips.  She doesn&#x27;t mind them (so far) and hasn&#x27;t tried to pull them out.  I do take them off when she goes down for naps in case they come off (or she pulls them off in her sleep) and she decides to put it in her mouth. They snap easily without hurting her head (or at least she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind or be bothered by them).  Will definitely buy more when the stash needs replenishing.</li>
            <li> Very cute and easier to use than the ones I picked up fromI The Children&#x27;s Place. However, the clips are small and may pose as a choking hazard for infants.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured.  Mine have some palm tree on them and they are big.  I will keep them because they were $7 and I don&#x27;t feel like dealing with a return to China.</li>
            <li> I love that this contains every color (which is perfect for matching my baby&#x27;s outfits). My baby has thin hair, so sometimes they fall out easily. And it seems that certain colors clip on better than others. But overall I was happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> This cute little heart shape clip is awesome... I actually bought this for small&lt;br /&gt;Maltese dog. I love it</li>
            <li> larger and not quite as represented online.  The black clips are not even heart shaped.  Okay for older girls but too big for toddlers.</li>
            <li> So cute and just the right size!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t close very well on my daughters head. It was cheap but it wasn&#x27;t even worth the price.</li>

            <li> Size not accurate in description</li>
            <li> Beware...you will not get what you ordered.  It looks like you would get cute heart shaped hair snaps but I got cheap looking palmtree/strawberry hair snaps.  Colors are browns, yellows, reds.  Nothing of what is pictured....so don&#x27;t order.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The clips are a wonderful size &amp; I think our granddaughter will like themðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> This is the worst! We purchased it for our 20 months old daughter and after one day, the color peeled off.</li>
            <li> Item is what you would expect for amount that was paid for them.</li>
            <li> These work great.  The girls of the house use these for all kinds of things, lol.  Everyday hairstyles, crafts, holing out hair back while washing our face.  These are good.</li>
