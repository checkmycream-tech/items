            <li>This lightly fragrant shampoo leaves your hair wonderfully \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; and gives lots of body and shine.  </li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>Of all shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, I feel the Neutrogena does the best job, leaving my hair smooth and shiny and it washes away with no residue.</li>
            <li>Good fragrance to it as well.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo multi-pack for my mother-in-law because she LOVED it when she visited and used our guest shower.  </li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo</li>
            <li>I have to find another one as good before mail order companies run out of this one.</li>
            <li>Since this shampoo has gone out of production, I was very glad to find it offered on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and cannot find it in stores.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo brand.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the hyped junk they feature in the department stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the product for many years now.</li>
            <li>love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo</li>
            <li>An outstanding product I might add.</li>
            <li>My hair has been thinning out and I love the way it made my hair feel thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is the best and only shampoo product on the market that is unscented and is non-allergic.</li>
            <li>Product was promptly shipped and well packed so overall a very good transaction.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light as well, leaving one&#x27;s hair smelling clean not perfumed.  </li>
            <li>There must be a reason it&#x27;s not on the market; high price and as good as $4.00 shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is thinning some with age.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo gives my hair body.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena Clean Volume Body Enhancing shampoo lives up to its name.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to get it from Amazon when local stores are out.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena Clean Volume shampoo is truth in advertising.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair clean and full bodied.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you have very fine hair, with no body.  </li>
            <li>great buy and product was as expected</li>
            <li>Overall, a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>Could not find it in the stores around here, luckily I looked on eBay, and I avoided any hair emergencies.</li>
            <li>Cleans my hair,without leaving a residue;which,is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It is the complimentary shampoo they supply.  </li>
            <li>but so far, I have found no shampoo in decades of shampooing that has been able to do both.  </li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>so when my one source dried up I turned to Amazon and was delighted to not only find the product but was able to get it at a fairly reasonable price--although it did cost more than I had been paying at the supermarket.  </li>
            <li>I tried an earlier version of the shampoo while living in a more humid part of the country and still found this to be true.  </li>
            <li>Quickly shipped, thanks very much.</li>
            <li>It works great since I have sensitive skin/scalp and other shampoos</li>
            <li>I like how my scalp feels clean!I will definitely buy more in the future!&lt;br /&gt;  James Newman</li>
            <li>Gentle yet produces much lather.  </li>
            <li>I order enough to get the free shipping and there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any shelf life issues.    </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I recommend this shampoo neutrogena clean for daily use.</li>
            <li>Very little shampoo was lost, however, and now I have a nice supply.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo</li>
            <li>the price  has gotten too high.  </li>
            <li>It is not harsh and really cleans my hair and makes it shine.</li>
            <li>but I hope they come out with soething new that I can use as well.</li>
            <li>I agree that it was nice to find this on Amazon, since Target stopped carrying it and few local stores have it.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels pleasantly clean, not weighed down by \\&quot;stuff.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>apparently this has been discontinued by the marteting gurus or bean counters at Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>The last time I did an Amazon search, it was selling for a ridiculous price, probably because there are only so many bottles left in this world.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is gentle enough for daily use even for dry hair in low humidity drying locales.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money -- find a new brand!  </li>
            <li> It gives my thin hair volume and it rinses clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> No other shampoo I have tried in the past decade has left my hair feeling this soft and given my hair body.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair straighter and with less of my natural curl.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to find in local stores, so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My hair is grey and thinning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually get sucked in my packaging (or at least I don&#x27;t admit it), but I like the clean, almost architectural look of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair feeling soft without the heavy residue of other shampoos I have used.  </li>
            <li> (I use the Neutrogena conditioner, too, but the pink \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; version, since Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell the matching formula.)</li>
            <li> Other volume shampoos just don&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer -- this shampoo gives body to my hair.  </li>
            <li> My only slight complaint was that the tops of several bottles were not secure and leaked in shipping causing a mess to wash off when I receive them.  </li>
            <li> I became addicted to this shampoo as a frequent visitor to Hilton Hotels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and it was always a little difficult to find locally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the last 10+ years and have tried 2 oalternatives with lousy results.  </li>
            <li> Almost impossible to find locally in stores.  </li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> so I ordered for him, but I noticed a terrible smell from his scalp and his pillow .</li>

            <li> Love this shampoo and cannot find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Only retail store you can buy it now is CVS and the price  has gotten too high.  I love this shampoo brand.  It does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> This lightly fragrant shampoo leaves your hair wonderfully \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; and gives lots of body and shine.  What a wonderful shampoo for the price!</li>

            <li> I have problems finding shampoos that do not make my head itch.  This is one that I found and have now used for several years.  I would recommend it, especially for those with thin/thinning hair.  Good fragrance to it as well.</li>
            <li> Why was this taken off the market?!  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and love it.  Other volume shampoos just don&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review ages after I bought the product, only to warn others looking for this product that it&#x27;s no longer made.  The last time I did an Amazon search, it was selling for a ridiculous price, probably because there are only so many bottles left in this world.  Don&#x27;t waste your money -- find a new brand!  Change is good!</li>
            <li> My husband liked to use this shampoo so I ordered for him, but I noticed a terrible smell from his scalp and his pillow . The smell stopped at once when I changed his shampoo.</li>
            <li> Could not find it in the stores around here, luckily I looked on eBay, and I avoided any hair emergencies.</li>
            <li> Since this shampoo has gone out of production, I was very glad to find it offered on Amazon.  My only slight complaint was that the tops of several bottles were not secure and leaked in shipping causing a mess to wash off when I receive them.  Very little shampoo was lost, however, and now I have a nice supply.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years.  For some reason, local stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  It is a great \\&quot;no frills, no nonsense\\&quot; shampoo.  I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo multi-pack for my mother-in-law because she LOVED it when she visited and used our guest shower.  She said she could not find this brand anywhere in Michigan.  Being me, I just hoppen on computer and opened amazon.com and there it was!  The price was right &amp; I wanted to hit my prime shipping minimum, so I sent her two packages.  Would you believe she called and left a voice message not saying thank you but \\&quot;what am I going to do with 8 bottles of shampoo?\\&quot;  Go figure!</li>
            <li> My age is \\&quot;up there\\&quot;. My hair is grey and thinning. The Neutrogena Clean Volume Body Enhancing shampoo lives up to its name. I have been using the product for many years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and it was always a little difficult to find locally so when my one source dried up I turned to Amazon and was delighted to not only find the product but was able to get it at a fairly reasonable price--although it did cost more than I had been paying at the supermarket.  Product was promptly shipped and well packed so overall a very good transaction.</li>

            <li> Does the job! Cleans my hair,without leaving a residue;which,is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena Clean Volume shampoo is truth in advertising.  The shampoo leaves my hair feeling soft without the heavy residue of other shampoos I have used.  Even my husband notices the difference in the feel of my hair as I have with his since he also started using this shampoo.  The scent is very light as well, leaving one&#x27;s hair smelling clean not perfumed.  If you do wear perfume, however, the shampoo won&#x27;t conflict with the fragrance. The product can therefore be used by both the men and the women in the family, reducing the clutter.  The shampoo is gentle enough for daily use even for dry hair in low humidity drying locales.  I have fine hair that is thinning some with age.  I agree with the other reviewer -- this shampoo gives body to my hair.  It does leave my hair straighter and with less of my natural curl.  I tried an earlier version of the shampoo while living in a more humid part of the country and still found this to be true.  I wish I could have this product and still keep my curl but so far, I have found no shampoo in decades of shampooing that has been able to do both.  All in all, I am still thrilled that Neutrogena still makes this product.  No other shampoo I have tried in the past decade has left my hair feeling this soft and given my hair body.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shampoo neutrogena clean for daily use. It leaves my hair shiny and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and I have had difficulty finding it in the stores latley.</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Why? I loved this shampoo but once it&#x27;s gone it&#x27;s gone. I have to find another one as good before mail order companies run out of this one. An outstanding product I might add.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to find locally in stores.  Buying in bulk definitely saves money.  It works great since I have sensitive skin/scalp and other shampoos tend to cause issues.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for people with allergies. My hair has been thinning out and I love the way it made my hair feel thicker and fuller. I am stocking up and hope the company doesn&#x27;t stop making it.  Just great and great service. thanks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this anywhere anymore and I love it. It gives my thin hair volume and it rinses clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> The reason I ordered the shampoo is because I like it and couldn&#x27;t find it in the supermarket stores.</li>
            <li> apparently this has been discontinued by the marteting gurus or bean counters at Neutrogena.  I&#x27;ve used it for the last 10+ years and have tried 2 oalternatives with lousy results.  Wish they&#x27;d reconsider....</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this shampoo gives my hair body. It is not harsh and really cleans my hair and makes it shine. I would recommend this to anyone with fine hair. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the best and only shampoo product on the market that is unscented and is non-allergic. The company should continue to produce it.</li>
            <li> Good price great product</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have found for really fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had allergies since I can remember and started having rash and itch issues since I was 11.  I have tried multiple shampoos but this is the only shampoo that has erased my rash and itch issues.  I&#x27;m concerned that Neutrogena has cancelled this product but I hope they come out with soething new that I can use as well.</li>
            <li> great buy and product was as expected</li>
            <li> There must be a reason it&#x27;s not on the market; high price and as good as $4.00 shampoo. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again when this batch runs out.</li>
