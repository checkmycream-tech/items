            <li> my Aveno or Pantene leave in conditioner spray other than the price.</li>
            <li> Bottle is small, but a little product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff has cracked the code to my previously untamable hair.</li>
            <li> But spray carefully -- can make the floor slick.</li>
            <li> No more tears!</li>
            <li> After having my LO, my hair was shedding and weak.</li>
            <li> Too expensive at the salon</li>
            <li> Beautician recommended and I found it to be useless.</li>
            <li> I am amazed and shocked.</li>

You can purchase this product at salons but you&#x27;ll pay much more! Extremely satisfied and product arrived on time. Will continue to buy for as long as they offer this product!</li>

            <li> Great product!  I like the scent, too!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but very expensive for this little tiny bottle. 5 stars for the product itself but 2 for the price.</li>
            <li> My patient is a hairdresser and she told me about this product and it works my hair started growing back</li>
            <li> Miracle is right! Tames my natural curls. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Miracle in a bottle. Detangling is no longer an issue for my kinky curls.</li>
            <li> Wife says it works OK.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy after sitting all day!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair a lot and it had become really dry and damaged, since I&#x27;ve been using this product my hair has actually gotten healthier and really soft. The smell is also really good.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product makes hair look and feel healthy again!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing on the market. I am hooked. After having my LO, my hair was shedding and weak. After using this one time my hair has completely changed...for the better. I have NO shedding at all and my hair is thicker after using this. I am amazed and shocked. It&#x27;s unreal how great of a product this is and how quickly it worked. I WILL BE GETTING THE WHOLE LINE!</li>
            <li> Not exactly for my type of hair after chemo my hair became thin at the top and thick around the rest of my head but I&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS..GOT HERE FAST!!! DEF RECOMMEND IT AND THE PRICE IS PERFECT - 5 STARS!!</li>
            <li> Best thing I have used since I bleached my hair for the summer! It&#x27;s a 10 is really a miracle!!! It all started with my mom giving me a sample of this product and I have to say I fell in love! I use this with a combination of the light Moroccan oil! Best combo and I also shampoo my hair with the purple shampoo from joico! All great products that currently work together For blonde hair it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Beautician recommended and I found it to be useless. I think it actually dried my hair out more.  The over the counter products are much better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product can&#x27;t touch the tangles in my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product and had to buy a travel size to take with me. This size lasted me almost 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> This is probably my one and only favorite product from this line. It really helps when de-tangling my long curly hair. I would definitely recommend the leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended to me by my stylist because I have very long color treated hair. I don&#x27;t blow dry and I don&#x27;t use many styling products. This will make your hair soft and de-tangle it well but I did not see a difference between this and my Aveno or Pantene leave in conditioner spray other than the price. If you&#x27;re just dying to try it buy one at Target and then return it when you realize the other conditioners are the same.</li>
            <li> I like this better than conventional hair sprays. But spray carefully -- can make the floor slick.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Just a tiny bit makes your hair like silk.Love it!</li>
            <li> delivered fast and a great product. Not a fake.</li>
            <li> Instantly detangled my hair. Im transitioning to natural hair and the detangling process is rough but this stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Highly recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well to reduce dryness and frizz for my dry and color processed hair, especially when I blow dry it!  So much cheaper here than at the big discount chain stores!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair is soft as silk .. Gives a A plus for fast shipment and packaging.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my 2 year olds knots!  No more tears!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for after swimming. Works great for detangling long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loyal to his leave-in-conditioner for quite some time now. The best leave-in I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
