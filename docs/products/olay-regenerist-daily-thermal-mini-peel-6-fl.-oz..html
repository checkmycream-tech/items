            <li>I love all of their products .  </li>
            <li>I find that glycolic acid does wonders for the texture (and tone) of my skin, so I purchased this peel (which is more so a scrub)</li>

            <li>You have to use a great deal of water to get the warming effect, which dries quickly and becomes very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I use this with other Olay products and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Easy addition to skin care routine.</li>

            <li>I have clean, radiant, smooth skin that looks so healthy after I use this.</li>

            <li>I use it every morning and it has improved the clearness and smoothness of my skin tremendously!  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed a huge change in my wrinkles</li>
            <li>... but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>The price on here at $12-13 is cheap.  </li>
            <li>But really, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked this line so much</li>
            <li>but I am happy with the product overall and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever had smooth beatiful skin</li>
            <li>if could lightly peel my skin off..</li>
            <li>I use it Thermal Mini-Peel every daily and works great on my face.</li>
            <li>Feels warm on the skin, feels very spa like.</li>
            <li>so decided to see if it was still available online to order or had been discontinued..  </li>
            <li>not help with discoloration but still does wonders to smooth your skin.</li>

            <li>It leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>It will also help keep you skin free of acne.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>I love many of Oil of Olay Regenerist products, but really don&#x27;t like the smell of this.</li>
            <li>So nice to have a warm facial before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Really makes my face feel clean and fresh, followed by a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel fresh clean love</li>
            <li>I have just finished my first bottle of this product and am about to begin my second tube, and have noticed very good results already.</li>
            <li>and I have very fine lines in certain areas of my face and would like to freshen &amp; smooth the appearance of my skin without any irritation.</li>
            <li>clean, exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite know what I was expecting, but this facial cleaner was quite amazing!</li>
            <li>The heat and tiny crystals that scrub your skin make a remarkable combination.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, it works and I love the entire line of Olay Regenerist.  </li>
            <li>is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I love that even when using cold water, the product turns very warm and feels great on the face.  </li>
            <li>I love how it heats up nicely just enough where it&#x27;s not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>THAT THE HEAT WILL HELP CLEAN ANY PORES.  </li>
            <li>It Makes my skin feel super smooth and pampered,</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and refreshed after each use.</li>
            <li>thi product is a very deep cleanser and between the warmth and the exfoliating bits, it feels so good on your face.</li>
            <li>big pores,sporadic acne - helps to give you a clearer, brighter complection-and helps with the texture of your skin-it also feels good -a must buy.</li>
            <li>This is a good scrub and it has helped my pregnancy acne immensely.</li>
            <li>I was very sceptical but was looking for a more gentle scrub to use more often</li>
            <li>I love the warming feature, and it really gets out my blackheads.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, Amazon sells this at a much cheaper price than the store.</li>
            <li>People with better skin than mine probably see more dramatic results but I am happy with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best products I have used in a long time !!  </li>
            <li>I have used other Olay products and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems.</li>
            <li>In combination with other Olay Regenerist porducts, this makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Not to harsh,  but not like nothing is in the product.. Cleans off great and leaves my skin super smooth..</li>
            <li>- I had to come back and give this product an extra star to make a perfect 5 star product.</li>
            <li>thinking it was just an over the counter mild product...</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it in several local stores so was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the nice warm feeling and any dry or loose skin is removed easily.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff, but liked it better when it was $12.99 a bottle less than a year ago, then</li>
            <li>I do not have great skin to start with and have many issues such as discoloration, fine lines and wrinkles and some slight acne scarring.</li>
            <li>and I like it because it does make my skin really moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money you pay for it.</li>
            <li>I used to fork over $100+ for fancy peels and facials but this stuff completely replaced all that :)</li>
            <li>I can see my skin getting softer, smoother and more clear.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it because now I know I am not missing anything if I don&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Keeps your face clear :)</li>
            <li>The results are worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My skin has stayed very clear and bright and it&#x27;s really hard not to keep touching my face because it&#x27;s so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li>but this is clearing them right up</li>
            <li>this is the first product that has really helped smooth the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>The Olay Mini Peel helps to smooth off the dry patches and my skin does look better.</li>
            <li>I splash my face with warm water, rub in a dab of the Neutrogena all over my face, then put on a generous dab of the Olay scrub &amp; gently scrub my whole face, staying clear of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>so I only leave it on a couple of minutes, then rinse and apply a light moisturizer with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;Never experienced any redness or any sort of other discomfort.</li>
            <li>have olive combination skin that is prone to discoloration from acne, and while the results of this product don&#x27;t quite equate to a micro/vibra-derm procedure, it certainly gets close!</li>
            <li>It really heats up in the water and I am sure it does a really deep clean.</li>
            <li>I liked this product it did work to heat up on my skin and then dry up my skin and then shed my skin like a snake.</li>
            <li>This is such a great daily treatment!</li>
            <li>Use it in the shower and it gives and nice warm feeling to my face while scrubbing away old dead skin cells!  </li>
            <li>I trust this brand very much and when I found this I jumped on it.</li>
            <li>Quick and visible results of brightening, smoothing, and overall glow that you get after a good facial, exfoliation, or enzyme mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have noticed how soft and supple my skin has become and it really gets my face clean!</li>
            <li>I know this product sounds really tempting!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The &#x27;thermal&#x27; part of it is pretty neat-</li>
            <li>started out using it twice daily, but more often than not anymore</li>
            <li>This product is very soothing and warm to the skin, I will continu using as long as possible.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>altho I will say that olay does need to have more directions on the back.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to make my skin as smooth and clear as this.</li>
            <li>overall seems to work better.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and I have a much more even tone.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to use the peel in the shower, it seems to get warmer and last longer that way.</li>
            <li>Like I already said, the warming feature is pretty neat, too.</li>
            <li>Also, it only warms for maybe six seconds-even if I add more water.</li>
            <li>I love using this - its like a mini facial!</li>
            <li>The whole Regenerist line has been like a miracle for my skin!</li>
            <li>After you rinse your skin will feel so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The smooth, soft, clearer skin IS revealed AND people do notice you&#x27;re doing something different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this price to be significantly better than my local WallyMart store.  </li>
            <li>This is my first criteria for any product.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I am hooked.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Like having a facial massage every day :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really comparable to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; facial, but for maintenance it does a pretty great job.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this could lightly peel off my skin to help even out my skin tone but that didnt happen.. but its a really good scrub, non irritating even if you rub your face for 1-2 minutes..</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and soft after use.  </li>
            <li>Makes the face skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African- American with fair completion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a great product but its just not good for sensitive/acne skin.  </li>
            <li>And it really does heat up on the first application.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li>A word of warning, however...if you use this product at night before bed make sure you wash it off completely because it will take the color right out of your pillow case (similar to what bleach will do, yikes)!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild, and does not linger on the skin for very long after it has been washed off, which is important for anyone sensitive to the smell of perfumes in their products.   </li>
            <li>This is a very a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>This Peel removes all the dead skin on your face and will be as effective when you get to the end of the tube as it was when you first opened it.</li>
            <li>is for me a certain no buy again.</li>
            <li>Much more economical than previous product I was buying from MK cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Still not sure why it&#x27;s referred to as a peel, it is more like an exfoliate, but really feels like a nice facial treatment.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it&#x27;s helping to clear up my active acne!</li>
            <li>the heating action is great in the shower and it really cleans out the pores while there open and if feels like your getting a mini facial every morning,  it is normally 22-25 dollars at Walmart and walgreens</li>
            <li>This adds up to a pretty decent amount of savings versus buying it in the store.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the product very highly.</li>
            <li>After only one week of use I have noticed a huge improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many things and spent so much money over the years.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very problematic skin.</li>
            <li>It works really well, so I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>so when I bought this I didn&#x27;t read the directions to much and exfoliated for 4-5 min.....</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use too much water at one time</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Over the course of a month, I noticed that my arms and hands looked and felt much smoother and youthful.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>When I was growing up, I was fortunate to escape teenage acne.  </li>
            <li>then you absolutely need this.</li>
            <li>This is the one product that removes all of that FAST..</li>
            <li>BUT I have very tolerant skin).</li>
            <li>and you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>when I use the Thermal peel on my face it heats up and using circular motions with my finger tips, gently scrubs my skin.</li>
            <li>I think this product is too much to spend for people my age.</li>
            <li>I thought its quite unusual.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it gives your skin a gentle warming sensation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After removing ALL makeup and REALLY cleaning the face and neck, use this product according to directions, adding water to reactivate the thermal properties a couple times (I do it 3 times).</li>
            <li>I use it daily and really enjoy the heating sensation it gives.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Like a real spa treatment.</li>
            <li>I never, never spend this much on cleansers for myself.</li>
            <li>This really does make my skin smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>I have real oily skin and this has helped a lot to control it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I use it a couple times a week and my skin feels so soft and fresh afterward.</li>
            <li>It hasnt really made a difference yet, but we&#x27;ll see with longer use of the product.</li>
            <li>I really think it improves the texture of my skin and pores.  </li>
            <li>I actually really like this product.</li>
            <li>much* cleaner and clearer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if I have a breakout and use this it is significantly reduced by the following day.</li>
            <li>Normally Walmart would beat Amazon&#x27;s price BUT NOT THIS TIME!</li>
            <li>It has only been a week and my skin is significantly smoother.</li>
            <li>I love this and use it every other day in my skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li>Old scars from my chest are pretty much gone now too.</li>
            <li>Not sure I really saw any improvement in my skin, but it feels nice.  </li>
            <li>have combination skin &amp; an oily t-zone &amp; like to use salicylic acid to keep my pores clean &amp; occasional zits away.  </li>
            <li>I have already been using this product for the past 1.5 years and feel an amazing difference in the skin texture.</li>
            <li>It scrubs nicely and it does heat up, but I cannot get over the TWO parabens, the red 33, and blue 1.I personally don&#x27;t mind spending a bit more on my daily face routine and having all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>so an so when u have better for less.</li>
            <li>To be fair, my face glows everyday regardless but it was extra glowy when I used this.</li>
            <li>Also I love facial scrubs, especially ones that are warming.</li>
            <li>After the next week, the tan areas had begun to fade, and the mild keratosis pilaris on my arms had also begun to lessen.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this product and helps get that younger look by peeling away the dead and build up skin on my face.</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily for the past three months and see and feel a remarkable difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li>I had a time finding a decent scrub for my face that would help with the breakouts I am still getting in my 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and find it gentle and luxurious.</li>
            <li>If I get my face wet with hot water, put on the mask and leave it for a couple minutes, my skin is totally soft and smooth when I rinse it.</li>
            <li>Off with the old and on with the new...good for sensitive skin...you can feel,the difference right away...</li>
            <li>It is also selling at a very reasonable price, compared to major retail stores.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for aging skin that still gets blemishes.</li>
            <li>but still, a highly recommended scrub, not a peel off :</li>
            <li>Pair it with any microdermabrasion kit for some real deal results comparable to a professional peel.</li>
            <li>I have melesma my skin is very sun sensitive and prone to tanning.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Use it everyday, I love this peel.</li>
            <li>By removing the dead skin cells, it also helps to make your foundation go on more evenly as well.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see that my pores are less noticable and overall my skin feels &amp; looks more even and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product &amp; will re-order although a little goes a long way with the product.</li>
            <li>Looked used, but represented as new.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even put on moisturizer, let your skin soak the residue in and adjust to the NEW SKIN SHERIFF in-town over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not use other exfoliating products on the areas I use the mini-peel on, and I use a very light moisturizer only at night.</li>
            <li>I also had a few areas that were rough and lightly discolored that I wanted to smooth out.</li>
            <li>However, I gave it 3 stars because it leaves my skin feeling wonderful - until the flare up :(</li>
            <li>is the first product which has given me instant results</li>
            <li>After the first 7 days, I used it only in the evenings on weekdays and twice a day on weekends.</li>
            <li>If you do not, you are at a higher risk of sunburn, which is important to keep in mind if you have very pale or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see if it helps with the redness/scarring from previous acne...</li>
            <li>Although, your face might be a little pinkish after the first use it  goes away pretty soon.</li>
            <li>As it heats, it only does that for a short period of time, making it calm the fact that it soothes the sensation out, not burning.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>Not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and softer, and I haven&#x27;t developed any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Anyway I&#x27;m use to professional products</li>
            <li>In fact, I have an Oil of Olay Professional X product which is practically identical to this Regenerist \\&quot;mini-peel\\&quot; and it never describes itself as a peel.  </li>
            <li>but this product has made the pores on my face smaller, it has gotten rid of the blackheads I had on my nose, my face is so much smoother now.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to present day</li>
            <li>but so far, this is working wonders for my complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend for those who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I never had to wear make-up and was blessed to be frequently complimented on my &amp;#34;perfect porcelain&amp;#34; skin.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, I had to try this</li>
            <li>I do that a couple times before I completely rinse it off.</li>
            <li>The pattern/print on the tube wasn&#x27;t complete.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Its kinda grey in color and it has a slightly funny smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the old acne marks fading too.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe Cher until I tried this, and realized that HOLY MOSES, I really CAN turn back time ! ! !  </li>
            <li>My flaky, oily, sensitive, middle-aged skin looks like a million bucks after I use this.  </li>
            <li>I use this product every morning and my skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can make your skin sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li>like I had a professional mini-facial.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin at all.</li>
            <li>: this was ok on few days of use but my skin reacted if used in a daily basis.</li>
            <li>and it is slowly but surely working I am also using this with a Hydroquinone Moisturizer</li>
            <li>I use this about every other day (I cleanse with origins checks &amp; balances first which I highly recommend) since using this product</li>
            <li>Great way to exfoliate, without being to hard on older skin--I am in my late 60s.</li>
            <li>After a lot of research, I decided to try this peel because I read that other reviewers with sensitive skin also had success.  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers note that they couldn&#x27;t sense any re-warming of the product when they re-wet it, and I find that it is definitely less noticeable if you&#x27;re really scrubbing your face hard because your face will feel warm from that alone, and so any heat that the product puts off becomes negligible in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Serious business, you will need an SPF of 75 or more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the peel 3 different times and every time I had a pretty substantial break out the next day.</li>
            <li>A friend had me try her very popular Clarisonic Brush ($200), and I think the Thermal Mini-Peel is at least as effective --and much less expensive.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a very long time &amp; love it but, everyonce in a while I receive a tube that is completely dried up &amp; will not come out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very mild facial scrub like experience without being too harsh.</li>
            <li>Something I have had problems with for so long is discolouration and it really made my skin Tone Even.</li>
            <li>but I can attest that this stuff seems to open the pores and ensure your dull skin is scrubbed away to reveal a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>at one time and lets your new younger silkier skin shine through.</li>
            <li>Gentle scrub removes dead skin, leaves skin soft and smooth, wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I used to have very acne prone skin with dry peeling areas too.</li>
            <li>It has a grainy texture and I scrub gently until it starts to get dry and then dampen my fingers to &#x27;reactivate&#x27; the warming and scrub again.</li>
            <li>The grit in this is gentle enough to use twice a day on my skin but some people may only like it one time per day.  </li>
            <li>it a try but don&#x27;t expect big results for at least a week &amp; more like 2 weeks to a month.</li>
            <li>so maybe I won&#x27;t scrub so hard there, but it was fine everywhere else</li>
            <li>I have major discolaration on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>However, I have very sensitive skin that makes it difficult to find suitable products for.</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying it as a single purchase first, then moving to subscribe and save ordering to save money if you are going to keep using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>just pulled so tight it was shriveled and took a whole day and tons of moisturizer to return to it&#x27;s normal elastic self.</li>
            <li>I think my breakouts are starting to clear up too</li>
            <li>Really helps get rid of rough skin.</li>
            <li>It not only cleans, but removes old skin.  </li>
            <li>I had a red face for around 4 days just like a professional peel..</li>
            <li>I never really understood what they meant by tighten pores because no product really ever did that for me</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m only 19 years old.</li>
            <li>Following my shower I use my normal facial moisturizer and makeup.</li>
            <li>A few things to note: this product does have AHA in it, and it is very important to either cover the treated areas with clothing, or wear a heavier sunblock than normal for at least a week after use.</li>
            <li>its a mess don&#x27;t care for prefer pads much easier no mess.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, and depending on how much you use it, you can get at least a month out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>this is great to get rid of all the crap accumulated under the skin, it will clear everything up.</li>
            <li>Please be careful though and maybe check your skin tolerance first before you leave it on too long and shrivel up your skin</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin looking and feeling exactly the same as any average face wash.</li>
            <li>but I still feel has given me decent results, just probably slower, as expected.</li>
            <li>Due to my very sensitive skin and rosacea, I was afraid to try any anti-aging products and stray from my beloved calming sensitive/rosacea products.  </li>
            <li>I used this product in 2-3 days my skin looked brighter the dark patches on my face faded and my skin looks much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first few days of use</li>
            <li>Its able to be used everyday so I can pamper myself everyday!</li>
            <li>Why pay 200 for one single product that was developed by doctor</li>
            <li>I think the product is a little too abrasive for acne prone skin even with gentle rubbing.   </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I asked my doctor for his opinion on the best skin care products for me-</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after using this!</li>
            <li> It worked best with the brush to create the warming sensation.  </li>
            <li> The warmth is wonderfully soothing, but I wonder if it is a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Its great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> it would have been perfect</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!!  </li>
            <li> Best of all, it does not sting or burn, and does not aggravate my rosacea or sensitivity at all.  </li>

            <li> the warming effect glad i did auto ship on this</li>
            <li> What I Love about Olay product&#x27;s is that it works so well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I Love how this Olay product works for my skin and</li>

            <li> This stuff is so fantastic!</li>

            <li> So many people freak out when the zits arrive and give up when they start using this product because of it.</li>
            <li> Point being, I didn&#x27;t see myself using this TWICE a day forever :)</li>
            <li> Point being, I didn&#x27;t see myself using this TWICE a day forever :)</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> but my face is still getting brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li> and I can really say that I am happy with the results I am getting.</li>
            <li> I love all of their products .  </li>
            <li> I find that glycolic acid does wonders for the texture (and tone) of my skin, so I purchased this peel (which is more so a scrub)</li>
            <li> and I just love the way my face feels each morning after using it.</li>
            <li> and I tried it &amp; fell in love..</li>

            <li> We love this.</li>
            <li> have ordered many times.  </li>

            <li> I love the warm feeling; It makes your face super clean.</li>
            <li> first it turns warm, then refreshing.</li>
            <li> At $12 it is a good value, at $30, not so much.</li>
            <li> You have to use a great deal of water to get the warming effect, which dries quickly and becomes very sticky.  </li>
            <li> I use this with other Olay products and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Easy addition to skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten all sorts of compliments and comments from friends and strangers alike about how good my skin looks - I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> Helps keep your face clean and clear and it feels great too</li>
            <li> I have clean, radiant, smooth skin that looks so healthy after I use this.</li>
            <li> Yes I still have my fine lines, wrinkles, etc</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and it has improved the clearness and smoothness of my skin tremendously!  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed a huge change in my wrinkles</li>
            <li> ... but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> The price on here at $12-13 is cheap.  </li>
            <li> But really, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked this line so much</li>
            <li> but I am happy with the product overall and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever had smooth beatiful skin</li>
            <li> if could lightly peel my skin off..</li>
            <li> I use it Thermal Mini-Peel every daily and works great on my face.</li>
            <li> Feels warm on the skin, feels very spa like.</li>
            <li> so decided to see if it was still available online to order or had been discontinued..  </li>
            <li> not help with discoloration but still does wonders to smooth your skin.</li>
            <li> , it was a great price here on  amazon, I will definitely continue to buy.</li>

            <li> It leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> It will also help keep you skin free of acne.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I love many of Oil of Olay Regenerist products, but really don&#x27;t like the smell of this.</li>
            <li> So nice to have a warm facial before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Really makes my face feel clean and fresh, followed by a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel fresh clean love</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle of this product and am about to begin my second tube, and have noticed very good results already.</li>
            <li> and I have very fine lines in certain areas of my face and would like to freshen &amp; smooth the appearance of my skin without any irritation.</li>
            <li> clean, exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite know what I was expecting, but this facial cleaner was quite amazing!</li>
            <li> The heat and tiny crystals that scrub your skin make a remarkable combination.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, it works and I love the entire line of Olay Regenerist.  </li>
            <li> is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love that even when using cold water, the product turns very warm and feels great on the face.  </li>
            <li> I love how it heats up nicely just enough where it&#x27;s not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> THAT THE HEAT WILL HELP CLEAN ANY PORES.  </li>
            <li> It Makes my skin feel super smooth and pampered,</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and refreshed after each use.</li>
            <li> thi product is a very deep cleanser and between the warmth and the exfoliating bits, it feels so good on your face.</li>
            <li> big pores,sporadic acne - helps to give you a clearer, brighter complection-and helps with the texture of your skin-it also feels good -a must buy.</li>
            <li> This is a good scrub and it has helped my pregnancy acne immensely.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical but was looking for a more gentle scrub to use more often</li>
            <li> I love the warming feature, and it really gets out my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, Amazon sells this at a much cheaper price than the store.</li>
            <li> People with better skin than mine probably see more dramatic results but I am happy with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best products I have used in a long time !!  </li>
            <li> I have used other Olay products and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems.</li>
            <li> In combination with other Olay Regenerist porducts, this makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Not to harsh,  but not like nothing is in the product.. Cleans off great and leaves my skin super smooth..</li>
            <li> - I had to come back and give this product an extra star to make a perfect 5 star product.</li>
            <li> thinking it was just an over the counter mild product...</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in several local stores so was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the nice warm feeling and any dry or loose skin is removed easily.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, but liked it better when it was $12.99 a bottle less than a year ago, then</li>
            <li> I do not have great skin to start with and have many issues such as discoloration, fine lines and wrinkles and some slight acne scarring.</li>
            <li> and I like it because it does make my skin really moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I used to fork over $100+ for fancy peels and facials but this stuff completely replaced all that :)</li>
            <li> I can see my skin getting softer, smoother and more clear.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it because now I know I am not missing anything if I don&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Keeps your face clear :)</li>
            <li> The results are worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My skin has stayed very clear and bright and it&#x27;s really hard not to keep touching my face because it&#x27;s so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> but this is clearing them right up</li>
            <li> this is the first product that has really helped smooth the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> The Olay Mini Peel helps to smooth off the dry patches and my skin does look better.</li>
            <li> I splash my face with warm water, rub in a dab of the Neutrogena all over my face, then put on a generous dab of the Olay scrub &amp; gently scrub my whole face, staying clear of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> so I only leave it on a couple of minutes, then rinse and apply a light moisturizer with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;Never experienced any redness or any sort of other discomfort.</li>
            <li> have olive combination skin that is prone to discoloration from acne, and while the results of this product don&#x27;t quite equate to a micro/vibra-derm procedure, it certainly gets close!</li>
            <li> It really heats up in the water and I am sure it does a really deep clean.</li>
            <li> I liked this product it did work to heat up on my skin and then dry up my skin and then shed my skin like a snake.</li>
            <li> This is such a great daily treatment!</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower and it gives and nice warm feeling to my face while scrubbing away old dead skin cells!  </li>
            <li> I trust this brand very much and when I found this I jumped on it.</li>
            <li> Quick and visible results of brightening, smoothing, and overall glow that you get after a good facial, exfoliation, or enzyme mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed how soft and supple my skin has become and it really gets my face clean!</li>
            <li> I know this product sounds really tempting!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The &#x27;thermal&#x27; part of it is pretty neat-</li>
            <li> started out using it twice daily, but more often than not anymore</li>
            <li> This product is very soothing and warm to the skin, I will continu using as long as possible.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> altho I will say that olay does need to have more directions on the back.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to make my skin as smooth and clear as this.</li>
            <li> overall seems to work better.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and I have a much more even tone.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to use the peel in the shower, it seems to get warmer and last longer that way.</li>
            <li> Like I already said, the warming feature is pretty neat, too.</li>
            <li> Also, it only warms for maybe six seconds-even if I add more water.</li>
            <li> I love using this - its like a mini facial!</li>
            <li> The whole Regenerist line has been like a miracle for my skin!</li>
            <li> After you rinse your skin will feel so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> The smooth, soft, clearer skin IS revealed AND people do notice you&#x27;re doing something different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this price to be significantly better than my local WallyMart store.  </li>
            <li> This is my first criteria for any product.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I am hooked.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Like having a facial massage every day :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really comparable to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; facial, but for maintenance it does a pretty great job.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this could lightly peel off my skin to help even out my skin tone but that didnt happen.. but its a really good scrub, non irritating even if you rub your face for 1-2 minutes..</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and soft after use.  </li>
            <li> Makes the face skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African- American with fair completion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a great product but its just not good for sensitive/acne skin.  </li>
            <li> And it really does heat up on the first application.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li> A word of warning, however...if you use this product at night before bed make sure you wash it off completely because it will take the color right out of your pillow case (similar to what bleach will do, yikes)!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very mild, and does not linger on the skin for very long after it has been washed off, which is important for anyone sensitive to the smell of perfumes in their products.   </li>
            <li> This is a very a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> This Peel removes all the dead skin on your face and will be as effective when you get to the end of the tube as it was when you first opened it.</li>
            <li> is for me a certain no buy again.</li>
            <li> Much more economical than previous product I was buying from MK cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Still not sure why it&#x27;s referred to as a peel, it is more like an exfoliate, but really feels like a nice facial treatment.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it&#x27;s helping to clear up my active acne!</li>
            <li> the heating action is great in the shower and it really cleans out the pores while there open and if feels like your getting a mini facial every morning,  it is normally 22-25 dollars at Walmart and walgreens</li>
            <li> This adds up to a pretty decent amount of savings versus buying it in the store.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the product very highly.</li>
            <li> After only one week of use I have noticed a huge improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many things and spent so much money over the years.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very problematic skin.</li>
            <li> It works really well, so I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> so when I bought this I didn&#x27;t read the directions to much and exfoliated for 4-5 min.....</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use too much water at one time</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Over the course of a month, I noticed that my arms and hands looked and felt much smoother and youthful.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> When I was growing up, I was fortunate to escape teenage acne.  </li>
            <li> then you absolutely need this.</li>
            <li> This is the one product that removes all of that FAST..</li>
            <li> BUT I have very tolerant skin).</li>
            <li> and you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> when I use the Thermal peel on my face it heats up and using circular motions with my finger tips, gently scrubs my skin.</li>
            <li> I think this product is too much to spend for people my age.</li>
            <li> I thought its quite unusual.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it gives your skin a gentle warming sensation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After removing ALL makeup and REALLY cleaning the face and neck, use this product according to directions, adding water to reactivate the thermal properties a couple times (I do it 3 times).</li>
            <li> I use it daily and really enjoy the heating sensation it gives.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Like a real spa treatment.</li>
            <li> I never, never spend this much on cleansers for myself.</li>
            <li> This really does make my skin smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I have real oily skin and this has helped a lot to control it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week and my skin feels so soft and fresh afterward.</li>
            <li> It hasnt really made a difference yet, but we&#x27;ll see with longer use of the product.</li>
            <li> I really think it improves the texture of my skin and pores.  </li>
            <li> I actually really like this product.</li>
            <li> much* cleaner and clearer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if I have a breakout and use this it is significantly reduced by the following day.</li>
            <li> Normally Walmart would beat Amazon&#x27;s price BUT NOT THIS TIME!</li>
            <li> It has only been a week and my skin is significantly smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this and use it every other day in my skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li> Old scars from my chest are pretty much gone now too.</li>
            <li> Not sure I really saw any improvement in my skin, but it feels nice.  </li>
            <li> have combination skin &amp; an oily t-zone &amp; like to use salicylic acid to keep my pores clean &amp; occasional zits away.  </li>
            <li> I have already been using this product for the past 1.5 years and feel an amazing difference in the skin texture.</li>
            <li> It scrubs nicely and it does heat up, but I cannot get over the TWO parabens, the red 33, and blue 1.I personally don&#x27;t mind spending a bit more on my daily face routine and having all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> so an so when u have better for less.</li>
            <li> To be fair, my face glows everyday regardless but it was extra glowy when I used this.</li>
            <li> Also I love facial scrubs, especially ones that are warming.</li>
            <li> After the next week, the tan areas had begun to fade, and the mild keratosis pilaris on my arms had also begun to lessen.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product and helps get that younger look by peeling away the dead and build up skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for the past three months and see and feel a remarkable difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I had a time finding a decent scrub for my face that would help with the breakouts I am still getting in my 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and find it gentle and luxurious.</li>
            <li> If I get my face wet with hot water, put on the mask and leave it for a couple minutes, my skin is totally soft and smooth when I rinse it.</li>
            <li> Off with the old and on with the new...good for sensitive skin...you can feel,the difference right away...</li>
            <li> It is also selling at a very reasonable price, compared to major retail stores.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for aging skin that still gets blemishes.</li>
            <li> but still, a highly recommended scrub, not a peel off :</li>
            <li> Pair it with any microdermabrasion kit for some real deal results comparable to a professional peel.</li>
            <li> I have melesma my skin is very sun sensitive and prone to tanning.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, I love this peel.</li>
            <li> By removing the dead skin cells, it also helps to make your foundation go on more evenly as well.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see that my pores are less noticable and overall my skin feels &amp; looks more even and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product &amp; will re-order although a little goes a long way with the product.</li>
            <li> Looked used, but represented as new.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even put on moisturizer, let your skin soak the residue in and adjust to the NEW SKIN SHERIFF in-town over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not use other exfoliating products on the areas I use the mini-peel on, and I use a very light moisturizer only at night.</li>
            <li> I also had a few areas that were rough and lightly discolored that I wanted to smooth out.</li>
            <li> However, I gave it 3 stars because it leaves my skin feeling wonderful - until the flare up :(</li>
            <li> is the first product which has given me instant results</li>
            <li> After the first 7 days, I used it only in the evenings on weekdays and twice a day on weekends.</li>
            <li> If you do not, you are at a higher risk of sunburn, which is important to keep in mind if you have very pale or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see if it helps with the redness/scarring from previous acne...</li>
            <li> Although, your face might be a little pinkish after the first use it  goes away pretty soon.</li>
            <li> As it heats, it only does that for a short period of time, making it calm the fact that it soothes the sensation out, not burning.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> Not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and softer, and I haven&#x27;t developed any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Anyway I&#x27;m use to professional products</li>
            <li> In fact, I have an Oil of Olay Professional X product which is practically identical to this Regenerist \\&quot;mini-peel\\&quot; and it never describes itself as a peel.  </li>
            <li> but this product has made the pores on my face smaller, it has gotten rid of the blackheads I had on my nose, my face is so much smoother now.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to present day</li>
            <li> but so far, this is working wonders for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend for those who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I never had to wear make-up and was blessed to be frequently complimented on my &amp;#34;perfect porcelain&amp;#34; skin.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, I had to try this</li>
            <li> I do that a couple times before I completely rinse it off.</li>
            <li> The pattern/print on the tube wasn&#x27;t complete.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Its kinda grey in color and it has a slightly funny smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the old acne marks fading too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe Cher until I tried this, and realized that HOLY MOSES, I really CAN turn back time ! ! !  </li>
            <li> My flaky, oily, sensitive, middle-aged skin looks like a million bucks after I use this.  </li>
            <li> I use this product every morning and my skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can make your skin sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li> like I had a professional mini-facial.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> : this was ok on few days of use but my skin reacted if used in a daily basis.</li>
            <li> and it is slowly but surely working I am also using this with a Hydroquinone Moisturizer</li>
            <li> I use this about every other day (I cleanse with origins checks &amp; balances first which I highly recommend) since using this product</li>
            <li> Great way to exfoliate, without being to hard on older skin--I am in my late 60s.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research, I decided to try this peel because I read that other reviewers with sensitive skin also had success.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers note that they couldn&#x27;t sense any re-warming of the product when they re-wet it, and I find that it is definitely less noticeable if you&#x27;re really scrubbing your face hard because your face will feel warm from that alone, and so any heat that the product puts off becomes negligible in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Serious business, you will need an SPF of 75 or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the peel 3 different times and every time I had a pretty substantial break out the next day.</li>
            <li> A friend had me try her very popular Clarisonic Brush ($200), and I think the Thermal Mini-Peel is at least as effective --and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a very long time &amp; love it but, everyonce in a while I receive a tube that is completely dried up &amp; will not come out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very mild facial scrub like experience without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> Something I have had problems with for so long is discolouration and it really made my skin Tone Even.</li>
            <li> but I can attest that this stuff seems to open the pores and ensure your dull skin is scrubbed away to reveal a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> at one time and lets your new younger silkier skin shine through.</li>
            <li> Gentle scrub removes dead skin, leaves skin soft and smooth, wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I used to have very acne prone skin with dry peeling areas too.</li>
            <li> It has a grainy texture and I scrub gently until it starts to get dry and then dampen my fingers to &#x27;reactivate&#x27; the warming and scrub again.</li>
            <li> The grit in this is gentle enough to use twice a day on my skin but some people may only like it one time per day.  </li>
            <li> it a try but don&#x27;t expect big results for at least a week &amp; more like 2 weeks to a month.</li>
            <li> so maybe I won&#x27;t scrub so hard there, but it was fine everywhere else</li>
            <li> I have major discolaration on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> However, I have very sensitive skin that makes it difficult to find suitable products for.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying it as a single purchase first, then moving to subscribe and save ordering to save money if you are going to keep using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> just pulled so tight it was shriveled and took a whole day and tons of moisturizer to return to it&#x27;s normal elastic self.</li>
            <li> I think my breakouts are starting to clear up too</li>
            <li> Really helps get rid of rough skin.</li>
            <li> It not only cleans, but removes old skin.  </li>
            <li> I had a red face for around 4 days just like a professional peel..</li>
            <li> I never really understood what they meant by tighten pores because no product really ever did that for me</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m only 19 years old.</li>
            <li> Following my shower I use my normal facial moisturizer and makeup.</li>
            <li> A few things to note: this product does have AHA in it, and it is very important to either cover the treated areas with clothing, or wear a heavier sunblock than normal for at least a week after use.</li>
            <li> its a mess don&#x27;t care for prefer pads much easier no mess.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, and depending on how much you use it, you can get at least a month out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> this is great to get rid of all the crap accumulated under the skin, it will clear everything up.</li>
            <li> Please be careful though and maybe check your skin tolerance first before you leave it on too long and shrivel up your skin</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin looking and feeling exactly the same as any average face wash.</li>
            <li> but I still feel has given me decent results, just probably slower, as expected.</li>
            <li> Due to my very sensitive skin and rosacea, I was afraid to try any anti-aging products and stray from my beloved calming sensitive/rosacea products.  </li>
            <li> I used this product in 2-3 days my skin looked brighter the dark patches on my face faded and my skin looks much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few days of use</li>
            <li> Its able to be used everyday so I can pamper myself everyday!</li>
            <li> Why pay 200 for one single product that was developed by doctor</li>
            <li> I think the product is a little too abrasive for acne prone skin even with gentle rubbing.   </li>
            <li> I have seen far fewer breakouts from the KP than with any other product I have tried, which was a big surprise.</li>
            <li> Starting to clear my black heads away..</li>
            <li> After you have let your peel set in when you wash your face it will just rinse all of that dead skin right down the sink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use much on my face, and thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using this for as long as I can and saving money at the same time!</li>
            <li> I pea sized amount is all you need so the tube lasts quite a long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> In one week, my acne scars were fading pretty slowly, and still are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far no results not even a slight chance</li>
            <li> It has become increasily harder to find and much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I really like to spend the time to get at least 3 thermal re-activations per treatment</li>
            <li> If you guys are wondering what type of skin I have; I am a African American with really dark and oily skin around my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li> but I wont buy this again for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my skin is holding up well as I turn into a withered old lady.</li>
            <li> I like this product a like being using it for a  long time  would recommend this to everyone  </li>
            <li> I started breaking out horribly since getting pregnant and most acne fighters (salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide) are prohibited during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I am 24 with acne prone skin, and this along with the entire Regenerist line is fixing my skin unlike any other product line I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If I had any dry areas on my face, they disappeared after using this.</li>
            <li> I am a Retin A user and get the dry scaly patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I got some dry, patchy places on my forehead that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> No complicated steps, doesn&#x27;t burn and after a few uses you&#x27;ll notice small changes.</li>
            <li> Most of the skin care products I buy are worthless, but this one leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t exfoliate that long and Read directions!!</li>
            <li> Now, I only get an occasional small pimple.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, if your someone who knows you have very sensitive skin, do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY!  </li>
            <li> Be very careful to use sunscreen when you go out for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> So far, I have been using this every other day now for the past week and no problems with my skin that could be associated with this product.</li>
            <li> and I have clogged pores all over my chin, nose, and cheeks  thus resulting in rough skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday at night after I wash my face with olay facial foam cleanser..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to use it until the tube is empty  </li>
            <li> so be careful using it in the summer.  </li>
            <li> so I prefer to only use it every other day or every few days...which is not as directed</li>
            <li> Well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this to augment my face-washing regimen since the other one was not working the way I expected it.  </li>
            <li> I will provide an update in due time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yea, not exactly.  </li>
            <li> I began using it just once every other day for a week to test for irritation.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face smoother than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> As with all the other Olay products I&#x27;ve tried, I got this because my mom recommended it.</li>
            <li> I like this, but not sure how much it actually does.</li>
            <li> I got this when I needed to switch up a lot of my beauty products due to pregnancy.</li>
            <li> So when I use this Olay scrub, I use my usual cleanser at the same time</li>
            <li> It does not have a drying effect which I feared it might due to the warming effect.</li>
            <li> I apply this about every other day after using an Olay Regenerist cleanser.</li>
            <li> I wet my face down and put some on my cheeks and forehead</li>
            <li> I leave it on for a few minutes or until dry, then I wash my face with Luke-warm water.  </li>
            <li> I used SPF 50 one day at the pool and came out a little pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties and still get occasional bouts of cystic acne on my chin</li>
            <li> becuase it was recommended for some dark spots that I have.</li>
            <li> However, in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s, I developed acne on my chin, rosacea on my cheeks, and also noticed a lot of dulling and poor cell turnover.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still seeing results, it may have slowed down</li>
            <li> If you have the patience to work through the breakouts that it may give you then the results are endless!</li>
            <li> skin is smoother, softer, clearer with LESS whiteheads, blackheads, zits than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> ther, softer, clearer with LESS whiteheads, blackheads, zits than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 and a half weeks</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up and I&#x27;ve also notice less scarring.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a typical cleanser to me.</li>
            <li> They were minor and hard to see.</li>
            <li> I like to use a little on the tops of my shoulders as well as my face.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it made me breakout a little by my mouth</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price!</li>
            <li> but my skin is somewhat smoother and has a little glow to it.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about the sun warning on the peel</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BIT.  </li>
            <li> I am going to continue using and see how my skin looks and feels after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Use it a few times a week for my face.</li>
            <li> No improvement after one month&#x27;s use, wasted $16.00</li>
            <li> Used once a day, it lasts for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times but as it was $15+ a bottle I didn&#x27;t use it often.</li>
            <li> It is messy, so I used it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I use it every night to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I will be updating in a few weeks to let know if it did help with the discolaration or not.</li>
            <li> You can use the product everyday, and after a week it will look like you went and got a microdermabrasion at the salon.</li>
            <li> Even the brown spots  slowly faded without other \\&quot;potions\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Even the brown spots  slowly faded without other \\&quot;potions\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and a few small blemishes,</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a remedy for wrinkles per say</li>
            <li> Made my face feel smoother than usual</li>
            <li> Not sure what that was about</li>
            <li> I usually give the Oil of Olay products 5 stars, but this is not one of them.  </li>
            <li> (I usually don&#x27;t burn at all)</li>
            <li> used it twice a day and on weekdays apply all my usual moisturizer w/SPF and makeup.</li>
            <li> so rushed mornings usually aren&#x27;t conducive to</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 2 or three times per week in place of usual cleanser.</li>
            <li> Any little random scar or mark was gone in a few weeks because I used this everyday.</li>
            <li> Other than that, nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> But even so, it&#x27;s still hard to get off your face.  </li>
            <li> The only con is the smell - a little musky but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Also here on amazon is always at least $5 cheaper then the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I put on a TON of moisturizer afterward and have not had any irritation or negative effects.</li>
            <li> IF running late, I skipped the morning Mini-Peel treatment</li>
            <li> I even forced my boyfriend to try it</li>
            <li> If you use Retin A and have been getting that creepy, scaly, alligator dead skin that just hangs around well</li>
            <li> It was very hard to treat.</li>
            <li> Even so, I have noticed zero difference in my face and am getting broken out again.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I have not experienced a lot of dryness or peeling.   </li>
            <li> I think this product mway have broken me out.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE that I will not leave behind.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Olay because I wanted something to cleanse my skin, without burning it out, or irritating it.</li>
            <li> And it sounds like a lot of people have broken out.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin prone to pimples and cysts on my cheeks and chin + the brown spots those things leave behind.</li>
            <li> and already I see a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> It leaves a weird film on my skin unless I turn around and scrub my face with something else.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> The Olay people were crazy to discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry feel disappointed what a loss want try this again give it 2 star for the warmath</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> I use this 1-2 times a week and have never had bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s discontinued :-(  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all time WORST.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this every day.  Leaves face clean, exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It made my skin tone even. Something I have had problems with for so long is discolouration and it really made my skin Tone Even. Love it and would recommend to anY one.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, I love this peel.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this \\&quot;mini-peel\\&quot; is it leaves my skin very smooth. The product feels warm going on my face for 3 seconds and then goes away. I have sensitive skin and I am prone to occasional break-outs. So far, I have been using this every other day now for the past week and no problems with my skin that could be associated with this product. I am going to continue using and see how my skin looks and feels after a few weeks of use. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and I have very fine lines in certain areas of my face and would like to freshen &amp; smooth the appearance of my skin without any irritation. The product has a nice light smell as well... I will provide an update in due time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edited 9/2/11 - I had to come back and give this product an extra star to make a perfect 5 star product. I have noticed how soft and supple my skin has become and it really gets my face clean! I like to use a little on the tops of my shoulders as well as my face. The heat and tiny crystals that scrub your skin make a remarkable combination. I am not sure if this is a remedy for wrinkles per say but I can attest that this stuff seems to open the pores and ensure your dull skin is scrubbed away to reveal a more youthful appearance. Great stuff! A++</li>
            <li> It does get warm, but does nothing for my skin</li>
            <li> thi product is a very deep cleanser and between the warmth and the exfoliating bits, it feels so good on your face. also it smells pretty good too! its amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for serval months and have seen a noticeable difference in my skins overall texture. I use this about every other day (I cleanse with origins checks &amp; balances first which I highly recommend) since using this product my skin has become smoother and it&#x27;s even helped with redness/skin tone evening. I follow up with the Clinique dramatically different gel. Also here on amazon is always at least $5 cheaper then the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I purchased this product.  It&#x27;s made my skin feel softer, and my makeup goes on smoother.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Use it a few times a week for my face. Alternate days with another cleanser. What it&#x27;s as good for, maybe even better, is elbows, knees and feet. Really helps get rid of rough skin. Especially good on the knees and elbows if you use a self tanner to avoid dark patches.</li>
            <li> so far so good! Would buy again</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I don&#x27;t usually use much on my face, and thought I would give this a try.  After using for a week, I love the way this makes my face feel AND look!</li>
            <li> Have been using for years and love the way it feels on my face</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> The gave me milia that I cannot get rid of.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  It not only cleans, but removes old skin.  The heat is unique and feels good.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my face</li>
            <li> I have very problematic skin. I&#x27;m in my late twenties and still get occasional bouts of cystic acne on my chin and I have clogged pores all over my chin, nose, and cheeks  thus resulting in rough skin...this is the first product that has really helped smooth the appearance of my skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> I do like this peel. It does help my complexion, including helping my acne scars fade. It has helped my pores become smaller and it defintely makes your skin softer. I use it every day and have had no adverse effects. A word of warning, however...if you use this product at night before bed make sure you wash it off completely because it will take the color right out of your pillow case (similar to what bleach will do, yikes)! Iwould recommend this product. I plan on continuing to use it. It is worth the money you pay for it. Does anyone know of any good eye cream/serum (anti-age) for senstive skin?</li>
            <li> It scrubs nicely and it does heat up, but I cannot get over the TWO parabens, the red 33, and blue 1.I personally don&#x27;t mind spending a bit more on my daily face routine and having all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very nice, warm, and relaxing. Not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> i will purchase this product again. i recommend using it in the shower. its easy to use, smells nice and leaves my face feeling clean without any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Made my face feel smoother than usual</li>
            <li> How could Olay advertised this as &amp;#34;Mini-peel&amp;#34;?? No peeling there,  It&#x27;s just a facial scrub!!&lt;br /&gt; No improvement after one month&#x27;s use, wasted $16.00</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this. It gets nice and warm upon appling water and leaves your skin feeling like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> Great product. Lessens fine lines and brightens face over time would recommend a nice moisture surge product after every use to maximize effects</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Makes my skin feel so nice.  I used it all the time but its $22 or more in the pharmacy.  The price on here at $12-13 is cheap.  I did notice that it made me breakout a little by my mouth so maybe I won&#x27;t scrub so hard there, but it was fine everywhere else and the breakout went away.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ..will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I love this product! Warms up pleasantly when water is added. It gives a very mild facial scrub like experience without being too harsh. I have very sensitive skin and find it gentle and luxurious. I will definitely stock up on this stuff!</li>
            <li> I asked my doctor for his opinion on the best skin care products for me- he suggested Olay and I threw out all the Avon and Mary K- I love all the Olay products</li>
            <li> This product is very nice because it is one step.  I wash my face, then use it.  I love the nice warm feeling and any dry or loose skin is removed easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Regenerist Thermal Mini-Peel for 2 months, and it is making a visible difference on my face.  My skin is smoother and softer, and I haven&#x27;t developed any breakouts.  The pores on my nose have cleared.  Very easy to use in the shower each morning, as suggested.    A friend had me try her very popular Clarisonic Brush ($200), and I think the Thermal Mini-Peel is at least as effective --and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I love many of Oil of Olay Regenerist products, but really don&#x27;t like the smell of this. It works really well, so I gave it 3 stars. I prefer the Oil of Olay 2 step mini peel that smells like papaya.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Super easy to use in the shower and makes your face feel great afterwards. Used once a day, it lasts for a few months. Much more economical than previous product I was buying from MK cosmetics. I will continue using this for as long as I can and saving money at the same time!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about two months ago and am happy with the results. I have oily skin so I prefer to only use it every other day or every few days...which is not as directed but I still feel has given me decent results, just probably slower, as expected. My pores are definitely clearer and some of my old pink spots are diminished. My skin feels great after using this! I love how it heats up nicely just enough where it&#x27;s not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;I use Olay regenerist facial cleanser daily and I do cleanse my face before using this. Still not sure why it&#x27;s referred to as a peel, it is more like an exfoliate, but really feels like a nice facial treatment. My only complaint is the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. I have acne and was using the Neutrogena peel to improve my skin tone and acne scars. I decided to give the Regenerist Mini-Peel a try to save money. The tube was a larger size for the same price.  I&#x27;ve tried the peel 3 different times and every time I had a pretty substantial break out the next day. I think the product is a little too abrasive for acne prone skin even with gentle rubbing.   I have used other Olay products and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems. Maybe there should be a warning on the packaging that it shouldn&#x27;t be used on skin prone to acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and look 17, need I say more?! :) But really, this stuff is amazing. Pair it with any microdermabrasion kit for some real deal results comparable to a professional peel. I used to fork over $100+ for fancy peels and facials but this stuff completely replaced all that :)</li>
            <li> I never write reviews although I should more.. Anyway I&#x27;m use to professional products so when I bought this I didn&#x27;t read the directions to much and exfoliated for 4-5 min.....thinking it was just an over the counter mild product... I had a red face for around 4 days just like a professional peel.. It was too much but my skin looks great now....Just don&#x27;t exfoliate that long and Read directions!! Lol.... Blessings</li>
            <li> Well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this to augment my face-washing regimen since the other one was not working the way I expected it.  Well, I don&#x27;t find that it works.  You have to use a great deal to get the warming effect, which is very sticky.  You have to use a great deal of water to get the warming effect, which dries quickly and becomes very sticky.  You can&#x27;t use too much water at one time otherwise it will wash it off your face.  But even so, it&#x27;s still hard to get off your face.  I tried doing it with just my fingers, with the Pro-X brush and the Pro-X exfoliating head.  It worked best with the brush to create the warming sensation.  Even so, I have noticed zero difference in my face and am getting broken out again.  I&#x27;m probably going to ask for my money back, which Olay will do if you request it.</li>
            <li> The warmth is wonderfully soothing, but I wonder if it is a gimmick. It lasts such a short time... Overall, it cleanses my face, so I am content.</li>
            <li> Gentle scrub removes dead skin, leaves skin soft and smooth, wrinkles less noticeable.  Works great on my acne prone skin. Clears acne!! Actually heals breakouts faster. I use another wash to help remove makeup, then the scrub, followed by the olay moisturizer and my skin feels like silk. I used to have very acne prone skin with dry peeling areas too. It was very hard to treat. But now I love my skin!!</li>
            <li> To be fair, my face glows everyday regardless but it was extra glowy when I used this. If I had any dry areas on my face, they disappeared after using this. Also I love facial scrubs, especially ones that are warming. I used this in the shower and used some on my chest too. Any little random scar or mark was gone in a few weeks because I used this everyday. Old scars from my chest are pretty much gone now too. That&#x27;s a fringe benefit I did not expect.</li>
            <li> I know this product sounds really tempting!  And it is, a glycolic peel that&#x27;ll make my skin appear younger and fresher in one use all in a tube that I can buy over the counter and make my day?!!?  Yea, not exactly.  Seriously, if your someone who knows you have very sensitive skin, do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY!  Having said that, I know you&#x27;ll probably try it anyway cause thats what I did but damn I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s probably a great product but its just not good for sensitive/acne skin.  Just not.  Move on....</li>
            <li> I &#x27;like&#x27; this product because, it does do what it does. As it heats, it only does that for a short period of time, making it calm the fact that it soothes the sensation out, not burning. The exfoliating crystals feel good, and I keep scrubbing for 1-2 minutes and keep it on for 30 more seconds- thus rinse is where it comes in! The results are noticeable, but you will start to feel the smoothness texture of your skin in one use. In one week, my acne scars were fading pretty slowly, and still are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this scrub at night, I suggest a nice vitamin C cream, or serum. Your face will look glowing and radiant in the morning- trust me. Make sure you limit your sun exposure!</li>
            <li> I have been using for about 1 and 1/2 weeks. I look forward to using it every night. I can see my skin getting softer, smoother and more clear. I am using along with the Olay Regenerist Pore Detox cleanser. I have oily skin and used to have blemishes but this is clearing them right up and my skin is looking great. I liked this line so much I did a mini facial on my husband with the cleanser and this mini peel and he liked it as well. I did get some red spots the 2nd day I used it. They were minor and hard to see. Not sure what that was about but I am happy with the product overall and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I usually give the Oil of Olay products 5 stars, but this is not one of them.  I thought that this product would be a mini-peel, but all that it was was a \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; which one could get from any number of products.  In fact, I have an Oil of Olay Professional X product which is practically identical to this Regenerist \\&quot;mini-peel\\&quot; and it never describes itself as a peel.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub!  I use it every morning and it has improved the clearness and smoothness of my skin tremendously!  Highly recommended for aging skin that still gets blemishes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! I haven&#x27;t ever had smooth beatiful skin but this product has made the pores on my face smaller, it has gotten rid of the blackheads I had on my nose, my face is so much smoother now. I love to apply it with my Clarisonic because it heats up and feels great! I would highly recommend this! It&#x27;s cheaper to buy on Amazon than at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle of this product and am about to begin my second tube, and have noticed very good results already. The price is reasonable, and depending on how much you use it, you can get at least a month out of the bottle. I would recommend trying it as a single purchase first, then moving to subscribe and save ordering to save money if you are going to keep using it on a regular basis. This adds up to a pretty decent amount of savings versus buying it in the store.  My purchase of this product was prompted by a desire to help reduce or remove fading tan lines from a sunburn. I also had a few areas that were rough and lightly discolored that I wanted to smooth out. However, I have very sensitive skin that makes it difficult to find suitable products for. I began using it just once every other day for a week to test for irritation. When none occurred, I moved to once daily for a week, then twice daily every day after that. I do not use other exfoliating products on the areas I use the mini-peel on, and I use a very light moisturizer only at night. As a result, I have not experienced a lot of dryness or peeling.   The first few days of use I did not notice a change but at the end of the week I noticed that my arms and hands were smoother. After the next week, the tan areas had begun to fade, and the mild keratosis pilaris on my arms had also begun to lessen. Over the course of a month, I noticed that my arms and hands looked and felt much smoother and youthful. I have seen far fewer breakouts from the KP than with any other product I have tried, which was a big surprise. The product does not feel as warm as claimed, but it still does its job as advertised. The fragrance is very mild, and does not linger on the skin for very long after it has been washed off, which is important for anyone sensitive to the smell of perfumes in their products.   A few things to note: this product does have AHA in it, and it is very important to either cover the treated areas with clothing, or wear a heavier sunblock than normal for at least a week after use. If you use this product every day, always keep the affected areas well covered. If you do not, you are at a higher risk of sunburn, which is important to keep in mind if you have very pale or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Use all of the products. My skin is so soft and complexion is beautiful.</li>
            <li> like the way it feels</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It really heats up in the water and I am sure it does a really deep clean. I have not used it on my face yet, I use it on my back. Every time I use it the spots on my back start clearing up within days. Its great!</li>
            <li> I noticed a visi9ble difference from the start! I&#x27;m 43..big pores,sporadic acne - helps to give you a clearer, brighter complection-and helps with the texture of your skin-it also feels good -a must buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years and I love it! I will keep using the Regenerist line. Seems to work for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I never really understood what they meant by tighten pores because no product really ever did that for me but I can actually see the difference with this product! It leaves my face smoother than any other product I have ever used. And it really does heat up on the first application.</li>
            <li> My mom started using this about 5-7 years ago. I tried it a few times but as it was $15+ a bottle I didn&#x27;t use it often. Fast forward to present day, I have my own house now and as I am in my thirties I notice that my skin in changing. So I ordered this from Amazon as they had the lowest price. I love the warming feeling and the exfoliation. Its able to be used everyday so I can pamper myself everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days and already I see a dramatic difference. My skin is softer and brighter. Most importantly, it&#x27;s helping to clear up my active acne! (I&#x27;m 31 and have struggled with cystic acne all my life.) I&#x27;m excited to see if it helps with the redness/scarring from previous acne...but so far, this is working wonders for my complexion. And the heat-activated formula feels heavenly!</li>
            <li> I think this product mway have broken me out. However, I gave it 3 stars because it leaves my skin feeling wonderful - until the flare up :( I&#x27;d recommend for those who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Couldn&#x27;t find it in several local stores so was very happy to find it on Amazon. Really makes my face feel clean and fresh, followed by a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this could lightly peel off my skin to help even out my skin tone but that didnt happen.. but its a really good scrub, non irritating even if you rub your face for 1-2 minutes..and you can feel that all impurities was lifted.. ive been using this for almost a month now and I use it everyday at night after I wash my face with olay facial foam cleanser.. my skin did brighten, I noticed that it lessen my whiteheads and my skin is smoother.. its really good as a scrub and I love using it.. it would have been perfect it if could lightly peel my skin off.. I think the percentage of glycolic acid is not enough.. but still, a highly recommended scrub, not a peel off :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: this was ok on few days of use but my skin reacted if used in a daily basis. maybe once or twice a week is ok..</li>
            <li> When I was growing up, I was fortunate to escape teenage acne.  I never had to wear make-up and was blessed to be frequently complimented on my &amp;#34;perfect porcelain&amp;#34; skin.  However, in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s, I developed acne on my chin, rosacea on my cheeks, and also noticed a lot of dulling and poor cell turnover. My skin just didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; anymore in the mirror or in photos. Due to my very sensitive skin and rosacea, I was afraid to try any anti-aging products and stray from my beloved calming sensitive/rosacea products.  After a lot of research, I decided to try this peel because I read that other reviewers with sensitive skin also had success.  I LOVE IT!!!!  It has made a world of difference in my skin!  I have my glow back in the mirror and in photos, and it has helped cellular turnover so I&#x27;m not getting clogged pores or break-outs any more.  Best of all, it does not sting or burn, and does not aggravate my rosacea or sensitivity at all.  I am using it daily in place of my former cleanser.</li>
            <li> This Peel removes all the dead skin on your face and will be as effective when you get to the end of the tube as it was when you first opened it. I have graduated in my skin care routine to mostly all prescription strength creams/serums/acids but this is one drugstore MUST HAVE that I will not leave behind. If you use Retin A and have been getting that creepy, scaly, alligator dead skin that just hangs around well then you absolutely need this. This is the one product that removes all of that FAST.. at one time and lets your new younger silkier skin shine through. The key I found is to leave it on for atleast an hour (or longer I have left it on overnight BUT I have very tolerant skin). After you have let your peel set in when you wash your face it will just rinse all of that dead skin right down the sink. Please be careful though and maybe check your skin tolerance first before you leave it on too long and shrivel up your skin (yes that has happened to me) I once left it on all day and all night and the next morning my skin was left just pulled so tight it was shriveled and took a whole day and tons of moisturizer to return to it&#x27;s normal elastic self.</li>
            <li> Not sure I really saw any improvement in my skin, but it feels nice.  It is messy, so I used it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Used this for about 6 months. I used it once a month to refresh my skin. My skin has not looked this good in 10 years! I use this with other Olay products and I am very happy with the results. I put on a TON of moisturizer afterward and have not had any irritation or negative effects.</li>
            <li> As with all the other Olay products I&#x27;ve tried, I got this because my mom recommended it. She said her friends all thought she had gotten microderm abrasion or something done. Naturally, I had to try this myself!&lt;br /&gt;I have olive combination skin that is prone to discoloration from acne, and while the results of this product don&#x27;t quite equate to a micro/vibra-derm procedure, it certainly gets close! Quick and visible results of brightening, smoothing, and overall glow that you get after a good facial, exfoliation, or enzyme mask.&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;thermal&#x27; part of it is pretty neat- I wet my face down and put some on my cheeks and forehead and instantly I feel the warming sensation. It has a grainy texture and I scrub gently until it starts to get dry and then dampen my fingers to &#x27;reactivate&#x27; the warming and scrub again. I do that a couple times before I completely rinse it off. Some reviewers note that they couldn&#x27;t sense any re-warming of the product when they re-wet it, and I find that it is definitely less noticeable if you&#x27;re really scrubbing your face hard because your face will feel warm from that alone, and so any heat that the product puts off becomes negligible in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I started out using it twice daily, but more often than not anymore I just use it in the evening (using a gentler, creamy cleanser in the morning) and have had truly impressive results.&lt;br /&gt;I personally had no initial breakouts or any afterwards. My skin has stayed very clear and bright and it&#x27;s really hard not to keep touching my face because it&#x27;s so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> I have melesma my skin is very sun sensitive and prone to tanning.&lt;br /&gt;When I used this product in 2-3 days my skin looked brighter the dark patches on my face faded and my skin looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product which has given me instant results and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It works best in the shower for me .As it gets activated by water I feel the heat longer when I use it  in the shower.</li>
            <li> This product is very soothing and warm to the skin, I will continu using as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;  Shirley Clermont</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it almost since it came out. Now I find out it&#x27;s discontinued :-(  Maybe if those who like it email Olay and complain, they might reconsider.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before I bought this. It works just like it says and it&#x27;s not just for women, men can use it as well. altho I will say that olay does need to have more directions on the back. but I have been using this for about 3 weeks and you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> This did not arrive in a box.  Looked used, but represented as new.  The pattern/print on the tube wasn&#x27;t complete.  Wouldn&#x27;t reorder.  Product okay, I guess.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff... I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products and name brands. They don&#x27;t seem to make my skin as smooth and clear as this. The only thing I don&#x27;t like it when it sits for a while, towards the end of the bottle, it isn&#x27;t mixed well and is watery.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have used it for years.  Easy to use in the shower and feels good on your face</li>
            <li> Use it daily. Love the warm cleansing.</li>
            <li> I use it Thermal Mini-Peel every daily and works great on my face. I would recommend the product very highly.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product about a couple weeks ago. It does a good job of making your skin feel smooth. I do not have great skin to start with and have many issues such as discoloration, fine lines and wrinkles and some slight acne scarring. I have used many scrubs and products advertised as mini peels, etc. I feel this is one of the better products. I use it once a day. I find it works best in the shower as it gets warmer when used there and overall seems to work better. Following my shower I use my normal facial moisturizer and makeup. I am a Retin A user and get the dry scaly patches on my face. The Olay Mini Peel helps to smooth off the dry patches and my skin does look better. Yes I still have my fine lines, wrinkles, etc but my skin is somewhat smoother and has a little glow to it. I think the Olay Mini Peel does work well with the Retin A.  This is a very a decent product for the price. People with better skin than mine probably see more dramatic results but I am happy with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and with Amazon you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I used to purchase at walmart for around $20, then found Ulta carries it for $18, but Amazon won out at $15.  I use this every day in the shower and always get complements on my skin.  One bottle lasts me about 2 months.  Also like that it heats up when you use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff; my skin feels &amp; looks fabulous</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have mixed, acne-prone skin and I find that using this product once/twice a week truly clears it up. It&#x27;s not really comparable to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; facial, but for maintenance it does a pretty great job. I have fairly sensitive skin so I only leave it on a couple of minutes, then rinse and apply a light moisturizer with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;Never experienced any redness or any sort of other discomfort.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores and my skin looks brighter and healthier. Great product and price. I plan to purchase again through Amazon since I couldn&#x27;t find it at Target.</li>
            <li> I bought the Olay Mini-Peel to address some discoloration, acne and wrinkles that I have. I was a little nervous about the sun warning on the peel but I figured that if a product doesn&#x27;t have any affects it probably won&#x27;t have any results either. After only one week of use I have noticed a huge improvement in the texture of my skin. My pores are smaller and I have a much more even tone. The best part is that I haven&#x27;t had a single break out since I started using the peel! I have not noticed a huge change in my wrinkles but I don&#x27;t have that many anyway. Be very careful to use sunscreen when you go out for long periods of time. Serious business, you will need an SPF of 75 or more. I used SPF 50 one day at the pool and came out a little pink. (I usually don&#x27;t burn at all) Also, be sure to use the peel in the shower, it seems to get warmer and last longer that way.</li>
            <li> I trust this brand very much and when I found this I jumped on it. It feels nice and warm and scrubby and there&#x27;s a noticible difference in the appearance of my skin after 1 use. Although, your face might be a little pinkish after the first use it  goes away pretty soon.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel fresh clean love the warming effect glad i did auto ship on this don&#x27;t want to run out!! EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Olay because I wanted something to cleanse my skin, without burning it out, or irritating it. What I Love about Olay product&#x27;s is that it works so well for my skin. I have combination skin and a few small blemishes, when I use the Thermal peel on my face it heats up and using circular motions with my finger tips, gently scrubs my skin. I leave it on for a few minutes or until dry, then I wash my face with Luke-warm water.  I Love how this Olay product works for my skin and the end results it gives me. I have clean, radiant, smooth skin that looks so healthy after I use this. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for the same things. It is also selling at a very reasonable price, compared to major retail stores.</li>
            <li> I like this, but not sure how much it actually does. Feels warm on the skin, feels very spa like.</li>
            <li> Best product in the regenerist series.  The Olay people were crazy to discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on what the Olay recommended online. I use this every morning and I like it because it does make my skin really moist and smooth. But I&#x27;m only 19 years old. I think this product is too much to spend for people my age. And it sounds like a lot of people have broken out. A good product for people in their 30 and up maybe? Teenagers, I don&#x27;t recommend for y&#x27;all. Keep your money and try something else than this.    Good product but I wont buy this again for a long time.</li>
            <li> I got this when I needed to switch up a lot of my beauty products due to pregnancy. I wrote Olay and they assured me all of their products were safe for pregnancy. This is a good scrub and it has helped my pregnancy acne immensely. I started breaking out horribly since getting pregnant and most acne fighters (salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide) are prohibited during pregnancy. I don&#x27;t use it all the time as I feel that may be too drying but I use it semi regularly. It does make my face smoother and if I have a breakout and use this it is significantly reduced by the following day.</li>
            <li> Love it heats up and feels great for a thermal mini peel use it all the time</li>
            <li> It does warm your skin. I can&#x27;t say that my skin feels any smoother or softer becasue of it though. Glad I tried it because now I know I am not missing anything if I don&#x27;t buy it again. Olay has some great products. This just isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> Good deal.  Will order again.  Great product</li>
            <li> ... but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s quality. However, using anything with microbeads helps me avoid breaking out, so I&#x27;m content. Like I already said, the warming feature is pretty neat, too.</li>
            <li> ONLY USED THIS PRODUCT TWO TIMES, BUT IT DOES WARM YOUR SKIN A LITTLE BIT.  FIGURE THAT THE HEAT WILL HELP CLEAN ANY PORES.  I WILL KEEP ON USING IT</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product and was going to purchase it at Walmart for $19.94 but being the cheapskate that I am, I decided to come home &amp; check out the price on Amazon. Normally Walmart would beat Amazon&#x27;s price BUT NOT THIS TIME! Amazon had an instant clip coupon for $3 so I beat Walmarts price at $16.94! The product gets warm to the touch when activated with water and feels super on your face. I use it every night to remove the dead skin. Then I apply my Ambi face lightener to lighten my sunspots. It has done wonders for lightening them in a matter of weeks. By removing the dead skin cells, it also helps to make your foundation go on more evenly as well. I am very pleased with the product &amp; will re-order although a little goes a long way with the product. I pea sized amount is all you need so the tube lasts quite a long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. It leaves a weird film on my skin unless I turn around and scrub my face with something else. Also, it only warms for maybe six seconds-even if I add more water. It is not something I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason I can&#x27;t buy this in stores around here anymore. I love the warming sensation and the exfoliating scrub. I use it everyday and my skin is holding up well as I turn into a withered old lady.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I like how it head up as you rub it into your face. I even forced my boyfriend to try it coz I thought its quite unusual. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change, its meant to be beneficial in the anti aging department but I didn&#x27;t notice anything. Its kinda grey in color and it has a slightly funny smell. It could smell better. Its still a good face wash, I like Olay products.</li>
            <li> I have not seen great results with this products, but it is a decent substitute when you have nothing else on hand.</li>
            <li> I love using this - its like a mini facial! Received super fast and great price!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and wanted to continue to use it for years to come...Could not find it in some of the retail stores so decided to see if it was still available online to order or had been discontinued..  I have gotten compliments on my skin for years and wanted to keep up my skin regimen..</li>
            <li> best face cleaning you&#x27;ll ever get. Why pay 200 for one single product that was developed by doctor so an so when u have better for less.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  I have been using it twice a day for two months now &amp; my skin is visibly improved.  It is clearer &amp; more smooth.  The grit in this is gentle enough to use twice a day on my skin but some people may only like it one time per day.  Either way, I would work up to twice a day, gradually; use it once a day for a week to see how your skin reacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin &amp; an oily t-zone &amp; like to use salicylic acid to keep my pores clean &amp; occasional zits away.  So when I use this Olay scrub, I use my usual cleanser at the same time (Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash - has 2% salicylic acid).  I splash my face with warm water, rub in a dab of the Neutrogena all over my face, then put on a generous dab of the Olay scrub &amp; gently scrub my whole face, staying clear of my eyes.  I let this mixture sit on my face for 1-2 minutes before washing off to give everything a chance to work in to my pores.  I treat it kind of like a facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week, I had some small pimples erupt; maybe two or three at a time.  Now, I only get an occasional small pimple.  This routine has made a big difference in the look &amp; feel of my skin.  I was very sceptical but was looking for a more gentle scrub to use more often so I gave this a try.  I also found through the years that cleansers or facial products with glycolic acid work wonders on my skin.  This Olay scrub has glycolic acid &amp; works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try but don&#x27;t expect big results for at least a week &amp; more like 2 weeks to a month.</li>
            <li> I have major discolaration on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried SO many things and spent so much money over the years. This is one of the best over the counter products I have EVER used. I use it every might in the shower. It has only been a week and my skin is significantly smoother. Any whiteheads I had are gone. I am hoping for the discolaration to start fading soon (hence four stars instead of five)only time will tell but after each use your skin feels great. It does not have a drying effect which I feared it might due to the warming effect. I will be updating in a few weeks to let know if it did help with the discolaration or not. But all in all a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: AUGUST 17, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not help with discoloration but still does wonders to smooth your skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I got some dry, patchy places on my forehead that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. After using this peel for about a week, those spots disappeared. Now, I only use it a couple of times a week, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. Exfoliates too. Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes; it stings.</li>
            <li> Feels nice but Can&#x27;t tell if it helps</li>
            <li> Perfect peel for use at home.</li>
            <li> This is the best gentle exfolitaor..I use it every morning and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. In combination with other Olay Regenerist porducts, this makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> I liked this product it did work to heat up on my skin and then dry up my skin and then shed my skin like a snake. It was entertaining and good for my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so fantastic! The warming sensation is luxurious and feels so good. I apply this about every other day after using an Olay Regenerist cleanser. I am 24 with acne prone skin, and this along with the entire Regenerist line is fixing my skin unlike any other product line I&#x27;ve tried. This smoothes, and gives a more even texture to my skin...I&#x27;ve noticed the old acne marks fading too. I love this product and I will continue to purchase! The whole Regenerist line has been like a miracle for my skin! Try it!!!</li>
            <li> I use this 1-2 times a week and have never had bad reaction.  It feels nice when using, after you apply you rewet your fingers and it gives your skin a gentle warming sensation.  After you rinse your skin will feel so smooth and soft.  Love the Amazon price too!</li>
            <li> So many people freak out when the zits arrive and give up when they start using this product because of it. This is my SECOND tube. I have combination skin prone to pimples and cysts on my cheeks and chin + the brown spots those things leave behind. Through the years I&#x27;ve used scrubs and various treatments including glycolic acid peels at the dermatologist&#x27;s office. THIS will give you the benefits like a glycolic peel within a week IF you have the patience to use it for 7 days. The smooth, soft, clearer skin IS revealed AND people do notice you&#x27;re doing something different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how clogged your pores are and how deep the pimply goop is, will determine IF your face will seem to be at it&#x27;s all time WORST. The thermal properties and the massage \\&quot;wakes up\\&quot; and sprouts every zit you can imagine! It did for me, and so did dermatologist office treatments. So I&#x27;d initially start using this on a Friday night when you can be a hermit for the weekend in case you have a Zit-fest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing ALL makeup and REALLY cleaning the face and neck, use this product according to directions, adding water to reactivate the thermal properties a couple times (I do it 3 times). After rinsing, you&#x27;ll feel as though there is a residue left on the skin after rinsing it off. DO NOT re-wash your face, leave it be. Don&#x27;t even put on moisturizer, let your skin soak the residue in and adjust to the NEW SKIN SHERIFF in-town over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice a day and on weekdays apply all my usual moisturizer w/SPF and makeup. IF running late, I skipped the morning Mini-Peel treatment BUT as soon as I got home I took off my makeup, cleansed my face and whipped out the Thermal Mini-Peel and worked it! After the first 7 days, I used it only in the evenings on weekdays and twice a day on weekends. I really like to spend the time to get at least 3 thermal re-activations per treatment so rushed mornings usually aren&#x27;t conducive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother, softer, clearer with LESS whiteheads, blackheads, zits than it has been in years. Even the brown spots  slowly faded without other \\&quot;potions\\&quot;. Going forward, I used this only a couple times a week rather than every day because my skin IS doing so well. Point being, I didn&#x27;t see myself using this TWICE a day forever :)ther, softer, clearer with LESS whiteheads, blackheads, zits than it has been in years. Even the brown spots  slowly faded without other \\&quot;potions\\&quot;. Going forward, I used this only a couple times a week rather than every day because my skin IS doing so well. Point being, I didn&#x27;t see myself using this TWICE a day forever :)</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I use it daily and really enjoy the heating sensation it gives. It&#x27;s labeled a mini-peel but basically it&#x27;s a cream scrub cleanser. The only con is the smell - a little musky but not too bad. I&#x27;ve seen it retail for as much as $22 - I only paid $14.00 on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This Mini Peel is just awesome, I always had pretty smooth skin, but it just made it even softer! Isn&#x27;t that great? I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 and a half weeks and I&#x27;m still seeing results, it may have slowed down but my face is still getting brighter and more radiant. If you have the patience to work through the breakouts that it may give you then the results are endless! I&#x27;m using this to really even out my skin-tone because I have a really uneven skin-tone and it is slowly but surely working I am also using this with a Hydroquinone Moisturizer and I can really say that I am happy with the results I am getting. If you guys are wondering what type of skin I have; I am a African American with really dark and oily skin around my forehead and nose. Thank you again to Olay for the amazing product and wonderful service.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, it works and I love the entire line of Olay Regenerist.  This stuff does what they say it will do.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I love the warm feeling; It makes your face super clean.</li>
            <li> I found this price to be significantly better than my local WallyMart store.  I love this and use it every other day in my skin care regimen.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a peel, but it is an exfoliant.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Excellent my wife loves</li>
            <li> Great item. No complicated steps, doesn&#x27;t burn and after a few uses you&#x27;ll notice small changes. The heat opens your pores so blackheads an pre-zits are cleared out instantly</li>
            <li> I love all of their products .  Leaves my face felling silky and removes  all face&lt;br /&gt;makeup.  Smells very nice</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe Cher until I tried this, and realized that HOLY MOSES, I really CAN turn back time ! ! !  My flaky, oily, sensitive, middle-aged skin looks like a million bucks after I use this.  Great exfoliation without irritation.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have used it for years!</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out. I wanted to like the product but it did not agree with me.</li>
            <li> First, Olay Regenerist Thermal Mini-peel smells great! This is my first criteria for any product. I love the \\&quot;thermal\\&quot; quality and consistency, it feels so good. Like a real spa treatment. I can definitely see that my pores are less noticable and overall my skin feels &amp; looks more even and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best, most effective, yet gentle facial exfoliant out there!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to my friends all the time!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s getting increasingly more difficult to find this in stores... I hope Olay will continue to make it.</li>
            <li> Keeps your face clear :)</li>
            <li> This is such a great daily treatment! I find that glycolic acid does wonders for the texture (and tone) of my skin, so I purchased this peel (which is more so a scrub) and I just love the way my face feels each morning after using it. I will note that I do not use it at night, just once per day in the morning. The results are worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the heating action is great in the shower and it really cleans out the pores while there open and if feels like your getting a mini facial every morning,  it is normally 22-25 dollars at Walmart and walgreens, it was a great price here on  amazon, I will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> works just as described</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning and my skin feels so soft afterwards. I apply the daily olay serum and moisturizer after. I always get compliments on my skin and how smooth and glowy it looks. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve gotten all sorts of compliments and comments from friends and strangers alike about how good my skin looks - I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works well for me. I have used it a lot. It cleans well and warms as you wash your face.</li>
            <li> This was in my bffs shower when I was at her house and I tried it &amp; fell in love.. This product rocks.. The warning is nice - but its the perfect amount of beads for scrubbing. Not to harsh,  but not like nothing is in the product.. Cleans off great and leaves my skin super smooth.. Starting to clear my black heads away.. I love it ... Use it every day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African- American with fair completion. I regretted buying two quantities of this product. I breakout everytime I used it. I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far no results not even a slight chance I&#x27;m going to continue to use it until the tube is empty  maybe I&#x27;ll c results at the end of the entire tube hopefully.Using this feels like playing in ain a mud bath its a mess don&#x27;t care for prefer pads much easier no mess. Sorry feel disappointed what a loss want try this again give it 2 star for the warmath</li>
            <li> I bought this one year ago with a gift card from my dad. I never, never spend this much on cleansers for myself. So it was a splurge and I was skeptical. After the first use, I am hooked. This really does make my skin smoother and softer. I love the warming feature, and it really gets out my blackheads. I am not kidding, you have got to try this stuff! I hope olay never stops making it! I recently bought the regenerist micro sculpting cream, and I have found my beauty products I will always use. You will not regret trying this thermal peel!</li>
            <li> This product does wonder for my skin. I have real oily skin and this has helped a lot to control it.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and loved it.  It has become increasily harder to find and much more expensive.  It came in just a few days and everything was perfect! Thanks</li>
            <li> Helps keep your face clean and clear and it feels great too</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it a couple times a week and my skin feels so soft and fresh afterward.</li>
            <li> I like this product a like being using it for a  long time  would recommend this to everyone  leaves your face feeling so good</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, but liked it better when it was $12.99 a bottle less than a year ago, then went to $20, now $30? At $12 it is a good value, at $30, not so much.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product leaves my skin feeling. I purchased it becuase it was recommended for some dark spots that I have. It hasnt really made a difference yet, but we&#x27;ll see with longer use of the product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel...first it turns warm, then refreshing.,,i will definately buy this product again</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says. My skin has cleared up and I&#x27;ve also notice less scarring.  My skin is smooth and supple. The formula is divine and whioe you&#x27;re doing it it&#x27;s so warm on your face it relaxes you. I definitely suggest this product.</li>
            <li> The most amazing face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin is refreshed and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product and helps get that younger look by peeling away the dead and build up skin on my face. It is a very easy product to use and the warming sensation is nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 2 or three times per week in place of usual cleanser. It leaves my skin so smooth. Easy addition to skin care routine.Great way to exfoliate, without being to hard on older skin--I am in my late 60s.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best products I have used in a long time !!  I love that even when using cold water, the product turns very warm and feels great on the face.  I think my breakouts are starting to clear up too (I am 59).  I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Olay just does a great job. This product really deep cleans my skin without drying it.  I really think it improves the texture of my skin and pores.  I am 60, and not prone to use lots of products so this and the Regenerist serum are my two go to skin products.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing at home skin care product! You can use the product everyday, and after a week it will look like you went and got a microdermabrasion at the salon. It will also help keep you skin free of acne. I recommend that you use a moisturizer or argon oil once and a while after using the product. You won&#x27;t need to use it every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s warm, it cleans and there&#x27;s a lot in the tube. Other than that, nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. Works great and I receive it on time stated.</li>
            <li> Using this for years. Convenient to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is great to get rid of all the crap accumulated under the skin, it will clear everything up.</li>
            <li> I started using this and had great results with smoothing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It can make your skin sensitive to the sun so be careful using it in the summer.  Use your sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Use it in the shower and it gives and nice warm feeling to my face while scrubbing away old dead skin cells!  Helps my skin stay younger looking!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My skin feels so clean and soft after use.  I have been using it daily for the past three months and see and feel a remarkable difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> Love the warmth when this goes on my face...gentle and soothing!</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product. Most of the skin care products I buy are worthless, but this one leaves my skin feeling soft. I like the smell and the warmth when it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I find that this is best used while in the shower as the humidity will prolong the warming effect. I think this is an interesting product and the warming sensation is nice. However, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. It seemed like a typical cleanser to me. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have already been using this product for the past 1.5 years and feel an amazing difference in the skin texture.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the only face products I&#x27;ve used where there&#x27;s actual visible results.  Occasionally I get this &#x27;growth&#x27; thing on my nose (no idea what it is, but my mom gets them too), and this thermal peel is the only thing that makes it go away.  My skin always looks so smooth and glowy too after I use it!</li>
            <li> I use this with my Clarisonic facial brush cleanser.  It Makes my skin feel super smooth and pampered, like I had a professional mini-facial.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  I recommend it. Makes the face skin feel clean and soft.  is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, Amazon sells this at a much cheaper price than the store. I like the thermal effect.</li>
            <li> We love this. have ordered many times.  leaves the face smooth and beautiful, relaxed and ready for anything.... pics, makeup, party anything! and the best thing you can use this daily.</li>
            <li> My favorite face scrub, glad I found it on here!  Like having a facial massage every day :)</li>
            <li> Off with the old and on with the new...good for sensitive skin...you can feel,the difference right away...a repeat user. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Love this mini peel. It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin at all. My skin feels clean and refreshed after each use. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love how it heats up and exfoliates. Aeesome!</li>
            <li> I like the warming sensation. If I get my face wet with hot water, put on the mask and leave it for a couple minutes, my skin is totally soft and smooth when I rinse it. I like to follow it with a foaming cleanser because the mask can be a bit too oily if its not washed off.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a very long time &amp; love it but, everyonce in a while I receive a tube that is completely dried up &amp; will not come out of the tube.  P&amp;G sent me a coupon to purchase another tube but, once again, I have received a &amp;#34;dried up&amp;#34; tube.  Did I receive an &amp;#34;old/outdated&amp;#34; tube from my Amazon purchase?</li>
            <li> I am really impressed this product gets such good reviews. It leaves the skin looking and feeling exactly the same as any average face wash. Maybe it is because I use the microdermabrasion/peel combo, so this one feels like nothing. Perhaps if you have never done any deep cleaning or peel this seems effective. That could explain the hype.&lt;br /&gt;It is interesting that it does feel warm on the skin.. but that is about it. Even the Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash (from the same line) leaves the skin feeling *much* cleaner and clearer.&lt;br /&gt;This is for me a certain no buy again.</li>
            <li> love the warming of this cleanser. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive! I use it about twice a week with great results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite know what I was expecting, but this facial cleaner was quite amazing! I use it after washing off my makeup to exfoliate and it works! The really cool and most pleasant part is the thermal heat that is generated....like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced! So nice to have a warm facial before going to bed. Lovely!</li>
            <li> I can definitely see the sun damage fade and my skin tone is evening out.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! I had a time finding a decent scrub for my face that would help with the breakouts I am still getting in my 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a Month my skin looks healthy  and is smoother. I use this daily it is the best and worth every penny.</li>
