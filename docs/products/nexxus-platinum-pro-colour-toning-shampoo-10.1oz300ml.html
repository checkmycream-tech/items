            <li>bright!...it&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li>Since Nexxus has a great reputation, I tried their take on the anti-yellowing genre.</li>

            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Its effective!</li>
            <li>I had to use this after my amazing hairstylist seemed to not tone my hair as great as she has before</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a good product and works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used fairly high-end hair dyes, but you still get some brassy color towards the roots, and this shampoo removed that.</li>
            <li>Says it did a good job</li>
            <li>I loved the result.  </li>
            <li>but doesnt do as good a job as the brand MODO.</li>
            <li>I have beautifully silvering hair that I love</li>
            <li>Does a wonderful job at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I love Nexxus priducts!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>For best use, wash hair first, then use the Nexxus.  </li>
            <li>For me its a toner not a cleanser, but in the end, glad I purchased!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>Nice color to keep the gray tones! :)</li>
            <li>It lathers really nice and does not  stain anything at all.  </li>
            <li>Worked really nice as a toning shampoo.</li>
            <li>It foams nicely.  </li>
            <li>Ok, first wash and I am extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>Been using It for years keeps my white hair perfect</li>
            <li>so we both have more gray hair than brown these days so a shampoo that solves the \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; problem is valuable to us.</li>
            <li>This product works for sure.</li>
            <li>She use to be able to purchase it at a salon but the salon went out of business</li>
            <li>Your hands won&#x27;t turn purple with the Nexxus toner, and they will with many of the others.  </li>
            <li>and I get many compliments on it (my hair)...</li>
            <li>and I will order more of it.</li>
            <li>I love my hair look amusement.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have found for this purpose, but don&#x27;t use it every day or your hair will be too blue.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great purple shampoo that works wonders I highly recommend Clairol Shimmer Lights, I swear by it!</li>
            <li>Sure could be better though.</li>
            <li>The shampoo worked for the most part and took the bronziness out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even need to use it too many times to get the results you want.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Its ok</li>
            <li>the Nexxus is ok, but not the best on chemically dyed blonde.</li>
            <li>I use it a couple of times a week and have such gorgeous hair now, even the most talented stylist couldn&#x27;t recreate it.  </li>
            <li>Sections of my hair are really brassy and while they really need to be lightened more, this does a great job of cooling off the warm tones.</li>
            <li>I wrote to Nexxus asking why so many products of theirs were available in retail outlets but not this one.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to order</li>
            <li>After about 6 shampoos my hair looks great, Im going to go ahead and say it looks BLONDER and actually makes my roots blend in better with the highlights.</li>
            <li>Loved it, makes my blonde look very light &amp; fabulous without looking too silver.  </li>
            <li>So if you might want to tone your hair and it is light, this shampoo would be great for white and gray hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s available on</li>
            <li>This shampoo was great because my hair would sometimes have a hint of brassy-ness after my hair dye and after just 3 washes, it was practically gone and a lot lighter blonde!</li>
            <li>yellow- but after even just one shampoo with this stuff, it improved greatly.</li>
            <li>My client with white hair has used this for years and all stores have discontinued the product, so happy to find it here</li>
            <li>My hairdresser always comments that my color looks great considering that its been 3 months since ive gotten my hair done, I find that this gets rid of almost all yellow tone.</li>
            <li>Best trick is to rinse your hair with the juice if half a lemon first,  it will help take all built up in the hair and makes it absorb the toning a lot better.</li>
            <li>The downsides are if you use it right after you color and have some spots that lightened well and some yellowy areas you&#x27;re trying to correct, the light spots will turn a lovely silver-lavender.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it dries out your hair, so make sure you use a good conditioner or combine with a moisture rich shampoo like i do.</li>
            <li>I was becoming more and more distressed at the thought of paying $165 to get my hair professionally toned and knowing that if I did, I had to stay out of the pool and sun or it would all be wasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beautiful sun kissed blonde hair with a lovely hint of my natural strawberry - no brassy tones!  </li>
            <li>Perfect shampoo to maintain grey hair from turning yellow and cleans better than any shampoo</li>
            <li>Does a really good job toning my blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend following up with a really good conditioner or hair mask.</li>
            <li>It really gives a great shine to my hair, and I only use it once a week.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my gray hair from yellowing and it make it look super</li>
            <li>After one wash I could see a tremendous difference in my hair color and also highlights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a strange consistency and it doesn&#x27;t great much foam to shampoo one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in somehow reaching the same effect on my own at home, for cheap.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and cheap.</li>
            <li>Because she does an amazing job every time in six weeks besides this last time.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend more for natural colored hair or those wanting platinum.</li>
            <li>We have tried others but for some reason our local shops have stopped carrying the brand we liked.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this for more than 5 different hair dying times and it has consistently worked very well!</li>
            <li>Honestly I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my blonde hair yet..</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a buy.</li>
            <li>I love dying my hair light blonde/almost white hair.  </li>
            <li>great for our grey/ white hair ....keeps it bright, white and not yellow.</li>
            <li>I now only dye my own hair because of this</li>
            <li>I use this several times a week and let it sit in the hair and it works really nice to cut the brassy tones out.</li>
            <li>Tones down the yellow traces of color treated hair magnificently</li>
            <li>And the best thing it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair like other toning shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I used this when I was using at-home box hair dyes that were for very light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>the way I like it.. also very fast shipment..ordered wed night and got it Thursday morning...</li>
            <li>If you like it, order it now because once supplies are are gone from other retailers, they won&#x27;t be able to restock it unless Nexxus does another about face and decides to start making it available again.</li>
            <li>My hair completely turned to a light ashy blonde with hints of silver, I love it.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I did not think it cleaned my hair nor did I notice any change in tone or color.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Love the product.. actually takes out the brassiness from my hair..</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a deep conditioner with the product.</li>
            <li>Dont quote me on that seeing as though I&#x27;ve used it only 3 times and could tell the majority of my brassiness was gone and was pleased with the outcome after the 3 washes.  </li>
            <li>than I normally would, lather it up super good, and leave it for a few minutes to try to maximize the toning effects.</li>
            <li>I am naturally a light brunette, dyed super blonde like a Scandinavian child.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really saves you money in the long run, because the possible adverse brassy color that home hair dyes may give you can be removed, leaving you with great dyed hair at a fraction of the cost of a salon.</li>
            <li>Also, hair actually feels clean after using this shampoo, whereas most toning shampoos fall short.</li>
            <li>It just made it even more dry.  </li>
            <li>I followed directions and after only 1 wash my hair came out very pretty!</li>
            <li>Now, the shampoo has been rebranded and only available in salons and online.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to do their own box hair-dye at home, especially if they are trying to achieve a blonde color.</li>
            <li>If you plop it in and then immediately wash it out, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>This purple shampoo didn&#x27;t do so much for the color of my hair, I feel like it maintained the amount of brass in my hair instead of taking it out.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair a light blonde color and this tones out the reddish tones.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice a much difference.</li>
            <li>Also, very drying.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but I really thought my hair looked blonder.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li>I have purchased it at other places, but Amazon&#x27;s prices are better.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy as long as the product is available.</li>
            <li>Your hair will be toned down, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>(after Simply Silver was taken off of the market, Platinum Pro was made available in their Aloxxi professional line).  </li>
            <li>The purple is still vibrant but the silver stays silver.</li>
            <li>I always use shimmer lights and decided to try a more expensive brand thinking it&#x27;d work better....</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Used Loreal UL63 which has a high lift</li>
            <li>I tried other products and while the purple stayed bright the silver seemed to absorb the purple to become pink.</li>
            <li>I use a little more shampoo</li>
            <li>However with continuing to use it while dyeing my hair golden blonde</li>
            <li>It also leaves your hair feeling like it just got treated, not like normal shampoo at all.</li>
            <li>Finally one day my stylist convinced me to let her tone my hair to pull out the golden tones &amp; you tend to get when you dye at home.  </li>
            <li>I also live in an area with a lot of iron in the water.  </li>
            <li>I use it together with blue dye on my gray hair giving it light silver blue hue works well for what I wanted</li>
            <li>(couldn&#x27;t find the ingredients anywhere and discovered it isn&#x27;t organic/natural in the least), but nothing that some good deep conditioner can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>First bought it at my local beauty salon until they decided to no longer sell it.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of cutting the brassy tones out of colored hair.</li>
            <li>I was informed this shampoo had been completely discontinued</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 7 yeas now, it&#x27;s the ONLY one that really makes your hair shiny and</li>
            <li>After two-three shampoos my hair was completely fixed.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture, smell or overall outcome of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t give me the blonde I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I used to have to go get my hair toned about every two weeks to keep it a nice ashy shade of blonde, but no more!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with gray/silver/white hair to help bring out the shine and to eliminate any yellow tones.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve decided to try this product, and it arrived early, which is a bonus, but after only 3 DAYS of using this product the brassiness is almost completely OUT!</li>
            <li>If you have gray hair, you know that many shampoos will cause dull, yellow highlights on your tresses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different toners, and much to my surprise</li>
            <li>She says there is no other one she can use on her hair.</li>
            <li>I figured to try a toning shampoo first before attempting to process my hair in some other way.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really works to enhance grey or white hair.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and silvery, not many products available for people who want to show off their Grey natural hair.  </li>
            <li>, I go pretty blonde from dark and one or two times using this</li>
            <li>I have naturally strawberry blonde hair and no matter what I do, the orange comes through after several shampoos after coloring.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products that were designed for blonde hair such as John Frieda&#x27;s go blonder products, they work, but they don&#x27;t get the iron out completely.</li>
            <li>I have died brown hair that turned very brassy and after using this shampoo for a couple weeks, it didn&#x27;t tone down the brassiness at all.</li>
            <li>It really does tone down any reddish hint coming through highlights.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to ANY ONE, because it enhances all other colors of hair as well,...</li>
            <li>Where I&#x27;m living we have very hard water, the water softener we have still doesn&#x27;t get all the iron out, so my light blonde hair has suffered because of it.</li>

            <li> My client with white hair has used this for years and all stores have discontinued the product, so happy to find it here</li>
            <li> My hairdresser always comments that my color looks great considering that its been 3 months since ive gotten my hair done, I find that this gets rid of almost all yellow tone.</li>
            <li> Best trick is to rinse your hair with the juice if half a lemon first,  it will help take all built up in the hair and makes it absorb the toning a lot better.</li>
            <li> The downsides are if you use it right after you color and have some spots that lightened well and some yellowy areas you&#x27;re trying to correct, the light spots will turn a lovely silver-lavender.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it dries out your hair, so make sure you use a good conditioner or combine with a moisture rich shampoo like i do.</li>
            <li> I was becoming more and more distressed at the thought of paying $165 to get my hair professionally toned and knowing that if I did, I had to stay out of the pool and sun or it would all be wasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beautiful sun kissed blonde hair with a lovely hint of my natural strawberry - no brassy tones!  </li>
            <li> Perfect shampoo to maintain grey hair from turning yellow and cleans better than any shampoo</li>
            <li> Does a really good job toning my blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend following up with a really good conditioner or hair mask.</li>
            <li> It really gives a great shine to my hair, and I only use it once a week.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my gray hair from yellowing and it make it look super</li>
            <li> After one wash I could see a tremendous difference in my hair color and also highlights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a strange consistency and it doesn&#x27;t great much foam to shampoo one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in somehow reaching the same effect on my own at home, for cheap.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and cheap.</li>
            <li> Because she does an amazing job every time in six weeks besides this last time.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend more for natural colored hair or those wanting platinum.</li>
            <li> We have tried others but for some reason our local shops have stopped carrying the brand we liked.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this for more than 5 different hair dying times and it has consistently worked very well!</li>
            <li> Honestly I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my blonde hair yet..</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a buy.</li>
            <li> I love dying my hair light blonde/almost white hair.  </li>
            <li> great for our grey/ white hair ....keeps it bright, white and not yellow.</li>
            <li> I now only dye my own hair because of this</li>
            <li> I use this several times a week and let it sit in the hair and it works really nice to cut the brassy tones out.</li>
            <li> Tones down the yellow traces of color treated hair magnificently</li>
            <li> And the best thing it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair like other toning shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I used this when I was using at-home box hair dyes that were for very light blonde hair.</li>
            <li> the way I like it.. also very fast shipment..ordered wed night and got it Thursday morning...</li>
            <li> If you like it, order it now because once supplies are are gone from other retailers, they won&#x27;t be able to restock it unless Nexxus does another about face and decides to start making it available again.</li>
            <li> My hair completely turned to a light ashy blonde with hints of silver, I love it.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I did not think it cleaned my hair nor did I notice any change in tone or color.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love the product.. actually takes out the brassiness from my hair..</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a deep conditioner with the product.</li>
            <li> Dont quote me on that seeing as though I&#x27;ve used it only 3 times and could tell the majority of my brassiness was gone and was pleased with the outcome after the 3 washes.  </li>
            <li> than I normally would, lather it up super good, and leave it for a few minutes to try to maximize the toning effects.</li>
            <li> I am naturally a light brunette, dyed super blonde like a Scandinavian child.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really saves you money in the long run, because the possible adverse brassy color that home hair dyes may give you can be removed, leaving you with great dyed hair at a fraction of the cost of a salon.</li>
            <li> Also, hair actually feels clean after using this shampoo, whereas most toning shampoos fall short.</li>
            <li> It just made it even more dry.  </li>
            <li> I followed directions and after only 1 wash my hair came out very pretty!</li>
            <li> Now, the shampoo has been rebranded and only available in salons and online.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to do their own box hair-dye at home, especially if they are trying to achieve a blonde color.</li>
            <li> If you plop it in and then immediately wash it out, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> This purple shampoo didn&#x27;t do so much for the color of my hair, I feel like it maintained the amount of brass in my hair instead of taking it out.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair a light blonde color and this tones out the reddish tones.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice a much difference.</li>
            <li> Also, very drying.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> but I really thought my hair looked blonder.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> I have purchased it at other places, but Amazon&#x27;s prices are better.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy as long as the product is available.</li>
            <li> Your hair will be toned down, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> (after Simply Silver was taken off of the market, Platinum Pro was made available in their Aloxxi professional line).  </li>
            <li> The purple is still vibrant but the silver stays silver.</li>
            <li> I always use shimmer lights and decided to try a more expensive brand thinking it&#x27;d work better....</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used Loreal UL63 which has a high lift</li>
            <li> I tried other products and while the purple stayed bright the silver seemed to absorb the purple to become pink.</li>
            <li> I use a little more shampoo</li>
            <li> However with continuing to use it while dyeing my hair golden blonde</li>
            <li> It also leaves your hair feeling like it just got treated, not like normal shampoo at all.</li>
            <li> Finally one day my stylist convinced me to let her tone my hair to pull out the golden tones &amp; you tend to get when you dye at home.  </li>
            <li> I also live in an area with a lot of iron in the water.  </li>
            <li> I use it together with blue dye on my gray hair giving it light silver blue hue works well for what I wanted</li>
            <li> (couldn&#x27;t find the ingredients anywhere and discovered it isn&#x27;t organic/natural in the least), but nothing that some good deep conditioner can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> First bought it at my local beauty salon until they decided to no longer sell it.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of cutting the brassy tones out of colored hair.</li>
            <li> I was informed this shampoo had been completely discontinued</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 7 yeas now, it&#x27;s the ONLY one that really makes your hair shiny and</li>
            <li> After two-three shampoos my hair was completely fixed.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture, smell or overall outcome of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t give me the blonde I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I used to have to go get my hair toned about every two weeks to keep it a nice ashy shade of blonde, but no more!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with gray/silver/white hair to help bring out the shine and to eliminate any yellow tones.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve decided to try this product, and it arrived early, which is a bonus, but after only 3 DAYS of using this product the brassiness is almost completely OUT!</li>
            <li> If you have gray hair, you know that many shampoos will cause dull, yellow highlights on your tresses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different toners, and much to my surprise</li>
            <li> She says there is no other one she can use on her hair.</li>
            <li> I figured to try a toning shampoo first before attempting to process my hair in some other way.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo really works to enhance grey or white hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny and silvery, not many products available for people who want to show off their Grey natural hair.  </li>
            <li> , I go pretty blonde from dark and one or two times using this</li>
            <li> I have naturally strawberry blonde hair and no matter what I do, the orange comes through after several shampoos after coloring.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products that were designed for blonde hair such as John Frieda&#x27;s go blonder products, they work, but they don&#x27;t get the iron out completely.</li>
            <li> I have died brown hair that turned very brassy and after using this shampoo for a couple weeks, it didn&#x27;t tone down the brassiness at all.</li>
            <li> It really does tone down any reddish hint coming through highlights.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to ANY ONE, because it enhances all other colors of hair as well,...</li>
            <li> Where I&#x27;m living we have very hard water, the water softener we have still doesn&#x27;t get all the iron out, so my light blonde hair has suffered because of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to go back to my natural color (dark blonde) for a while now, but the iron is still noticeable with that color, and besides I&#x27;ll know what my hair looks like anyways, so it&#x27;ll still bother me.</li>
            <li> and I naturally have dark Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works, I dont have lots of money to keep up my blonde locks, so I am known to delay going to the salon for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> This made my hair purple and grey and I only left it on for 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Definitely brightened grey hair.</li>
            <li> did nto work as expected even after being left on several times for ten min</li>
            <li> The only thing holding me back from five stars is it may stain your shower if you aren&#x27;t careful as the shampoo is a very deep purple with a lot of pigment concentration.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and the orange parts have toned way down.</li>
            <li> This product makes it look just as the stylist did it, in less than 3 minutes &amp; for about 1/6th of the price of the professional color.  </li>
            <li> It evened out my hair that had lots of leftover pink tinted sections in it from when I dyed my bleached blonde hair the color fushia.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair dry and darker.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible dye job at a salon and this stuff was a huge success in fixing it!</li>
            <li> I have Asian black hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just took a little while to see the results and didn&#x27;t work instantly</li>
            <li> The back half of my hair has been red-orange, the front half,</li>
            <li> What I have discovered is that Platinum Hair Shades toners usually have blue. .</li>
            <li> Took only a few days to ship too!</li>
            <li> I am a dark brunette trying to lighten my hair so red/orange tones come through often.</li>
            <li> I had a highlight/lowlight dye job that went way too dark.</li>
            <li> This product helps tone down the brassiness that comes with highlights.  </li>
            <li> It helps tone down the orange.  </li>
            <li> And for a lot less than I would have had to pay.  </li>
            <li> I use it once every week or less, and when I use it</li>
            <li> It does feel slightly stripping when I washed it out.</li>
            <li> A little rougher than I would have wanted</li>
            <li> It left my hair manageable and shiney, but alas I received the Pantene Silver CONDITIONER.  </li>
            <li> but my cousin/stylist said it might take a few applications.</li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago</li>
            <li> I usually use drug store color dyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this did anything?</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll see results in very few washes.  </li>
            <li> The bottle arrived with two seals broken and was previously opened.</li>
            <li> Just leave it in at least 5 minutes each time.</li>
            <li> because I have dirty blonde hair</li>
            <li> I have strawberry blonde hair with some gray coming in ( sad face!! ).  </li>
            <li> I spent two weeks at the beach, with the sun, salt water and chlorine from the pool at our house, my hair to on an ugly shade of brass.  </li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s one of the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> Little disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED WRONG ITEM.</li>
            <li> My hair had an awful brassy orange-yellow color after dying it multiple times over the years</li>
            <li> I do not use conditioner as my hair is very thin, so I gave the 3 bottles to Goodwill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;that is if nature has stepped it to give your shade an too unhappy</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this to neutralize some brassiness I was experiencing with transforming my brunette locks to blonde, which it did within a couple of shampoos. However with continuing to use it while dyeing my hair golden blonde I noticed it was turning my hair platinum blonde and negating the gold I was putting in. I would reccomend more for natural colored hair or those wanting platinum.</li>
            <li> Cuts the brassiness in my blond hair</li>
            <li> Been using It for years keeps my white hair perfect</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde.  I also live in an area with a lot of iron in the water.  Over time, the iron build up gives my hair orange and gold tones.  This shampoo (formerly known as \\&quot;Simply Silver\\&quot;) removes those unwanted tones and leaves my hair shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t keep up with the business decision Nexxus makes.  Simply Silver was taken off of the market, then put back on only to be removed again shortly thereafter.  Now, the shampoo has been rebranded and only available in salons and online.  No salons in my area stock Nexxus products, so it&#x27;s either order online or travel 100 miles to purchase it.  Thank goodness it&#x27;s available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2/2014:  I wrote to Nexxus asking why so many products of theirs were available in retail outlets but not this one.  I was informed this shampoo had been completely discontinued (after Simply Silver was taken off of the market, Platinum Pro was made available in their Aloxxi professional line).  If you like it, order it now because once supplies are are gone from other retailers, they won&#x27;t be able to restock it unless Nexxus does another about face and decides to start making it available again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo. Purple brings out the silver in your hair. Can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
            <li> I use it together with blue dye on my gray hair giving it light silver blue hue works well for what I wanted</li>
            <li> If you have gray hair, you know that many shampoos will cause dull, yellow highlights on your tresses. To combat that, shampoo makers make \\&quot;color toning\\&quot; products like this one. My wife and I are AARP members so we both have more gray hair than brown these days so a shampoo that solves the \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; problem is valuable to us. We have tried others but for some reason our local shops have stopped carrying the brand we liked. Since Nexxus has a great reputation, I tried their take on the anti-yellowing genre. It&#x27;s been a good product and works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have gray hair? Try this shampoo and wait for the compliments!</li>
            <li> This shampoo removes that yellow sheen from  regular shampoo chemical residue.  I like to use it once a week, which keeps all the yellow out for me.</li>
            <li> This product works for sure. My wife uses this shampoo on a regular basis. She use to be able to purchase it at a salon but the salon went out of business so she purchases it through Amazon. She says there is no other one she can use on her hair.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED WRONG ITEM. I thought I was purchasing the almost non-existance Pantene Silver Shampoo as I find this to be the best for my \\&quot;silver\\&quot; hair. It left my hair manageable and shiney, but alas I received the Pantene Silver CONDITIONER.  I do not use conditioner as my hair is very thin, so I gave the 3 bottles to Goodwill.  I don&#x27;t know if the error was mine or Amazon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I have died brown hair that turned very brassy and after using this shampoo for a couple weeks, it didn&#x27;t tone down the brassiness at all.</li>
            <li> I used this when I was using at-home box hair dyes that were for very light blonde hair. This shampoo was great because my hair would sometimes have a hint of brassy-ness after my hair dye and after just 3 washes, it was practically gone and a lot lighter blonde! I was able to use this for more than 5 different hair dying times and it has consistently worked very well! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to do their own box hair-dye at home, especially if they are trying to achieve a blonde color. I used fairly high-end hair dyes, but you still get some brassy color towards the roots, and this shampoo removed that. This shampoo really saves you money in the long run, because the possible adverse brassy color that home hair dyes may give you can be removed, leaving you with great dyed hair at a fraction of the cost of a salon.</li>
            <li> Does a really good job toning my blonde hair.  Sections of my hair are really brassy and while they really need to be lightened more, this does a great job of cooling off the warm tones.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo a couple of times and there was no decrease in the brassiness of my hair. It appeared to be the only product for brunettes and not silver hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect shampoo to maintain grey hair from turning yellow and cleans better than any shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different toners, and much to my surprise this one is the best AND it&#x27;s one of the least expensive.  Your hands won&#x27;t turn purple with the Nexxus toner, and they will with many of the others.  It does a great job of cutting the brassy tones out of colored hair.</li>
            <li> Well I have used this twice since I bought it.. Honestly I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my blonde hair yet.. but my cousin/stylist said it might take a few applications. Lets hope it works! I love Nexxus priducts!</li>
            <li> Wife uses it. Says it did a good job</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I used to have to go get my hair toned about every two weeks to keep it a nice ashy shade of blonde, but no more! Also, hair actually feels clean after using this shampoo, whereas most toning shampoos fall short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years.  It really does tone down any reddish hint coming through highlights.  Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great. Tones down the yellow traces of color treated hair magnificently</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 7 yeas now, it&#x27;s the ONLY one that really makes your hair shiny and bright!...it&#x27;s beautiful and I get many compliments on it (my hair)...I highly recommend this product to ANY ONE, because it enhances all other colors of hair as well,...the highlights on darker hair are just amazing!......thank you NEXXUS......i am a devoted customer!...RevEddie</li>
            <li> Great product.  First bought it at my local beauty salon until they decided to no longer sell it.  I have purchased it at other places, but Amazon&#x27;s prices are better.</li>
            <li> This does the job. I bleached my hair and it turned out baby chick yellow- but after even just one shampoo with this stuff, it improved greatly. After two-three shampoos my hair was completely fixed. I&#x27;m sold on this, I&#x27;m going to keep using it whenever I need to bleach my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I found helped a lot was leaving it in longer than they say you should- just shut off the water, do something for 10 minutes, then come back and wash it all out. If you plop it in and then immediately wash it out, it doesn&#x27;t do much. I only use this every couple of days to a week for maintenance at this point, it almost works too well if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I had looked all over for a product that would enhance my silver hair and couldn&#x27;t find anything. Hairdressers just looked at me like I was nuts. Heads up hairdressers, there&#x27;s a babyboomer generation going silver and not all of us want to cover it! I have beautifully silvering hair that I love and now I have the product that helps me keep it looking really wonderful! It was easy to order and I will order more of it. Charly (Charise&#x27;) McOmber</li>
            <li> I love my hair look amusement.</li>
            <li> It is the best shampoo for gray hair ever!</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works to enhance grey or white hair.  Helps get rid of that pesky yellow tinge.  This is the best shampoo I have found for this purpose, but don&#x27;t use it every day or your hair will be too blue.</li>
            <li> This is the deepest purple toner Infused shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Its effective! The downsides are if you use it right after you color and have some spots that lightened well and some yellowy areas you&#x27;re trying to correct, the light spots will turn a lovely silver-lavender. It also leaves your hair feeling like it just got treated, not like normal shampoo at all. You need a good conditioner after this one!</li>
            <li> Tones well without turning hair purple.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived with two seals broken and was previously opened. It makes me hesitant to even use the product.</li>
            <li> I have strawberry blonde hair with some gray coming in ( sad face!! ).  I spent two weeks at the beach, with the sun, salt water and chlorine from the pool at our house, my hair to on an ugly shade of brass.  I was becoming more and more distressed at the thought of paying $165 to get my hair professionally toned and knowing that if I did, I had to stay out of the pool and sun or it would all be wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this and voil&amp;agrave;!!  Beautiful sun kissed blonde hair with a lovely hint of my natural strawberry - no brassy tones!  I use it a couple of times a week and have such gorgeous hair now, even the most talented stylist couldn&#x27;t recreate it.  And for a lot less than I would have had to pay.  Yay all around!</li>
            <li> What I have discovered is that Platinum Hair Shades toners usually have blue. . Silver Hair shades have sort of a&lt;br /&gt;purple. . So if you might want to tone your hair and it is light, this shampoo would be great for white and gray hair&lt;br /&gt;that is if nature has stepped it to give your shade an too unhappy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Evers</li>
            <li> My hair had an awful brassy orange-yellow color after dying it multiple times over the years so I tried this product in hopes that it would remove my unwanted color and tone my hair. I followed directions and after only 1 wash my hair came out very pretty! My hair completely turned to a light ashy blonde with hints of silver, I love it. I cant want to see what it&#x27;ll look like after the 2nd try. Shipping was fast and cheap. Definitely worth a buy.</li>
            <li> Definitely brightened grey hair. A bit drying, but conditioner solved that problem. I use Wen for conditioner. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I am currently sporting silver and deep purple hair. I tried other products and while the purple stayed bright the silver seemed to absorb the purple to become pink. That is not the case with this shampoo. The purple is still vibrant but the silver stays silver.</li>
            <li> I love dying my hair light blonde/almost white hair.  I usually use drug store color dyes.  Finally one day my stylist convinced me to let her tone my hair to pull out the golden tones &amp; you tend to get when you dye at home.  I loved the result.  Seeing how my stylist charged me $60 I was interested in somehow reaching the same effect on my own at home, for cheap.  This product makes it look just as the stylist did it, in less than 3 minutes &amp; for about 1/6th of the price of the professional color.  After only one shampoo.  Loved it, makes my blonde look very light &amp; fabulous without looking too silver.  Love, love, love this product.  Took only a few days to ship too!</li>
            <li> This purple shampoo didn&#x27;t do so much for the color of my hair, I feel like it maintained the amount of brass in my hair instead of taking it out. I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture, smell or overall outcome of this shampoo. If you&#x27;re looking for a great purple shampoo that works wonders I highly recommend Clairol Shimmer Lights, I swear by it!</li>
            <li> This did nothing to help tone my hair after I bleached it.  It just made it even more dry.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product helps tone down the brassiness that comes with highlights.  For best use, wash hair first, then use the Nexxus.  Your hair will be toned down, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> great for our grey/ white hair ....keeps it bright, white and not yellow.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it. I bleached my hair twice and died it and couldn&#x27;t get the brassy orange color out. I just got this a few days ago and I&#x27;ve used it twice. only after 2 uses its all gone.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible dye job at a salon and this stuff was a huge success in fixing it! I now only dye my own hair because of this, I go pretty blonde from dark and one or two times using this gets the perfect color!</li>
            <li> I have silver hair and have used this shampoo for over six months.  It really gives a great shine to my hair, and I only use it once a week.  I highly recommend this for anyone with gray/silver/white hair to help bring out the shine and to eliminate any yellow tones.</li>
            <li> Darkest, beat purple shampoo iv ever came accross</li>
            <li> My client with white hair has used this for years and all stores have discontinued the product, so happy to find it here</li>
            <li> I read a review that says this is the replacement for Simply Silver.  No it&#x27;s not.  It does work somewhat over time when used religiously.  Sure could be better though.</li>
            <li> The shampoo worked for the most part and took the bronziness out of my hair. It&#x27;s just took a little while to see the results and didn&#x27;t work instantly</li>
            <li> This makes my hair dry and darker. It really doesn&#x27;t give me the blonde I was hoping for. It does get rid of the gold but it leaves t dingy.</li>
            <li> I had dyed my brown hair darker brown and this made it reddish? Not complaining but just putting it out there.</li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny and silvery, not many products available for people who want to show off their Grey natural hair.  Will continue to buy as long as the product is available.</li>
            <li> I have naturally strawberry blonde hair and no matter what I do, the orange comes through after several shampoos after coloring.  This is the only purple shampoo that I have found that helps somewhat.  It helps tone down the orange.  It is not a miracle cure though as it washes out and doesn&#x27;t totally eradicate the orange but, it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> did nto work as expected even after being left on several times for ten min</li>
            <li> This is the second toning shampoo ive used, I bought this one because of the lower price. I am naturally a light brunette, dyed super blonde like a Scandinavian child. This stuff works, I dont have lots of money to keep up my blonde locks, so I am known to delay going to the salon for as long as possible. My hairdresser always comments that my color looks great considering that its been 3 months since ive gotten my hair done, I find that this gets rid of almost all yellow tone. I use it once every week or less, and when I use it I use a little more shampoo than I normally would, lather it up super good, and leave it for a few minutes to try to maximize the toning effects.</li>
            <li> I went from dyed red back to blonde. After two highlight sessions, my hair was STILL orangey in color, when I WANT a champange color. On a stylists recommendation, I started looking into \\&quot;purple\\&quot; shampoos. After purchasing this shampoo It took me some time to figure it out. The first time I tried it, I did not think it cleaned my hair nor did I notice any change in tone or color. So, I started mixing it with my reg shampoo. After about 6 shampoos my hair looks great, Im going to go ahead and say it looks BLONDER and actually makes my roots blend in better with the highlights. For me its a toner not a cleanser, but in the end, glad I purchased! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Where I&#x27;m living we have very hard water, the water softener we have still doesn&#x27;t get all the iron out, so my light blonde hair has suffered because of it. The back half of my hair has been red-orange, the front half, blonde. I&#x27;ve used products that were designed for blonde hair such as John Frieda&#x27;s go blonder products, they work, but they don&#x27;t get the iron out completely. I&#x27;ve been wanting to go back to my natural color (dark blonde) for a while now, but the iron is still noticeable with that color, and besides I&#x27;ll know what my hair looks like anyways, so it&#x27;ll still bother me. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve decided to try this product, and it arrived early, which is a bonus, but after only 3 DAYS of using this product the brassiness is almost completely OUT! It&#x27;s made for every hair color, which means I&#x27;m still going to be using it after I dye my hair, now that I know I won&#x27;t have to worry about the brassiness being in it. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This toning shampoo works great,  you&#x27;ll see results in very few washes.  It lathers really nice and does not  stain anything at all.  And the best thing it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair like other toning shampoos.  I leave in my hair for about 5 mins and then rinse.  Best trick is to rinse your hair with the juice if half a lemon first,  it will help take all built up in the hair and makes it absorb the toning a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome color toner.  I dyed my hair a light blonde color and this tones out the reddish tones.  I bought it b/c my hair dresser uses it at her salon.</li>
            <li> Great for that brass.</li>
            <li> Worked really nice as a toning shampoo. I am a dark brunette trying to lighten my hair so red/orange tones come through often. I use this several times a week and let it sit in the hair and it works really nice to cut the brassy tones out.</li>
            <li> Love the product.. actually takes out the brassiness from my hair.. I have Asian black hair so when I bleach it,it comes out brassy but it makes it blonde.. the way I like it.. also very fast shipment..ordered wed night and got it Thursday morning...</li>
            <li> Oh god! This made my hair purple and grey and I only left it on for 30 seconds</li>
            <li> I always use shimmer lights and decided to try a more expensive brand thinking it&#x27;d work better.... IT DOESN&#x27;T--- Stick with shimmer lights.</li>
            <li> It evened out my hair that had lots of leftover pink tinted sections in it from when I dyed my bleached blonde hair the color fushia. A little rougher than I would have wanted (couldn&#x27;t find the ingredients anywhere and discovered it isn&#x27;t organic/natural in the least), but nothing that some good deep conditioner can&#x27;t fix. Don&#x27;t even need to use it too many times to get the results you want. Just leave it in at least 5 minutes each time.</li>
            <li> It keeps my gray hair from yellowing and it make it look super</li>
            <li> I had a highlight/lowlight dye job that went way too dark. I was hoping this would help bring the blonde out. I did not notice a much difference. Also, very drying. Be sure to use a deep conditioner with the product.</li>
            <li> Nice color to keep the gray tones! :)</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  Maybe it&#x27;s a placebo effect but I really thought my hair looked blonder.  The only thing holding me back from five stars is it may stain your shower if you aren&#x27;t careful as the shampoo is a very deep purple with a lot of pigment concentration.</li>
            <li> Got rid my orange hair in three washes</li>
            <li> I needed the brassiness out of my hair from my blonde being faded by the sun and just the color washing out of my hair. I mix this shampoo with my regular shampoo so that i can use it daily to keep the brassy out of my blonde. I LOVE this product. The only downside is that it dries out your hair, so make sure you use a good conditioner or combine with a moisture rich shampoo like i do.</li>
            <li> Little disappointed with it. Its ok but doesnt do as good a job as the brand MODO. the Nexxus is ok, but not the best on chemically dyed blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this did anything? I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference but maybe its because I have dirty blonde hair...Anyway I&#x27;m a dedicated Nexxus user and I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a strange consistency and it doesn&#x27;t great much foam to shampoo one&#x27;s hair.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that it makes my gray hair seem brighter.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t lighting my hair or take the brace out. Silver lights worked the best. I&#x27;ll be buying that again. And its cheaper</li>
            <li> Ok, first wash and I am extremely impressed. My hair is soft and the orange parts have toned way down. Can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again. I will be using this often, I think this became my permanent shampoo. ♥ ♥ ♥</li>
            <li> I just used this tonight on my hair.  I just put some highlights in my hair and wanted something to take away any brassiness.  This does the trick.  It foams nicely.  It does feel slightly stripping when I washed it out. I&#x27;d recommend following up with a really good conditioner or hair mask.</li>
            <li> I had to use this after my amazing hairstylist seemed to not tone my hair as great as she has before (she was in a hurry I guess). Because she does an amazing job every time in six weeks besides this last time. I said nothing and purchased this to try. In one 3 min period it&#x27;s reduced the grassiness a ton. I think in another time and it will be all gone!</li>
            <li> Used Loreal UL63 which has a high lift and I naturally have dark Asian hair.  Initially my hair had A LOT of &amp;#34;reddish&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; tones, so I figured to try a toning shampoo first before attempting to process my hair in some other way.  I could tell a difference after several washes.  If you&#x27;re looking for a drastic change, expecting it to remove all brassiness perhaps using it constantly might do the trick? Dont quote me on that seeing as though I&#x27;ve used it only 3 times and could tell the majority of my brassiness was gone and was pleased with the outcome after the 3 washes.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It&#x27;s inexpensive. It actually works! After one wash I could see a tremendous difference in my hair color and also highlights. Thumbs up!!!</li>
