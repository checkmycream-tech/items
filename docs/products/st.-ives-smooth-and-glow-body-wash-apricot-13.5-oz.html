            <li>So cheap for quality.</li>

            <li>I wanted the same scent and product but in a body wash, and I&#x27;m so happy I found this.</li>

            <li>This stuff is great, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, exfoliates and smells</li>
            <li>Nice smell, nice body wash, not much else to say.</li>
            <li>This is the best product we&#x27;ve ever used for our bodies - no allergies, even if apricot pit pieces, doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin but helps keep it soft!</li>
            <li>Skin feels nice and soft too.  </li>
            <li>It made my face and skin feel look fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what it is supposed to smell like so, not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>Well, the cap has a nice lip to it that makes it really easy to open.</li>
            <li>that also had Super Saver Shipping on it.</li>
            <li>and It came quickly.</li>
            <li>After looking around online for a great exfoliating body wash, typically finding over priced soaps that I didn&#x27;t want to risk i found this.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pretty good especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>Really exfoliates your skin and leaves you feeling like you got a good scrub down :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, I was hoping there was more scrubbies in this but even for the lack of scrubbies</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin and this product works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle.</li>
            <li>i wish it was more &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; then it actually is.</li>
            <li>I love St. Ives products, especially this body wash.</li>
            <li>- its also much cheaper compare to its competitors!</li>
            <li>not that great of a product..., and do your self a fever and go to the near supermarket and get it for much less.</li>
            <li>This was okay, it didn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>the new one is good but a little to grainy.</li>
            <li>This wash is the only one that keeps me moisturized and free of breakouts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The grains exfoliates gently without causing any dryness.</li>
            <li>But the smell is a little too strong and sweet and lingers on the skin.</li>
            <li>The other best part part is it has subtle fruity apricot scent.love</li>
            <li>I am very picky with soaps after using too many soap bars and body washes cheap and expensive that didn&#x27;t last, didn&#x27;t hydrate, didn&#x27;t glide well, or had cheap containers that if dropped were ruined.</li>
            <li>very silky and soft thank you very</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It has those nice little beads that really make you feel like you&#x27;re scrubbing away dirt and grime and such.</li>
            <li>I like it, it does make my skin soft and it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>Every time I use this the whole shower smells fruity, The exfoliates are all natural</li>
            <li>Most scrubs I&#x27;ve used feel a bit oily and can be harsh on my skin</li>
            <li>this is one of my new favorites I highly recommend it&lt;</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>prefer the old apricot body wash</li>
            <li>There is no seal between the lid and bottle; and the top flips open with very little pressure.</li>
            <li>However I will definetly not buy it here again do to the messy experience I got to clean up upon its arrival.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff, but wish it had more exfoliating material in it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pretty good especially in the summer. Abundant fine sparkle can be washed easily. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I also use the face scrub, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I buy this through Subscribe and Save.  It is a good product and it is cheap so I keep using it.  It smells really good too.  I use it with a loofa so the exfoliation is lost to me.</li>
            <li> I honestly only bought this because it was the cheapest thing I could find that I might use that also had Super Saver Shipping on it. That said, I&#x27;m glad I did.  I am a man, and perhaps this is considered a woman&#x27;s product, but I like the way it smells. It has those nice little beads that really make you feel like you&#x27;re scrubbing away dirt and grime and such. I also have to commend St. Ives for making and/or using a bottle that I love. What makes it so good? Well, the cap has a nice lip to it that makes it really easy to open. It also has a generous opening and a body with give which facilitates in getting plenty of soap out in a (controllable) hurry. This is probably rather odd to note, but it&#x27;s just struck me as of late because I have a Dove Men body wash right now that lets a tiny morsel of soap out with a normal squeeze so you have to death grip it to get a thin supply of gel to squirt out. Makes it feel like I&#x27;m using one of those ketchup bottles with a nozzle that&#x27;s too small. This product has no such problems.  It really is quite pleasant all around, and it makes the perfect filler to get Super Saver Shipping. What else could you want?</li>
            <li> I am already in love with the Apricot face scrub which I admit I have used as a body scrub for years and was excited to find this product. I love the feel and smell of it. You just need a little, making the bottle last a long time. I also use a mit so I get the most scrubbing benefit. I step out of the shower feeling incredibly moisturized.</li>
            <li> Nice and refreshing. Provides a lot of suds, smells good and does a leaves me feeling clean. Good budget body wash.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have dry skin and break out on my back. This wash is the only one that keeps me moisturized and free of breakouts. I have very sensitive skin. It is very gentle. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is a grear produciton. After I used it every time, I feel I refresh myself. So cheap for quality.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite body wash. I like that it has the exfoliating beads, and the smell is amazing. It&#x27;s a really great, refreshing scent that leaves you smelling clean, but isn&#x27;t too offensive. I usually buy a different body wash each time that I run out, but I&#x27;ve repurchased this once already and I&#x27;ll probably continue to do so. I tend to get &amp;#34;bored&amp;#34; with the same body washes but this stuff has been great.</li>
            <li> I like it, it does make my skin soft and it lathers very well. I only have to pour this on my puff/shower thing once (instead of twice like other more expensive brands) to get enough suds to lather my entire body which is a plus. It smells nice, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s unisex and I don&#x27;t love the smell because of that. I like more floral/womanly/stronger scents and this just smells faintly like apricots but that&#x27;s what it is supposed to smell like so, not a bad thing. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> i wish it was more &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; then it actually is. i&#x27;ve used all sorts of St. Ives products and (maybe its just me) it seems like this just doesn&#x27;t scrub as well as some other products i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> There is no seal between the lid and bottle; and the top flips open with very little pressure. This might be convenient in the shower, but it&#x27;s terrible when the bottle opens during delivery and spills body wash over everything else in the order. It&#x27;s not worth the time and hassle of returning or replacing other items, especially when this is not a returnable item. If you must order it, order it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the issue with the lid, the body wash left residue on my hands. It seems to be a different formula than the bottles and jars sold in physical stores.</li>
            <li> Now I love this along with the face scrub  since it seems to exfoliate as well as leaving you soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> cleans well and smell good too</li>
            <li> Thankfully the other items were in platic, and alike in purchased so there was no damage done. Just a mess. I love St. Ives as a product, the Apricot scrub is great, and is priced well here. However I will definetly not buy it here again do to the messy experience I got to clean up upon its arrival.</li>
            <li> not too rough but still exfoliated and works well! i would recommend to a friend anytime. thats all. from kristen</li>
            <li> Nice smell, nice body wash, not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Love the body wash. It&#x27;s my favorite &amp; it&#x27;s not in stores anymore which is not easy fiding it. But glad they have it on here.</li>
            <li> Smells great, exfoliates great and feels great when using also.  Feel nice and clean and smell good after showering too.  Can&#x27;t ask more than that.  Skin feels nice and soft too.  Love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This smells good and cleans well, but it&#x27;s filled with plastic microbeads. I&#x27;ve been seeing articles everywhere about how damaging those are to the environment.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell and works great as skin exfoliating</li>
            <li> cheap and smells good and exfoliates</li>
            <li> This was okay, it didn&#x27;t dry my skin. It made my face and skin feel look fresh and smooth.  But the smell is a little too strong and sweet and lingers on the skin. If only it had a lighter smell.</li>
            <li> I always use St. Ives products. I decided to try out this one after using St. Ives Apricot scrub, it has worked wonders for my skin and cleared up my acne. I wanted the same scent and product but in a body wash, and I&#x27;m so happy I found this. It has cleared up some of my body acne (but other St.Ives body scrubs worked slightly better). Regardless it is the same scent, and cleans my skin well. I only wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> This bodywash here!!  this is one of my new favorites I highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;It definnitly smooths ur skin and refreshs You plus its a big bottle!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product we&#x27;ve ever used for our bodies - no allergies, even if apricot pit pieces, doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin but helps keep it soft!</li>
            <li> I love St. Ives products, especially this body wash. What I enjoy the most is the balance between the exfoliating scrub and the soap foam. Most scrubs I&#x27;ve used feel a bit oily and can be harsh on my skin but this is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film afterwards and smells really good. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, exfoliates and smells great (citrus) - its also much cheaper compare to its competitors!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but nice exfoliator. I order this monthly from Amazon and have been happy with it.</li>
            <li> No exfoliating at all.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this the whole shower smells fruity, The exfoliates are all natural so that&#x27;s a plus and it really removes the dead ,dry skin cells off my body.</li>
            <li> After looking around online for a great exfoliating body wash, typically finding over priced soaps that I didn&#x27;t want to risk i found this. I am very picky with soaps after using too many soap bars and body washes cheap and expensive that didn&#x27;t last, didn&#x27;t hydrate, didn&#x27;t glide well, or had cheap containers that if dropped were ruined. Not only is this soap affordable it met all my qualifications. It&#x27;s just a shame this became an add-on item.</li>
            <li> I need to order some more of this product it was very lovely and it lasted longer than a minute my skin feel very silky and soft thank you very</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t too expensive yet it out performed some of the more expensive products on the market. It wasn&#x27;t too grainy. It applied smooth and lattered well. Nice fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and it is great as a body exfoliator. Great price here on Amazon and It came quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Really exfoliates your skin and leaves you feeling like you got a good scrub down :)</li>
            <li> not that great of a product..., and do your self a fever and go to the near supermarket and get it for much less.</li>
            <li> I have been using St Ives for years. It&#x27;s the only body wash my family will use.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the old apricot body wash the new one is good but a little to grainy. We use a lot&lt;br /&gt;And give to friends to try. So thank you for a great product. Hope you go back to&lt;br /&gt;Last version and please put this one back in stores. Thank you</li>
            <li> The soap was too silky and made the shower floor&lt;br /&gt;too slippery.  Fear of falling is something I would&lt;br /&gt;worry about and therefore, not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> smells and works great</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, I was hoping there was more scrubbies in this but even for the lack of scrubbies this is a nice body wash</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have dry and sensitive skin and this product works great on my skin. The grains exfoliates gently without causing any dryness. You can actually feel your skin pores breathing. It makes you feel refreshed. The other best part part is it has subtle fruity apricot scent.love this product.</li>
