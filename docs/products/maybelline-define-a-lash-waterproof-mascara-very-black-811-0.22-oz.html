            <li>Loved it -</li>

            <li>good mascara</li>
            <li>It is a good product</li>
            <li>and I like it because it doesn&#x27;t clump and gives me good length and volume without making my lashes look like spider legs</li>
            <li>Easy decision, buy it!!</li>
            <li>It goes on perfectly in one coat - it lengthens and volumizes without being clumpy or goopy and the brush does a great job of separating the lashes, so it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>

            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>will keep buying and hope the price will not go up :))))</li>
            <li>After trying several mascaras, this one is the one that works best for me!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best waterproof mascara I have every used!!  </li>
            <li>it has the same job as for brown mascara, Love it Love it!!!</li>
            <li>best mascara, i love it, makes my lashes look so long, I am always getting asked if I am wearing falsies</li>
            <li>This was a present for my mom, and she told me it resulted very good</li>
            <li>easy to remove with waterproof eye</li>
            <li>The formula does not flake throughout the day and it is waterproof but easy to remove with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars instead of one because the formula itself is probably fine</li>
            <li>My wife was reluctant to buy a product like this on Amazon, but lets say the $2 it saved us made her smile and agree in the end that Amazon is the place to shop!</li>
            <li>It can be layered for a more dramatic effect, but one application is perfect for daytime.</li>
            <li>The brush is the perfect size to apply even at the hard to get to lashes in the corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay super close attention to the package, so didn&#x27;t even realize this was a feature until after I bought</li>
            <li>I love to just put on layer after layer of this; it is a staple in my make up bag; will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>This mascara is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I have straight and fine lashes.</li>
            <li>Defines my lashes individually for a great wow factor!</li>
            <li>The wand has proven useful in separating my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascare, goes on evenly and lenghtens lashes so naturally.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything special for my lashes, but it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do exactly what the product description said.</li>
            <li>When I found out I could buy a whole year&#x27;s worth of this for the cost of one tube of Benefit, this snob got over herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very short lashes, so I decided to try a mascara that would show more length.  </li>
            <li>(easy, no clumps, one coat does it and dries quickly), what it does (long, skinny, defined wall of fluttery lashes), how it wears (all darn day, no flaking), and how it comes off (it&#x27;s stubborn, you need remover and take your time).  </li>
            <li>Holds the curl very well and does not smudge after applying eye drops.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>

            <li>real</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real Mascara since the day it hit the market.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real in how it applies</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it is really waterproof, and stays on forever.  </li>
            <li>It really is meant for people with thicker lashes.</li>
            <li>I HAVE to curl my lashes or they go in every direction and are stick straight.  </li>
            <li>Then, why oh why is the top and bottom of the brush bigger than the middle??  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I tried a little jojoba oil to remove it, and even then, most of it still stayed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not dramatic effect, just consistent result that does not run nor smear all day (pretty active outdoors).</li>
            <li>&quot; - I mean, it&#x27;s waterproof yet comes off nicely with a mascara remover.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d had a different brush in the right size, I may have tried that.  </li>
            <li>You will, unless you are 100% unskilled or completely new to mascara application.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara is super dry inside!</li>
            <li>I will say that if you do cry (like a sob fest) this will get messed up but normal tears because of wind or what have you will not mess up the look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying it, I have to say the only thing that really impresses me is its ability to STAY PUT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nearly identical to</li>
            <li>brush is way to soft to even define the lashes.</li>
            <li>I really like the red version.</li>
            <li>It looks decent, not a lot of volume, and wasn&#x27;t totally clump-free (just a couple I had to take care of).</li>
            <li>will say, the brush does seem weird at first - so bendy, you think you won&#x27;t ever be able to get enough friction going to coat and lengthen your lashes.  </li>
            <li>Went to a local store and was surprised to see the price of this product.  </li>
            <li>for how it looks, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not much better than most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>After applying several coats, it still looks like I&#x27;m barely wearing any mascara</li>
            <li>The brush bends too easy, it almost seems broken.</li>
            <li>My go to, everyday mascara---classic long, lovely lashes with minimal effort....just the way I like it!!!</li>

            <li> My go to, everyday mascara---classic long, lovely lashes with minimal effort....just the way I like it!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s great if you need an insanely waterproof mascara, but just all right for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Some wands make my lashes clump, or are hard to use without poking my eye, but with a straight stem such as this mascara has, my results are just as I hoped they would be.</li>
            <li> I am truly surprised to see this mascara rated with anything less than 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as this tube lasts, but probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I am complimented all the time on how long my lashes look.</li>
            <li> lengthens my lashes  and lasts a long time---wears well.  </li>
            <li> This one has been quite dry and no coverage.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference in the lengthening nor is the black define enough.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any lengthening effect whatsoever, but that might have been because I was distracted by seeing my lashes all stuck together with gross little clumps stuck to them.</li>
            <li> It also did not extend my short little eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Maybe the vial I received was old, but this mascara, while thick and long-lasting, tended to go on clumpy.</li>
            <li> But for someone who prefers a lighter look and/or isn&#x27;t willing to tolerate more than 1-step application, this was just plain awful.</li>
            <li> The formula (at least in the tube I purchased) was on the dry side, which made my lashes stiff and brittle (a feeling I dislike very much), and made it difficult to apply layer two.</li>
            <li> The tube doesn&#x27;t scrape the excess mascara off the brush as you pull it out, so the brush is always covered in gobs of goopy black mascara.</li>
            <li> I also found the extreme flexibility of the brush completely unnecessary and kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes has a tendency to get a little oily, causing eye makeup to smudge.</li>
            <li> Then while traveling a few months ago, my luggage decided to go somewhere else, and I ended up borrowing this from a friend.  </li>
            <li> And because I couldn&#x27;t get it on fast enough, it dried and then it looked terrible as I tried to get enough on to even coat my lashes.  </li>
            <li> This is my go to mascara for the past few months</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, and very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Sure, it stays put all day (even while swimming), but it&#x27;s absolutely miserable to apply.</li>
            <li> However, If you are like me and have hardly any eyelashes, then all it does it clump, lots of  flakes come off.</li>
            <li> I ditched it and went back to my tried-and-true L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic Shocking Extensions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like the brush was afraid to get into the lash and apply color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stupidly tried others after being suckered in by false promises, but always return to THIS mascara.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I like the mascara itself, but really hate the flimsy brush.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this mascara brush,it was in the shape of an L,I have never had a brush come out of the tube like this</li>
            <li> Horrible, would never buy again.</li>
            <li> I promptly returned this awful, awful mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!</li>

            <li> Love this mascara. Do exactly what the product description said. Holds the curl very well and does not smudge after applying eye drops.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my mom, and she told me it resulted very good, it works well and does its work.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this mascara brush,it was in the shape of an L,I have never had a brush come out of the tube like this&lt;br /&gt;before. I won&#x27;t buy this again on amazon.</li>
            <li> Went to a local store and was surprised to see the price of this product.  Decided to pull out my fancy phone and use the app to see the price on Amazon for it.  Yep, Amazon has a cheaper price than the local competition.  My wife was reluctant to buy a product like this on Amazon, but lets say the $2 it saved us made her smile and agree in the end that Amazon is the place to shop!</li>
            <li> I bought it two times. Always my favorite mascara. Brush is good for volume. Just love it. Thanks. I&#x27;ll buy again and agian</li>
            <li> I saw this in the drugstore and liked the look of the brush, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have straight and fine lashes. I can&#x27;t stand clumps at all, so I was hoping this mascara would really define my eyelashes, as the name suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it, I have to say the only thing that really impresses me is its ability to STAY PUT. The skin around my eyes has a tendency to get a little oily, causing eye makeup to smudge. This stuff did not budge or flake all day, even after washing my face with soap and water. I tried a little jojoba oil to remove it, and even then, most of it still stayed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it looks, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not much better than most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. It looks decent, not a lot of volume, and wasn&#x27;t totally clump-free (just a couple I had to take care of). It did lengthen, but not dramatically so. The formula (at least in the tube I purchased) was on the dry side, which made my lashes stiff and brittle (a feeling I dislike very much), and made it difficult to apply layer two. I also found the extreme flexibility of the brush completely unnecessary and kind of annoying. I didn&#x27;t pay super close attention to the package, so didn&#x27;t even realize this was a feature until after I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s great if you need an insanely waterproof mascara, but just all right for everyday use. I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as this tube lasts, but probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice close to benefits there real</li>
            <li> it has the same job as for brown mascara, Love it Love it!!! will keep buying and hope the price will not go up :))))</li>
            <li> I definitely like this mascara. It doesnt clump up although it seems a bit watery compared to what I&#x27;m used to. But for the price it is a very good product</li>
            <li> best mascara, i love it, makes my lashes look so long, I am always getting asked if I am wearing falsies</li>
            <li> I am truly surprised to see this mascara rated with anything less than 4 stars.  Let me preface with this - I am an unabashed make-up snob.  I like high-end stuff.  I had been using Benefit They&#x27;re Real Mascara since the day it hit the market.  Loved it - it&#x27;s PERFECT mascara (as it should be, for over $20/tube).  Then while traveling a few months ago, my luggage decided to go somewhere else, and I ended up borrowing this from a friend.  It&#x27;s nearly identical to They&#x27;re Real in how it applies (easy, no clumps, one coat does it and dries quickly), what it does (long, skinny, defined wall of fluttery lashes), how it wears (all darn day, no flaking), and how it comes off (it&#x27;s stubborn, you need remover and take your time).  When I found out I could buy a whole year&#x27;s worth of this for the cost of one tube of Benefit, this snob got over herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, the brush does seem weird at first - so bendy, you think you won&#x27;t ever be able to get enough friction going to coat and lengthen your lashes.  You will, unless you are 100% unskilled or completely new to mascara application.  If you can&#x27;t handle the brush - your loss - this product is a total gem!</li>
            <li> This mascara is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  The wand has proven useful in separating my lashes.  Waterproof works well.</li>
            <li> not dramatic effect, just consistent result that does not run nor smear all day (pretty active outdoors). easy to remove with waterproof eye make up remove as well as with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This mascara is super dry inside! Horrible, would never buy again.</li>
            <li> After trying several mascaras, this one is the one that works best for me! Great staying power, doesn&#x27;t clump upon application. I love it!</li>
            <li> I promptly returned this awful, awful mascara. Sure, it stays put all day (even while swimming), but it&#x27;s absolutely miserable to apply. The tube doesn&#x27;t scrape the excess mascara off the brush as you pull it out, so the brush is always covered in gobs of goopy black mascara. You have no choice but to apply A LOT of mascara... and it doesn&#x27;t go on neatly. The brush bristles are too short to actually go between your lashes, so it just glues them together. I didn&#x27;t notice any lengthening effect whatsoever, but that might have been because I was distracted by seeing my lashes all stuck together with gross little clumps stuck to them. The look was borderline acceptable after brushing some makeup remover over my lashes and running a comb through them. Pffsh, as if I&#x27;m going to do that every day. I gave it two stars instead of one because the formula itself is probably fine, it was just the applicator that sucked (and oh man, did it suck). For someone who likes to apply a lot of mascara, and who regularly uses a lash comb and makeup remover to neaten it up after applying it, this might be an acceptable option. But for someone who prefers a lighter look and/or isn&#x27;t willing to tolerate more than 1-step application, this was just plain awful. I ditched it and went back to my tried-and-true L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic Shocking Extensions.</li>
            <li> I have very short lashes, so I decided to try a mascara that would show more length.  After applying several coats, it still looks like I&#x27;m barely wearing any mascara and it didn&#x27;t help to lengthen either.  If I can return to the store, I will.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. It&#x27;s not clumpy,separates the lashes well, good length, and lasts all day. I used to only use washable mascara but if you curl your lashes the curl will not hold. I recommend using the waterproof mascara if you want the curl to hold all day. Just get yourself a good makeup remover to remove it.</li>
            <li> Maybe the vial I received was old, but this mascara, while thick and long-lasting, tended to go on clumpy. I had to use make-up remover to deal with the clumps. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is \\&quot;okay\\&quot; - I mean, it&#x27;s waterproof yet comes off nicely with a mascara remover. It doesn&#x27;t really do anything special for my lashes, but it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is the brush!  It&#x27;s terrible! For starters, the brush is too flimsy!  When I try to put it on, I can&#x27;t press it to my lashes to apply color because it bends away!!  It took FOREVER to get it on this way - it&#x27;s like the brush was afraid to get into the lash and apply color.  And because I couldn&#x27;t get it on fast enough, it dried and then it looked terrible as I tried to get enough on to even coat my lashes.  Then, why oh why is the top and bottom of the brush bigger than the middle??  That added to the difficulties I had. If I&#x27;d had a different brush in the right size, I may have tried that.  In the end, I threw it out and I&#x27;ll keep searching for a good waterproof mascara. Total waste of money, and very frustrating.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used! I am complimented all the time on how long my lashes look. If maybelline ever discontinues, I will be heartbroken!</li>
            <li> I like the mascara itself, but really hate the flimsy brush. I actually took the brush from another tube from another brand and it fits.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!! It goes on perfectly in one coat - it lengthens and volumizes without being clumpy or goopy and the brush does a great job of separating the lashes, so it looks very natural. It can be layered for a more dramatic effect, but one application is perfect for daytime. The formula does not flake throughout the day and it is waterproof but easy to remove with makeup remover. Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wedding and I got hooked. Comes on great, awesome brush, and comes off with washing. Great!</li>
            <li> My go to, everyday mascara---classic long, lovely lashes with minimal effort....just the way I like it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. Great no flaking or caking and color lasts all day. The brush is the perfect size to apply even at the hard to get to lashes in the corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li> The brush bends too easy, it almost seems broken.</li>
            <li> I love this mascare, goes on evenly and lenghtens lashes so naturally.  Easy decision, buy it!!</li>
            <li> One of the best mascaras I have ever purchased. Some wands make my lashes clump, or are hard to use without poking my eye, but with a straight stem such as this mascara has, my results are just as I hoped they would be.</li>
            <li> I love to just put on layer after layer of this; it is a staple in my make up bag; will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it is really waterproof, and stays on forever.  However, If you are like me and have hardly any eyelashes, then all it does it clump, lots of  flakes come off. Used a comb for the lashes but that didn&#x27;t help. I personally would not buy it again. It really is meant for people with thicker lashes. It also did not extend my short little eyelashes.</li>
            <li> good mascara...happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!</li>
            <li> lengthens my lashes  and lasts a long time---wears well.  Sometimes the stores sell out of it so have to order it.  It is a good product</li>
            <li> Great mascara!!  Stays on until you take it off.  Definitely the best waterproof mascara I have every used!!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Every mascara I&#x27;ve tried goes on and looks clumpy, but not this one! I&#x27;m in love! Defines my lashes individually for a great wow factor! I&#x27;ve found my mascara for life!</li>
            <li> brush is way to soft to even define the lashes. I did not see any difference in the lengthening nor is the black define enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and year.  It changes in packages from time to time, but what&#x27;s in it is the ONLY mascara I&#x27;ve tried that maintains the curl you put in your eyelashes with a curler.  I&#x27;ve stupidly tried others after being suckered in by false promises, but always return to THIS mascara.  I HAVE to curl my lashes or they go in every direction and are stick straight.  And then the mascara HAS to hold the curl.  This is the only mascara I can count on to do that.</li>
            <li> This is my go to mascara for the past few months and I like it because it doesn&#x27;t clump and gives me good length and volume without making my lashes look like spider legs</li>
            <li> Not that great. I really like the red version. This one has been quite dry and no coverage. I just ordered a different brand, we will see how that one works.</li>
            <li> This mascara is exactly what I was looking for! I have been using a volume mascara hoping to achieve the results I have gotten with this. I will say that if you do cry (like a sob fest) this will get messed up but normal tears because of wind or what have you will not mess up the look. This is definitely my new go to mascara.</li>
