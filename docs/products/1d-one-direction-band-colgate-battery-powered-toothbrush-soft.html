            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well, sometimes the on button works and sometime you have to play with it to get it to turn on.  I thought it played music like tooth tunes.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this!</li>
            <li> I found this at big lots for 2 bucks. I thought it plays music while brushing. But no. Still a cool brush. Bought it for some one else</li>
            <li> great stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> Thought it had music. Bought another one at Walmart that did. Not worth the $</li>
            <li> It broke after 1 day.</li>
            <li> This was a great stocking stuffer for Christmas! It&#x27;s still going strong and she still loves it! And still have not had to replace batteries!</li>
            <li> Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters - they love all things One Direction!</li>
            <li> disappointing, you can not change the head</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the toothbrush!! I love looking at one direction and everything. But i was a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t sing. But either way it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I assumed that this was the 1D toothbrush (made by another brand?) that plays music.  While my daughter does enjoy looking at the cute boys at toothbrushing time, we were both disappointed that the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t play a song.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter&#x27;s friend. She was absolutely thrilled. She is a big One Direction fan!</li>
            <li> Bought my daughter n her friend each there own, they came with batteries . That was nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a toothbrush. I honestly thought it played music.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I thought it was going to be like the one I bought her last year that played a 2 minute song and it does not play any song at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. Perfect for her 1D love without the music that comes from the other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! It cleans my teeth nicely and isn&#x27;t to rough, it doesn&#x27;t sing, lol..but I love the picture on it! So cute! Reccomend for any directioners! (:</li>
            <li> My daughter loves all things One Direction, including this toothbrush.  And I love that she is more motivated to do a good job brushing her teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  However, after ordering, I found that I could have gotten this same product for a better price at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> My Daughter loved it.  Wish there were replacement brushes for it so she can use it longer.  She brushes her teeth often and would like replacements if possible.</li>
            <li> My Grand daughter loves her tooth brush</li>
            <li> Played music very clearly</li>

            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter, she was so excited!  She was able to use it one time and in the middle of brushing her teeth it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Not great vibration and the battery did not last.</li>
            <li> Quick service&lt;br /&gt;Very durable&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t sing anything :(</li>
