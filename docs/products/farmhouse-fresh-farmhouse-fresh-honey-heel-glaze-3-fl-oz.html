            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>heel glaze (which I never used before) was the perfect finish to a pedicure.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best product I ever use for the feet</li>
            <li>Excellent and practical thank the seller</li>
            <li>This is a great foot product.</li>
            <li>and she was so happy.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful scent - warm with a hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s designed to work on its&#x27; own, as it worked perfectly as an augmentation to the pedicure.</li>
            <li>Great to use when wearing summer flip flops and sandals.</li>
            <li>My feet are happy and my heels feel great.</li>
            <li>I even put some on my husbands feet and he too liked it!</li>
            <li>Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Although the scent is awesome, I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This heel glazed has worked wonderfully even after the first week.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell!  </li>
            <li>nicely packed and shipped.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely and not sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li>The product has really nice smell, nothing very strong.</li>
            <li>I will add that I am a person who maintains her feet in great condition and that I consider them important and worthy of continuous upkeep.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Am buying 2 more jars.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the softness of my feet after use.  </li>
            <li>Love having the brush to apply the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will keep my heels in better shape over the summer.  </li>
            <li>Even so, I consider this a luxury product because of the price, but I love having it and using it while it lasts.</li>
            <li>Absolutely Love this product</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Many times they have 20 percent off.</li>
            <li>i really thought it would help after all the great reviews, but no luck here.</li>
            <li>This tends to work better when I take time to rub it in with lotion</li>
            <li>but I do love this product.</li>
            <li>I found it by getting a pedicure at the spa and learned it&#x27;s on one of Oprah&#x27;s favorite product lists.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and texture a lot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends.</li>
            <li>I bought my first jar of Honey Heel Glaze at a spa -- smells good.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with having found the right combination of products.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product from farm house fresh</li>
            <li>It smells so wonderful and leaves her feet feeling nice and soft -- especially her heels, which are often callused from being on her feet all the time.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly too!</li>
            <li>and there is no need to use a huge amount of this product.</li>
            <li>i paired it with nice heel scrub and it seems to really work well.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night under socks to bed and have baby smooth heels</li>
            <li>With $49 you get free shipping.</li>
            <li>(the little brush is very nice!)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We had SOOO much fun!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use not dirty</li>
            <li>I received this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift recently and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 5 days and not only does it smell amazing,</li>
            <li>The aroma and and feel make it worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try and not sticky but you can tell you have a product on.</li>
            <li>Much better off with a good moisturizing lotion and some thick socks to wear overnight!</li>
            <li>SOOOOO glad I gave a try to an unknown product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note to the lower star rating - your heels MUST be filed and exfoliated in order for a product like this to work accurately.  </li>
            <li>Smelled good, felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom and just a little dab will do you...</li>
            <li>make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think that a couple that&#x27;s 55 years young would have benefitted more from a spa tech doing our Spa Day, BUT we put a date on the calendar to have the same type of 1/2 day together in exactly 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need the brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Made the purchase because the product was one of Oprah&#x27;s favorites, and the accompanying description led me to believe it was borderline magic for the rough skin on feet.  </li>
            <li>This has absolutely transformed my cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product, but use it with lotion and rub it in and then put socks on to keep moisture in.</li>
            <li>Very liquid consistency and in not greasy.</li>
            <li>She really appreciates the ease and convenience of use</li>
            <li>Very over-hyped by Oprah &amp; Co.  </li>
            <li>And it would only cost 1/6th the price for all the products I purchased, including FHF Chocolate Facial (we both loved it), The Naked Bee Orange Blossum Honey Body Lotion, 80 Acres Blood Orange Oil and 80 acres Blood Orange Salt</li>
            <li>my heels were soft and you could see a huge difference compared to using lotion only.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find it for much less money here.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this from a local spa and this was the first winter where my heels didn&#x27;t crack and peel.  </li>
            <li>When we finish this product, in about a year since you only have to brush on a tiny amount with the cute high quality brush for results, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have another product that does really keep my feet soft which I use.  </li>
            <li>such a useful item.  </li>
            <li>I love using the small paint brush to brush the glaze of my feet.</li>
            <li>It works on rough, dry heels better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It makes my feet wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>On top of that we have ALL the product we&#x27;ll need for at least 6-7 &amp;#34;Home</li>
            <li>it suppose to give you soft feet</li>
            <li>First of all, I had to remove all my dry skin as usual,since that&#x27;s the only way (for me) to get that soft heel.</li>
            <li>I can barely believe it, three days and the skin looks virtually normal; no longer blackish and dry!</li>

            <li> My skin is very dry, especially my elbows and even my 3-year-old grand-daughter was &amp;#34;worried&amp;#34; about the skin there.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to repair my cracked and dry heels.  </li>
            <li> Living in Nevada where it&#x27;s dry, heel cracking in the summer is always an issue.  </li>
            <li> I did a few hours and my feet where not dry and scaly anymore!</li>
            <li> It made my feet feel rough &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and already see a difference in my heels.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I apply it every night with dark socks and my feet</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the price tag, at all.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but the product is worthless for heels that need some tlc.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;d just give each other the Spa Day!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a jar of the Heel Glaze sitting around forever, and I thought three nights ago to try putting a little on my arms.</li>
            <li> A little messy.</li>
            <li> i swear i used half the jar and just no result !</li>
            <li> it’s also sloppy and gross</li>
            <li> I tend to have your typical disgusting cracked and super hard (dry skin)heels.</li>
            <li> I tried to get products I could get past my Manly Man.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> I’m really disappointed with this product i have purchased almost every farmhouse masks</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> DO not buy it , and 20$ has gone because of bad cream for feet !</li>
            <li> I bought it and it was sooooo baaaaaddd like it&#x27;s the worst thing !</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For the price and results of this product, I feel that I would have done just as well with over the counter honey. It would have been a lot cheaper and I feel the benefits would have been the same.</li>
            <li> This is a great foot product. Not greasy at all! I would definately recommend it. You don&#x27;t really need the brush. I just put it on with my fingers before bed.</li>
            <li> Love! A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, especially my elbows and even my 3-year-old grand-daughter was &amp;#34;worried&amp;#34; about the skin there. I&#x27;ve had a jar of the Heel Glaze sitting around forever, and I thought three nights ago to try putting a little on my arms. Whoa, did it work! I can barely believe it, three days and the skin looks virtually normal; no longer blackish and dry! I love this stuff. Am buying 2 more jars.</li>
            <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use not dirty</li>
            <li> such a useful item.  i paired it with nice heel scrub and it seems to really work well.  nicely packed and shipped.  shipped quickly too!</li>
            <li> I bought it and it was sooooo baaaaaddd like it&#x27;s the worst thing ! DO not buy it , and 20$ has gone because of bad cream for feet !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like liquid gold! Wonderful scent - warm with a hint of cinnamon. Absorbs nicely and not sticky or gooey. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and already see a difference in my heels. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. A little messy. The aroma and and feel make it worth it.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the softness of my feet after use.  Smelled good, felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom and just a little dab will do you...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 days and not only does it smell amazing, it works well on my heels instantly moisturizing them with the littlest bit of the glaze.  I adore it!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his feet to keep them from cracking.  He has diabetes so it&#x27;s important.  He swears by it.</li>
            <li> Made the purchase because the product was one of Oprah&#x27;s favorites, and the accompanying description led me to believe it was borderline magic for the rough skin on feet.  Used it twice, once with socks on over night and once without.  Although the scent is awesome, I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the price.  Love having the brush to apply the product.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this from a local spa and this was the first winter where my heels didn&#x27;t crack and peel.  I was so pleased to find it for much less money here.  I&#x27;m hoping it will keep my heels in better shape over the summer.  I&#x27;ll update to let you know.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift recently and I absolutely love it! It does what it says it will do and it smells wonderful. I will add that I am a person who maintains her feet in great condition and that I consider them important and worthy of continuous upkeep. Even so, I consider this a luxury product because of the price, but I love having it and using it while it lasts. It makes my feet wonderfully soft. It is also made in America which is an extra bonus for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years. It is like a miracle--especially if you get the sore split open cracks on your heels.  Use it at night or twice a day under socks or stockings.  It truly DOES NOT stain--and even better--it WORKS</li>
            <li> I bought this to give my husband and I a &amp;#34;Spa Day&amp;#34;.  This decision came after checking with the spa at the hotel we were planning to visit in Vegas and finding out a &amp;#34;Couple&#x27;s 1/2 day&amp;#34; service was going to cost us upwards of $600.  So, I said to h€LL with that!  I&#x27;m gonna buy some spa quality products that had an aromatherapy benefit and we&#x27;d just give each other the Spa Day!  And it would only cost 1/6th the price for all the products I purchased, including FHF Chocolate Facial (we both loved it), The Naked Bee Orange Blossum Honey Body Lotion, 80 Acres Blood Orange Oil and 80 acres Blood Orange Salt Scrub.&lt;br /&gt;This heel glaze (which I never used before) was the perfect finish to a pedicure. I tried to get products I could get past my Manly Man. My husband couldn&#x27;t believe the difference a pedicure could make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think that a couple that&#x27;s 55 years young would have benefitted more from a spa tech doing our Spa Day, BUT we put a date on the calendar to have the same type of 1/2 day together in exactly 4 weeks.  On top of that we have ALL the product we&#x27;ll need for at least 6-7 &amp;#34;Home Spa Days&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had SOOO much fun!  I was very pleased with having found the right combination of products.  When we finish this product, in about a year since you only have to brush on a tiny amount with the cute high quality brush for results, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.  SOOOOO glad I gave a try to an unknown product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note to the lower star rating - your heels MUST be filed and exfoliated in order for a product like this to work accurately.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s designed to work on its&#x27; own, as it worked perfectly as an augmentation to the pedicure.</li>
            <li> I bought my first jar of Honey Heel Glaze at a spa -- smells good. It works on rough, dry heels better than anything I have ever used. Great to use when wearing summer flip flops and sandals.</li>
            <li> This has absolutely transformed my cracked heels. I use it every night under socks to bed and have baby smooth heels</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this product</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. The product has really nice smell, nothing very strong. I tend to have your typical disgusting cracked and super hard (dry skin)heels. First of all, I had to remove all my dry skin as usual,since that&#x27;s the only way (for me) to get that soft heel. After I did that, I applied the FHF Heel Glaze WITH my lotion and proceeded with putting socks on. There is no need to use the product overnight as suggested on the label. I did a few hours and my feet where not dry and scaly anymore! my heels were soft and you could see a huge difference compared to using lotion only. I would absolutely recommend this product, but use it with lotion and rub it in and then put socks on to keep moisture in. oh! and there is no need to use a huge amount of this product. I can see that it&#x27;s going to last forever.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Very liquid consistency and in not greasy. I also used on my hands, and after washing my hands the next day I could tell they were softer. I only did one foot to see if there was a difference, and I could feel softer skin on the foot where I used the honey glaze. Check price at Skin Store.com Many times they have 20 percent off. With $49 you get free shipping. Purchase 3 and save $5.80 per jar versus Amazon.</li>
            <li> My feet are happy and my heels feel great. I love using the small paint brush to brush the glaze of my feet. A heavenly treat. Pamper yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a nurse-friend of mine.  She really appreciates the ease and convenience of use (the little brush is very nice!)  It smells so wonderful and leaves her feet feeling nice and soft -- especially her heels, which are often callused from being on her feet all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I even put some on my husbands feet and he too liked it!</li>
            <li> I’m really disappointed with this product i have purchased almost every farmhouse masks i know they are not problem solving they are to pamper your self but this feet mask DOES NOTHING ! i swear i used half the jar and just no result ! it suppose to give you soft feet I apply it every night with dark socks and my feet didn’t change it’s also sloppy and gross i don’t like it</li>
            <li> I liked this product from farm house fresh it&#x27;s the best product I ever use for the feet</li>
            <li> Stunk.  Certainly not worth the price tag, at all. Very over-hyped by Oprah &amp; Co.  I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent and practical thank the seller</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to repair my cracked and dry heels.  i really thought it would help after all the great reviews, but no luck here.</li>
            <li> Horrible product! I get pedicures 2x per month but thouht that this product could be used in between pedicures. It made my feet feel rough &amp; dry. Much better off with a good moisturizing lotion and some thick socks to wear overnight!</li>
            <li> its become the skin shine 👌😘</li>
            <li> This tends to work better when I take time to rub it in with lotion but I do love this product. I found it by getting a pedicure at the spa and learned it&#x27;s on one of Oprah&#x27;s favorite product lists. Good stuff. It&#x27;s worth a try and not sticky but you can tell you have a product on.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but the product is worthless for heels that need some tlc.  Used it multiple times overnight with socks on.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture a lot.  Does it work - maybe not.  I have another product that does really keep my feet soft which I use.  I&#x27;ll use this up because I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Living in Nevada where it&#x27;s dry, heel cracking in the summer is always an issue.  This heel glazed has worked wonderfully even after the first week.  I love the smell!  I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends.</li>
