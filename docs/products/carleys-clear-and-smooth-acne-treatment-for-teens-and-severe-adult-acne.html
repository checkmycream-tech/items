            <li>but it&#x27;s good....</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase - HUGE bottle, lovely soap, great samples.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m also thrilled with their customer service and packaging.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling wonderful with a natural cleanse.</li>
            <li>but I just asked my husband if he could order me more of \\&quot;my face stuff\\</li>
            <li>I am from Indonesia, have tried so many products before.</li>
            <li>My face still had break outs or more.</li>
            <li>My now 15-year-old son has now been using this combination for more than six months.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and her skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I sure did.</li>
            <li>I think I would have done better if I&#x27;d rubbed rat poison on my face.</li>
            <li>Will buy again :)</li>
            <li>Love love love Carley&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I can tell he is much more comfortable and confident having now that he has clearer skin.  </li>
            <li>I ended up reporting them to paypal the best I could since when reporting I was limited in the amount of words allowed...</li>
            <li>This 5% scrub is what really demolished my stubborn acne for good.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is a miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li>This is quite a strong treatment with 5% benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li>I am loyal!</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s ok though, the bar is super reasonable to purchase and having extra lying around is GREAT!</li>
            <li>So yeah, amazing really doesn&#x27;t describe it.</li>
            <li>I have a quite strong acne problem since elementary school.</li>
            <li>The bar is seriously THE BEST part of the process.</li>
            <li>Love that this product is all natural, made in the USA, and it works!</li>
            <li>You can FEEL the difference the first time using this product!</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be stronger, more effective, but we are not seeing the results that the previous provided.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 5 years now.</li>
            <li>I have used so many other things, and nothing can compare to the results I am enjoying now.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>They send a free bar of soap (excellent quality and all natural) and several small free trials of their products as well.</li>
            <li>Although there were some free samples provided for the lotions and what not, I did not find much value in them and they seemed to contribute to the oily problem I suffered having already very oily skin.</li>
            <li>It is enough, so you don&#x27;t have to spend too many time washing your face.</li>
            <li>And thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>Your skin might feel a bit &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; the first week, but it goes away...</li>
            <li>the natural soap that you get free with each bottle.  </li>
            <li>like that it made my skin feel really clean and smooth other</li>
            <li>Finally I graduated from college last year and thought that if only I knew Carley&#x27;s Clear and Smooth before that, it would have been much better!!</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon the product accidentally, it made last year&#x27;s achievement because it gave my skin acne free.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Carley.  </li>
            <li>Expected a lot more for the price.</li>
            <li>In addition, there were multiple free samples included in our order like samples of skin lotion and even lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Clear &amp; Smooth keeps my skin clear and</li>

            <li>My skin feels so smooth, as smooth as a little babys&#x27; bottom!</li>
            <li>I was surprised that such a unassuming product can deliver such amazing results.</li>
            <li>it is simple and quick to use.seller</li>
            <li>it is simple and quick to use.</li>
            <li>I first purchased Carley&#x27;s original formula face scrub with 2% benzoyl peroxide, but thought my face needed an extra \\&quot;boost\\&quot; to really get rid of my moderate to severe acne flare up.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to order the larger size bottle but the larger size bottle never came.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only external face wash that has kept my skin clean and clear and helped with breakouts.</li>
            <li>Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth Acne Treatment is not only reasonably priced, it is the only treatment I&#x27;ve found thus far, that actually works without drying out your (his) skin!  </li>
            <li>I started having issues with adult acne.</li>
            <li>but based off of my experience I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the review was written by \\&quot;Jill&#x27;s\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>but based off of my experience I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the review was written by \\&quot;Jill&#x27;s\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>BUT THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it lasts me 6 months.</li>
            <li>After using this product in the shower several times wetting my face before applying it I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting much of a result.</li>
            <li>my teen uses this and it really works without over drying his skin</li>
            <li>So far this product seems to be working</li>
            <li>Like other reviews here I think the most underrated aspect of this purchase is the all-natural soap, I only use the acne solution before and during my morning shower but I would rinse and wash my face with the all-natural soap and within days my skin started to tighten and my pores were getting smaller.</li>
            <li>Seriously, you guys don&#x27;t know how glad I am to get it is cleared.</li>
            <li>I mean, other websites last year, gave same good reviews.  </li>

            <li> I mean, other websites last year, gave same good reviews.  </li>
            <li> received a message on ebay from a company called \\&quot;Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth\\&quot; letting me know that they saw my review of the other company&#x27;s stuff and wanted to know if I would like to try their products for free!&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> My son is a typical 15 year old with moderate acne.  </li>
            <li> The bar might not last that long</li>
            <li> The only reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 is because I am reserving judgment for how it works in the long run.</li>
            <li> We tried many over the counter treatments, and Proactive - talk about a waste of good money there - they all dried out his skin horribly!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT COMPLETELY CLEARY ACNR</li>
            <li> Haha, seriously??</li>
            <li> , you look pale all the time and too dry, and after that, my face became immune with it and acne came back), biore, neutrogena, all different anti acne cleansers did not help too.  </li>
            <li> After that, I stopped using the natural soap for treatment (maybe the way I stored it in a plastic container had caused bacteria, not sure though), and instead just used the cleanser once a day.</li>
            <li> I now typically buy both concentrations and mix the two versions for a moderate amount of benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> He has only been using this for a week and already his skin seems softer, clearer and less inflamed.  </li>
            <li> My routine has gotten lazy on the rinsing with soap throughout the day due to being busy and I can tell there is some regression</li>
            <li> they had so many bad reviews on ebay but would then change their account and sell their stuff under another seller name.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> maybe the one bad review below is sincere...</li>
            <li> maybe the one bad review below is sincere...</li>
            <li> We ordered 4 products and received 25% off our entire order (not sure if this is a limited time offer through Amazon).</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the instructions that come with the product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If it is not working, people would realize and flood the net with negative reviews</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 16 yr old who suffers from teen acne.</li>
            <li> While the last round of accutane did clear the worst of the cystic acne, I still suffered the facial spots that would crop up and last for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then one morning when I was running a little late, I used it on my dry face, rubbed it in gentley and then washed it off in the sink.</li>
            <li> I will update my review in a few weeks with how it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> It has got to be the single most destructive product I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used some bad acne products in my time but nothing has ever destroyed my skin like this before.)</li>
            <li> No more stained bed sheets, no more acne medicine on my face over night....</li>
            <li> I will actually be cutting the soap bar into smaller chunks</li>
            <li> I left a bad review....</li>
            <li> I am annoyed reading reviews or comments which said that people were paid to write the reviews for Carley&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I could be wrong ....</li>
            <li> I could be wrong ....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as bad as it was before.  </li>
            <li> This product broke me out like nothing ever has with terrible cystic acne that I am still dealing with.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love that this product is all natural, made in the USA, and it works! No more stained bed sheets, no more acne medicine on my face over night.... Win-win (all around).</li>
            <li> I LOVE Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 5 years now. I have always ordered it off from ebay but I just asked my husband if he could order me more of \\&quot;my face stuff\\&quot; he Googled the product and informed me that they now have it here on Amazon! Which is great since the only reason I was even keeping my ebay account active was to order Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;So here is my story......it&#x27;s long but it&#x27;s good....&lt;br /&gt;Soon after I turned 30 I started having issues with adult acne. I tried everything to clear up my face over a two years period!!! Then one night I was searching on ebay for a solution to my problem when I found a product that I decided to try. The product came from a company that started with the letter \\&quot;J\\&quot;.... I&#x27;ll call it \\&quot;Jill&#x27;s skin stuff\\&quot; as to not incriminate. I ordered a sample bottle....I liked it enough to order the larger size bottle but the larger size bottle never came. I wrote emails back and forth to \\&quot;Jill&#x27;s skin stuff\\&quot; and they gave me the runaround.  I ended up reporting them to paypal the best I could since when reporting I was limited in the amount of words allowed...so I couldn&#x27;t show the emails from \\&quot;Jill&#x27;s\\&quot; and \\&quot;Jill&#x27;s\\&quot; showed them the mailing receipt from when I ordered the sample bottle...and paypal considered that the issue was solved....Errrr....&lt;br /&gt;So I left a bad review....this is when it gets good!&lt;br /&gt;I received a message on ebay from a company called \\&quot;Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth\\&quot; letting me know that they saw my review of the other company&#x27;s stuff and wanted to know if I would like to try their products for free!&lt;br /&gt;Of course I said yes! And within days I received a package with their products...followed the directions and my face cleared up...so I continued to buy from them and 5 years later my skin is STILL clear!!!&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that that \\&quot;Jill&#x27;s\\&quot; company is a copycat company...they had so many bad reviews on ebay but would then change their account and sell their stuff under another seller name.&lt;br /&gt;Now I could be wrong ....maybe the one bad review below is sincere...The one by \\&quot;Anonymous\\&quot;.....but based off of my experience I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the review was written by \\&quot;Jill&#x27;s\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line....&lt;br /&gt;Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth keeps my skin clear and it is simple and quick to use.seller name.&lt;br /&gt;Now I could be wrong ....maybe the one bad review below is sincere...The one by \\&quot;Anonymous\\&quot;.....but based off of my experience I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the review was written by \\&quot;Jill&#x27;s\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line....&lt;br /&gt;Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth keeps my skin clear and it is simple and quick to use.</li>
            <li> Insert obligatory &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried everything&amp;#34; statements here. After accutane 3x over the course of a decade, I felt like I would forever be cursed with cystic and unsightly acne. While the last round of accutane did clear the worst of the cystic acne, I still suffered the facial spots that would crop up and last for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product with the kick-start instructions that were provided and several months later I still have not had to re-order. Like other reviews here I think the most underrated aspect of this purchase is the all-natural soap, I only use the acne solution before and during my morning shower but I would rinse and wash my face with the all-natural soap and within days my skin started to tighten and my pores were getting smaller. My routine has gotten lazy on the rinsing with soap throughout the day due to being busy and I can tell there is some regression but it&#x27;s not as bad as it was before.  I will continue to order again without hesitation and in future orders I will actually be cutting the soap bar into smaller chunks so I can have one by the sink and one in the shower or one to take with me to work. Although there were some free samples provided for the lotions and what not, I did not find much value in them and they seemed to contribute to the oily problem I suffered having already very oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works for me and controls my breakouts. I am loyal! this operation also makes wonderful moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have a quite strong acne problem since elementary school. I am from Indonesia, have tried so many products before. Medications and creams from different doctors, clinics, even treatments like Clearasil, Clinique, all 3 in one products that I have forgot the names, Burt&#x27;s bees, Oxy with 10% benzoil peroxide (quite works but it&#x27;s too damaging, you look pale all the time and too dry, and after that, my face became immune with it and acne came back), biore, neutrogena, all different anti acne cleansers did not help too.  I always had acne regularly. My skin type is oily. Finally I graduated from college last year and thought that if only I knew Carley&#x27;s Clear and Smooth before that, it would have been much better!! Seriously, you guys don&#x27;t know how glad I am to get it is cleared. I am annoyed reading reviews or comments which said that people were paid to write the reviews for Carley&#x27;s product. Haha, seriously?? You can fake so many reviews on Ebay? How?? If it is not working, people would realize and flood the net with negative reviews but it is not the case, right? How come you manipulate the masses? I mean, other websites last year, gave same good reviews.  I stumbled upon the product accidentally, it made last year&#x27;s achievement because it gave my skin acne free. On their website, [...], they have a guarantee. You can try it and if it is not working, just return the bottle. They will refund you all with shipping fee. I tried it in September last year. Believe me, I almost return it because after October, was not working. My face still had break outs or more. After that, I stopped using the natural soap for treatment (maybe the way I stored it in a plastic container had caused bacteria, not sure though), and instead just used the cleanser once a day. It is enough, so you don&#x27;t have to spend too many time washing your face. This is quite a strong treatment with 5% benzoyl peroxide.  Then I waited until November and could see the results after a couple weeks from that. So, it is not instantly working but give it a try and take your time because everyone is different, the skin condition, problem with acne. I already bought 4 bottles because they had promo last month. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My son is a typical 15 year old with moderate acne.  We tried many over the counter treatments, and Proactive - talk about a waste of good money there - they all dried out his skin horribly!  Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth Acne Treatment is not only reasonably priced, it is the only treatment I&#x27;ve found thus far, that actually works without drying out your (his) skin!  I can tell he is much more comfortable and confident having now that he has clearer skin.  Thanks, Carley.  And thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since I was a teenager.  I am forty now, and prior to using this product, continually battled cystic acne.  This product works!  I have used so many other things, and nothing can compare to the results I am enjoying now.  I was surprised that such a unassuming product can deliver such amazing results.</li>
            <li> My now 15-year-old son has now been using this combination for more than six months. He definitely can tell the difference when he hasn&#x27;t used it. Although it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of his acne, it has minimized the severity of the breakouts. He used this regimen in conjunction with the Nature&#x27;s Cure Two Part Acne Treatment System pills (does not use the cream).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and her skin has never looked better.  She tried everything over the counter as well as prescriptions, and nothing worked like Carley&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 16 yr old who suffers from teen acne. Purchased before but a different formula. This was supposed to be stronger, more effective, but we are not seeing the results that the previous provided. Expected a lot more for the price.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY FACEWASH THAT I HAVE USED THT HAS WORKED. IT DID NOT COMPLETELY CLEARY ACNR BUT THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED IMPROVEMENT. I THINK MY PROBLEM IS I SUFFER FROM HORMONAL IMBALANCES THAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTING, BUT THIS IS STILL HELPING A LOT. MY LAST BOTTLE LASTED A YEAR USING IT ONCE A DAY. I HAVE FOUND THAT USING IT AT NIGHT JUST BEFORE BED HAS WORKED THE BEST FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I have been using Carley&#x27;s products for years now and I have never had anything but good results! They also have many more products, including a great range of anti-aging products, on their website.</li>
            <li> You can FEEL the difference the first time using this product! I sure did. My face was instantly smoother, pores unclogged and suffice to say... GLOWING! Just after one application. Be sure to follow the instructions that come with the product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. They also email you instructions, which I feel goes above and beyond in the customer service department. Since I started using this (about a month ago) I have ZERO breakouts. So yeah, amazing really doesn&#x27;t describe it. Pretty sure this is a miracle in a bottle! Another great thing is the size of the product you get... SO MUCH! I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it lasts me 6 months. The bar might not last that long, that&#x27;s ok though, the bar is super reasonable to purchase and having extra lying around is GREAT! The bar is seriously THE BEST part of the process. My skin feels so smooth, as smooth as a little babys&#x27; bottom! Your skin might feel a bit &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; the first week, but it goes away... along with your acne.  Trust me, if you have acne, you need to try this product!</li>
            <li> My son uses this product and swears by it.</li>
            <li> I want to warn anyone who is even thinking about using this product, DON&#x27;T DO IT!! It has got to be the single most destructive product I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used some bad acne products in my time but nothing has ever destroyed my skin like this before.) I think I would have done better if I&#x27;d rubbed rat poison on my face. This product broke me out like nothing ever has with terrible cystic acne that I am still dealing with.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase - HUGE bottle, lovely soap, great samples.  Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> After using this product in the shower several times wetting my face before applying it I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting much of a result. Then one morning when I was running a little late, I used it on my dry face, rubbed it in gentley and then washed it off in the sink. By the end of the day i saw visable results and have been doing this every morning ever since.</li>
            <li> After years of spending money on expensive acne products I finally found one that works andI love it. Its a great product!</li>
            <li> I first purchased Carley&#x27;s original formula face scrub with 2% benzoyl peroxide, but thought my face needed an extra \\&quot;boost\\&quot; to really get rid of my moderate to severe acne flare up.  This 5% scrub is what really demolished my stubborn acne for good.  I now typically buy both concentrations and mix the two versions for a moderate amount of benzoyl peroxide.  Love love love Carley&#x27;s.  I would give them 10 stars if I could.  I also love! the natural soap that you get free with each bottle.  Leaves skin feeling wonderful with a natural cleanse.</li>
            <li> my teen uses this and it really works without over drying his skin</li>
            <li> Update: I continue to use Carley&#x27;s Kick Ass and regular acne face wash. They send a free bar of soap (excellent quality and all natural) and several small free trials of their products as well. This is a great company and I&#x27;m so glad they are selling through Amazon now.    I&#x27;ve been using Carley&#x27;s for years now and it&#x27;s the only external face wash that has kept my skin clean and clear and helped with breakouts. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to be working and it smells great!  I ordered it for my adolescent son who has problem skin.  He has only been using this for a week and already his skin seems softer, clearer and less inflamed.  I&#x27;m also thrilled with their customer service and packaging.  We ordered 4 products and received 25% off our entire order (not sure if this is a limited time offer through Amazon). In addition, there were multiple free samples included in our order like samples of skin lotion and even lip balm.  Awesome!  I will definitely be ordering again.  I will update my review in a few weeks with how it seems to be working.  The only reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 is because I am reserving judgment for how it works in the long run.</li>
            <li> This did not work for my acne at all I did however  like that it made my skin feel really clean and smooth other then that I would not buy again.</li>
