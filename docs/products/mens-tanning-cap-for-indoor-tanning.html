    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>great product all around</li>
            <li>The material is incredibly stretchy, so I&#x27;m not quite sure about the reviews that claimed this product was too snug.</li>
            <li>Sure you could use just a sock , but this is great to have to protect your jewels.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly and I&#x27;m sure it can fit anyone (as it says: one size fits all).</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s just a stretchy ankle sock made out of panty hose material.</li>
            <li>no colon, so I use this over my stoma cap to tan in the tanning bed, im  not a dude but protects stoma from uva uvb rays as I own my own bed</li>
            <li>If it is, I suppose that&#x27;s a nice problem to have :)</li>
            <li>I though this washable condom would be a good way to save money and be environmentally friendly</li>
            <li>They have a great customer service since the first order was delivered &amp;#34;somewhere else&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Item is very comfortable and does the job as described.</li>
            <li>sure beats the alternative though.  </li>
            <li>Will probably order 2 more soon.  </li>
            <li>However, in regards to this being able to function as a package protector, I will say that i tried it once</li>
            <li>To be honest I didn&#x27;t think cotton could block seaman but it did seem to work at first...</li>
            <li>Also good for spray tanning since color takes very far in that \\&quot;area\\</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly on his little Rat head.</li>
            <li>If this item doesn&#x27;t fit then you should thank your parents.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t move around and it&#x27;s really comfortable.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Needed something to keep the special areas from being sun burnt, these will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>The good news is despite the small size, the band is quite comfortable around the top</li>
            <li>works great to protect the little guy.</li>
            <li>This product was a really useful &#x27;tool&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The fabric is very soft and comfortable for a quick tanning session.</li>
            <li>The price point was right</li>
            <li>I have always worn underwear in the tanning bed to avoid exposing certain areas, but this offers a safe and sensible solution to avoid tan lines.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, its pretty great (as a small animal hat)</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth it and very well designed.</li>
            <li>made from soft comfortable material..</li>
            <li>It took some time to get it on the first time</li>
            <li>It seemed relatively sheer, but I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t burned anything down there.</li>
            <li>easy to wash and maintain small and easy to take along with you</li>
            <li>They actually included a free one in with the package.</li>
            <li>Ordered two of these and they are functional and of high quality.  </li>
            <li>and it barely fit the tip, or half a scrote.</li>
            <li>Considering that most tan sessions last from 10-15 minutes, having things a little crammed</li>
            <li>Not worth the money, nothing special here.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit it was to small my goods got toasted</li>
            <li>I am average size and it is a TIGHT fit.</li>

            <li> Thin material that still lets light through, you truly could just use a towel or small sock.</li>
            <li> so it is left like a hat for your little head...  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to start hitting the tanning bed again, and I came across this little item by accident when I was searching for goggles.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected ......</li>
            <li> I used it less the a dozen times (washed twice)</li>
            <li> Protect yourself down under!</li>
            <li> They do seem a little small though as a previous reviewer had pointed out.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it is not effective..  </li>
            <li> This thing is just too small to place my package in!</li>
            <li> And it is a bit uncomfortable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s just a stretchy ankle sock made out of panty hose material. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do though. They actually included a free one in with the package.</li>
            <li> Protect yourself down under! You don&#x27;t want to get out of the tanning bed looking like leather do u? This is definitely worth it and very well designed. The fabric is very soft and comfortable for a quick tanning session. Also good for spray tanning since color takes very far in that \\&quot;area\\&quot; I recommend this to all male tanners! And for the price?! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Does the job, could be a bit bigger but for the price cant complain. made from soft comfortable material.. great product all around</li>
            <li> Not what I expected ......</li>
            <li> It needs to be bigger that is all I can say!!!!  I am average size and it is a TIGHT fit. It took some time to get it on the first time</li>
            <li> Does not work. I have been wearing this for weeks but my penis is not getting a tan. And it is a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit it was to small my goods got toasted</li>
            <li> Item is very comfortable and does the job as described. If this item doesn&#x27;t fit then you should thank your parents.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, nothing special here.  Thin material that still lets light through, you truly could just use a towel or small sock.</li>
            <li> What else can I say? This thing is just too small to place my package in! They need to make em in different sizes!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered two of these and they are functional and of high quality.  They do seem a little small though as a previous reviewer had pointed out.  Considering that most tan sessions last from 10-15 minutes, having things a little crammed sure beats the alternative though.  Will probably order 2 more soon.  The good news is despite the small size, the band is quite comfortable around the top so you don&#x27;t have to worry about feeling like you&#x27;re getting choked by it.</li>
            <li> This thing has a week elastic that rolls up from the bottom so it is left like a hat for your little head...  Will not hug the donuts...</li>
            <li> This product was a really useful &#x27;tool&#x27;. I have to give notice that I used it in my independent film about a rat trying to be a chef. It worked perfectly on his little Rat head. However, in regards to this being able to function as a package protector, I will say that i tried it once and it barely fit the tip, or half a scrote. Otherwise, its pretty great (as a small animal hat)</li>
            <li> Big time tanner and I&#x27;m out in the back yard a lot messing with the flowers.  Needed something to keep the special areas from being sun burnt, these will do the trick.  They have a great customer service since the first order was delivered &amp;#34;somewhere else&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I recently decided to start hitting the tanning bed again, and I came across this little item by accident when I was searching for goggles. I have always worn underwear in the tanning bed to avoid exposing certain areas, but this offers a safe and sensible solution to avoid tan lines. It seemed relatively sheer, but I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t burned anything down there. The material is incredibly stretchy, so I&#x27;m not quite sure about the reviews that claimed this product was too snug. If it is, I suppose that&#x27;s a nice problem to have :)</li>
            <li> got this for a very personal reason, had colon removed, temporary ileostomy no colon, so I use this over my stoma cap to tan in the tanning bed, im  not a dude but protects stoma from uva uvb rays as I own my own bed, stoma is like the inside of your mouth, so when I seen this, I thought hummmmm, and it works.....</li>
            <li> I though this washable condom would be a good way to save money and be environmentally friendly but unfortunately it is not effective..  I used it less the a dozen times (washed twice) and it&#x27;s already getting a hole it it.. To be honest I didn&#x27;t think cotton could block seaman but it did seem to work at first... The price point was right but I&#x27;m going back to using snickers wrappers ....</li>
            <li> works great to protect the little guy. easy to wash and maintain small and easy to take along with you</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly and I&#x27;m sure it can fit anyone (as it says: one size fits all). It doesn&#x27;t move around and it&#x27;s really comfortable. I ordered this on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon and it came that Monday.</li>
            <li> Sure you could use just a sock , but this is great to have to protect your jewels. Takes some getting use to but does the job &#x3D;-)</li>
