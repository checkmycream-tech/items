            <li>The wefts aren&#x27;t the best quality</li>
            <li>but regardless it&#x27;s beautiful !</li>
            <li>I should have known it wouldn&#x27;t be awesome from the price alone</li>

            <li>and I love this wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with some brushing and styling and maybe some curling</li>
            <li>it came out a tiny bit shorter than shown but my friend was still very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Cute design tho.</li>
            <li>Well, it doesnt look like the picture at all but also not terrible.</li>
            <li>I love this wig that I bought for my mannequin head.</li>
            <li>This wig is simply grand.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s awesome overall!!</li>
            <li>It is ok for the price</li>
            <li>This is a cute wig.</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>but hey i love it.</li>
            <li>The picture of the model is so adorable.  </li>
            <li>If my head was the size of a cantaloupe, it would be better.  </li>
            <li>it looks fine now.</li>
            <li>Probably fine for o e time costume use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful soft wig it literally looks like real hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute enough and the price is really pretty great.</li>
            <li>Was a little shorter than i thought it would be its actually a great wig specially for the price, the quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li>so I have to work to get the creases out first for sure..</li>
            <li>This cheap wig is SUPER nice; I&#x27;m not sure how it can be so cheap; but if you want a good chemo wig buy this one.</li>
            <li>and it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>Well, it arrived early and that&#x27;s great, but the color isn&#x27;t nearly what is shown and it only reached my chin instead of being shoulder length, the style was just OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Russian roulette with these kind of products.  </li>
            <li>I resolved the bounce with Hairspray but it shouldnt have happened right away.</li>
            <li>and since this is my first try with wigs the strands are falling out.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty.</li>
            <li>Hair falling out all over the place first time I opened it.</li>
            <li>Really adore this wig!</li>
            <li>And that in itself actually kinda of satisfied me.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a cute short haired wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color looks very natural and it&#x27;s a very pretty hair style.</li>
            <li>a positive note</li>
            <li>Looks pretty close to the picture and fits really well.</li>
            <li>Super soft and feels/looks like real</li>
            <li>I like this wig, although it was much shorter than advertised (it comes to my chin rather than to my shoulders as is pictured on the model.)  </li>
            <li>it looks real from the roots.</li>
            <li>side was much longer</li>
            <li>Wish it was actually light brown instead of strawberry blonde and wish it curled</li>
            <li>much longer than photo</li>
            <li>With more work it might be something I wear out but straight out of the package and with minimal fluffing</li>
            <li>It fits pretty well and it is very soft but it looks super cheap (shiny and obv fake, like something you pickup at the Halloween store) and the hair itself is just lifeless and the curls are uneven and have mostly fallen out, it&#x27;s dented in and wavy in some parts.</li>
            <li>, it is very soft, and I like the feel.  </li>
            <li>shines looks somewhat natural though too.</li>
            <li>At first my hair was an off black</li>
            <li>One went down to shoulder and other one went down to top of ear.</li>
            <li>The color was an orangey/auburnish, VERY thin (you can pretty much see through it), and far too short (my natural hair sticks out in the back unless I position the bangs on this wig way too far above the center of my forehead.</li>

            <li> The bangs are to long and the curls were not bouncy</li>
            <li> The model in the photo must have a tiny head because I have an average sized skull and the hair barely extends past my ears.</li>
            <li> The wig came as pictured, it was longer than I expected it to be</li>
            <li> I donno if I like this one yet or not really...</li>
            <li> It arrived quicker than the expected arrival date, and it looks identical to the photo.</li>

            <li> On time and exactly as expected</li>

            <li> Sides were completely uneven.</li>
            <li> Also, I knew I was in trouble when hair started coming off of it when I took it out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On me, it hardly made it past my ears.  </li>
            <li> so this wig was hard to suit on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what you payed for at least.</li>
            <li> Is not as thick or curly as the photo.</li>
            <li> Its very thin as I expected after reading reveiws but its workable.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m serious 1000/10 &amp;</li>
            <li> Thin on one side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin as hell ..</li>
            <li> I know that sounds weird</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, and obviously fake, but</li>
            <li> Cap was too small, very disappointing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Shorter than it looks in the photo but still cute and very nice looking.</li>
            <li> Way to small,seemed like a child size. Hair seemed ok though.</li>
            <li> The wig came as pictured, it was longer than I expected it to be and it arrived right on time! The wefts aren&#x27;t the best quality but it still looks great and I love this wig.</li>
            <li> The curls at the bottom kind of go everywhere I&#x27;m sure with some brushing and styling and maybe some curling it can look like the picture</li>
            <li> Well, it arrived early and that&#x27;s great, but the color isn&#x27;t nearly what is shown and it only reached my chin instead of being shoulder length, the style was just OK. But, for the price it is what it is I think.</li>
            <li> it came out a tiny bit shorter than shown but my friend was still very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Cap was too small, very disappointing. Cute design tho.</li>
            <li> I donno if I like this one yet or not really...With more work it might be something I wear out but straight out of the package and with minimal fluffing this is what I&#x27;ve got..so I have to work to get the creases out first for sure..The bangs always get me though..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture but beautiful color and since this is my first try with wigs the strands are falling out. What do you expect for a ten dollar wig.</li>
            <li> Cheezy...very unnatural look. Thin on one side.</li>
            <li> I like this wig, although it was much shorter than advertised (it comes to my chin rather than to my shoulders as is pictured on the model.)  It&#x27;s also darker than pictured here. It&#x27;s cute enough and the price is really pretty great. Doesn&#x27;t feel *too* unnatural, just sort of feels like hair with a little bit of hairspray in it.</li>
            <li> At first my hair was an off black so this wig was hard to suit on me.The bangs are to long and the curls were not bouncy rather i would touch them to make it not have cowlicks and they would flaten.I resolved the bounce with Hairspray but it shouldnt have happened right away.This wig now looks gorgeous but I died my hair the same color...actually took awhile for me to realize they are the same.Anyways I take the front of my hair(short bang length all around)and pin it back eiththe bangs and brush it to it looks real from the roots.</li>
            <li> Well, it doesnt look like the picture at all but also not terrible. The color is pretty. Its very thin as I expected after reading reveiws but its workable. Super soft and feels/looks like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;One side was much longer so I cut it and it looks fine now. Its a bob haircut, long in the front and short in the back. So, if you order this product expect something like that.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a Russian roulette with these kind of products.  You might get a chance at a nicer make but you&#x27;ll just have to chance the money.</li>
            <li> The model in the photo must have a tiny head because I have an average sized skull and the hair barely extends past my ears.</li>
            <li> I love this wig that I bought for my mannequin head. I sell hats and headbands on Etsy, so I was very pleased with this purchase. With a little brushing it&#x27;s very beautiful, and it is perfect for what I want to use it for. The color looks very natural and it&#x27;s a very pretty hair style. It arrived quicker than the expected arrival date, and it looks identical to the photo. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Proof you truly get what you pay for. Looked nothing like pictures except for color. Sides were completely uneven. One went down to shoulder and other one went down to top of ear.</li>
            <li> This wig is simply grand. It is comfortable to wear and looks great on me. Makes me feel like a million.</li>
            <li> Is not as thick or curly as the photo. The wig is almost strawberry blonde.</li>
            <li> Not well. It&#x27;s what you payed for at least.</li>
            <li> Way shorter and thinner than as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin as hell ..i wouldn&#x27;t even wear it to a Halloween party lol</li>
            <li> Very cheap. Hair falling out all over the place first time I opened it. Had to throw it away. Probably fine for o e time costume use</li>
            <li> Really adore this wig! Wish it was actually light brown instead of strawberry blonde and wish it curled but it&#x27;s awesome overall!!</li>
            <li> It is ok for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful soft wig it literally looks like real hair! It&#x27;s a bit longer than the picture but regardless it&#x27;s beautiful ! I love it and the price is great shipping was fast plus the wig smells nice I know that sounds weird but I&#x27;m serious 1000/10 &amp;#60;3 love ittttt!</li>
            <li> It is a lot thinner then it looks here. I was it had a bit more body, but I felt good wearing it.</li>
            <li> much longer than photo</li>
            <li> I should have known it wouldn&#x27;t be awesome from the price alone but the reviews were so great I decided to give it a try anyway. It fits pretty well and it is very soft but it looks super cheap (shiny and obv fake, like something you pickup at the Halloween store) and the hair itself is just lifeless and the curls are uneven and have mostly fallen out, it&#x27;s dented in and wavy in some parts. I&#x27;ve brushed it out and will try to set it and hopefully get it looking passable.</li>
            <li> This is a cute wig. Looks pretty close to the picture and fits really well.</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It is beautifully made. Naturally looking hair and and an awesome value.</li>
            <li> A good wig. It&#x27;s shiny, and obviously fake, but THATS WHAT DRAG QUEENS ARE. Over expressive. And that in itself actually kinda of satisfied me. I guess 4 stars is enough for today</li>
            <li> This cheap wig is SUPER nice; I&#x27;m not sure how it can be so cheap; but if you want a good chemo wig buy this one.</li>
            <li> Was one of the best wigs I purchased</li>
            <li> Was a little shorter than i thought it would be its actually a great wig specially for the price, the quality is pretty good. shines looks somewhat natural though too. I like it and i&#x27;m happy with this wig. brown slighly redish as it shines but hey i love it.</li>
            <li> The wig I received didn&#x27;t resemble the picture AT ALL. The color was an orangey/auburnish, VERY thin (you can pretty much see through it), and far too short (my natural hair sticks out in the back unless I position the bangs on this wig way too far above the center of my forehead. In seeing the pictures of others posted here, it almost seems like every person received a completely different wig.</li>
            <li> Way too shiny and you could see the wefts through the hair.</li>
            <li> On time and exactly as expected</li>
            <li> The picture of the model is so adorable.  She must be very tiny, because on her, the wig about reaches her shoulders.  On me, it hardly made it past my ears.  If my head was the size of a cantaloupe, it would be better.  Also, I knew I was in trouble when hair started coming off of it when I took it out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, it is very soft, and I like the feel.  I may try to change the style a bit so it&#x27;s a cute short haired wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price though, this would be good for a Halloween costume.</li>
