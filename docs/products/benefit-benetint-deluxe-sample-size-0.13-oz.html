            <li>This way it soaks in the best.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Has a great scent when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I love this color - it is perfect for someone with fair skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect light shade.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t how it works good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good way to sample the product</li>
            <li>, this is a good solution to taking Benetint with you when traveling.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, it&#x27;s a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to buy it in this purse-friendly size.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this because I had read good reviews.</li>
            <li>I tried it on bare skin...worked wonderful, however, don&#x27;t know how it would work under or on top of makeup as I have yet tried either way.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>It has a rosewater smell that is really lovely and doesn&#x27;t have a taste once it dries.</li>
            <li>I had such issues with my powder blush doing this, and I am so happy that I never have to worry about that again!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The bottle seems to close very securely, which is important with a stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gives you a fresh rosy glow, and my cheeks have a nice flush all day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy full size anymore!  </li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and can be applied in layers to make it darker.</li>
            <li>So easy to use for a touch up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It acts like a stain but wears off very quickly.  </li>
            <li>so I was glad that I tried first!</li>
            <li>This has a light see thru tint to it and is perfect to use on your lips or cheeks for a little added color.</li>
            <li>but overall this looks great on any skin tone.</li>
            <li>As such, the product is great.</li>
            <li>New favorite lip tint/blush!</li>
            <li>They are not sealed, the color is lighter than the real thing and it is more watery, they do not smell like roses like the genuine product and there is a CHEMICAL taste (that reminds me of Windex)</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy the real thing from a reputable seller.</li>
            <li>Swipe on some lipstick for more intense color</li>
            <li>Bottle came 2/3 full and I thought this a lip STAIN?  </li>
            <li>Gives even brown skin, a nice pink fresh post workout kind of tint on the cheeks.</li>
            <li>So easy to achieve the natural and sexy look.</li>
            <li>I will say that after swiping the brush across the apples of your cheeks, you MUST blend the product in quickly.</li>
            <li>Im super sensitive to most cosmetics.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a deep rose color but looks great with my super pale Swedish skin as well as my besties olive toned Cuban skin and my step</li>
            <li>WELL worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it all just came right off.</li>
            <li>While I love the product, the sample size was only 2/3 full</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the full size Benetint and knew I needed to find a smaller version to take when I travel.</li>
            <li>The rose-water scent is lovely, and overall I could not be happier with this product.</li>
            <li>This is pretty expensive for the amount you get, but it&#x27;s the perfect size to take with you.</li>
            <li>Glad I only tried the sample.</li>
            <li>This one is small, but it&#x27;s good for giving it a try to see if you like the color or, like I do, keeping it your purse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order the large bottle when I run out of this sample size and then just refill the sample size for travelling purposes.</li>
            <li>that IS NOT IN THE REAL PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>mom&#x27;s much darker skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they even have the word \\&quot;stain\\&quot; in their title when its very misleading.</li>
            <li>but I guess it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely disappears after putting it on my lips.</li>
            <li>It is also very drying to lips.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a real stain.  </li>
            <li>They pretty much fade away quickly so this benetint is what I use when I need lasting make up.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that you can adjust how light or dark the tint looks on your cheeks, simply by running the brush on the side of the bottle opening to wipe some excess off ( you can always add more).</li>
            <li>I ordered the travel size since I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like using liquid blush (switched from powder), and I am about to order the bigger size of this product because I am totally sold on it!</li>
            <li>When you apply it over top of serums or lotions, the chemicals combine and makes it tend to absorb unevenly or streaky.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural too.</li>
            <li>This product stays on in the exact same amount that I placed on my cheeks ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>Not only does the bottle itself last forever (can&#x27;t even imagine getting the full size one), but it stays on all night.</li>
            <li>I keep it tucked in my purse, in case I need a little extra flush when going out for drinks :)</li>
            <li>I love this little sample size!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly stamped not for sale and yet it was sold to me.</li>
            <li>and I only need to reapply about every 4-6 hours depending on how much eating or drinking I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>Gives you a natural flushed look that you want with blush.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to use this product because it looked so dark, but it is not dark at all.</li>
            <li>It still works fine with a few extra coats, and when I run out I plan to just refill this smaller bottle from the larger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short</li>
            <li>If it left a bit of color behind, I might have said ok.</li>

            <li> I could take it anywhere too, and it&#x27;s lasting me such a long time.</li>
            <li> I do not use it everyday because I have natural plant based things that I use regularly.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the printing on the bottle&lt;br /&gt;rubbed off , almost instantly, I don&#x27;t know if it was sensitive</li>
            <li> Really, it is a strange item.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> This little bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> The color is pinkish, not redish, but not an outright pink color.</li>
            <li> I usually just put on the stain 1-2 layers then chapstick and it will stay on as you drink, eat, talk with very low maintenance.</li>
            <li> I think I might just throw out any other blush I have.</li>
            <li> bottle is rather small but you only need a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After waiting a half hour I wiped a bit off</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might be my imagination, but the formula seems a bit less concentrated than my full-size Benetint.</li>
            <li> Seriously, Benefit is the ONLY blush I use.</li>
            <li> 12 dollars and change is way too much for this tiny bottle of stuff that does nothing :(  </li>
            <li> The applicator brush always tickles a little</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try a little container of it first&lt;</li>
            <li> Its a waste.</li>
            <li> Not gummy or sticky is a liquid that dries in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> If you are using as a lip tint, you will need to reapply every few hours.</li>
            <li> For me this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I usually throw on a little chapstick over it to seal it in while I sip my morning coffee</li>
            <li> Small bottle lasts.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not something unnerving, just a slight tickle like applying a thin lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even leave anything behind in that spot.</li>
            <li> No hint of color behind.</li>
            <li> False advertising.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still expensive @</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin liquid.</li>
            <li> It will fade, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> Well I had read bad ones too but didnt  believe it.</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Im super sensitive to most cosmetics. Need to avoid titanium dioxide- which is in practically everything. This stuff works for me. I do not use it everyday because I have natural plant based things that I use regularly. They pretty much fade away quickly so this benetint is what I use when I need lasting make up. It looks very natural too.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I have the big bottle of Benetint from Benefit and I ordered these samples to use in my purse or during travel.  They are not sealed, the color is lighter than the real thing and it is more watery, they do not smell like roses like the genuine product and there is a CHEMICAL taste (that reminds me of Windex) that IS NOT IN THE REAL PRODUCT.  Who knows what is in here!  I threw mine out.  I would rather be safe than sorry.  Do yourself a favor and buy the real thing from a reputable seller.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. Not only does the bottle itself last forever (can&#x27;t even imagine getting the full size one), but it stays on all night. I usually just put on the stain 1-2 layers then chapstick and it will stay on as you drink, eat, talk with very low maintenance. Swipe on some lipstick for more intense color but overall this looks great on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> The applicator brush always tickles a little but it&#x27;s not something unnerving, just a slight tickle like applying a thin lip gloss. The product itself is not lip gloss texture, however. It is an actual lip stain, not a lipstick that stains or &amp;#34;paints&amp;#34; the lips. It&#x27;s a very thin liquid. I love this product! I have it in two different sizes. This one is small, but it&#x27;s good for giving it a try to see if you like the color or, like I do, keeping it your purse. It has a rosewater smell that is really lovely and doesn&#x27;t have a taste once it dries. It dries very quickly and can be applied in layers to make it darker. I usually throw on a little chapstick over it to seal it in while I sip my morning coffee and I only need to reapply about every 4-6 hours depending on how much eating or drinking I&#x27;m doing. The color is pinkish, not redish, but not an outright pink color. So don&#x27;t expect fire engine red or bubblegum. It&#x27;s definitely a deep rose color but looks great with my super pale Swedish skin as well as my besties olive toned Cuban skin and my step mom&#x27;s much darker skin. It works well with what you&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect light shade. Multiple coats will give you a darker color. It will fade, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a stain but this is not a stain. Not even for a couple of minutes. After waiting a half hour I wiped a bit off and it all just came right off. Didn&#x27;t even leave anything behind in that spot. I don&#x27;t know why they even have the word \\&quot;stain\\&quot; in their title when its very misleading. If it left a bit of color behind, I might have said ok. But nothing. No hint of color behind. And that&#x27;s after FIVE applications. Yeah...I like to test out what I buy. Dont bother spending your money on this. Its a waste. Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Really, it is a strange item. I don&#x27;t how it works good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because I had read good reviews. Well I had read bad ones too but didnt  believe it. I should&#x27;ve listened!! Bottle came 2/3 full and I thought this a lip STAIN?  It only stained the brush but not my lips. SO DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> New favorite lip tint/blush!</li>
            <li> I tried it on bare skin...worked wonderful, however, don&#x27;t know how it would work under or on top of makeup as I have yet tried either way.</li>
            <li> While I love the product, the sample size was only 2/3 full and I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I ordered the travel size since I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like using liquid blush (switched from powder), and I am about to order the bigger size of this product because I am totally sold on it! I love this color - it is perfect for someone with fair skin. Keep in mind that you can adjust how light or dark the tint looks on your cheeks, simply by running the brush on the side of the bottle opening to wipe some excess off ( you can always add more). Or, don&#x27;t, and use the entire amount. I will say that after swiping the brush across the apples of your cheeks, you MUST blend the product in quickly. This product stays on in the exact same amount that I placed on my cheeks ALL DAY. It doesn&#x27;t smear, fade, or get streaky at all. I had such issues with my powder blush doing this, and I am so happy that I never have to worry about that again! The rose-water scent is lovely, and overall I could not be happier with this product. WELL worth the money.</li>
            <li> This has a light see thru tint to it and is perfect to use on your lips or cheeks for a little added color. Not gummy or sticky is a liquid that dries in a few seconds. Cant even feel that it is on my lips. So easy to use for a touch up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> As such, the product is great. Gives even brown skin, a nice pink fresh post workout kind of tint on the cheeks. Adds a lot of color to the face. But beware of the size. Its tiny. Smaller then even a travel pack. But then again. You don&#x27;t need to use much of it on a daily basis. Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy full size anymore!  This was perfect!  I could take it anywhere too, and it&#x27;s lasting me such a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so expensive so I wanted to try a little container of it first&lt;br /&gt;before taking the $40 benetint plunge.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still expensive @ $12....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, it&#x27;s a nice product.  Packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is rather small but you only need a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good way to sample the product first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the printing on the bottle&lt;br /&gt;rubbed off , almost instantly, I don&#x27;t know if it was sensitive&lt;br /&gt;to water on my hands or what, but I guess it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> I think I might just throw out any other blush I have. This gives you a fresh rosy glow, and my cheeks have a nice flush all day. If you are using as a lip tint, you will need to reapply every few hours. I&#x27;ll order the large bottle when I run out of this sample size and then just refill the sample size for travelling purposes.</li>
            <li> Great alternative too blush. Small bottle lasts.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the full size Benetint and knew I needed to find a smaller version to take when I travel. This is pretty expensive for the amount you get, but it&#x27;s the perfect size to take with you. The bottle seems to close very securely, which is important with a stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be my imagination, but the formula seems a bit less concentrated than my full-size Benetint. It still works fine with a few extra coats, and when I run out I plan to just refill this smaller bottle from the larger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this is a good solution to taking Benetint with you when traveling.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Love love love!! This little bottle last a long time. Has a great scent when you put it on. I was hesitant at first to use this product because it looked so dark, but it is not dark at all. Gives you a natural flushed look that you want with blush.</li>
            <li> This product  didn&#x27;t stain as advertised. Glad I only tried the sample. Buyer beware. Bought for a trip so I was glad that I tried first!</li>
            <li> I love this little sample size!! I keep it tucked in my purse, in case I need a little extra flush when going out for drinks :) Seriously, Benefit is the ONLY blush I use. I swear by this stuff. So easy to achieve the natural and sexy look. I know others have commented about streaking. I have only ever had this problem if I apply AFTER I apply face lotion. The trick is to apply to cleansed skin (maybe after toner, but that is it). This way it soaks in the best. When you apply it over top of serums or lotions, the chemicals combine and makes it tend to absorb unevenly or streaky. Just my experience! Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Nice to be able to buy it in this purse-friendly size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly stamped not for sale and yet it was sold to me. I understand the words  not for individual sale but this was stamped not for sale</li>
            <li> False advertising. Rip off. Sent me sample size!!!!! Pissed</li>
            <li> For me this was a waste of money. I bought this as a lip stain after seeing it on a you tube video. I am so disappointed! This product absolutely disappears after putting it on my lips. It is also very drying to lips. I&#x27;ll be returning for a refund. 12 dollars and change is way too much for this tiny bottle of stuff that does nothing :(  I also ordered in another color but hopefully can cancel.</li>
            <li> I like this.  It acts like a stain but wears off very quickly.  I wish it was a real stain.  The consistency is like water.  You apply with a brush.  If you have lip wrinkles it will run into the lines.  I avoid this by brushing it just inside the lip staying away from the wrinkles.  You could also use a lip liner to keep the tinting fluid from running out.</li>
