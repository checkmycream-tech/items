    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These strips are wonderful.</li>
            <li>and these are the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Excellent product though.</li>
            <li>Perfect job.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, best waxing system and all-in-one waxing strips I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The best!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have any problem at all and the finishing oil smells great!</li>
            <li>(Which smells and feels awesome, by the way)</li>
            <li>So easy to use!!!  </li>
            <li>These Moom strips are an excellent value and so easy to use!</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good price and couldn&#x27;t be easier with the strips predone.</li>
            <li>I ma very pleased with the subscribe and save price.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure this varies greatly per person).</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It does come in a nice package that is liquid compatible.</li>
            <li>Well I needed to do it twice in one day because it was not that effective.</li>
            <li>The after wax oil is nice too.</li>
            <li>How do the manufacturers believe it is effective?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see it being effective for your bikini area.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to rub the strips together, I just let them warm up in my hand.</li>
            <li>This is a great product because it works, and it&#x27;s natural, and set at a good price.</li>
            <li>Better than any thing else.</li>
            <li>and I find that these work better than wax in a jar.  </li>
            <li>The box says that the strips can be used more than once</li>
            <li>yeah, takes all the hair away, I do not know what it is but the feel and ease of use was just better with this company and their product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I am a longtime user of Moom in a jar (with fabric strips), as I had never found a better product.</li>
            <li>Love the Subscribe &amp; Save price.</li>
            <li>but it still is better than a shave.</li>
            <li>I love the wax removal oil that comes with the strips as well.</li>
            <li>Simply the best there is.</li>
            <li>These are like ripping the top layer of skin off with the hair.  </li>
            <li>I guess the good part about it not getting all the hair is that it doesn&#x27;t rip your skin off like hot waxing can.  </li>
            <li>I used this product and it works pretty good</li>
            <li>, it had a nice lavender scent, and quickly removed any residue.</li>
            <li>I order the strips because I can cut them to size and a quick rub between the hands, and it is warm.  </li>
            <li>I have never waxed at home, always at the salon, so I wanted something easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These strips are so easy to apply on those areas.</li>
            <li>Good wax and a decent price, cheaper than buying it at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>These work pretty well, and smell really nice.</li>
            <li>the oil jar doesn&#x27;t seal perfectly, so the box shows up with small oil spots and a lovely smell.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I used to really love this product and thought it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of waxing products, but so far these strips work great and are very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I give it a 4/5 because sometimes, but very rarely, the strips don&#x27;t separate correctly and sometimes</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I do think I will not buy them again simply because it is more cost effective to use the jar and the reusable strips.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work that great, but I had thought maybe they got it right it with the facial strips.</li>
            <li>The are pretty sweet!</li>
            <li>These strips were very easy to use, gentle and most importantly: the wax was VERY easy to clean up with the little vial of jojoba/cucumber oil they provided.</li>
            <li>I like these strips better than anything I&#x27;ve tried form a retail store, but the bigger strip box for leg and body is a better value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick 5 min wax, nothing fancy.  </li>
            <li>I loved the other Moom product, the original w/ the strips..</li>
            <li>These are the first wax strips that don&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li>Of course, hot wax is going to work better at getting the hair out at the root, but the short prep time makes this a better choice for me.</li>
            <li>Well worth having to order through the mail.</li>
            <li>I love that this is natural and has no chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price</li>
            <li>But the product is  easy to use, not messy at all.</li>
            <li>this was the first time i had purchased anything to wax my legs.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the oil had leaked out of the bottles when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>First time waxer here.  </li>
            <li>I had my husband help me since after the first pull</li>
            <li>I am able to use one strip multiple times and it still grabs the hair.  </li>
            <li>waxed for the first time at home with these</li>
            <li>I have to do a little clean up tweezing, but out of all the other strips and hot wax I&#x27;ve tried, this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>I tried the strips on my bikini area and my chin, and they just weren&#x27;t strong enough to lift the hair away.</li>
            <li>but really there is only 10 because they do not pull apart easily at all as stated.</li>
            <li>I think the product probably works well on fine hair but not coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the oil that came with it</li>
            <li>The pre waxed strips worked very well.</li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>
            <li>They are much easier to use than the moom wax in a jar (or really any wax in a jar)</li>
            <li>It takes about 4 strips (after you separate them you can use both strips, I find) to do my whole face.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work</li>
            <li>I purchased these wax strips based on other reviewers that said these were more gentle.</li>
            <li>It is true that you can reuse the strips( in the same session) and they still take off the hair.</li>
            <li>Not only are these strips faster, neater, and easier to use than regular Moom, but the results are better.</li>
            <li>The waxing also doesn&#x27;t last even close to the 2 months advertised, I&#x27;m lucky if I can go 2 weeks between waxing</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these</li>
            <li>Have only used for face, but it works fine and with no prep time necessary.</li>
            <li>Now I feel like I need to look for something new.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase these strips and recommend these to others looking for a simple, natural, non-irritating, and economical way to remove hair.</li>
            <li>It is very natural and won&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>The skin is red for an hour or so afterward, but not the stinging that hot wax leaves.</li>
            <li>The strips don&#x27;t remove the hair like hot waxing, and you can only do it once or twice in a two week period.</li>
            <li>Love the small strips, the after lotions works wonders</li>
            <li>I can look past this because I love the product.</li>
            <li>On top of that my skin has not stopped burning for the past hour.</li>
            <li>By far the easiest at-home wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that breaks out</li>
            <li>The only thing I still use Moom wax for is my eyebrows, as these strips really don&#x27;t work well for that.    </li>
            <li>The only downside is having to trim so much excess off the edges but they work quite well.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or any plant allergies, you may want to try something else.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to pay $50+ to have it done professionally and pay for the upkeep.</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised to find that the hair grew back finer and more slowly after using these strips.</li>
            <li>You have to go over the same spot a few times before it is clean of the hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely found all the excess wax by the time I have to re-wax.  </li>
            <li>it was messy and didn&#x27;t get all the hair on the first pull.  </li>
            <li>I also find that, combined with these strips, using rose hip oil every night (which I originally started doing to combat incipient wrinkles) also seems to retard hair growth somewhat.</li>

            <li> It takes practice but it will save you tons of money in the long run (I use it for my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> but this one left a really tacky and hard to get rid of residue, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to leave as much wax residue behind and the oils are truly natural with cucumber oil</li>
            <li> Also they are tiny tiny tiny not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed since the reviews on this product are great.</li>
            <li> Would be curious to know if anyone else had the same experience.</li>
            <li> Not all of it, just enough to make me worried it would be a big mess, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have only used Nair strips in the past which worked fairly well and weren&#x27;t too painful.  </li>
            <li> All it did was create a big sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I have persistent blond \\&quot;peach fuzz,\\&quot; along with a few coarser hairs, on my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even done my armpits by myself, it takes a few goes in different directions</li>
            <li> the box with Moom strips were wet by oil.</li>
            <li> you have to heat in the microwave (including pricey brands like Bliss) to depilatories to other pre-waxed strips</li>
            <li> That was my other beef with waxing...</li>
            <li> So easy to use, least painful waxing I ever felt, barely anything.</li>
            <li> However,I am not sure how one could actually create a product of this type without it being messy, but they are a little difficult to use at first because of the stickiness, the way you have to peel, etc. etc.</li>
            <li> I slowed down</li>
            <li> I had previously used moom body wax that comes in a jar.</li>
            <li> those little bits of wax end up everywhere</li>
            <li> , not sure.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d get small pimples on the edges of where I put the strips.</li>
            <li> Also, the strips are so small</li>
            <li> My face feels weird for a week afterwards, and I get acne the following week.</li>
            <li> That worked, but it was just way too messy and it was too difficult to control  the application for small areas around the eyes.</li>
            <li> They removed all the hair I wanted and wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as other wax strips I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After trying it a few times I was disappointed, it hardly removes any hair if at all.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the oil they give you to remove the wax seems to make me break out.</li>
            <li> The worst ever messy and ineffective might as well have bought the wax.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> thought it would be so painful, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all!</li>
            <li> Way too painful!  </li>
            <li> YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These work pretty well, and smell really nice. I really like the oil that came with it, it had a nice lavender scent, and quickly removed any residue. This is a great product because it works, and it&#x27;s natural, and set at a good price.</li>
            <li> this was the first time i had purchased anything to wax my legs.  it was messy and didn&#x27;t get all the hair on the first pull.  i probably wont get it again</li>
            <li> I have tried creams and waxes to rid the longer peach fuzz on my face. Always a problem with those things.  The pre waxed strips worked very well. Better than any thing else. It is true that you can reuse the strips( in the same session) and they still take off the hair. The skin is red for an hour or so afterward, but not the stinging that hot wax leaves. These strips do not stick to your lips pulling skin off. They have never left tiny blood spots where it ripped skin, not just the hair follicle out. These strips are wonderful. Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this stuff.  First of all, the oil had leaked out of the bottles when it arrived.  Not all of it, just enough to make me worried it would be a big mess, but it wasn&#x27;t. It does come in a nice package that is liquid compatible. The strips don&#x27;t remove the hair like hot waxing, and you can only do it once or twice in a two week period. Well I needed to do it twice in one day because it was not that effective. I guess the good part about it not getting all the hair is that it doesn&#x27;t rip your skin off like hot waxing can.  Maybe I needed to leave it longer or get it warmer, not sure.  But I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. By far the easiest at-home wax I&#x27;ve ever used. It takes practice but it will save you tons of money in the long run (I use it for my upper lip and chin. So embarrassing). I&#x27;ve tried everything from wax you have to heat in the microwave (including pricey brands like Bliss) to depilatories to other pre-waxed strips and these are the best I&#x27;ve tried. Well worth having to order through the mail.</li>
            <li> First time waxer here.  These work really well.  I had my husband help me since after the first pull I slowed down and my results suffered.  I love that this is natural and has no chemicals.  I do think I will not buy them again simply because it is more cost effective to use the jar and the reusable strips.  Excellent product though.</li>
            <li> The worst ever messy and ineffective might as well have bought the wax. Also they are tiny tiny tiny not worth the money at all. DO NOT BUY THESE YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out everytime I wax.  These are the first wax strips that don&#x27;t break me out! I use them to wax my chin, cheeks, upper lip, forehead and sideburns.  I highly recommend these and they are cheaper to buy than getting your face waxed weekly! They are much easier to use than the moom wax in a jar (or really any wax in a jar) and I find that these work better than wax in a jar.  The box says that the strips can be used more than once but I have never found that to be the case.  The wax strips grasp hair quite well and I usually only need one pass on my sideburns and cheeks to get all of the hair.</li>
            <li> Once you master the technique (and can tolerate the discomfort), the Moom strips do as they are promised--the hair does stay away. However,I am not sure how one could actually create a product of this type without it being messy, but they are a little difficult to use at first because of the stickiness, the way you have to peel, etc. etc.</li>
            <li> Perfect job. So so convenient!! Always use oil to remove residue.I wish there was also a medium  size for face.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of use of the product only I wish I could purchase it locally. It is worth the price and I will purchase again. It is very natural and won&#x27;t irritate the skin. It does a good job.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, best waxing system and all-in-one waxing strips I have ever used. The best! Doesn&#x27;t seem to leave as much wax residue behind and the oils are truly natural with cucumber oil yeah, takes all the hair away, I do not know what it is but the feel and ease of use was just better with this company and their product.</li>
            <li> I tried using the strips a couple of times before throwing in the towel on this item. I&#x27;m a little disappointed since the reviews on this product are great. But it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I tried the strips on my bikini area and my chin, and they just weren&#x27;t strong enough to lift the hair away. I think the product probably works well on fine hair but not coarse hair. I&#x27;ve had better results with [[ASIN:B0000691JH Moom Organic Hair Removal Kit, Tea Tree, 6-Ounce Package]], the one that uses a jar and the cloth strips.</li>
            <li> So easy to use!!!  The oil to remove the sticky residue (which is why they work) is a must!!!</li>
            <li> I am a longtime user of Moom in a jar (with fabric strips), as I had never found a better product. Not only are these strips faster, neater, and easier to use than regular Moom, but the results are better. I have persistent blond \\&quot;peach fuzz,\\&quot; along with a few coarser hairs, on my upper lip and chin. I was totally surprised to find that the hair grew back finer and more slowly after using these strips. It takes about 4 strips (after you separate them you can use both strips, I find) to do my whole face. The only thing I still use Moom wax for is my eyebrows, as these strips really don&#x27;t work well for that.    I also find that, combined with these strips, using rose hip oil every night (which I originally started doing to combat incipient wrinkles) also seems to retard hair growth somewhat. Would be curious to know if anyone else had the same experience.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of waxing products, but so far these strips work great and are very easy to use.  I am able to use one strip multiple times and it still grabs the hair.  I have to do a little clean up tweezing, but out of all the other strips and hot wax I&#x27;ve tried, this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and I have noticed that the amount of wax on the strips has gotten thinner.  I used to really love this product and thought it was well worth the price. Now I feel like I need to look for something new.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed at home, always at the salon, so I wanted something easy to use.  This product is so simple and I am hooked.  I will be waxing at home from now on.  Good price and couldn&#x27;t be easier with the strips predone.</li>
            <li> I like these strips better than anything I&#x27;ve tried form a retail store, but the bigger strip box for leg and body is a better value.</li>
            <li> I used this product and it works pretty good it does not get rid of all the hair. You have to go over the same spot a few times before it is clean of the hair.</li>
            <li> Have only used for face, but it works fine and with no prep time necessary. Just rub the plastic strips between your hands, pull them apart to reveal the waxy sides and wax away! Of course, hot wax is going to work better at getting the hair out at the root, but the short prep time makes this a better choice for me. Love the Subscribe &amp; Save price.</li>
            <li> These Moom strips are an excellent value and so easy to use! I was using regular Moom in a jar. That worked, but it was just way too messy and it was too difficult to control  the application for small areas around the eyes. These strips are so easy to apply on those areas. I ma very pleased with the subscribe and save price. I will continue to purchase these strips and recommend these to others looking for a simple, natural, non-irritating, and economical way to remove hair.</li>
            <li> These strips didn&#x27;t work for me at all. All it did was create a big sticky mess. It smells too.</li>
            <li> The are pretty sweet! The only downside is having to trim so much excess off the edges but they work quite well. I&#x27;ve even done my armpits by myself, it takes a few goes in different directions but it still is better than a shave.</li>
            <li> I loved the other Moom product, the original w/ the strips.. but this one left a really tacky and hard to get rid of residue, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> waxed for the first time at home with these and I would definitely recommend them! I have really sensitive skin and I was concerned it might be irritated by the wax but I didn&#x27;t have any problem at all and the finishing oil smells great!</li>
            <li> So easy to use, least painful waxing I ever felt, barely anything. Love the small strips, the after lotions works wonders</li>
            <li> So I read all the reviews on here and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It says there is 20 strips but really there is only 10 because they do not pull apart easily at all as stated. After trying it a few times I was disappointed, it hardly removes any hair if at all. Moving on to something else.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s a quick 5 min wax, nothing fancy.  The after wax oil is nice too. Helps soothe the area and get any remaining wax off.  I order the strips because I can cut them to size and a quick rub between the hands, and it is warm.  I give it a 4/5 because sometimes, but very rarely, the strips don&#x27;t separate correctly and sometimes the oil jar doesn&#x27;t seal perfectly, so the box shows up with small oil spots and a lovely smell.  I can look past this because I love the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased these wax strips based on other reviewers that said these were more gentle. This turned out to be the case with me. I used to use the Veet version of these and I&#x27;d get small pimples on the edges of where I put the strips. Since this was my upper lip and between my eyebrows it&#x27; was rather embarrassing. These strips were very easy to use, gentle and most importantly: the wax was VERY easy to clean up with the little vial of jojoba/cucumber oil they provided. (Which smells and feels awesome, by the way) That was my other beef with waxing...those little bits of wax end up everywhere and I&#x27;ve barely found all the excess wax by the time I have to re-wax.  Good wax and a decent price, cheaper than buying it at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The product has a quarter of an inch strip and is a joke to try to use. How do the manufacturers believe it is effective?</li>
            <li> I had previously used moom body wax that comes in a jar. It didn&#x27;t work that great, but I had thought maybe they got it right it with the facial strips. I was wrong. It didn&#x27;t remove any hair, but it definitely removed skin. On top of that my skin has not stopped burning for the past hour. Also, the strips are so small I don&#x27;t see it being effective for your bikini area. I really wanted this product to work so I could save time and money instead of going to the threading salon. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Did you not watch out when you ship this item? I think the after care-oil was not closed.&lt;br /&gt;The oil spilled almost out!  the box with Moom strips were wet by oil.</li>
            <li> I used these strips on my face, and they work. Unfortunately, the oil they give you to remove the wax seems to make me break out. My face feels weird for a week afterwards, and I get acne the following week. I can&#x27;t seem to get the remaining wax off without using the oil, so I guess I can&#x27;t use these anymore. If you have sensitive skin or any plant allergies, you may want to try something else.</li>
            <li> As a latina, I have unsightly &amp;#34;sideburns&amp;#34; that I have been self-conscious about for years. I had been thinking about waxing for a while but was always too scared and I didn&#x27;t want to pay $50+ to have it done professionally and pay for the upkeep. I heard about these and figured I should try it since they&#x27;re so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be so painful, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all! I love the wax removal oil that comes with the strips as well. I didn&#x27;t even have to rub the strips together, I just let them warm up in my hand. They removed all the hair I wanted and wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as other wax strips I&#x27;ve tried. I only used 4 strips for both sides of my face. These are definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Moom strips are all I ever use on my upper lip etc.  They pick up every hair and the oil that is included  takes the sticky feel away instanly.  Simply the best there is.</li>
            <li> I have only used Nair strips in the past which worked fairly well and weren&#x27;t too painful.  These are like ripping the top layer of skin off with the hair.  Way too painful!  I&#x27;d rather have a mustache than ever use these again!!</li>
            <li> The strips do what they are supposed to provided you follow the instructions. Given that it is wax and you are literally ripping it off your body part, the idea of it being painless is a bit of a fallacy. The waxing also doesn&#x27;t last even close to the 2 months advertised, I&#x27;m lucky if I can go 2 weeks between waxing (I&#x27;m sure this varies greatly per person). But the product is  easy to use, not messy at all. I will be a repeat buyer.</li>
