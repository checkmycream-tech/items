            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very strong and seems to be working good.</li>
            <li>Love !</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing, and it didn&#x27;t take long...saw results after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>These things are amazing.</li>
            <li>good scrub or cleanser and face cloth will exfoliated better than this product.</li>
            <li>Liked it</li>
            <li>If you have oilier or more acne-prone skin, this would be good for you.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I like many people that reviewed this</li>
            <li>and you would get many orders.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, make sure to use stridex medicated pads, which is a BHA.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>Please Amazon lower your price on this, for it is a pretty good product</li>
            <li>Good n fast delivery!</li>
            <li>They stay moist until the last one is used, and they do a very good job of removing residue on the face.</li>
            <li>So quick for a glycolic fix!</li>
            <li>I follow it with moisturizer and finish with a light dusting of Physicians</li>
            <li>I love these so dang much.</li>
            <li>This is a review as well as a quick tip to Amazon and customers who purchase this item.</li>
            <li>These are AHA that is more suitable for normal to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These are great and my facialist said that they are not strong, so no harm to use them.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about spending 12.99 a month on skincare on top of my usual facewash, etc, but honestly the clear skin is worth it.</li>
            <li>I first saw this item in the people style magazine as a recommended product.</li>
            <li>I order these Facial Pads all the time and love them.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the scent and the feel of it initially, but</li>
            <li>I have used for a week and it really helps to brighten my skin.word to the  wise.this item is twice the price on Amazon.the exact product</li>
            <li>It did however feel very soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is making a difference, indeed, as I am very tanned, but am keeping out of the sun (they warn you to stay out of sun when using this).  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item as described.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try them at first since I have sensitive, oily skin and anything with acid in it immediately terrifies me.</li>
            <li>I got the same size of 60 pads at Ulta for $9.98, but the closest to me said they most likely will not be carrying it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend Nip+Fab.</li>
            <li>just a little too potent for my drier skin.</li>
            <li>At this point my skin is soft, hydrated and I feel like I may look a little bit more youthful than my 42 years.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my sensitive skin out at all</li>
            <li>Noticed brighter skin within the first few uses.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately  I did not get any of the benefits that this product promotes that I was looking for I.e. exfoliation and lightening. It did however feel very soothing on my skin.</li>

            <li> This is a review as well as a quick tip to Amazon and customers who purchase this item.I first saw this item in the people style magazine as a recommended product.I have used for a week and it really helps to brighten my skin.word to the  wise.this item is twice the price on Amazon.the exact product is 12.99 @target</li>
            <li> These are great and my facialist said that they are not strong, so no harm to use them. It is making a difference, indeed, as I am very tanned, but am keeping out of the sun (they warn you to stay out of sun when using this).  My complexion is clearer and softer.  I like many people that reviewed this agree, that they can be purchesed for less money. I got the same size of 60 pads at Ulta for $9.98, but the closest to me said they most likely will not be carrying it.  I checked Target as well and only can get it by mail, for my closest stores are out of stock.  There they are $12.98 plus shipping.  Please Amazon lower your price on this, for it is a pretty good product and you would get many orders.</li>
            <li> I picked this product up at a local CVS store and was very disappointed .Any good scrub or cleanser and face cloth will exfoliated better than this product. I am a big fan of glycolic peels but this one missed the mark. I will probably use the remainder as a make up remover but will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item as described. Thank-you!!</li>
            <li> Works great. My acne scars are fading away slowly. These are AHA that is more suitable for normal to sensitive skin. If you have oily skin, make sure to use stridex medicated pads, which is a BHA.</li>
            <li> Love these.  So quick for a glycolic fix!</li>
            <li> A. GREAT product!!! My skin looks amazing, and it didn&#x27;t take long...saw results after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I order these Facial Pads all the time and love them.  They stay moist until the last one is used, and they do a very good job of removing residue on the face.</li>
            <li> I love these so dang much.</li>
            <li> Liked it but I didn&#x27;t see any results. Good n fast delivery!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen and difference in skin.</li>
            <li> Noticed brighter skin within the first few uses. But on a side note, buy these at Target, they&#x27;re like 12 bucks.</li>
            <li> Extent product...just a little too potent for my drier skin. If you have oilier or more acne-prone skin, this would be good for you. I enjoyed the scent and the feel of it initially, but like I said, it dried out my skin too much.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing. I was hesitant to try them at first since I have sensitive, oily skin and anything with acid in it immediately terrifies me. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 months now and I have noticed a dramatic drop in breakouts. I would usually break out maybe once every 1.5-2 weeks, one or two blemishes, and I think it was because I wasn&#x27;t exfoliating enough. I use one in the morning, one at night, so a container of 60 lasts a month.I recommend them to anyone with my skin type. Also, they&#x27;re WAY cheaper at target. I buy a lot of my usual products on amazon, but they&#x27;re $12.99 at target (sometimes go on sale for 10.99). Not crazy about spending 12.99 a month on skincare on top of my usual facewash, etc, but honestly the clear skin is worth it.</li>
            <li> Love ! Helps my skin a lot !</li>
            <li> I have been using NipFab for a little over one week and I am very happy with the results so far. It does not dry my sensitive skin out at all and I have a brighter appearance with noticeably smaller pores. I was hesitant because all previous toners have caused irritation and dry patches. At this point my skin is soft, hydrated and I feel like I may look a little bit more youthful than my 42 years. I follow it with moisturizer and finish with a light dusting of Physicians Formula Youtful Wear Spotless translucent powder. Highly recommend Nip+Fab.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was afraid to try this. It isn&#x27;t very strong and seems to be working good.</li>
