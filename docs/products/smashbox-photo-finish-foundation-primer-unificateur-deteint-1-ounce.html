            <li>Great feeling and looks so much better.</li>
            <li>love love this primer and believe me I have tried a ton at all price points!!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>used it for about a week, definitely love it!</li>
            <li>I will be sticking with this for sure!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this primer!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It goes on so easy and it smooths my face and it feels so great.</li>
            <li>It feels great and skin feels smooth after applying it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so smooth and my makeup looks great all day.</li>
            <li>Your skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I liked the Smashbox primer and might try it again.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice silky feeling and makes foundation glide on easier.</li>
            <li>It really helps my foundation go on flawlessly and stay on all day.  </li>
            <li>it really does create a perfect canvas for foundation, (liquid/powder/cream) concealer, eye shadow, pressed powder, bronzer, blush, or anything else you can think of.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>Concealer\\&quot; goes on smoothly and performs 2x better (and its already a great product) with this primer under it.</li>
            <li>I honestly wanted to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Everyone seems to recommend it, said I&#x27;d love it and it would change my make-up loving life forever.</li>
            <li>Love this amazing face smoother.  </li>
            <li>so now i apply primer first and all day my face stays smooth and perfect!!!</li>
            <li>Love love love this primer!</li>
            <li>the container is completely full but it does not have a good finish for the face.  </li>
            <li>Its makes me face very smooth and shrinks my pores.</li>
            <li>I then proceeded to use a very light mineral powder foundation, blush etc.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my face irritated (which alot of products do), goes on super smooth &amp; makes my makeup look great &amp; stay in place all day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t mask my pores any more than anything else either.</li>
            <li>So, for the price, there&#x27;s no way I can give this any more than just 3 stars.</li>
            <li>but I have found better</li>
            <li>Love this primer.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite of all that I have tried.</li>
            <li>It makes applying makeup so much better.  </li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>What could be better than that?</li>
            <li>Or maybe I had a counterfeit and was better than sephora&#x27;s haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its silicone based which allows makeup to float on top of your skin without caking.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many makeup items ranging from drugstore items to mail-order items (Avon) to high-end beauty/department store items.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Worked ok but pricey.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY primers, but this one topped them all.</li>
            <li>Words cannot describe how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin love this.</li>
            <li>I love,</li>
            <li>I will be trying more of your products.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love love this</li>
            <li>I love it, excelent product</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This product really impressed me and I will definitely buy it again when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>Do not use it any more didn&#x27;t impress me</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for it, maybe it&#x27;s better for people with dryer skin.</li>
            <li>It is so exceptionally light, the texture is very smooth, not sticky.  </li>
            <li>The air was very cool).</li>
            <li>High on my list was the Smashbox primer since I&#x27;ve heard many good things about it from friends and online reviews.</li>
            <li>It has become the most important part of my beauty routine in the morning.</li>
            <li>I think is great quality, but be aware you order the right version for you skin.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite product!!</li>
            <li>Which is fine.</li>
            <li>It prevents the concealer from settling into fine lines throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Even if I don&#x27;t wear makeup that day I always start my gay with this.  </li>
            <li>, it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>This goes on great but does not last all day.</li>
            <li>It is easier to get the makeup on evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Is a light product that has not caused any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>do have combination skin, primarily oily.</li>
            <li>This oil free product helps a lot with my make up.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and silky</li>
            <li>That stuff was fantastic - literally, all day oil control.</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth, not oily, and keeps my eye shadow on longer.</li>
            <li>looks so natural on face and provides a good foundation for makeup</li>
            <li>There are far superior products for this purpose.</li>
            <li>So the primer works great, but I have super sensitive (and super oily) skin</li>
            <li>The best so far for me is the primer from Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I assumed the product I would be getting had the Breast Cancer Awareness ribbon printed on it, however it was just the original packaging.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>There is a significant difference between using this primer with foundation and applying foundation alone or with another primer.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and no other words can describe this primer other than THE BEST.</li>
            <li>and I knew that even if I loved it, I can&#x27;t see myself committing to pay that much on a regular basis every time it ran out.</li>
            <li>After an 8 hour day at work wearing a full face of make-up, it still is on.</li>
            <li>My makeup does not go on more smoothly, does not last longer, and does not look any better.</li>
            <li>Being reluctant to purchase a full size, I took the sample.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin and only use a light dusting of powder</li>
            <li>but when I changed to the Balm, I quickly realized it was the primer.</li>
            <li>It is very silky, smooth and light weight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says oil free but the first time I opened it, an oil squirt came out the bottle and got me all confused.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, goes on very silky, no obnoxious odor, it&#x27;s colorless, and it does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>High praise!!!</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft and like a fresh canvas and is super light weight feel!</li>
            <li>Does not take much and my foundation just glides on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>On the fourth of July I was going to a barbecue with my boyfriend&#x27;s extended family and, wanting to look nice, used this primer.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>primer is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>On top of many dollars spent.  </li>
            <li>It is definately worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t put it on I feel like my makeup doesn&#x27;t go on right.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the Smashbox product, but I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s a huge difference between it and other</li>
            <li>I can also tell my skin tone evens out a little bit after application too, which is always nice!.</li>
            <li>Price is super super high for one ounce.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job of covering fine lines, especially around the mouth and eyes!</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time two days ago right after my am cleaning routine.</li>
            <li>I bought this after trying a sample size of it in Sephora and it does give my foundation a smooth finish and helps other makeup application go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and have fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>I use a moisturizer first and then apply a pea size drop of this primer.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it evens out the texture of my face.</li>
            <li>A definite top 3 in my book.</li>
            <li>I wear many layers under my makeup starting with moisturizer and sunblock.</li>
            <li>I put on moisturizer first, the primer, then my foundation.</li>
            <li>Thanks Smashbox!</li>
            <li>It did for me exactly what the product said it would do.</li>
            <li>I have naturally pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li>Been hooked ever since I first tried it.</li>
            <li>First tried this at Sephora.  </li>
            <li>I was first using Hourglass Mineral Veil(?)</li>
            <li>- the first primer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely doing a better job of &amp;#34;priming&amp;#34; than Hourglass.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday but so far it works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to my usual DHC brand, both products go on smoothly and help hide pores and imperfections, either alone or when used under your favorite makeup.</li>
            <li>I have combination, super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but this one certainly helps the battle against oil and makeup melt.</li>
            <li>or you have large pores</li>
            <li>It can feel heavy if not applied lightly, but that&#x27;s easily controlled.</li>
            <li>Ifyou are starting to get those fine lines around your eyes</li>
            <li>I much prefer NARS primer to Smashbox for entire face/foundation application (even the light version).  </li>
            <li>This is going straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother, she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>I really like this and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I apply it somehow scared, not knowing if it really contains</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I have never broken out from Smashbox&#x27;s Primer.</li>
            <li>If you are using foundation, this is an absolute must, to ensure your make-up doesn&#x27;t disappear by 10 AM.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s never broken me out</li>
            <li>next time I &#x27;ll try the light version.  </li>
            <li>I was using Revlon&#x27;s Photo Ready before this, straight from the drug store.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this primer!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any gripes about it.</li>
            <li>The primer is really lightweight and does not affect my acne at all (ok, the first week it did take my face a while to get use to, so I did break out a little bit.</li>
            <li>Offers exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>go on a lot smoother and makes your skin more youthful than previous.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my skin has gotten dryer and rougher.  </li>
            <li>need to check it first or find me another brand &amp;#62;: / a cheaper yet better one?</li>
            <li>Maybe I just don&#x27;t like primers but this particular one makes my face feel oily.</li>
            <li>It has been one of the most highly rated primers the last several years which is why Smashbox can charge $36 for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I went ahead and spent the extra money on this one instead of something much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who have oily skin to limit breakout</li>
            <li>If the price were in the $20-something range, even the high $20-something range, I could give this 5-stars.</li>
            <li>After foundation, my pores appeared to be more pronounced as little bumps.</li>
            <li>The Smashbox product is a little watery by comparison, and it seems to absorb into my skin, so I tend to use a bit more.</li>
            <li>Being in my mid-thirties and having oily skin gets old fast.</li>
            <li>A few things before I divulge on how much I love this primer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so a small bead size of this product is enough to glide smoothly on all the face and it gives smooth glow &amp;#34;which</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>It seems friendly to my skin, has no fragrance and works well with all the other makeup products I use.</li>
            <li>this stuff is AMAZING...covers it right up and only takes a tiny amt for the whole face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Size is nice, you only need a small amount on every area.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth allowing your makeup to go on flawlessly lasting all day long!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely control oil but using this with blotting papers throughout the day keeps my makeup semi-fresh looking for 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, so I was surprised this happened to me with the Monistat.</li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft, just silky immediately wherever I place it&lt;</li>
            <li>can apply to sensitive areas like under my eyes</li>
            <li>Wow, how did I makeup before?</li>
            <li>Trying to find a comparable item at a lower price, but so far no luck.</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels - it&#x27;s not oily or heavy at all, and I definitely think it helps my foundation stay on longer.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I find the DHC product comes out of the tube thicker but spreads thinner and more smoothly, so I generally end up using less to get the same effect.</li>
            <li>I mean, sure, it makes my face FEEL good...but as far as the aesthetics of it...</li>
            <li>The product consistency is really  good , with a small amount you can  cover your entire face, so this size of the product i think would last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Also, I was surprised to see that after I put  my powder on (Bare Minerals)</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, where shine is definitely somewhat of a problem.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many primers on the market but Smashbox&#x27;s is the only one that stays put all day and isn&#x27;t too thick or greasy.</li>
            <li>You do need to wash it off before bed, but it comes off easily with ordinary soap &amp; water, or your regular cleanser/makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I applied a little to my freshly washed and moisturized skin and my nose became matte</li>
            <li>: I use a mixture of Clinique Tinted Moisture Surge, Alamay, and Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would rather buy this directly from Sephora next time.</li>
            <li>Product holds up well in high humidity and dry climates.  </li>
            <li>Not only have I gotten my 45 year old mother addicted to it as it keeps makeup out of fine lines she&#x27;s beginning to see, but I&#x27;ve turned complete strangers at sephora on to this stuff when they see me buying it like I&#x27;m in fear of discontinuation.</li>
            <li>I know) because it was recommended by beauty bloggers for having the exact same active ingredients.</li>
            <li>WHEN USED ALONE ON VERY OILY SKIN, IT CUTS DOWN ON SOME OF THE SHINE, BUT NOT ALL OF IT.</li>
            <li>When I apply my stuff the places I&#x27;d rather be covered get covered, I use less, and they stay covered much longer than if I&#x27;d applied the makeup alone.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Creates a smooth, nearly flawless finish.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do a good job hiding them.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product  </li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>

            <li> It feels great and skin feels smooth after applying it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so smooth and my makeup looks great all day.</li>
            <li> Your skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I liked the Smashbox primer and might try it again.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice silky feeling and makes foundation glide on easier.</li>
            <li> It really helps my foundation go on flawlessly and stay on all day.  </li>
            <li> it really does create a perfect canvas for foundation, (liquid/powder/cream) concealer, eye shadow, pressed powder, bronzer, blush, or anything else you can think of.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Concealer\\&quot; goes on smoothly and performs 2x better (and its already a great product) with this primer under it.</li>
            <li> I honestly wanted to love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to recommend it, said I&#x27;d love it and it would change my make-up loving life forever.</li>
            <li> Love this amazing face smoother.  </li>
            <li> so now i apply primer first and all day my face stays smooth and perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this primer!</li>
            <li> the container is completely full but it does not have a good finish for the face.  </li>
            <li> Its makes me face very smooth and shrinks my pores.</li>
            <li> I then proceeded to use a very light mineral powder foundation, blush etc.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my face irritated (which alot of products do), goes on super smooth &amp; makes my makeup look great &amp; stay in place all day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mask my pores any more than anything else either.</li>
            <li> So, for the price, there&#x27;s no way I can give this any more than just 3 stars.</li>
            <li> but I have found better</li>
            <li> Love this primer.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite of all that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It makes applying makeup so much better.  </li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> What could be better than that?</li>
            <li> Or maybe I had a counterfeit and was better than sephora&#x27;s haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its silicone based which allows makeup to float on top of your skin without caking.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many makeup items ranging from drugstore items to mail-order items (Avon) to high-end beauty/department store items.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Worked ok but pricey.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY primers, but this one topped them all.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin love this.</li>
            <li> I love,</li>
            <li> I will be trying more of your products.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love love this</li>
            <li> I love it, excelent product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This product really impressed me and I will definitely buy it again when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> Do not use it any more didn&#x27;t impress me</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for it, maybe it&#x27;s better for people with dryer skin.</li>
            <li> It is so exceptionally light, the texture is very smooth, not sticky.  </li>
            <li> The air was very cool).</li>
            <li> High on my list was the Smashbox primer since I&#x27;ve heard many good things about it from friends and online reviews.</li>
            <li> It has become the most important part of my beauty routine in the morning.</li>
            <li> I think is great quality, but be aware you order the right version for you skin.</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite product!!</li>
            <li> Which is fine.</li>
            <li> It prevents the concealer from settling into fine lines throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Even if I don&#x27;t wear makeup that day I always start my gay with this.  </li>
            <li> , it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> This goes on great but does not last all day.</li>
            <li> It is easier to get the makeup on evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Is a light product that has not caused any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> do have combination skin, primarily oily.</li>
            <li> This oil free product helps a lot with my make up.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and silky</li>
            <li> That stuff was fantastic - literally, all day oil control.</li>
            <li> It is silky smooth, not oily, and keeps my eye shadow on longer.</li>
            <li> looks so natural on face and provides a good foundation for makeup</li>
            <li> There are far superior products for this purpose.</li>
            <li> So the primer works great, but I have super sensitive (and super oily) skin</li>
            <li> The best so far for me is the primer from Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I assumed the product I would be getting had the Breast Cancer Awareness ribbon printed on it, however it was just the original packaging.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> There is a significant difference between using this primer with foundation and applying foundation alone or with another primer.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and no other words can describe this primer other than THE BEST.</li>
            <li> and I knew that even if I loved it, I can&#x27;t see myself committing to pay that much on a regular basis every time it ran out.</li>
            <li> After an 8 hour day at work wearing a full face of make-up, it still is on.</li>
            <li> My makeup does not go on more smoothly, does not last longer, and does not look any better.</li>
            <li> Being reluctant to purchase a full size, I took the sample.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin and only use a light dusting of powder</li>
            <li> but when I changed to the Balm, I quickly realized it was the primer.</li>
            <li> It is very silky, smooth and light weight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says oil free but the first time I opened it, an oil squirt came out the bottle and got me all confused.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, goes on very silky, no obnoxious odor, it&#x27;s colorless, and it does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> High praise!!!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft and like a fresh canvas and is super light weight feel!</li>
            <li> Does not take much and my foundation just glides on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li> On the fourth of July I was going to a barbecue with my boyfriend&#x27;s extended family and, wanting to look nice, used this primer.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> primer is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> On top of many dollars spent.  </li>
            <li> It is definately worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t put it on I feel like my makeup doesn&#x27;t go on right.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the Smashbox product, but I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s a huge difference between it and other</li>
            <li> I can also tell my skin tone evens out a little bit after application too, which is always nice!.</li>
            <li> Price is super super high for one ounce.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job of covering fine lines, especially around the mouth and eyes!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time two days ago right after my am cleaning routine.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying a sample size of it in Sephora and it does give my foundation a smooth finish and helps other makeup application go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and have fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> I use a moisturizer first and then apply a pea size drop of this primer.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it evens out the texture of my face.</li>
            <li> A definite top 3 in my book.</li>
            <li> I wear many layers under my makeup starting with moisturizer and sunblock.</li>
            <li> I put on moisturizer first, the primer, then my foundation.</li>
            <li> Thanks Smashbox!</li>
            <li> It did for me exactly what the product said it would do.</li>
            <li> I have naturally pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li> Been hooked ever since I first tried it.</li>
            <li> First tried this at Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I was first using Hourglass Mineral Veil(?)</li>
            <li> - the first primer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely doing a better job of &amp;#34;priming&amp;#34; than Hourglass.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday but so far it works great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to my usual DHC brand, both products go on smoothly and help hide pores and imperfections, either alone or when used under your favorite makeup.</li>
            <li> I have combination, super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but this one certainly helps the battle against oil and makeup melt.</li>
            <li> or you have large pores</li>
            <li> It can feel heavy if not applied lightly, but that&#x27;s easily controlled.</li>
            <li> Ifyou are starting to get those fine lines around your eyes</li>
            <li> I much prefer NARS primer to Smashbox for entire face/foundation application (even the light version).  </li>
            <li> This is going straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li> I really like this and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I apply it somehow scared, not knowing if it really contains</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I have never broken out from Smashbox&#x27;s Primer.</li>
            <li> If you are using foundation, this is an absolute must, to ensure your make-up doesn&#x27;t disappear by 10 AM.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never broken me out</li>
            <li> next time I &#x27;ll try the light version.  </li>
            <li> I was using Revlon&#x27;s Photo Ready before this, straight from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this primer!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any gripes about it.</li>
            <li> The primer is really lightweight and does not affect my acne at all (ok, the first week it did take my face a while to get use to, so I did break out a little bit.</li>
            <li> Offers exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> go on a lot smoother and makes your skin more youthful than previous.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my skin has gotten dryer and rougher.  </li>
            <li> need to check it first or find me another brand &amp;#62;: / a cheaper yet better one?</li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t like primers but this particular one makes my face feel oily.</li>
            <li> It has been one of the most highly rated primers the last several years which is why Smashbox can charge $36 for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad I went ahead and spent the extra money on this one instead of something much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who have oily skin to limit breakout</li>
            <li> If the price were in the $20-something range, even the high $20-something range, I could give this 5-stars.</li>
            <li> After foundation, my pores appeared to be more pronounced as little bumps.</li>
            <li> The Smashbox product is a little watery by comparison, and it seems to absorb into my skin, so I tend to use a bit more.</li>
            <li> Being in my mid-thirties and having oily skin gets old fast.</li>
            <li> A few things before I divulge on how much I love this primer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so a small bead size of this product is enough to glide smoothly on all the face and it gives smooth glow &amp;#34;which</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> It seems friendly to my skin, has no fragrance and works well with all the other makeup products I use.</li>
            <li> this stuff is AMAZING...covers it right up and only takes a tiny amt for the whole face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Size is nice, you only need a small amount on every area.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth allowing your makeup to go on flawlessly lasting all day long!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely control oil but using this with blotting papers throughout the day keeps my makeup semi-fresh looking for 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, so I was surprised this happened to me with the Monistat.</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft, just silky immediately wherever I place it&lt;</li>
            <li> can apply to sensitive areas like under my eyes</li>
            <li> Wow, how did I makeup before?</li>
            <li> Trying to find a comparable item at a lower price, but so far no luck.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels - it&#x27;s not oily or heavy at all, and I definitely think it helps my foundation stay on longer.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I find the DHC product comes out of the tube thicker but spreads thinner and more smoothly, so I generally end up using less to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> I mean, sure, it makes my face FEEL good...but as far as the aesthetics of it...</li>
            <li> The product consistency is really  good , with a small amount you can  cover your entire face, so this size of the product i think would last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, I was surprised to see that after I put  my powder on (Bare Minerals)</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, where shine is definitely somewhat of a problem.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many primers on the market but Smashbox&#x27;s is the only one that stays put all day and isn&#x27;t too thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> You do need to wash it off before bed, but it comes off easily with ordinary soap &amp; water, or your regular cleanser/makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I applied a little to my freshly washed and moisturized skin and my nose became matte</li>
            <li> : I use a mixture of Clinique Tinted Moisture Surge, Alamay, and Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would rather buy this directly from Sephora next time.</li>
            <li> Product holds up well in high humidity and dry climates.  </li>
            <li> Not only have I gotten my 45 year old mother addicted to it as it keeps makeup out of fine lines she&#x27;s beginning to see, but I&#x27;ve turned complete strangers at sephora on to this stuff when they see me buying it like I&#x27;m in fear of discontinuation.</li>
            <li> I know) because it was recommended by beauty bloggers for having the exact same active ingredients.</li>
            <li> WHEN USED ALONE ON VERY OILY SKIN, IT CUTS DOWN ON SOME OF THE SHINE, BUT NOT ALL OF IT.</li>
            <li> When I apply my stuff the places I&#x27;d rather be covered get covered, I use less, and they stay covered much longer than if I&#x27;d applied the makeup alone.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for me other than make my large pores slightly less visible.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so even though it seems a little pricey, it lasts for months and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I cut back on cosmetics to work on my acne, and I&#x27;ve seen a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> in fact, I don&#x27;t think this keeps it on nearly as long as E.L.F&#x27;s $5 primer for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it stays for long time and it doesn&#x27;t give the feeling of suffocated skin .</li>
            <li> The other one I like is about twice the price of this, and I would actually pick this as my number one anyway.</li>
            <li> It also smoothes out my skin as a primer should -- making my clinique foundation slide on easier and not stick to dry skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> i would apply foundation in the morn and by lunch u could see splotches wear the foundation stuck to dry spots etc.</li>
            <li> In the winter this primer smooths out my dry patches.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the price (average of $36 + tax for 1 oz.).</li>
            <li> But, I finally broke down and purchased it on Amazon since I have Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I put it ovn before 7 and by 3pm mt T-zones are starting to shine just a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where the notion that primer is supposed to mysteriosuly make pores disappear or shrink, or generally fix flaws that you know, are meant to be covered by makeup, but for what a primer is meant to do, this does it and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve used foundation for interviews in the last few weeks without a hang-up.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin had some dark spots from sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> A little Goes A long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep my make-up on any longer than any other primer...</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my face was extremely greasy (it wasn&#x27;t the july heat; there have been scattered showers for days.</li>
            <li> i usually use E.L.F mineral primer and Nyx primer for daily use .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any smell like some other primers.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your face look oily like some other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this primer for a few years, it&#x27;s one of only two primers I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t either cause breakouts, or wad up into little balls of &#x27;gunk&#x27; when applying, or make no difference whatsoever....</li>
            <li> I ordered the original formula, but it made me breakout badly after a few days using it, I just figured using it only in some occasions ,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far less expensive than the specific eye primer at $20 for .25 oz</li>

            <li> This helps my make-up stay on all day or night. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but so far it works great, it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> I honestly wanted to love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been seeing the product in my local Ulta for years, wanting so badly to try it on my terribly oily, poorly textured skin. Everyone seems to recommend it, said I&#x27;d love it and it would change my make-up loving life forever. I put off purchasing it all these years because it&#x27;s so expensive...and I knew that even if I loved it, I can&#x27;t see myself committing to pay that much on a regular basis every time it ran out. But, I finally broke down and purchased it on Amazon since I have Amazon Prime. And uh...yeah, I don&#x27;t get it. I mean, sure, it makes my face FEEL good...but as far as the aesthetics of it...it&#x27;s just not there for me. It doesn&#x27;t keep my make-up on any longer than any other primer...in fact, I don&#x27;t think this keeps it on nearly as long as E.L.F&#x27;s $5 primer for me. It doesn&#x27;t mask my pores any more than anything else either. So, for the price, there&#x27;s no way I can give this any more than just 3 stars. Sorry, make-up fanatics...it&#x27;s not \\&quot;for everyone\\&quot; after all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help keep my make-up on my face and this product does the trick!  It also smoothes out my skin as a primer should -- making my clinique foundation slide on easier and not stick to dry skin, etc.  It&#x27;s worth the price.  I&#x27;ve used it every day for over a month and it looks hardly used.</li>
            <li> This goes on great but does not last all day. I put it ovn before 7 and by 3pm mt T-zones are starting to shine just a little. I thought it was my pwder but when I changed to the Balm, I quickly realized it was the primer. I have had worse but I have found better and now I pay less.</li>
            <li> I hate this primer. A few months ago I cut back on cosmetics to work on my acne, and I&#x27;ve seen a marked improvement. On the fourth of July I was going to a barbecue with my boyfriend&#x27;s extended family and, wanting to look nice, used this primer. Now, I&#x27;ve used foundation for interviews in the last few weeks without a hang-up. I should have gone with my gut because I thought I remembered it being greasy. I applied a little to my freshly washed and moisturized skin and my nose became matte so I kept applying. After foundation, my pores appeared to be more pronounced as little bumps. By the end of the day, my face was extremely greasy (it wasn&#x27;t the july heat; there have been scattered showers for days. The air was very cool). This morning I had approximately 3 medium sized whiteheads, 2 average pimples, and one deep, painful zit that hadn&#x27;t been there yesterday. This is going straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li> Works well but not worth the price to me. I bought this after trying a sample size of it in Sephora and it does give my foundation a smooth finish and helps other makeup application go on very smoothly. However, i have also tried Monistat Anti Chafing cream as a primer (sounds weird I know) because it was recommended by beauty bloggers for having the exact same active ingredients. After looking at the ingredients myself and comparing the two, the $6 Monistat works just as well as $38 Smashbox.</li>
            <li> Love this amazing face smoother.  Helps make your foundation, etc. go on a lot smoother and makes your skin more youthful than previous.  I love it!</li>
            <li> The only primer that I use. I have tried many primers on the market but Smashbox&#x27;s is the only one that stays put all day and isn&#x27;t too thick or greasy. It feels like nothing is there. I assumed the product I would be getting had the Breast Cancer Awareness ribbon printed on it, however it was just the original packaging. Which is fine. This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Smashbox Photo Finish definitely did not disappoint! It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth allowing your makeup to go on flawlessly lasting all day long!! It is by far my favorite product!!</li>
            <li> So the primer works great, but I have super sensitive (and super oily) skin so it does make me break out at times.  It doesn&#x27;t completely control oil but using this with blotting papers throughout the day keeps my makeup semi-fresh looking for 8 hours.  I have yet to find the perfect product...but this one certainly helps the battle against oil and makeup melt.</li>
            <li> Love love love this primer! Feels like silk!! A little Goes A long way. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Love this primer. It is my favorite of all that I have tried. Does not take much and my foundation just glides on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Best primer on the market</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my skin has gotten dryer and rougher.  I use a moisturizer first and then apply a pea size drop of this primer.  It is like silk on my face.  It makes applying makeup so much better.  It is easier to get the makeup on evenly and smoothly.  I really like this and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, works awesome and makes my makeup look perfect for many hours! Its a must try product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using DHC Velvet Skin Coat, and when I ran out, I decided to give a few other brands a try. High on my list was the Smashbox primer since I&#x27;ve heard many good things about it from friends and online reviews. So far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the Smashbox product, but I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s a huge difference between it and other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my usual DHC brand, both products go on smoothly and help hide pores and imperfections, either alone or when used under your favorite makeup. For some reason, I find the DHC product comes out of the tube thicker but spreads thinner and more smoothly, so I generally end up using less to get the same effect. The Smashbox product is a little watery by comparison, and it seems to absorb into my skin, so I tend to use a bit more. I&#x27;d say both are about equal when used under makeup, but I prefer the DHC product if I&#x27;m going without...it leaves my face velvety and a bit smoother looking than what I get with the Smashbox product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I liked the Smashbox primer and might try it again. It seems friendly to my skin, has no fragrance and works well with all the other makeup products I use. Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff works sooo good. It makes your skin soft and like a fresh canvas and is super light weight feel!</li>
            <li> Product holds up well in high humidity and dry climates.  Is a light product that has not caused any breakouts.  Would definitely recomend</li>
            <li> A few things before I divulge on how much I love this primer.&lt;br /&gt;I do have combination skin, primarily oily. Moderate acne, especially on my cheeks. Make-up: I use a mixture of Clinique Tinted Moisture Surge, Alamay, and Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works. I was really skeptical, especially because of the price point. The other primers I have used are Victoria&#x27;s Secret Primer and Bare Minerals&#x27; Primer. I decided to try Smashbox&#x27;s since a friend recommended it to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It. Sure. Does. First of all, it evens out the texture of my face. I definitely can see and feel it. It helps my make up go on smoother and stay on. The primer is really lightweight and does not affect my acne at all (ok, the first week it did take my face a while to get use to, so I did break out a little bit. Meaning like two small white heads, but nothing too dramatic). After an 8 hour day at work wearing a full face of make-up, it still is on. How do I know? Because when I take a make-up remover wipe to my face, all of it is on it, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primer is definitely worth it. A definite top 3 in my book. It helps even out your facial texture, keep your make-up on, and makes it also look evenly textured.</li>
            <li> Ifyou are starting to get those fine lines around your eyes or you have large pores (I have both0 this stuff is AMAZING...covers it right up and only takes a tiny amt for the whole face so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WONDERS WHEN COMBINED WITH A MAKE UP SETTER LIKE MODEL IN A BOTTLE TO SET YOUR MAKE UP. WHEN USED ALONE ON VERY OILY SKIN, IT CUTS DOWN ON SOME OF THE SHINE, BUT NOT ALL OF IT.</li>
            <li> this primer goes across skin and perfects every lil imperfection and allows foundation to smooth perfectly on and stays on all day.b4 i used primer i would apply foundation in the morn and by lunch u could see splotches wear the foundation stuck to dry spots etc. so now i apply primer first and all day my face stays smooth and perfect!!!</li>
            <li> There is a significant difference between using this primer with foundation and applying foundation alone or with another primer. It can feel heavy if not applied lightly, but that&#x27;s easily controlled. Creates a smooth, nearly flawless finish.</li>
            <li> I have big pores on my cheeks by my nose area. This product didn&#x27;t really do a good job hiding them. I didn&#x27;t like the texture of it either. It felt to me like plasticy when I put it on. I tried it because of all the rave reviews on YouTube but for me personally it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I like that I get compliments from people when I wear this under my makeup. What could be better than that?</li>
            <li> I sometimes doubt about the authenticity of this product. I had the same primer before, in a smaller size, and this one is not as white nor its consistency feels the same...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says oil free but the first time I opened it, an oil squirt came out the bottle and got me all confused.&lt;br /&gt;Now I apply it somehow scared, not knowing if it really contains oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size is nice, you only need a small amount on every area.So that&#x27;s good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make you skin matte, but I still reapply face powder once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would rather buy this directly from Sephora next time. Maybe they changed the formula, or this is a counterfeit. Or maybe I had a counterfeit and was better than sephora&#x27;s haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to check it first or find me another brand &amp;#62;: / a cheaper yet better one? haha</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. This oil free product helps a lot with my make up. Highly recommended for those who have oily skin to limit breakout</li>
            <li> i usually use E.L.F mineral primer and Nyx primer for daily use . i keep Smashbox for occasions make up ( although i wish to use it everyday but it is pricy :&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;())&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay so a small bead size of this product is enough to glide smoothly on all the face and it gives smooth glow &amp;#34;which i like&amp;#34; .&lt;br /&gt;it stays for long time and it doesn&#x27;t give the feeling of suffocated skin . sometimes i only use the primer for the glow and go out without foundation .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like it . i will buy this again.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. It feels great and skin feels smooth after applying it. The foundation however does not last longer, but maybe that&#x27;s foundations fault.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Photo Finish for years and its the best primer that I&#x27;ve ever used. I wear many layers under my makeup starting with moisturizer and sunblock. On humid summer days my makeup doesn&#x27;t wander in spite of the moist layers. In the winter this primer smooths out my dry patches. Its silicone based which allows makeup to float on top of your skin without caking. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Works as a great primer and oil diminishing treatment. I only use it on my t-zone to keep makeup from slicking off.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!! I won&#x27;t leave the house without this on... EVER! Leaves a nice silky feeling and makes foundation glide on easier. I use less foundation and brighteners because of this product so it also helps on the cost of products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many makeup items ranging from drugstore items to mail-order items (Avon) to high-end beauty/department store items. I&#x27;m all about finding what works and what has the best value, regardless of the price. After trying multiple items, I&#x27;ve found that the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer is what works for me. It goes on smooth and silky, it hydrates, it&#x27;s oil-free so it doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation, and my pores do look smaller and my makeup does last a lot longer. I put on moisturizer first, the primer, then my foundation. The only issue I have is the price (average of $36 + tax for 1 oz.). If the price were in the $20-something range, even the high $20-something range, I could give this 5-stars. It has been one of the most highly rated primers the last several years which is why Smashbox can charge $36 for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to address the Monistat Chafing Gel that I&#x27;ve seen some beauty sites recommend instead of this product. I tried the Monistat Chafing Gel before trying the Smashbox product, and I did it to save money. The consistency and feel seems the same, but I broke out badly that first week. I have never broken out from Smashbox&#x27;s Primer. Even though the Monistat and Smashbox primer feel the same, I do believe Monistat has extra ingredients in their formula that can irritate some people and cause pores to clog. I do not have sensitive skin, so I was surprised this happened to me with the Monistat.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, where shine is definitely somewhat of a problem.  This primer works, but not as well as others I have tried.</li>
            <li> used it for about a week, definitely love it! looks so natural on face and provides a good foundation for makeup</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I wear it everyday. When I don&#x27;t put it on I feel like my makeup doesn&#x27;t go on right. Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> I much prefer NARS primer to Smashbox for entire face/foundation application (even the light version).  But this formula works well for me just under the eyes.  I apply it over my eye moisturizer and then apply concealer.  It prevents the concealer from settling into fine lines throughout the day.  It&#x27;s far less expensive than the specific eye primer at $20 for .25 oz</li>
            <li> Love this product. My skin looks so smooth and my makeup looks great all day. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Your skin looks and feels amazing. It is not greasy or oily at all. It does a fantastic job of covering fine lines, especially around the mouth and eyes!</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this product again not only b/c the container is completely full but it does not have a good finish for the face.  There are far superior products for this purpose.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin healthier then it was , wonderful would purchase again</li>
            <li> The best primer ever !!! I really love this product and no other words can describe this primer other than THE BEST.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for me other than make my large pores slightly less visible. My makeup does not go on more smoothly, does not last longer, and does not look any better. This primer also breaks me out and clogs my pores like crazy, even in the oil-free version. I know this is a cult favorite but off all the primers I have used, this one was the worst for my skin.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  Offers exactly as promised.  I use this with the FX foundation and I&#x27;m happy with their coverage and appearance.</li>
            <li> Worked ok but pricey.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product  It goes on with a softness, but sinks in, and when applying my base, liquid or powder it really helps with the pores.  Very nice.  I have tried MANY primers, but this one topped them all.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how much I love this product.  It is so exceptionally light, the texture is very smooth, not sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t have any smell like some other primers.  If you are using foundation, this is an absolute must, to ensure your make-up doesn&#x27;t disappear by 10 AM.  It also masks any redness you may have.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- My skin feels baby soft, just silky immediately wherever I place it&lt;br /&gt;- My Make up forever \\&quot;HD Invisible Cover Concealer\\&quot; goes on smoothly and performs 2x better (and its already a great product) with this primer under it. (I dont wear foundation)&lt;br /&gt;-absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;-no tint on my brown skin&lt;br /&gt;- no scent&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve been a user for about 9 months and it&#x27;s never broken me out&lt;br /&gt;- can apply to sensitive areas like under my eyes&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s ? none. My skin love this.</li>
            <li> I love, love love this primer and believe me I have tried a ton at all price points!! This is the only one I have found that will even my skin, shrink my pours and battle the mid day makeup melt that I would experience with everything else I have tried with my oily skin. I will be sticking with this for sure! Thanks Smashbox! I will be trying more of your products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!  I have really dry skin had some dark spots from sun exposure.  My skin has never looked better. I use a drop of this , it only takes a drop. Even if I don&#x27;t wear makeup that day I always start my gay with this.  High praise!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it. It did for me exactly what the product said it would do. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The product was received on time, in good condition.  The product consistency is really  good , with a small amount you can  cover your entire face, so this size of the product i think would last for a long time. I think is great quality, but be aware you order the right version for you skin. I ordered the original formula, but it made me breakout badly after a few days using it, I just figured using it only in some occasions ,  next time I &#x27;ll try the light version.  I does make that the make up stay longer.</li>
            <li> this product is perfect! My face  and my makeup looks so much more perfect! I am glad I went ahead and spent the extra money on this one instead of something much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this product. I have naturally pretty oily skin. I was using Revlon&#x27;s Photo Ready before this, straight from the drug store. That stuff was fantastic - literally, all day oil control. Meanwhile, with Smashbox I&#x27;m oily by the time I get to work. Won&#x27;t be buying again, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this primer! Doesn&#x27;t make my face irritated (which alot of products do), goes on super smooth &amp; makes my makeup look great &amp; stay in place all day. Been hooked ever since I first tried it. Doesn&#x27;t make your face look oily like some other products. Would def recommend to anyone looking for a great primer. A little expensive, but worth the price! &amp;#34;You get what you pay for!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep trying to find a better primer when I must already have the best it gets. I am 46 years old and have fine lines around my eyes so I am constantly looking for a primer that will allow my makeup to just rest on the primer and not settle into the wrinkles. You would have thought I actually WANT people to see my lines magnified because that&#x27;s what this product did for me! Ugh! Terrible and way too expensive so I have wasted money again. The best so far for me is the primer from Bare Minerals. I guess I will stick with what works.</li>
            <li> I started using mineral makeup and had a sample of this primer. Wow, how did I makeup before? I&#x27;m not sure where the notion that primer is supposed to mysteriosuly make pores disappear or shrink, or generally fix flaws that you know, are meant to be covered by makeup, but for what a primer is meant to do, this does it and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My makeup stays longer and falls smoother on my face and it is instantly mattifying. I have combination, super sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate a thing. When I apply my stuff the places I&#x27;d rather be covered get covered, I use less, and they stay covered much longer than if I&#x27;d applied the makeup alone. Will be a staple in my kit from now on.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous primers with nothing but disapointing results. On top of many dollars spent.  I had received a sample of this at a counter at Christmas time.  Being reluctant to purchase a full size, I took the sample. Well, the sample disappeared within a week.  I found myself using this everyday.  It has become the most important part of my beauty routine in the morning. A little goes a long way.  My makeup holds to it perfectly and does not bubble or roll off as may primers do. It is definately worth the investment. It is non oily, will not clog your pores and goes on perfectly evenly. Just try it once and you will be hooked!</li>
            <li> It is very silky, smooth and light weight.  It really helps my foundation go on flawlessly and stay on all day.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin and only use a light dusting of powder so I thought primer wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me. I tried this as a sample and LOVED it. It is silky smooth, not oily, and keeps my eye shadow on longer. Also, I was surprised to see that after I put  my powder on (Bare Minerals) my face had a dewy glow that it has never had before. Love love this but I&#x27;m going to have to rob a bank to buy it. Price is super super high for one ounce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this primer for a few years, it&#x27;s one of only two primers I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t either cause breakouts, or wad up into little balls of &#x27;gunk&#x27; when applying, or make no difference whatsoever....and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of primers. The other one I like is about twice the price of this, and I would actually pick this as my number one anyway. You can feel the difference in how your makeup goes on when you use this....it really does create a perfect canvas for foundation, (liquid/powder/cream) concealer, eye shadow, pressed powder, bronzer, blush, or anything else you can think of. It&#x27;s easy to apply, goes on very silky, no obnoxious odor, it&#x27;s colorless, and it does not cause me to break out. You do need to wash it off before bed, but it comes off easily with ordinary soap &amp; water, or your regular cleanser/makeup remover. Highly recommend this primer! A little goes a long way, so even though it seems a little pricey, it lasts for months and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> First tried this at Sephora.  I use it daily with or without putting on makeup afterwords.  It makes your face feel like velvet.  I put it on after my moisturizer and it makes my makeup just glide over my skin.  Great feeling and looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I love it, excelent product</li>
            <li> I had tried tons of primers with little satisfaction. (Mally &amp; Laura gellar to name a few) I absolutely love this stuff. Not only have I gotten my 45 year old mother addicted to it as it keeps makeup out of fine lines she&#x27;s beginning to see, but I&#x27;ve turned complete strangers at sephora on to this stuff when they see me buying it like I&#x27;m in fear of discontinuation. It rocks!</li>
            <li> It is great....I love this product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Its makes me face very smooth and shrinks my pores. Best primer on the market in my opinion. Is a must have in my makeup collection!</li>
            <li> Smashbox doesn&#x27;t dissapoint. One of the best primers on the market.</li>
            <li> I must say I was a little hesitant to buy this product because of the price but I&#x27;m glad I did. Being in my mid-thirties and having oily skin gets old fast. I&#x27;ve always had oily skin and always will. I used this for the first time two days ago right after my am cleaning routine. I then proceeded to use a very light mineral powder foundation, blush etc. I was about 10 hours into my day and no visible shine! This primer did the job. I gave it a 4/5 because I can still feel the oil if that makes any sense, but you can&#x27;t see shine. This product really impressed me and I will definitely buy it again when it&#x27;s time. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Do not use it any more didn&#x27;t impress me</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels - it&#x27;s not oily or heavy at all, and I definitely think it helps my foundation stay on longer. I can also tell my skin tone evens out a little bit after application too, which is always nice!. I don&#x27;t really have any gripes about it.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff. It goes on so easy and it smooths my face and it feels so great. Trying to find a comparable item at a lower price, but so far no luck.</li>
            <li> I was first using Hourglass Mineral Veil(?) - the first primer I&#x27;ve ever owned. But I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it. So I bought the trial size of this one and it&#x27;s definitely doing a better job of &amp;#34;priming&amp;#34; than Hourglass. It feels like it&#x27;s giving my skin a smoother finish before applying liquid foundation. After I use up the trial size, I&#x27;ll be ordering the 1oz.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t like primers but this particular one makes my face feel oily. Don&#x27;t care for it, maybe it&#x27;s better for people with dryer skin.</li>
