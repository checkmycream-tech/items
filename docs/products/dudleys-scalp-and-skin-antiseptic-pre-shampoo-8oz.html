            <li>Awesome scalp cleaner, love it</li>
            <li>To be fair, I didn&#x27;t want to write this review until I was seen by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>my scalp started healing and my hair was longer, healthier, and I truly did not know that I had a good grade of hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product,it work great.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I used it one more time before I gave up.</li>
            <li>it started getting better</li>
            <li>I am so glad someone recommended this product on Youtube.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of shampoo too actually fine a shampoo that helps with the control~ itching~ dandruff all in one.</li>
            <li>I tried it the first day and was happy my scalp was clear I love this product.</li>
            <li>After 2 applications, I am dandruff free.  </li>
            <li>by this time 10 years has passed, yes so you know my scalp is in a full blown war attack</li>
            <li>Now, here is the kicker the smell got better but the buildup was still there not as much</li>
            <li>and this was a mild relaxer my scalp would have sores all over it, my hair was getting stuck to my head because of the sores, which causing me to go bald where I would part my hair.</li>
            <li>You just have to be consistent, but it works!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I purchased and work quite well.</li>
            <li>I saw improvement from the first use with Dudleys.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two weeks (consistently).</li>
            <li>When I went natural and put braids in for a while I was able to use this product each week to keep my scalp clean and the small evaporates leaving smelling clean</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product</li>
            <li>but it was there, check this out, thanks to technology i went to YOUTUBE and looked for my symtoms</li>
            <li>Clean your scalp regularly to see results!</li>
            <li>Definitely a great product that I&#x27;ve used in the past for dry scalp when I had relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>not wanting to wash my hair to often because of breakage and dryness of my hair, did not know that it was causing war to my scalp, after three years people would complain about the smell of my hair here and there, so me being young at that time</li>
            <li>I started out with a relaxer on my hair when I joined the military after working out so much and me being of color</li>
            <li>I had been struggling with dandruff and dry scalp for a while, so far, no itching!</li>
            <li>to early to know long range benefits.</li>
            <li>I finally had enough and decided to go natural low and behold</li>
            <li>Works well, but does leave a strong, medicinal smell behind.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not sure if it really works</li>
            <li> this product helped my daughter a lot with her dry flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> I apply with a cotton ball and apply to areas where scalp is dry and flaky or sore.</li>
            <li> We tried all of the dandruff control shampoo&#x27;s on the shelf with no real results.  </li>
            <li> I would give this minus stars if I could.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s slowly going away.</li>
            <li> I mean I could not keep it on my scalp longer than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of relief and this gave me none.</li>
            <li> It has an unpleasant odor and it doesn&#x27;t lather</li>
            <li> I also used it on my dog, who has bad skin allergies.</li>

            <li> this product helped my daughter a lot with her dry flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> Works for about 4 days for me</li>
            <li> It works! You just have to be consistent, but it works! Clean your scalp regularly to see results! Good product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I purchased and work quite well. I would highly recommend it for any troubled scalp or skin issues you may have.</li>
            <li> Works well, but does leave a strong, medicinal smell behind. I also used it on my dog, who has bad skin allergies. I dabbed some on the affected areas and waited 5 minutes then washed it off. It did not seem to sting him, nor me, when I used it on myself.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my scalp. For $28 it&#x27;s NOT worth it</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s dandruff was unbelievable.  We tried all of the dandruff control shampoo&#x27;s on the shelf with no real results.  I saw improvement from the first use with Dudleys.  Well worth the money.  It has an unpleasant odor and it doesn&#x27;t lather but the smell goes away within an hour or so after use.  Very satisfied with this buy!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I didn&#x27;t want to write this review until I was seen by a dermatologist. I found out I have dandruff. I heard about this product from MSMIKKO100  from YouTube. My scalp was on fire from itching all day, everyday. Not even scratching helped. I used it the first time and nothing happened,  my head was still itching like crazy. I used it one more time before I gave up. I felt like I had bought a placebo. I would give this minus stars if I could. I was in desperate need of relief and this gave me none.</li>
            <li> This product cleans your scalp very good</li>
            <li> Definitely a great product that I&#x27;ve used in the past for dry scalp when I had relaxed hair. When I went natural and put braids in for a while I was able to use this product each week to keep my scalp clean and the small evaporates leaving smelling clean and then I follow with an oil sheen spray.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product</li>
            <li> This shampoo helped me,from day one. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of shampoo too actually fine a shampoo that helps with the control~ itching~ dandruff all in one. I recommend this too anyone that is in need, for the perfect shampoo, now this shampoo isn&#x27;t the best smelling but it does it&#x27;s job.... Five. STAR</li>
            <li> I love this product,it work great.</li>
            <li> Great for scalp and skin and good for healing bed sores.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> seems to be helping my itchy scalp. to early to know long range benefits.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks (consistently). I still have itchiness and flakes but it&#x27;s slowly going away.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a litttle sketchy because all products guarantee the best but I can truly testify to this product, why? My hair for years was flaky, itchy, buildup, and stunk.  I started out with a relaxer on my hair when I joined the military after working out so much and me being of color not wanting to wash my hair to often because of breakage and dryness of my hair, did not know that it was causing war to my scalp, after three years people would complain about the smell of my hair here and there, so me being young at that time did pay attention to those words.  As the years passed i would go to the hair dresser and they would try and shampoo my scalp 3 to 4 times to get the buid up of danger off, now by this time 10 years has passed, yes so you know my scalp is in a full blown war attack no help what so ever they tried everything, no luck all that money salons pay to get these products and it did not help.  At this point relaxers are now starting to take a toll on my scalp as well, I mean I could not keep it on my scalp longer than 5 minutes and this was a mild relaxer my scalp would have sores all over it, my hair was getting stuck to my head because of the sores, which causing me to go bald where I would part my hair. I finally had enough and decided to go natural low and behold it started getting better my scalp started healing and my hair was longer, healthier, and I truly did not know that I had a good grade of hair. Now, here is the kicker the smell got better but the buildup was still there not as much but it was there, check this out, thanks to technology i went to YOUTUBE and looked for my symtoms and it popped up dudley Antiseptic, I went to all the beauty stores trying to find it and no one had it, I came to my trusted site AMAZON and low and behold here it was Thank God. I tried it the first day and was happy my scalp was clear I love this product. AMAZING.</li>
            <li> After 2 applications, I am dandruff free.  I am so glad someone recommended this product on Youtube.</li>
            <li> Awesome scalp cleaner, love it</li>
            <li> I had been struggling with dandruff and dry scalp for a while, so far, no itching! I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am hoping it helps to control dandruff.  It can be difficult to apply. I apply with a cotton ball and apply to areas where scalp is dry and flaky or sore.</li>
