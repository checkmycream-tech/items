            <li>A few drops of this oil mixed with water and used as a spray is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is the best citrus home fragrance and very competitive with my absolute favorite (and very expensive)</li>

            <li>/&gt;Bodyshop scents are limited (but high very high-quality) so I ordered a range of different scents from another company on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put a few drops in my oil burner with a little water and it makes the entire house smell like your own private island.</li>

            <li> This is the best citrus home fragrance and very competitive with my absolute favorite (and very expensive) Archipelago Positano candle. I burn this with the ceramic burner daily and I would only buy my candle again if I saw it on major sale. Burning the oil is not only more economic but it also eliminates the waste of disposed candle jars. I also purchase unscented fabric softener sheets, add 1-2 drops and use when drying linens, underwear, et cetera. I LOVE this scent!</li>
            <li> Recently, I was christmas shopping and came across this fragant oil...My older sister turned me on to the brand &#x27;The Body Shop&#x27; and I actaully first smelled this oil at a thrift store of all places were it was brand new and some didnt like there gift and had donated it. I fell in love, it is a strong citrus smell that is inviting and energizing all at the same time. I dont know what I will do when I run out of this small oil for the candle lite burner. Great product anyone that likes citrus smells should try it, and dont get run off by the strong concentrated smell it defusses in the air as you burn it off...Love it.</li>
            <li> I first encountered this fragrance mixed with the fragrance Exotic in a Body Shop years ago and I have been a fan ever since. It is harder to find now, but it is still an amazing fragrance!!</li>
            <li> Makes my house smell like a spa.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  Fantastic satsuma orange smell!  Meow!</li>
            <li> I was shopping in the mall this morning while waiting for a friend and I was in Victoria&#x27;s secret. I smelled the most beautiful citrus smell and I couldn&#x27;t get enough. I started going thru all the fragrances there wondering what it was. I finally asked the girls at the front door and with a scowl they said \\&quot;it&#x27;s from over there\\&quot; and pointed to The Body Shop. I walked in sniffing and the girl behind the counter greeted me and asked if she could help. I told her I had to have whatever it was that smelled like citrus. They started laughing and showed me the Satsuma Oil in the burner. I bought it right away. They had mixed it and added the \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; oil too and so I grabbed it along with body butter and shower gel too. I am now on my couch writing this while burning the only fragrance I will ever need and enjoying every breath I take! GREAT STUFF!</li>
            <li> love-love-love this scent</li>
            <li> Purchased this item after purchasing the Jasmine &amp; White Frangipani oil (thinking it was something else) as a gift. I have since learned to mix 10 drops per ounce of 40% ABV vodka into a spray bottle to make a room/ linen spray. Seriously, I haven&#x27;t slept better. I use this to freshen the couch, the rug, the bedsheets. After I mixed it with the Jasmine/ Frangipani scent, I have honestly had ladies ask if they could buy that perfume. IT IS SENSATIONAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bodyshop scents are limited (but high very high-quality) so I ordered a range of different scents from another company on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally spilled 3 drops of this particular oil on my chair at work, and even two days later my Boss asked if I had just eaten a satsuma. Sumptuous scent.</li>
            <li> Accident accident smell it smells very good refreshing up the house my wife and I love it</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, thanks.</li>

            <li> Love this. Not some fake orange smelling stuff. This smells like fresh satsuma straight off of the tree. Strong - I use this sparingly in my humidifier/aromatherapy thing.</li>
            <li> A few drops of this oil mixed with water and used as a spray is wonderful.  I put a little on the inside of my arms and it did not irritate my skin at all as some citrus perfume oils made to use on the skin have. It certainly smells great. It isn&#x27;t terribly long lasting but then what is. There is nothing worse than the scent of something that has been on someone all day long just getting more potent all the time.</li>
            <li> awesome absolutly the best fragrance in the entire world.  I am never without it.  I always order several at a time so i dont run out.</li>
            <li> The best smelling oil I have ever found hands down! I highly recommend this product, the oil lasts forever and the scent of orange is amazing.</li>
            <li> The best smelling oil on the planet! This oil makes me feel like I&#x27;m on a tropical island with exotic flowers surrounding me. I&#x27;ve never smelled anything so sensual.
