            <li>I love Murad.</li>
            <li>I love this day</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, but I am allergic to many.</li>
            <li>Love it and the price.  </li>
            <li>Makeup goes on nicely on top.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and would be lost without it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love everything about itâ€¦</li>
            <li>I love Murad, it works for my skin</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>purchased not one, but 3 resurgence items and although I was able to return them I paid a 15% restocking fee-</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer and gives my 60 year old skin a glow.</li>
            <li>and it is authentic as original Murad product.  </li>
            <li>Best skin product I have ever used, hands down!  </li>
            <li>Great light moisturizer especially for women over 50.</li>
            <li>They gave me a huge sample to use which lasted for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It seems to stay on the top of your skin instead of being absorbed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I rated this item five stars because the moisture lotion makes my face feel refreshed and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and keeps makeup from drying my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 and my skin looks great all day long, even by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>The one thing that bothers me, which I guess &amp;#34;sheer lustre&amp;#34; should have hinted to me, is the full on gold glitter that appears after putting this on.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, and it is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>The PM version of this product is much more effective at eliminating dry patches and redness.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li>I feel beautiful again and wearing little makeup because I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed it quickly and my face appears dewy.</li>
            <li>This is a marvelous product and I was thrilled to see it on amazon for about 30% off,  now for the bad news....</li>
            <li>It has a light fruity type scent (not offensive and fades fast) and a bit of glittery sheen.</li>
            <li>My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin, it was cracking to the point of redness and bleeding.</li>
            <li>so I saw this infomercial and decided i was worth it.</li>
            <li>My aging skin (early 60&#x27;s) has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>As a 51 year old, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin going through many changes.</li>
            <li>My face feels great after I apply it; it&#x27;s not greasy and it soaks right in leaving your skin feeling soft and terrific!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I suppose its a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As always your follow-ups are right on</li>
            <li>I am sure it is a good product for those less sensitive.</li>
            <li>This is a nice medium weight moisturizer appropriate for normal to dry skin (perhaps more on the dry side).</li>
            <li>if something seems too good to be true, usually it</li>
            <li>It not only moisturizes, but also has a sunscreen...and gives your skin a really lovely GLOW.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a &amp;#34;lustre&amp;#34; like the name says, but there are definitely NOT sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is exactly what I had been ordering thru the club....</li>
            <li>I also use the night cream and cleanser, but my favorite can&#x27;t-live-without is the Sheer Lustre Day Creme.</li>
            <li>sure he would want to know about a simple a fix as a packaging problem.  </li>
            <li>I use it under my makeup, and unlike other moisturizers and sunscreens, it nicely \\&quot;holds\\</li>
            <li>It might not be so good for oily skin, and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll feel about in the hot summer, but for winter and cooler weather</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the tiny bits of glitter, but I was pleased that I didn&#x27;t look like a disco ball after I applied this product to my face.</li>
            <li>face lotion is so light, and I only use a VERY small amount (just like the directions say) and it still does a great job balancing the face.</li>
            <li>I love the added glow it gives my skin, and my skin never feels dry.</li>
            <li>It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Nothing like having an adolescent sheen of grease and two huge zits on your chin to look younger.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I use this cream over a coloured cream and it gives a very lucent look, I have been using it For 3 years.</li>
            <li>Hopefully Murad will see the light and switch over to safer sunscreen incredients like Avobenzone or physical sunscreens like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide.</li>
            <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the same as the one I bought in the store, the texture isn&#x27;t as rich.</li>
            <li>This really really hydrates the skin extremely well and even a many like me can appreciate it because I need it as I am getting older and my skin is getting dryer.  </li>
            <li>, I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li>maybe more, and when I saw later a larger size for&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to have decent every day sun protection.  </li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and really appreciate the \\&quot;glow of</li>
            <li>love this under my makeup, this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li>at last I went for this one and immediately my dry irritated skin calmed down and felt happy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t opened my new tube, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time now.  </li>
            <li>.25 oz DLX Size Pump NEW.  </li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m liking it!</li>
            <li>Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars is that I don&#x27;t see any real change to  &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; but one cannot expect miracles!</li>
            <li>But since my skin was so dry and it was the dark of winter, I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too much.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer gives your skin a glow like a 20 year old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 60 yrs old &amp; my face looks</li>
            <li>looked like it was old cream</li>
            <li>But when I looked in the mirror afterwords, boy was i surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have used this but bought directly from Murad.</li>
            <li>It protects from the sun, and it has the slightest bit of iridescence that gives your skin a young, dewy appearance.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin glowing and soft.</li>
            <li>I get compliments about how dewy and soft my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I love this mosturizer, its not to heavy, for daytime use and just enough to keep ur face supple, all day..</li>
            <li>People with oily skin would probably not like this product, but for those of us with dry and aging skin, it is a real miracle cream!</li>
            <li>This lotion really helps lock in moisture and I highly recommend this lotion to anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>The glitter leaves more of a subtle glow.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product during a facial a month ago and instantly noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the entire Murad Resurgence line for us sizzlin&#x27; babes over 40!</li>
            <li>I just use the Resurgence renewing cleansing cream to clean my face in the shower and then apply a small amount of this lotion to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clear younger skin in no time.</li>
            <li>My skin so far may feel firmer, but I have red blotches and dryness.</li>
            <li>When it was gone, there was no way I was going back to my old product.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for everyone and especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There have been a couple of times where I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers and really nothing compares.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s more like a &amp;#34;lustre&amp;#34; like the name says, but there are definitely NOT sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is exactly what I had been ordering thru the club....</li>
            <li> I also use the night cream and cleanser, but my favorite can&#x27;t-live-without is the Sheer Lustre Day Creme.</li>
            <li> sure he would want to know about a simple a fix as a packaging problem.  </li>
            <li> I use it under my makeup, and unlike other moisturizers and sunscreens, it nicely \\&quot;holds\\</li>
            <li> It might not be so good for oily skin, and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll feel about in the hot summer, but for winter and cooler weather</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the tiny bits of glitter, but I was pleased that I didn&#x27;t look like a disco ball after I applied this product to my face.</li>
            <li> face lotion is so light, and I only use a VERY small amount (just like the directions say) and it still does a great job balancing the face.</li>
            <li> I love the added glow it gives my skin, and my skin never feels dry.</li>
            <li> It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Nothing like having an adolescent sheen of grease and two huge zits on your chin to look younger.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I use this cream over a coloured cream and it gives a very lucent look, I have been using it For 3 years.</li>
            <li> Hopefully Murad will see the light and switch over to safer sunscreen incredients like Avobenzone or physical sunscreens like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the same as the one I bought in the store, the texture isn&#x27;t as rich.</li>
            <li> This really really hydrates the skin extremely well and even a many like me can appreciate it because I need it as I am getting older and my skin is getting dryer.  </li>
            <li> , I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li> maybe more, and when I saw later a larger size for&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to have decent every day sun protection.  </li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and really appreciate the \\&quot;glow of</li>
            <li> love this under my makeup, this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> at last I went for this one and immediately my dry irritated skin calmed down and felt happy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t opened my new tube, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time now.  </li>
            <li> .25 oz DLX Size Pump NEW.  </li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m liking it!</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars is that I don&#x27;t see any real change to  &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; but one cannot expect miracles!</li>
            <li> But since my skin was so dry and it was the dark of winter, I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too much.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer gives your skin a glow like a 20 year old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 60 yrs old &amp; my face looks</li>
            <li> looked like it was old cream</li>
            <li> But when I looked in the mirror afterwords, boy was i surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have used this but bought directly from Murad.</li>
            <li> It protects from the sun, and it has the slightest bit of iridescence that gives your skin a young, dewy appearance.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin glowing and soft.</li>
            <li> I get compliments about how dewy and soft my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> I love this mosturizer, its not to heavy, for daytime use and just enough to keep ur face supple, all day..</li>
            <li> People with oily skin would probably not like this product, but for those of us with dry and aging skin, it is a real miracle cream!</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps lock in moisture and I highly recommend this lotion to anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> The glitter leaves more of a subtle glow.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product during a facial a month ago and instantly noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the entire Murad Resurgence line for us sizzlin&#x27; babes over 40!</li>
            <li> I just use the Resurgence renewing cleansing cream to clean my face in the shower and then apply a small amount of this lotion to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clear younger skin in no time.</li>
            <li> My skin so far may feel firmer, but I have red blotches and dryness.</li>
            <li> When it was gone, there was no way I was going back to my old product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for everyone and especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There have been a couple of times where I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers and really nothing compares.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63-years old and have used Sheer Lustre Day Moisture, and other Murad Resurgence products, for almost 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this product thru Amazon,  I was stunned at the savings of at least $20.</li>
            <li> Due to finances a while back I had to find a cheaper system, the blotchiness came back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that keeps me glowing all day with my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for a long time...</li>
            <li> the package was not exactly the same as the ones that I had purchased from Sephora, so I called Murad, it turns out that&lt;br /&gt;none</li>
            <li> It did not cause me to break out, and it did not exacerbate the dry patches on my chin.</li>
            <li> I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Now that I am over 60, my skin tend to get very dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica, Cellex-C, Obagi and other leading cosmetic lines, but Murad products definitely lead the way in leaving your face slightly waxy.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used them before, the size sounds like it won&#x27;t last long for the amount of money you are spending, but it doesn&#x27;t take but a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe I spent the amount of money I did.......</li>
            <li> my mid-40&#x27;s it&#x27;s even harder to find one that works with the ever changing hormone roller coaster in my life.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I will never look for any other skin care products because I don&#x27;t have to</li>
            <li> So no more flaked skin on my nose, and no more overly moisturized pimple face, and all though it sounds like a commercial it even makes my face look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that amazon is becoming as risky as ebay.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money trying to &#x27;save&#x27; money.</li>
            <li> I am using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 and will be 63 in a couple of months &amp; people always think I&#x27;m in my late forties.  </li>
            <li> And it makes my late 40s</li>
            <li> Tried samples previously, but didn&#x27;t purchase at the time as thought they were too expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money).</li>
            <li> When the Murad folks say &amp;#34;get glowing&amp;#34;, they mean it!</li>
            <li> I looked tired all the time.</li>
            <li> Not great results for the price</li>
            <li> I mean, I am not 15!!  </li>
            <li> , I was wrong</li>
            <li> and that I was basically wrong.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best skincare product - have used for 30 years.</li>
            <li> I have found Murad Products to be the best I have ever used, probably because they were formulated by a Dermatologist.  This moisturizer gives your skin a glow like a 20 year old.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t opened my new tube, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time now.  It&#x27;s just the best moisturizer I could hope for.  There have been a couple of times where I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers and really nothing compares.  I&#x27;m 62 and will be 63 in a couple of months &amp; people always think I&#x27;m in my late forties.  I can&#x27;t recommend it strongly enough.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I have dry, sensitive skin, and it is perfect for me.  I&#x27;m 63-years old and have used Sheer Lustre Day Moisture, and other Murad Resurgence products, for almost 10 years.  I love the added glow it gives my skin, and my skin never feels dry.</li>
            <li> this is another great Murad product. Lasts about 3-4 months and it a lovely silky consistency</li>
            <li> I love this product being I have very dry skin and it has been the best rejuvenating cream I&#x27;ve yet to come across. I have purchased it twice at the cost of $38.75.  As I come back to my orders to reorder again after 3 months, the purchase price went up to $64?!?!?  Guess I will be moving on if this is what I have to look forward to.  Taking advantage of your customers needs?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  It not only moisturizes, but also has a sunscreen...and gives your skin a really lovely GLOW.  I use it under my makeup, and unlike other moisturizers and sunscreens, it nicely \\&quot;holds\\&quot; the makeup base.  I am 64 years old and really appreciate the \\&quot;glow of youth\\&quot; it gives me!  People with oily skin would probably not like this product, but for those of us with dry and aging skin, it is a real miracle cream!</li>
            <li> I like the night products better.  This moisturizer is a bit sticky and the tackiness lasts all day.  It seems to stay on the top of your skin instead of being absorbed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Murad Resurgence system since it came out. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. My skin color &amp; texture even out when I use Resurgence. Due to finances a while back I had to find a cheaper system, the blotchiness came back. I looked tired all the time. Now I&#x27;m back &amp; I&#x27;m staying. Amazon makes it affordable. I&#x27;m almost 60 yrs old &amp; my face looks like I&#x27;m 45!!Enough said.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;m 40 and my skin looks great all day long, even by the end of the day.  I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine. Well, at 56 I just felt my skin wasn&#x27;t looking great and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money). My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great. That was when I decided to invest in the entire Resurgence line of products. I started with the wash to day/night treatments, the mask etc. It was a costly order but the results are worth it! It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing. Even my husband noticed the difference. Don&#x27;t waste money trying to &#x27;save&#x27; money. I will never look for any other skin care products because I don&#x27;t have to, I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li> I had tried this product before and liked it.  It is a great moisturizer and gives my 60 year old skin a glow.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything more, except I do love this product...has it all and does it all,so why try anything else?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for a long time... just started using it and so far I&#x27;m liking it! We&#x27;ll see what happens! But definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> only used this product for a week but I got it to Hydrate and prevent wrinkles.  On the infomercial they talk about smoothing skin and blotchiness and giving a dewy appearance.  My skin so far may feel firmer, but I have red blotches and dryness. Definately not moisturizing enough for my almost 40 skin.I don not think I wil continue with it, it is stating to burn when applied.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother-n-law because she had asked for it for Christmas.  She is in her 70&#x27;s and she says she loves it.  I cannot recommend because I have not tried it.  Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Just love this product, would never change to another one!</li>
            <li> When I received it, the packaging looked counterfeit (box &amp; tube lettering was smeared) &amp; then I opened it. The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the same as the one I bought in the store, the texture isn&#x27;t as rich. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this!&lt;br /&gt;I love all the Murad Resurgence products anyway.&lt;br /&gt;There are no &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34; like the one reviewer claimed.  It&#x27;s more like a &amp;#34;lustre&amp;#34; like the name says, but there are definitely NOT sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;I love this under my makeup, this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on so easily and adds a great luminescence to my skin. I combine it with the essential C moisture 30.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t work, I was wrong it works wonderfully. I have the most sensitive skin, it was cracking to the point of redness and bleeding. It was embarrasing , makeup wouldn&#x27;t cover it up so I saw this infomercial and decided i was worth it. I am glad that I did. I love it, I keep it in my purse and apply it as needed over and under makeup. My skin has never been softer, like a baby&#x27;s but and my cracking has gone away. I feel beautiful again and wearing little makeup because I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> I was upset that it did not come in a sealed box.  My friend was afraid to use it, so I bought it from her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and love it.  Amazone has the best prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li> This really really hydrates the skin extremely well and even a many like me can appreciate it because I need it as I am getting older and my skin is getting dryer.  I am using it everyday.  Great hydration!! Nice glow to the skin as well.</li>
            <li> Nice and light weight.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this product here and elsewhere on Amazon and noted how some said it left their faces greasy. But since my skin was so dry and it was the dark of winter, I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too much. Yep, it&#x27;s greasy alright. And it makes my late 40s face break out. Nothing like having an adolescent sheen of grease and two huge zits on your chin to look younger. But that wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for when I wanted a product to restore youthfulness! I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica, Cellex-C, Obagi and other leading cosmetic lines, but Murad products definitely lead the way in leaving your face slightly waxy. I have the night products kit, too, with the cleanser, toner, age-diffusing serum, and night cream and I wake up with a sheen, too. But I can deal with it at night.</li>
            <li> Great light moisturizer especially for women over 50. Helps your makeup glide on and provides some sun protection. Does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> My aging skin (early 60&#x27;s) has never looked better.  I didn&#x27;t realize how thirsty it was until I discovered this Murad line.  It might not be so good for oily skin, and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll feel about in the hot summer, but for winter and cooler weather it&#x27;s fantastic.  Great price through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product, &amp; the way it makes my skin feel. This is the best price I have found so far &amp; will buy again</li>
            <li> I use this cream over a coloured cream and it gives a very lucent look, I have been using it For 3 years.</li>
            <li> The one thing that bothers me, which I guess &amp;#34;sheer lustre&amp;#34; should have hinted to me, is the full on gold glitter that appears after putting this on. Other than that, I suppose its a good moisturizer. If glitter doesn&#x27;t bother you like me, go for it.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers the face and yet gives a tint and a glow when you don&#x27;t have on makeup. It is a good product. I will keep on buying this product.</li>
            <li> is exactly what I had been ordering thru the club.... great product and price</li>
            <li> Love this product line.  Tried samples previously, but didn&#x27;t purchase at the time as thought they were too expensive.  However, I just didn&#x27;t find anything else I tried that I really liked. Great to find them at a cheaper price on Amazon. If you haven&#x27;t used them before, the size sounds like it won&#x27;t last long for the amount of money you are spending, but it doesn&#x27;t take but a small amount.  My skin feels so much better!</li>
            <li> Honest to goodness I did not see any change in my neck. I cannot believe I spent the amount of money I did.......</li>
            <li> when I received the cream it was yellow looked like it was old cream</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this product thru Amazon,  I was stunned at the savings of at least $20. maybe more, and when I saw later a larger size for&lt;br /&gt;even more savings I ordered immediately.  Love the product ...especially under make-up and it is authentic as original Murad product.  I am&lt;br /&gt;always impressed when a great product can be bought for less....so I salute Amazon for all the products they can get for their customers at&lt;br /&gt;good prices!  As always your follow-ups are right on and I will keep coming back!  Bev Surratt</li>
            <li> I love Murad. I started using it three months ago. My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I found that this made my face break out--sometimes a reaction to the sunscreen. I am sure it is a good product for those less sensitive.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT CAME ON TIME! GREAT SERVICE! MURAD IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR SKIN - I HAVE TRIED EVERY TYPE OF PRODUCT AND ALWAYS GO BACK TO MURAD.</li>
            <li> When the Murad folks say &amp;#34;get glowing&amp;#34;, they mean it! I love this day moisture - it stays with you all day, keeping your foundation fresher too.  It&#x27;s the only product that keeps me glowing all day with my very dry skin.  Highly recommend the entire Murad Resurgence line for us sizzlin&#x27; babes over 40!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial products in my life. I&#x27;ve tried all brands like Clinique-Mary K-Avon-Este&#x27; Lauder. Now that I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s it&#x27;s even harder to find one that works with the ever changing hormone roller coaster in my life.&lt;br /&gt;This face lotion is so light, and I only use a VERY small amount (just like the directions say) and it still does a great job balancing the face. So no more flaked skin on my nose, and no more overly moisturized pimple face, and all though it sounds like a commercial it even makes my face look and feel younger. I don&#x27;t use the night cream, or the eye lifter cream, or the facial mask.  I just use the Resurgence renewing cleansing cream to clean my face in the shower and then apply a small amount of this lotion to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I will never change my facial routines again !!</li>
            <li> This feels so good on my skin.  Love the lustrious look it gives too.  I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I rated this item five stars because the moisture lotion makes my face feel refreshed and smooth.  Now that I am over 60, my skin tend to get very dry.  This lotion really helps lock in moisture and I highly recommend this lotion to anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Finally something that keeps my skin moist. I have tried many products, but I am allergic to many. at last I went for this one and immediately my dry irritated skin calmed down and felt happy.</li>
            <li> I love this mosturizer, its not to heavy, for daytime use and just enough to keep ur face supple, all day.. can&#x60;t do without it!!</li>
            <li> Love it and the price.  I will buy again, and again.  just bought the Murad Age Spot And Pigment Lightening Serum .25 oz DLX Size Pump NEW.  Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This may be a good product.  But when I looked in the mirror afterwords, boy was i surprised.  Sparkles all over my face.  I guess that is why it is &amp;#34;lustre&amp;#34;.  But I, for one, did not like the sparkles.  I mean, I am not 15!!  Like I said, i may be great but for the sparkles!</li>
            <li> I have used this but bought directly from Murad. As I never received this item, it makes me wonder if the seller is getting bottles and filling them with junk and not actual murad product. The fact that I never received it bugs the heck out of me!</li>
            <li> Excellent day moisturizer. My skin absorbed it quickly and my face appears dewy.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer a lot.  It goes on very nicely, absorbs well and is not at all greasy.  My skin feels well-moisturized.  Makeup goes on nicely on top.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face, neck, and chest.  It seems to have decent every day sun protection.  Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars is that I don&#x27;t see any real change to  &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; but one cannot expect miracles!</li>
            <li> Makes my face smooth, silky, and glowing!!</li>
            <li> Smooth and keeps makeup from drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every day under my makeup.  It protects from the sun, and it has the slightest bit of iridescence that gives your skin a young, dewy appearance.  My face feels great after I apply it; it&#x27;s not greasy and it soaks right in leaving your skin feeling soft and terrific!  I seem to &amp;#34;collect&amp;#34; skin creams, but since I began using Murad Day Moisture, the rest are gathering dust.  I also use the night cream and cleanser, but my favorite can&#x27;t-live-without is the Sheer Lustre Day Creme.</li>
            <li> Not great results for the price</li>
            <li> I first tried this product during a facial a month ago and instantly noticed a difference in my skin. They gave me a huge sample to use which lasted for 2 weeks. When it was gone, there was no way I was going back to my old product. As a 51 year old, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin going through many changes. This product keeps my skin glowing and soft. Also works good with a serum underneath. I am switching to all Murad products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and would be lost without it.&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about itâ€¦&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My input, which I have actually called your company to report, is that as I use the tube the print starts&lt;br /&gt;to come off the tube and onto my face!  When I called, which I have never done before in my life, your&lt;br /&gt;representative remarked that no one had ever mentioned that and that I was basically wrong.  Well,&lt;br /&gt;as probably your biggest fan of the product and someone who had sat in lectures with Dr. Murad, I&lt;br /&gt;am sure he would want to know about a simple a fix as a packaging problem.  I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Cindi Godino&lt;br /&gt;cparrisgo@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I love Murad, it works for my skin and I do not have to worry about my face being greasy. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  I get compliments about how dewy and soft my skin looks.  You&#x27;ll see results in the course of a week.</li>
            <li> I will not use anything else on my face...best moisturizer around!!! I give it ten stars!!!!! I recommend this for everyone and especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter and she loves it</li>
            <li> Price is good and the product is great as I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever tried!  Made my skin look radiant.</li>
            <li> This is a nice medium weight moisturizer appropriate for normal to dry skin (perhaps more on the dry side). It has a light fruity type scent (not offensive and fades fast) and a bit of glittery sheen. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the tiny bits of glitter, but I was pleased that I didn&#x27;t look like a disco ball after I applied this product to my face. The glitter leaves more of a subtle glow. It did not cause me to break out, and it did not exacerbate the dry patches on my chin. The PM version of this product is much more effective at eliminating dry patches and redness. I would purchase this again if Murad phases Oxybenzone out of their products. Oxybenzone can cause allergic reactions and is a known endocrine disruptor. Hopefully Murad will see the light and switch over to safer sunscreen incredients like Avobenzone or physical sunscreens like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> This is a marvelous product and I was thrilled to see it on amazon for about 30% off,  now for the bad news....&lt;br /&gt;The item that I received was counterfeit, so be forewarned- if something seems too good to be true, usually it is.&lt;br /&gt;It just looked \\&quot;off\\&quot;-  the package was not exactly the same as the ones that I had purchased from Sephora, so I called Murad, it turns out that&lt;br /&gt;none of the items that I bought are authentic.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased not one, but 3 resurgence items and although I was able to return them I paid a 15% restocking fee- almost $25!&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned. Disappointed that amazon is becoming as risky as ebay.</li>
            <li> Best skin product I have ever used, hands down!  Love it!  Try it you will be amazed! Clear younger skin in no time.</li>
