            <li> Ms. Manicure always has the best cuticle trimmers!</li>
            <li> My seven piece set arrived with only six pieces. The rubber cuticle pusher was missing.</li>
            <li> One of the items was cheaply made. It was the cuticle trimmer. The two prong where you trim the cuticle did not last long. Ok item for what you pay fo it. I gave it a 2 because no nail brudh was added. I say look some where eles for this product</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and when I received it only 6 of the 7 items were included.  The cuticle pusher was missing from package.</li>
            <li> Clippers aren&#x27;t very sharp. Everything else worked great.</li>
            <li> 2 pieces were missing from the set. I bought it as a gift for a nail party and had to end up getting something else.</li>

            <li> I got it as a gift for a friend going on a trip, but it arrived a day late. So I ended up using it myself and love it.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described,</li>
            <li> A good set of nail tools. They all work fine and look pretty. They would be a nice part of a go away to college gift.</li>
            <li> I loved this set! The nail flipper is my favorite. The only issue I had was my nail filer bent, but it&#x27;s still totally functional.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this manicure se . It has really helped me get my nails back in shape.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I had a filer by Ms Manicure sine 1998. Recently it was wearing out.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but of course Amazon. Particularly the metal filer is an excellent, durable item. Was very happy to find it at Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> The price of this kit is great! You get all of your mani essentials in one space, the only thing I would add is a pair of scissors.</li>
