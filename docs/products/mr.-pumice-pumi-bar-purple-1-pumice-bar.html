            <li>I find it works awesome on keeping my feet silky smooth when used 1x a week.</li>
            <li>then hes good for about a month.</li>
            <li>This is a great price for an effective pumice that does the job.</li>
            <li>For those days when you just can&#x27;t get to the salon but want a good foot scrub, this is it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I dont tend to rate products unless I really loved them.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>

            <li>Good for women.</li>
            <li>A good portion of it falls off every time you use it.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT...</li>
            <li>I have tried the pedi egg, the pedi spin, the den something handheld scraper thing, all worked good for a while</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>its alright and works fairly well.</li>
            <li>I took a chance and order two of the Mr. Pumice and it works as good.  </li>
            <li>Great, I love it.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the item purchased.</li>
            <li>Will keep ordering more!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>After a while your feel will retain moisture better and you won&#x27;t even need the bar anymore!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It saves you from getting so many pedicures!</li>
            <li>Keeps my tootsies in top condition!</li>
            <li>Love this pumice bar!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite budget luxuries!  </li>
            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Works way better!</li>
            <li>However, the bar worked amazingly and rinsed off well for periodic use.</li>
            <li>when i unwrapped it, it looked kinda like cheap Styrofoam, but it worked great.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how effective it is.</li>
            <li>Works amazing though.</li>
            <li>This product cleans and removes cracks on heels effectively.</li>
            <li>and then I just keep them nicely moisturized with some Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best pumice I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>i need to buy the kind that they use at the nail place.</li>
            <li>Really liked this product.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job for in between pedi&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is a good pumice bar, but i&#x27;ve tried dollar store ones that were better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for someone looking to save some cash but still wants a great product!</li>
            <li>My husband does my pedicures and sometimes I do them on my own</li>
            <li>but we both liked the product.</li>
            <li>did not care for this, it kind of comes apart when you&#x27;re using it ?</li>
            <li>This is honestly the lowest quality pumice stone I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>When I found this i read the review and while most people say it worked really good for their cracked feet</li>
            <li>i had a pumice stone that i used for pedicures but wanted to try something that seems popular.</li>
            <li>I very strongly recommend Mr. Pumice.</li>
            <li>Noticed improvement on the very first use great product</li>
            <li>But this is the perfect product for my skin to KEEP it soft when I get pedicures.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of lotions and soaks but by far this has worked the best.</li>
            <li>This is SO much more effective though.  </li>
            <li>I was blown away by the results, as my feet are now baby soft and flawless.</li>
            <li>one is better by far, and does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>I saw great reviews on this product when I first bought it a couple years ago.</li>
            <li>It feels a bit scratchy and is very light.  </li>
            <li>Pumice is defined as a very light and porous volcanic rock formed when a gas-rich froth of glassy lava solidifies rapidly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Effective and Easy to Use</li>
            <li>Effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>makes my skin very smooth, best to use right after a shower, quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Great item, I have dry heels and this worked wonders and smoothed out my heels, prompt delivery and great product, would recommend it</li>
            <li>So easy to use and more effective than a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>i love the way it make my feet feel, when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>Excellent product - I&#x27;d definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>Love this pumice bar.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and they look and better yet</li>
            <li>assure you, they in fact do deserve a 5 star rating. :)</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li>Cheap and gets the job done!  </li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many pumice bars and this one just didn&#x27;t do it for me</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>i guess i have more callouses??</li>
            <li>I love getting my feet pampered and my salon always uses these butthey cost around six or seven dollars here.</li>
            <li>But I use this in the shower with just bar soap and my feet are fabulous!</li>
            <li>should of done more research on it before I purchased this.</li>
            <li>I love the pumice bar.  </li>
            <li>I wish I got more than the 2 pieces I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s even better than what most pedicure salons use.</li>
            <li>So i used this on my feet with the O&#x27;Keef&#x27;s Healthy foot cream and it made my heels</li>
            <li>i have never felt so confident with showing my feet and wearing sandals.</li>
            <li>Love this product it works so well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to using this, I&#x27;ve also been using [[ASIN:B0002QB9NE O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme 3.2oz Jar]]</li>
            <li>They look horrendous more often than not.  </li>
            <li>It feels better than the earth stones that you can buy the stores.</li>
            <li>it help to work better.</li>
            <li>My calloused heals have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, but I&#x27;m sticking with this one &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This helped a lot, as well as the o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s healthy feet creme.</li>
            <li>Not bad!!!</li>
            <li>This pumice bar is softer, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day in the shower and my feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I like the stone much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>my feet haven&#x27;t been more happier.</li>
            <li>I got a micro plane and it works much better.</li>
            <li>I love the size and shape .</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this pumice stone.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use soap with it for maximum effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Works so much better than the one I bought at Target which I threw away.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>and they work so much better than the ped-eggs.</li>
            <li>Makes funky feet feel better.</li>
            <li>My favorite pumice bar for years.</li>
            <li>came on time works ok</li>
            <li>love it, works well.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and the seller shipped it to me quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li>This is a great pumice product, I would highly recommend it to anyone that get&#x27;s callouses on their feet.  </li>
            <li>At the price, though, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, I don&#x27;t like the purple stuff that comes off when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and keeps your feet perfectly smooth in between pedicures!  </li>
            <li>Really cheap but works better than most.</li>
            <li>Produces alot of &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; just touching it, however, its cheap and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Fantastic :)</li>
            <li>The bar is incredibly &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; and fell apart the second I began using it.</li>
            <li>Such a great product at such a great price!</li>
            <li>I find it works best when I wet it, then put liquid soap on it, then use it.</li>
            <li>All in all though not bad!</li>
            <li>Easy instructions and</li>
            <li>it breaks easily</li>
            <li>Falling apart too easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used one of these before and it was so easy.</li>
            <li>being said, don&#x27;t expect this to be like Mr. Clean&#x27;s Magic Eraser, becasue</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>easy to hold and does the job.</li>
            <li>The size of it is great for the pedicurist, it&#x27;s a bit bigger than most and therefore easy for her/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the rest and Mr. Pumice is by far the best otu there it&#x27;s used at all the high end nail salons.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s defintely a strong bar that is perfect for the feet.&lt;br /&gt;i still notice that little pieces are falling off</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did the merchant ship the item out quickly, they also shipped out a very good quality item.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Was expecting to have to scrub and scrub but wonderfully the dry skin came right off.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect little pumice.</li>
            <li>This little, purple tool works wonders and is a great thing to have in the summertime!</li>
            <li>I now have smooth feet...</li>
            <li>and they are callous free.</li>
            <li>Its cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>It does take a few uses to get your feet perfect</li>
            <li>i brought this product and have never been so happy, i actually have softer feet.</li>
            <li>Seems really cheap</li>
            <li>this is a must for smooth feet..</li>
            <li>Used it twice and heels are smooth again.</li>
            <li>The Mr. Pumice does an excellent job in removing any dead skin.</li>
            <li>After one use my feet were smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a guy who just wanted to smooth out his feet.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and light and suited my needs</li>
            <li>thisa thing crumbles a lot but does smooth feet to an extent.  </li>
            <li>A quick rinse and the bar is clean!</li>
            <li>It works great, (best when wet), and keeps my feet smooth and soft a lot longer than a normal stone pumice, which does not even compare to this.  </li>
            <li>It is very worth the money.</li>
            <li>This item was not expensive, and the fact that it had Free shipping was even better.</li>
            <li>using this product is super easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost exactly a year now, and I&#x27;ve worn away maybe an eighth of an inch on the most used parts of the bar.</li>
            <li>Get the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp (Foot File) instead!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased one bar for $5 from the nail salon and then discovered Amazon had them cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical of how great this seemed to work when I read some of the reviews -- but this pumice bar really is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this on a whim....</li>
            <li>Not exactly painful, but I didn&#x27;t enjoy using them at all.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for my feet and its still working fine, love it.  </li>
            <li>I love being barefoot, but I also love soft feet.</li>
            <li>Helps clean off some of my calluses in the shower.</li>
            <li>The pumice actually works nicely and doesn&#x27;t immediately get moldy like so many do.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so soft and smooth its amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get my feet really clean without these.  </li>
            <li>it is by far the best i have tried yet and think i have finally ended my search.</li>
            <li>Mr. Pumice is great at smoothing rough skin making it smooth.</li>
            <li>Wow am I glad I tried this one!  </li>
            <li>This is a great combination for dry and cracked heels!</li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>Of course the pumice works great on rough heels.</li>
            <li>Wish the bar was bigger, but a good value.</li>
            <li>It seems as though it will last awhile which is also good.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad on here as I compared it to the price it is sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty.</li>
            <li>It feels really good to be able to just scuff this up and down your fee at the end of a shower.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and very gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After several satisfied weeks and at this price, I&#x27;m buying more to stock up and give to friends and family (great stocking stuffer) with chronic dry, peeling and/or cracked feet!!  </li>
            <li>came quickly and looks as pictured.</li>
            <li>Super lightweight.</li>
            <li>This bar helped my heels but it wears away quickly and flakes.</li>
            <li>I got out of the shower, applied some cream to my heels, and noticed a HUGE difference after just the first use.  </li>
            <li>My feet were smooth after the first use.</li>
            <li>It lasted a good while, but eventually I tried a different product...which has been far better in quality and ease of use.</li>
            <li>by far my favorite thing to clean my hands up</li>
            <li>This is okay if you don&#x27;t live in an area where you walk lots.</li>
            <li>It crumbled in my bath tub the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>After only 2 uses, my feet were silky smooth!!</li>
            <li>There is a little bit of grit that comes off of the stone when you use it, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found to keep my feet soft!</li>
            <li>After using them this way each time I bathed for a couple weeks, I felt they were more or less equally effective.</li>
            <li>I truly love this pumice and am completely brand loyal to this now.</li>
            <li>I normally have a lot of dry skin on my heels and this takes care of it beautifully.  </li>
            <li>and it really gets it smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it every time i shower, and Im never afraid to wear sandals pr flip flops.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate its worth the price buy it now.</li>
            <li>this and my tweezer man callous remover, get my feet so soft love it.</li>
            <li>and I do not even have to soak my feet; I only used it after a warm shower.  </li>
            <li>i honestly think its the same one they use!</li>
            <li>I bought this because it kinda looked like the same kind they use when you get a pedicure.</li>
            <li>SO THRILLED with this product, and will definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product because it does the job quickly and leaves my feet ultra smooth.  </li>
            <li>Other pumice bars have hurt my feet but this one was comfortable yet effective.</li>
            <li>Nothing major, easy to clean but a nuisance nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Went right in the trash.</li>
            <li>i have him use the pumice in the shower and put the lotion on right afterwards</li>
            <li>Got my feet looking right.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>it works really well to clean up my heels.</li>
            <li>This little bar is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It has helped my feet to stay super smooth and without the hurt that I found most with other pumice bars.</li>
            <li>good quality, average price.  </li>
            <li>so so very much</li>
            <li>leaves feet smooth unlike many other pumice stones/scrubbers</li>
            <li>Really does the job removing heel calluses; best used with a less abrasive bar for final cut.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just right for that soft, clean, spa feeling.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft and smooth after using this</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain!  </li>
            <li>This is a must have tool to keep your foot soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>It works very well with callous removing gel!</li>
            <li>but this pumice stone is worth a few minutes to &amp;#34;write home about&amp;#34; (literally) and of course, spread the word for others like myself who have been on lifelong grail searches for the perfect peeling/cracked foot &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; or Moms who barely have time to take a good daily shower</li>
            <li>It is exactly like the foam blocks kids use for crafts.</li>
            <li>It really does the job and so grateful I purchased it!</li>
            <li>This pumice bar last a long time and my feet look great.  </li>
            <li>This bar doesnt even look like its been used, so I&#x27;m sure it will last!</li>
            <li>I definitely wish I would have purchased more than one at a time though because I want to always have one in my shower.</li>
            <li>At first glance you would think this is not going to work.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t magic, and my callouses/dead skin isn&#x27;t totally gone yet, but I do notice some improvement every time I use</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, it WORKS!  </li>
            <li>the first time i saw it was at the salon</li>
            <li>I was set to get married</li>
            <li>But after the first time it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Pair</li>
            <li>I first scene it at Sally&#x27;s .They</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it regularly since then and just bought more of them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite justify when it works - but not any better than an actual pumice stone.</li>
            <li>It satisfactorily accomplishes the desired purpose of the reason that it was purchased in the first place.</li>
            <li>I finally bought another one and my feet are no longer calloused, instead they are soft, smooth, and super clean.</li>
            <li>:  I&#x27;m a guy, and this whole pumice thing is weird to me, but it makes my girl happy, good enough for</li>
            <li>I love it, it lasts such a long time, and works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>I ordered my own and use it every other day in the shower</li>
            <li>This pumice bar is truly heavy duty and does a wonderful job on rough feet after they have soaked.</li>
            <li>Replaced it with a pedicure rasp that worked much faster and didn&#x27;t need to have my skin soaked to soften it up first.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend, especially to those people out there that think their feet can&#x27;t be saved.  :-)</li>
            <li>This product breaks too easily and wears out after several uses.</li>
            <li>The smoother pumice bars are only good for minor blemishes.</li>
            <li>These work good, but don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>I scraped it across my foot and immediately the ridges on the pumice started becoming flat.</li>
            <li>It comes in fine, medium and coarse.</li>
            <li>I buffed my fingertips with the same fine grit stone pumice afterwards as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I recommend this particular pumice stone to anyone who has cracked heels!</li>
            <li>amazing little product.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly great at removing years of dead skin from my male, abused feet.  </li>
            <li>My fault for not reading the description closely, since I bought this rather fast just to go with another order.</li>
            <li>Its gentle on your feet, yet does the job.</li>
            <li>These are really the way to go.  </li>
            <li>Beings that this item was really rather inexpensive</li>
            <li>I really am trying to make it work</li>
            <li>I like it, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>on here it much cheaper.</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;m giving one to my Mom.</li>
            <li>Also shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have went to the nail salon recently and they used a mr.pumice bar and it made my feet so smooth, so I brought one</li>
            <li>I really wish I would have taken before and after photos.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping to.</li>
            <li>more than i expected.</li>
            <li>Even that doesn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s so cheap you can afford to replace it frequently if necessary.  </li>
            <li>did i buy a whole punch of them and gave away to my daughters and friends.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a real pumice stone, but I think it works better than one.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and it seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the way it works, it isn&#x27;t as pruductive as a real pumice stone.</li>
            <li>but it does work and has not broken yet.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It works really well with just soap and water.</li>
            <li>It also works really well on your hands as well.</li>
            <li>Now, I have to be really gentle with it.</li>
            <li>I bought one a few years back from bb&amp;b, and it was the best pumice ever, except it was smaller and blue.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>it has definitely made my feet more soft.</li>
            <li>The combo of the two has been really effective, but the key player is definitely this pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I have found something to make my feet normal!  </li>
            <li>Better than any other pumice you look for.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, how do I clean the pumice after I&#x27;m done?</li>
            <li>I lost my last Mr. Pumice bar and for months I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would clean my feet as well as this could.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it really smoothed out my feet (and to be frank they were in rough shape).</li>
            <li>recommend going over the skin with a finer grit stone pumice to buff the skin surface smooth after using this to remove all the dead skin quickly.</li>
            <li>not often that you make an online purchase and can say that you&#x27;re happily surprised about how much better&lt;br /&gt;it was than you thought it would be; this is one item that you will say is even better than you expected.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>As a new Mom I don&#x27;t have as much time as I used to for writing reviews</li>
            <li>Let me say, this is much better than the typical metal ones.</li>
            <li>This does a decent job on my feet</li>
            <li>My routine is bi-weekly pedicures and a quick daily scrub in the shower with this pumi bar.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but personally I need a more coarse pumice then this for my feet.</li>
            <li>This pumice bar manages to get most of the dry skin off, resulting in smooth feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, to reduce the mess, I&#x27;ll use it in the shower with the water running.  </li>
            <li>However, if you live in a city where you live a lot of walking steer clear and find something a little bit more powerful...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Sure, there are little pieces of purple pumice that come off everywhere, but so are your feet shavings, so who cares?  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li>I love these little things.</li>
            <li>i love this little pumice bar.</li>
            <li>Just get it wet, rub soap on your feet, and scrub lightly.</li>
            <li>It does dent in a bit with use, but it really keeps my feet soft.  </li>
            <li>i just wanted to smooth out an elbow that i lean on while working that gets rough.</li>
            <li>they are coarser and more heavy duty.</li>
            <li>I well never buy this again, Don&#x27;t waste your money, Go buy something better.</li>
            <li>I love these bars; they truly do what they are supposed to...removes dead skin, softens callouses, helps rid of cracked heels, and cleans feet.</li>
            <li>This product was good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say I have never seen an average person with as much callused and dry feet as my own.</li>
            <li>I say this because although your skin might feel baby soft and smooth right after you use this, once it has time to dry and harden again(like in 3-4 days) your skin will be rougher than before if you don&#x27;t do this extra step.</li>
            <li>When I found this online, I recognized it right away as what they were using at my local salon.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost compared to many many other wasted dollars i have spent!</li>
            <li>Both sides, wether coarse or fine, are very coarse.</li>
            <li>I soaked my feet for about 45 minutes in warm water with a little white vinegar before.  </li>
            <li>I live in flip flops and</li>
            <li>and it still looks new.</li>
            <li>But, I tried it and now I can&#x27;t live without one of these in my shower.</li>
            <li>Does not crack, have been using it for a month or so and looks like new.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li>After just ONE USE of just a few minutes (fussy baby), I had such amazing results that it is part of my routine twice a week at the end of my shower so my feet have soaked in water, followed up by either Nutiva&#x27;s Coconut Oil or Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter</li>
            <li>This is only effective after removing the impenetrable layer of dead skin.</li>
            <li>I personally have never used a REAL pumice stone, so I can&#x27;t really compare the two, but this thing sort of seems to work.  </li>
            <li>very soft.</li>
            <li>It has lasted me 6+ months so far!</li>
            <li>Other products work better and last longer.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a old fashioned Pumice Stone in the stores and have only found short rounded smooth ones or the metal graters.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>So far no issues!</li>
            <li>It does leave purcple little crystals after using it, but it washes off just as easy with water.</li>
            <li>But after 2 days of using this in the shower on my super dry feet, I can say my feet are baby soft.</li>
            <li>On my feet all day and mostly barefoot (indoors) with lifelong issues of chronically dry, peeling and cracked heels (inherited from both my parents) who has tried everything but who no longer has the time to try an umpteenth product or spend that weekly at home hourly pedicure which used to be my best solution as an alternative to a professional pedicure because I am now a stay-at-home Mom of an infant/toddler, I desperately needed a solution that would only add a couple minutes to my routine without being aggressive to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t see it work on my skin or make it any better. :(</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard core and doesn&#x27;t take off hard parts, but its a good rough finish for in between polishing.</li>
            <li>Because of this, it makes a huge mess when you use it.  </li>
            <li>It did feel like there was lotion or some other softening agent in it which was cool</li>
            <li>This product just doesnt seem to cut it unless your feet are already super soft with the start of rough patches.</li>
            <li>It really sloughs away the dry heels on the soles of the feet, yet  is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this because I had read all the good reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical -- less than three bucks at my local beauty supply store -- and is simple and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>cheap little bar.</li>
            <li>This Pumice stone I found to be more of a hard Styrofoam product than a stone.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it is more like a hard styrofoam.</li>
            <li>Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;*Really light and fluffy, compared to my old one, like a volcanic rock.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally something that can keep my poor diabetic feet smooth and pain free.  </li>
            <li>Just like what they use in the professional nail salons.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my shower and use it daily and really like how it works.</li>
            <li>I definitely didn&#x27;t like this pumice as much as my others.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s going to last much longer than all the others I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li>I keep one in the shower and use it just about every day to keep my feet soft.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of pumice stones both natural and synthetic, brushes, files, polishers, creams, exfoliants and treatments with mixed/inconsistent results.  </li>
            <li>it will probably take two or three weeks to completely remove the calluses.</li>
            <li>This item gets my feet soft after using it.</li>
            <li>MY feet are so soft now.</li>
            <li>I use this for my heels and it makes them really soft.</li>
            <li>It removed all the dead skin and made my feet so smooth</li>
            <li>It falls apart fast and get gritty stuff all over.</li>
            <li>So far it has been working like a charm</li>
            <li>I also found out that this sort of material is also used by professional pedicurist.</li>
            <li>When I pointed out to my husband how soft my feet felt, he also noticed the difference</li>
            <li>I get frequent pedicures and get the acid/callus remover combo.  </li>
            <li>But I really didn&#x27;t like the grainy, oily residue this left on my hands after using it.</li>
            <li>but I still prefer my old school pumice.</li>
            <li>Some reviews complain about it coming a part/flaking, but I didn&#x27;t think it was that big of a deal,  some little-tiny crumbs, but nothing really to speak of.  </li>
            <li>this is not what they use when you get a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get my feet soft and not have to pay those values removals at the shop.</li>
            <li>It keeps the bottom of my feet soft without ever having to do anything else to them.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a long time (2 years on my last one), works really well and is a pretty purple color.</li>
            <li>This makes fast work of getting rid of dead/rough skin especially on the feet.</li>
            <li>it certainly isn&#x27;t magic, but it does seem to slowly work...</li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;ll wear down pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It made a purple mess all over the place, so I had to be sure to use it over the toilet.</li>
            <li>I still have to hold my foot over the toilet to not make a mess, but it&#x27;s way better and faster than this purple thing.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Mr. Pumice Extra Coarse along with Compound W in order to remove a planters wart on the bottom of my right foot.</li>
            <li>The product smoothed out the cracked, thick skin on my feet after just one or two sessions -- a feat that no previous pumice stone was able to do.</li>
            <li>After using it just twice over the course of a week, it helped remove the rough, pointed callouses that I get on the edges of my toes, in a very gentle way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you have callouses and rough spots that you want to get rid of quickly.</li>
            <li>I used it, and after I told him about the resultant mess and what Mr Pumice was really made of, my generous husband said it had not cost much and that I ought to just chuck the thing.</li>
            <li>let me tell you I never have cracked feet just extremely rough and this lovely little bar worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>I live on a farm, so I use this thing daily!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Really rough, surprised at how much grit there is to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a week and my feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>Less and less seem to rub off the more I use it</li>
            <li>Little purple granules come off the bar as you use it, so I&#x27;m sure the bar wears down in time.  </li>
            <li>, FEEL just like they did after an hourlong at-home or professional pedicure; and my husband can instantly tell the difference!!!  </li>
            <li>plus it is actually *soft* enough and doesnt hurt after every use.</li>
            <li>This has been a battle since I used pumice stones (real ones) and they just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job I expected.  </li>
            <li>I do not believe Mr Pumice Pumi Bar has any natural materials, especially volcanic rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t scrape up my skin or leave any abrasions, but rather left my feet feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>it really works in getting rid of the rough spots on the feet.</li>
            <li>Recently bought this pumice stone to try, as the one I had used previously nearly doubled in price.  </li>
            <li>These stones are made for cleaning stains off toilets, porcelain sinks, etc. and works very well on my feet.</li>
            <li>Eventually it gets very this in the center and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li>Which may be an under statment, the rough grit texture really gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I would have been better off scrubbing my skin with broken glass; all this did was cut my skin</li>
            <li>I mean when I was sleeping not even my blankets liked to cuddle with me.&lt;br /&gt;Yessss when I moved in the bed at night I would feel the blanket rubbing and snagging on my coarse and rough feet...</li>
            <li>actually I woundnt recommend it to be done everyday maybe every other day at the most.</li>
            <li>It also dries out quickly so it doesn&#x27;t mildew like others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>It makes a mess all over everything &amp; leaves a funny feel on hands.</li>
            <li>But using mr pumice bar then applying a thick foot cream with a chemical exfoliant such as amlactin and wearing socks to bed makes them super soft</li>
            <li>this product is worth every penny, no more hidding my feet.</li>
            <li>I misplaced my first one and didn&#x27;t go a week before I purchased another one.</li>
            <li>Yes it can wear down quickly because it is a little soft, but this is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>perfect balance between strong enough to get my worst spots on my feet and still stays together, yet soft enough to not be irritating.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend has dry heels that have started to crack (and hes way to young for that)</li>
            <li>My heels are extremely dry and they crack frequently.  </li>
            <li>Very coarse but not painful in the least.</li>
            <li>takes all of the calluses off just go easy and don&#x27;t rub too hard,do a little at a time than a few times a week and it helps between pedicures</li>
            <li>whether its wet or dry will not repurchase im going back to my real stone.</li>
            <li>Some were good and some were bad.</li>

            <li> I find it works awesome on keeping my feet silky smooth when used 1x a week.</li>
            <li> then hes good for about a month.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for an effective pumice that does the job.</li>
            <li> For those days when you just can&#x27;t get to the salon but want a good foot scrub, this is it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>

            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved it...</li>
            <li> Never found anything that works this good on my heels.</li>
            <li> Good for women.</li>
            <li> A good portion of it falls off every time you use it.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> I have tried the pedi egg, the pedi spin, the den something handheld scraper thing, all worked good for a while</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> its alright and works fairly well.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and order two of the Mr. Pumice and it works as good.  </li>
            <li> Great, I love it.  </li>
            <li> but I am sure it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the item purchased.</li>
            <li> Will keep ordering more!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> After a while your feel will retain moisture better and you won&#x27;t even need the bar anymore!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> It saves you from getting so many pedicures!</li>
            <li> Keeps my tootsies in top condition!</li>
            <li> Love this pumice bar!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite budget luxuries!  </li>
            <li> Love these!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*Works way better!</li>
            <li> However, the bar worked amazingly and rinsed off well for periodic use.</li>
            <li> when i unwrapped it, it looked kinda like cheap Styrofoam, but it worked great.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Works amazing though.</li>
            <li> This product cleans and removes cracks on heels effectively.</li>
            <li> and then I just keep them nicely moisturized with some Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best pumice I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> i need to buy the kind that they use at the nail place.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job for in between pedi&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is a good pumice bar, but i&#x27;ve tried dollar store ones that were better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for someone looking to save some cash but still wants a great product!</li>
            <li> My husband does my pedicures and sometimes I do them on my own</li>
            <li> but we both liked the product.</li>
            <li> did not care for this, it kind of comes apart when you&#x27;re using it ?</li>
            <li> This is honestly the lowest quality pumice stone I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> When I found this i read the review and while most people say it worked really good for their cracked feet</li>
            <li> i had a pumice stone that i used for pedicures but wanted to try something that seems popular.</li>
            <li> I very strongly recommend Mr. Pumice.</li>
            <li> Noticed improvement on the very first use great product</li>
            <li> But this is the perfect product for my skin to KEEP it soft when I get pedicures.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of lotions and soaks but by far this has worked the best.</li>
            <li> This is SO much more effective though.  </li>
            <li> I was blown away by the results, as my feet are now baby soft and flawless.</li>
            <li> one is better by far, and does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I saw great reviews on this product when I first bought it a couple years ago.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit scratchy and is very light.  </li>
            <li> Pumice is defined as a very light and porous volcanic rock formed when a gas-rich froth of glassy lava solidifies rapidly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Effective and Easy to Use</li>
            <li> Effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> makes my skin very smooth, best to use right after a shower, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Great item, I have dry heels and this worked wonders and smoothed out my heels, prompt delivery and great product, would recommend it</li>
            <li> So easy to use and more effective than a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> i love the way it make my feet feel, when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> Excellent product - I&#x27;d definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love this pumice bar.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and they look and better yet</li>
            <li> assure you, they in fact do deserve a 5 star rating. :)</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li> Cheap and gets the job done!  </li>
            <li> i love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many pumice bars and this one just didn&#x27;t do it for me</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> i guess i have more callouses??</li>
            <li> I love getting my feet pampered and my salon always uses these butthey cost around six or seven dollars here.</li>
            <li> But I use this in the shower with just bar soap and my feet are fabulous!</li>
            <li> should of done more research on it before I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I love the pumice bar.  </li>
            <li> I wish I got more than the 2 pieces I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s even better than what most pedicure salons use.</li>
            <li> So i used this on my feet with the O&#x27;Keef&#x27;s Healthy foot cream and it made my heels</li>
            <li> i have never felt so confident with showing my feet and wearing sandals.</li>
            <li> Love this product it works so well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to using this, I&#x27;ve also been using [[ASIN:B0002QB9NE O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme 3.2oz Jar]]</li>
            <li> They look horrendous more often than not.  </li>
            <li> It feels better than the earth stones that you can buy the stores.</li>
            <li> it help to work better.</li>
            <li> My calloused heals have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, but I&#x27;m sticking with this one &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This helped a lot, as well as the o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s healthy feet creme.</li>
            <li> Not bad!!!</li>
            <li> This pumice bar is softer, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day in the shower and my feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I like the stone much better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> my feet haven&#x27;t been more happier.</li>
            <li> I got a micro plane and it works much better.</li>
            <li> I love the size and shape .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use soap with it for maximum effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than the one I bought at Target which I threw away.</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> and they work so much better than the ped-eggs.</li>
            <li> Makes funky feet feel better.</li>
            <li> My favorite pumice bar for years.</li>
            <li> came on time works ok</li>
            <li> love it, works well.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and the seller shipped it to me quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is a great pumice product, I would highly recommend it to anyone that get&#x27;s callouses on their feet.  </li>
            <li> At the price, though, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, I don&#x27;t like the purple stuff that comes off when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and keeps your feet perfectly smooth in between pedicures!  </li>
            <li> Really cheap but works better than most.</li>
            <li> Produces alot of &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; just touching it, however, its cheap and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Fantastic :)</li>
            <li> The bar is incredibly &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; and fell apart the second I began using it.</li>
            <li> Such a great product at such a great price!</li>
            <li> I find it works best when I wet it, then put liquid soap on it, then use it.</li>
            <li> All in all though not bad!</li>
            <li> Easy instructions and</li>
            <li> it breaks easily</li>
            <li> Falling apart too easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before and it was so easy.</li>
            <li> being said, don&#x27;t expect this to be like Mr. Clean&#x27;s Magic Eraser, becasue</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> easy to hold and does the job.</li>
            <li> The size of it is great for the pedicurist, it&#x27;s a bit bigger than most and therefore easy for her/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the rest and Mr. Pumice is by far the best otu there it&#x27;s used at all the high end nail salons.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s defintely a strong bar that is perfect for the feet.&lt;br /&gt;i still notice that little pieces are falling off</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did the merchant ship the item out quickly, they also shipped out a very good quality item.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Was expecting to have to scrub and scrub but wonderfully the dry skin came right off.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little pumice.</li>
            <li> This little, purple tool works wonders and is a great thing to have in the summertime!</li>
            <li> I now have smooth feet...</li>
            <li> and they are callous free.</li>
            <li> Its cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> It does take a few uses to get your feet perfect</li>
            <li> i brought this product and have never been so happy, i actually have softer feet.</li>
            <li> Seems really cheap</li>
            <li> this is a must for smooth feet..</li>
            <li> Used it twice and heels are smooth again.</li>
            <li> The Mr. Pumice does an excellent job in removing any dead skin.</li>
            <li> After one use my feet were smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who just wanted to smooth out his feet.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and light and suited my needs</li>
            <li> thisa thing crumbles a lot but does smooth feet to an extent.  </li>
            <li> A quick rinse and the bar is clean!</li>
            <li> It works great, (best when wet), and keeps my feet smooth and soft a lot longer than a normal stone pumice, which does not even compare to this.  </li>
            <li> It is very worth the money.</li>
            <li> This item was not expensive, and the fact that it had Free shipping was even better.</li>
            <li> using this product is super easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost exactly a year now, and I&#x27;ve worn away maybe an eighth of an inch on the most used parts of the bar.</li>
            <li> Get the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp (Foot File) instead!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased one bar for $5 from the nail salon and then discovered Amazon had them cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of how great this seemed to work when I read some of the reviews -- but this pumice bar really is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this on a whim....</li>
            <li> Not exactly painful, but I didn&#x27;t enjoy using them at all.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for my feet and its still working fine, love it.  </li>
            <li> I love being barefoot, but I also love soft feet.</li>
            <li> Helps clean off some of my calluses in the shower.</li>
            <li> The pumice actually works nicely and doesn&#x27;t immediately get moldy like so many do.  </li>
            <li> My feet are so soft and smooth its amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get my feet really clean without these.  </li>
            <li> it is by far the best i have tried yet and think i have finally ended my search.</li>
            <li> Mr. Pumice is great at smoothing rough skin making it smooth.</li>
            <li> Wow am I glad I tried this one!  </li>
            <li> This is a great combination for dry and cracked heels!</li>
            <li> And the price is right!</li>
            <li> Of course the pumice works great on rough heels.</li>
            <li> Wish the bar was bigger, but a good value.</li>
            <li> It seems as though it will last awhile which is also good.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad on here as I compared it to the price it is sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty.</li>
            <li> It feels really good to be able to just scuff this up and down your fee at the end of a shower.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and very gentle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After several satisfied weeks and at this price, I&#x27;m buying more to stock up and give to friends and family (great stocking stuffer) with chronic dry, peeling and/or cracked feet!!  </li>
            <li> came quickly and looks as pictured.</li>
            <li> Super lightweight.</li>
            <li> This bar helped my heels but it wears away quickly and flakes.</li>
            <li> I got out of the shower, applied some cream to my heels, and noticed a HUGE difference after just the first use.  </li>
            <li> My feet were smooth after the first use.</li>
            <li> It lasted a good while, but eventually I tried a different product...which has been far better in quality and ease of use.</li>
            <li> by far my favorite thing to clean my hands up</li>
            <li> This is okay if you don&#x27;t live in an area where you walk lots.</li>
            <li> It crumbled in my bath tub the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> After only 2 uses, my feet were silky smooth!!</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of grit that comes off of the stone when you use it, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found to keep my feet soft!</li>
            <li> After using them this way each time I bathed for a couple weeks, I felt they were more or less equally effective.</li>
            <li> I truly love this pumice and am completely brand loyal to this now.</li>
            <li> I normally have a lot of dry skin on my heels and this takes care of it beautifully.  </li>
            <li> and it really gets it smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it every time i shower, and Im never afraid to wear sandals pr flip flops.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate its worth the price buy it now.</li>
            <li> this and my tweezer man callous remover, get my feet so soft love it.</li>
            <li> and I do not even have to soak my feet; I only used it after a warm shower.  </li>
            <li> i honestly think its the same one they use!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it kinda looked like the same kind they use when you get a pedicure.</li>
            <li> SO THRILLED with this product, and will definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because it does the job quickly and leaves my feet ultra smooth.  </li>
            <li> Other pumice bars have hurt my feet but this one was comfortable yet effective.</li>
            <li> Nothing major, easy to clean but a nuisance nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> i have him use the pumice in the shower and put the lotion on right afterwards</li>
            <li> Got my feet looking right.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> it works really well to clean up my heels.</li>
            <li> This little bar is amazing!  </li>
            <li> It has helped my feet to stay super smooth and without the hurt that I found most with other pumice bars.</li>
            <li> good quality, average price.  </li>
            <li> so so very much</li>
            <li> leaves feet smooth unlike many other pumice stones/scrubbers</li>
            <li> Really does the job removing heel calluses; best used with a less abrasive bar for final cut.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just right for that soft, clean, spa feeling.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft and smooth after using this</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain!  </li>
            <li> This is a must have tool to keep your foot soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> It works very well with callous removing gel!</li>
            <li> but this pumice stone is worth a few minutes to &amp;#34;write home about&amp;#34; (literally) and of course, spread the word for others like myself who have been on lifelong grail searches for the perfect peeling/cracked foot &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; or Moms who barely have time to take a good daily shower</li>
            <li> It is exactly like the foam blocks kids use for crafts.</li>
            <li> It really does the job and so grateful I purchased it!</li>
            <li> This pumice bar last a long time and my feet look great.  </li>
            <li> This bar doesnt even look like its been used, so I&#x27;m sure it will last!</li>
            <li> I definitely wish I would have purchased more than one at a time though because I want to always have one in my shower.</li>
            <li> At first glance you would think this is not going to work.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t magic, and my callouses/dead skin isn&#x27;t totally gone yet, but I do notice some improvement every time I use</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, it WORKS!  </li>
            <li> the first time i saw it was at the salon</li>
            <li> I was set to get married</li>
            <li> But after the first time it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Pair</li>
            <li> I first scene it at Sally&#x27;s .They</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it regularly since then and just bought more of them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite justify when it works - but not any better than an actual pumice stone.</li>
            <li> It satisfactorily accomplishes the desired purpose of the reason that it was purchased in the first place.</li>
            <li> I finally bought another one and my feet are no longer calloused, instead they are soft, smooth, and super clean.</li>
            <li> :  I&#x27;m a guy, and this whole pumice thing is weird to me, but it makes my girl happy, good enough for</li>
            <li> I love it, it lasts such a long time, and works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> I ordered my own and use it every other day in the shower</li>
            <li> This pumice bar is truly heavy duty and does a wonderful job on rough feet after they have soaked.</li>
            <li> Replaced it with a pedicure rasp that worked much faster and didn&#x27;t need to have my skin soaked to soften it up first.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend, especially to those people out there that think their feet can&#x27;t be saved.  :-)</li>
            <li> This product breaks too easily and wears out after several uses.</li>
            <li> The smoother pumice bars are only good for minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> These work good, but don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I scraped it across my foot and immediately the ridges on the pumice started becoming flat.</li>
            <li> It comes in fine, medium and coarse.</li>
            <li> I buffed my fingertips with the same fine grit stone pumice afterwards as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I recommend this particular pumice stone to anyone who has cracked heels!</li>
            <li> amazing little product.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly great at removing years of dead skin from my male, abused feet.  </li>
            <li> My fault for not reading the description closely, since I bought this rather fast just to go with another order.</li>
            <li> Its gentle on your feet, yet does the job.</li>
            <li> These are really the way to go.  </li>
            <li> Beings that this item was really rather inexpensive</li>
            <li> I really am trying to make it work</li>
            <li> I like it, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> on here it much cheaper.</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;m giving one to my Mom.</li>
            <li> Also shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have went to the nail salon recently and they used a mr.pumice bar and it made my feet so smooth, so I brought one</li>
            <li> I really wish I would have taken before and after photos.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping to.</li>
            <li> more than i expected.</li>
            <li> Even that doesn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s so cheap you can afford to replace it frequently if necessary.  </li>
            <li> did i buy a whole punch of them and gave away to my daughters and friends.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a real pumice stone, but I think it works better than one.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and it seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the way it works, it isn&#x27;t as pruductive as a real pumice stone.</li>
            <li> but it does work and has not broken yet.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It works really well with just soap and water.</li>
            <li> It also works really well on your hands as well.</li>
            <li> Now, I have to be really gentle with it.</li>
            <li> I bought one a few years back from bb&amp;b, and it was the best pumice ever, except it was smaller and blue.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> it has definitely made my feet more soft.</li>
            <li> The combo of the two has been really effective, but the key player is definitely this pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I have found something to make my feet normal!  </li>
            <li> Better than any other pumice you look for.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, how do I clean the pumice after I&#x27;m done?</li>
            <li> I lost my last Mr. Pumice bar and for months I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would clean my feet as well as this could.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it really smoothed out my feet (and to be frank they were in rough shape).</li>
            <li> recommend going over the skin with a finer grit stone pumice to buff the skin surface smooth after using this to remove all the dead skin quickly.</li>
            <li> not often that you make an online purchase and can say that you&#x27;re happily surprised about how much better&lt;br /&gt;it was than you thought it would be; this is one item that you will say is even better than you expected.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> As a new Mom I don&#x27;t have as much time as I used to for writing reviews</li>
            <li> Let me say, this is much better than the typical metal ones.</li>
            <li> This does a decent job on my feet</li>
            <li> My routine is bi-weekly pedicures and a quick daily scrub in the shower with this pumi bar.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but personally I need a more coarse pumice then this for my feet.</li>
            <li> This pumice bar manages to get most of the dry skin off, resulting in smooth feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, to reduce the mess, I&#x27;ll use it in the shower with the water running.  </li>
            <li> However, if you live in a city where you live a lot of walking steer clear and find something a little bit more powerful...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sure, there are little pieces of purple pumice that come off everywhere, but so are your feet shavings, so who cares?  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> I love these little things.</li>
            <li> i love this little pumice bar.</li>
            <li> Just get it wet, rub soap on your feet, and scrub lightly.</li>
            <li> It does dent in a bit with use, but it really keeps my feet soft.  </li>
            <li> i just wanted to smooth out an elbow that i lean on while working that gets rough.</li>
            <li> they are coarser and more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I well never buy this again, Don&#x27;t waste your money, Go buy something better.</li>
            <li> I love these bars; they truly do what they are supposed to...removes dead skin, softens callouses, helps rid of cracked heels, and cleans feet.</li>
            <li> This product was good, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say I have never seen an average person with as much callused and dry feet as my own.</li>
            <li> I say this because although your skin might feel baby soft and smooth right after you use this, once it has time to dry and harden again(like in 3-4 days) your skin will be rougher than before if you don&#x27;t do this extra step.</li>
            <li> When I found this online, I recognized it right away as what they were using at my local salon.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost compared to many many other wasted dollars i have spent!</li>
            <li> Both sides, wether coarse or fine, are very coarse.</li>
            <li> I soaked my feet for about 45 minutes in warm water with a little white vinegar before.  </li>
            <li> I live in flip flops and</li>
            <li> and it still looks new.</li>
            <li> But, I tried it and now I can&#x27;t live without one of these in my shower.</li>
            <li> Does not crack, have been using it for a month or so and looks like new.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li> After just ONE USE of just a few minutes (fussy baby), I had such amazing results that it is part of my routine twice a week at the end of my shower so my feet have soaked in water, followed up by either Nutiva&#x27;s Coconut Oil or Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter</li>
            <li> This is only effective after removing the impenetrable layer of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I personally have never used a REAL pumice stone, so I can&#x27;t really compare the two, but this thing sort of seems to work.  </li>
            <li> very soft.</li>
            <li> It has lasted me 6+ months so far!</li>
            <li> Other products work better and last longer.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a old fashioned Pumice Stone in the stores and have only found short rounded smooth ones or the metal graters.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> So far no issues!</li>
            <li> It does leave purcple little crystals after using it, but it washes off just as easy with water.</li>
            <li> But after 2 days of using this in the shower on my super dry feet, I can say my feet are baby soft.</li>
            <li> On my feet all day and mostly barefoot (indoors) with lifelong issues of chronically dry, peeling and cracked heels (inherited from both my parents) who has tried everything but who no longer has the time to try an umpteenth product or spend that weekly at home hourly pedicure which used to be my best solution as an alternative to a professional pedicure because I am now a stay-at-home Mom of an infant/toddler, I desperately needed a solution that would only add a couple minutes to my routine without being aggressive to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I honestly don&#x27;t see it work on my skin or make it any better. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard core and doesn&#x27;t take off hard parts, but its a good rough finish for in between polishing.</li>
            <li> Because of this, it makes a huge mess when you use it.  </li>
            <li> It did feel like there was lotion or some other softening agent in it which was cool</li>
            <li> This product just doesnt seem to cut it unless your feet are already super soft with the start of rough patches.</li>
            <li> It really sloughs away the dry heels on the soles of the feet, yet  is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this because I had read all the good reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical -- less than three bucks at my local beauty supply store -- and is simple and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> cheap little bar.</li>
            <li> This Pumice stone I found to be more of a hard Styrofoam product than a stone.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it is more like a hard styrofoam.</li>
            <li> Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;*Really light and fluffy, compared to my old one, like a volcanic rock.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally something that can keep my poor diabetic feet smooth and pain free.  </li>
            <li> Just like what they use in the professional nail salons.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my shower and use it daily and really like how it works.</li>
            <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t like this pumice as much as my others.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s going to last much longer than all the others I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> I keep one in the shower and use it just about every day to keep my feet soft.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of pumice stones both natural and synthetic, brushes, files, polishers, creams, exfoliants and treatments with mixed/inconsistent results.  </li>
            <li> it will probably take two or three weeks to completely remove the calluses.</li>
            <li> This item gets my feet soft after using it.</li>
            <li> MY feet are so soft now.</li>
            <li> I use this for my heels and it makes them really soft.</li>
            <li> It removed all the dead skin and made my feet so smooth</li>
            <li> It falls apart fast and get gritty stuff all over.</li>
            <li> So far it has been working like a charm</li>
            <li> I also found out that this sort of material is also used by professional pedicurist.</li>
            <li> When I pointed out to my husband how soft my feet felt, he also noticed the difference</li>
            <li> I get frequent pedicures and get the acid/callus remover combo.  </li>
            <li> But I really didn&#x27;t like the grainy, oily residue this left on my hands after using it.</li>
            <li> but I still prefer my old school pumice.</li>
            <li> Some reviews complain about it coming a part/flaking, but I didn&#x27;t think it was that big of a deal,  some little-tiny crumbs, but nothing really to speak of.  </li>
            <li> this is not what they use when you get a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get my feet soft and not have to pay those values removals at the shop.</li>
            <li> It keeps the bottom of my feet soft without ever having to do anything else to them.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time (2 years on my last one), works really well and is a pretty purple color.</li>
            <li> This makes fast work of getting rid of dead/rough skin especially on the feet.</li>
            <li> it certainly isn&#x27;t magic, but it does seem to slowly work...</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;ll wear down pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It made a purple mess all over the place, so I had to be sure to use it over the toilet.</li>
            <li> I still have to hold my foot over the toilet to not make a mess, but it&#x27;s way better and faster than this purple thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mr. Pumice Extra Coarse along with Compound W in order to remove a planters wart on the bottom of my right foot.</li>
            <li> The product smoothed out the cracked, thick skin on my feet after just one or two sessions -- a feat that no previous pumice stone was able to do.</li>
            <li> After using it just twice over the course of a week, it helped remove the rough, pointed callouses that I get on the edges of my toes, in a very gentle way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you have callouses and rough spots that you want to get rid of quickly.</li>
            <li> I used it, and after I told him about the resultant mess and what Mr Pumice was really made of, my generous husband said it had not cost much and that I ought to just chuck the thing.</li>
            <li> let me tell you I never have cracked feet just extremely rough and this lovely little bar worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I live on a farm, so I use this thing daily!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*Really rough, surprised at how much grit there is to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a week and my feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> Less and less seem to rub off the more I use it</li>
            <li> Little purple granules come off the bar as you use it, so I&#x27;m sure the bar wears down in time.  </li>
            <li> , FEEL just like they did after an hourlong at-home or professional pedicure; and my husband can instantly tell the difference!!!  </li>
            <li> plus it is actually *soft* enough and doesnt hurt after every use.</li>
            <li> This has been a battle since I used pumice stones (real ones) and they just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job I expected.  </li>
            <li> I do not believe Mr Pumice Pumi Bar has any natural materials, especially volcanic rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t scrape up my skin or leave any abrasions, but rather left my feet feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> it really works in getting rid of the rough spots on the feet.</li>
            <li> Recently bought this pumice stone to try, as the one I had used previously nearly doubled in price.  </li>
            <li> These stones are made for cleaning stains off toilets, porcelain sinks, etc. and works very well on my feet.</li>
            <li> Eventually it gets very this in the center and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Which may be an under statment, the rough grit texture really gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I would have been better off scrubbing my skin with broken glass; all this did was cut my skin</li>
            <li> I mean when I was sleeping not even my blankets liked to cuddle with me.&lt;br /&gt;Yessss when I moved in the bed at night I would feel the blanket rubbing and snagging on my coarse and rough feet...</li>
            <li> actually I woundnt recommend it to be done everyday maybe every other day at the most.</li>
            <li> It also dries out quickly so it doesn&#x27;t mildew like others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It makes a mess all over everything &amp; leaves a funny feel on hands.</li>
            <li> But using mr pumice bar then applying a thick foot cream with a chemical exfoliant such as amlactin and wearing socks to bed makes them super soft</li>
            <li> this product is worth every penny, no more hidding my feet.</li>
            <li> I misplaced my first one and didn&#x27;t go a week before I purchased another one.</li>
            <li> Yes it can wear down quickly because it is a little soft, but this is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> perfect balance between strong enough to get my worst spots on my feet and still stays together, yet soft enough to not be irritating.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has dry heels that have started to crack (and hes way to young for that)</li>
            <li> My heels are extremely dry and they crack frequently.  </li>
            <li> Very coarse but not painful in the least.</li>
            <li> takes all of the calluses off just go easy and don&#x27;t rub too hard,do a little at a time than a few times a week and it helps between pedicures</li>
            <li> whether its wet or dry will not repurchase im going back to my real stone.</li>
            <li> Some were good and some were bad.</li>
            <li> My feet were very bad and rough and I used one time and it was awesome!!</li>
            <li> Very hard to clean out.</li>
            <li> It requires little effort and is quick to do as well (less than a minute for both feet).  </li>
            <li> this is not made for human skin ,it is so harsh and rough which cause skin rash even if you use this very gently .</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft now after using it for about 2 weeks every other day.</li>
            <li> purple material does crumble a bit when it&#x27;s new, but after the initial breaking-in period, only a few particles fall off with each use.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel like sand paper, snag delicate fabrics, or scare your significant other when you brush up against them.</li>
            <li> it seems to get &amp;quot;used up&amp;quot; after every use, but I dont use it daily, so this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> possibly wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on repairing them with lotions and stuff, but using this bar wet has made a major difference in the way my feet look and feel.</li>
            <li> The bar does &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; little purple pieces, but they just wash right down the drain.</li>
            <li> It is not super hard like many other pumice stones i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I have very rough heels and with only using it twice I have seen a major difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much I like it, but I sort of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I order them 5-6 at a time and they last me all year long (if not longer).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for months, they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> does what it is suppose to ,but doesn&#x27;t last to long.</li>
            <li> It looked like a Mr Pumice massacre in the shower for the first use, I just washed the little grits down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Pretty color and only sheds the little purple fibers a little.</li>
            <li> It works well and seems like it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it flakes off when you use it or even when gently handling it.</li>
            <li> that said, it does do a decent job at removing dead, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The fine side is very coarse while the coarse side is crazy coarse.</li>
            <li> pretty gross to say the least!</li>
            <li> The reason for only 4 stars is I don&#x27;t want people to get the idea that you can scrub off a deep crack in one session as other reviewers have suggested.</li>
            <li> dead skin get in there and its hard to clean.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long either, quickly getting ruts in the surface where my toe was rubbed against, making it difficult to rub only the callus.</li>
            <li> As for any mess, I&#x27;ve personally found it small, a quick clean-up, and really not worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> accidently entered an earlier review rating that would have indicated only an average product...</li>
            <li> I was never able to complete a 2 week routine of soaking my feet daily.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t do a lot for those who just have a minor problem.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a natural stone.</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> In a few days they were completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something to smooth out my feet, which are generally dry, cracked and scary.  </li>
            <li> I tried using this bar exclusively on one foot, while using the regular pumice stone on the other.</li>
            <li> It works about the same as a regular pumice stone, except leaves little purple granules.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other things that do.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as big a deal as some of the other reviews makes it seem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but Mr. Pumice is the only one for me.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for those people who have the truly hard callouses on their feet.</li>
            <li> so i bought this for him with something called \\&quot;Dry Heel Eliminator\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> my heels always get soo dry and cracked in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> Dry heat and always flip flop season</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple weeks now, and it still hasn&#x27;t worn down very much, so I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviews are talking about.</li>
            <li> Bar is not made well, is not a good purchase and is nothing like the Real pumice stones you can get anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Also, local store (sally&#x27;s) sales for half the price.</li>
            <li> and I would guess that it has over half its life left.</li>
            <li> Regular pumice stones also wear down with use; it&#x27;s just less obvious because any particles are grey and much less noticeable than the purple bits that fall off this bar.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I was hoping for a stone bar, and this is just rough styrofoam that turns into a giant dust mess if you attempt to use it.</li>
            <li> This bar is a little coarser than my regular pumice stones, however, and I prefer it for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> about every day or every other day I scrub my feet so they don&#x27;t have marks left on my feet from the black flip flops or dirt.</li>
            <li> but the material is lightweight, almost like a rough foam or something.</li>
            <li> Please read the description carefully.</li>
            <li> It felt very similar to the foam you use in basket and wreath making -- you know, that green block stuff that crumbles with the slightest touch?</li>
            <li> me start of by saying I have some ROUGH feet.  </li>
            <li> Please use this with wet feet and wet the puma bar.</li>
            <li> So let me tell you that when I say my feet were rough</li>
            <li> It is rough but not too rough.</li>
            <li> They are made of some type of synthetic material that actually scrapes away the dead skin and calluses on the bottom of your feet.</li>
            <li> Also be careful when handling.</li>
            <li> Your hands can get rough from using this.</li>
            <li> its not really pumice.</li>
            <li> this wig nighttime routine of putting Vaseline on your feet followed by thick socks and sleep in it and your feet will be soft</li>
            <li> i do like this but one down side is that unless you properly dry it, the water that gets stuck between the crevice will smell.</li>
            <li> it left my elbow skinned and raw.</li>
            <li> Use them when your heels are really wet (after 10 minutes) and this little bar will get the dry skin off.</li>
            <li> I used mine wet with a little body wash, rinsed the bar thoroughly after using, and let air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pumice with a single drop of Compound W after every shower and after less than 3 weeks it appears the wart has been removed successively.</li>
            <li> It falls apart with purple pieces going all over and doesn&#x27;t quite get my hand callous off the way the other pumices i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews on this Pumice stone has me doubting all other reviews I have ever read on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> other than the ones at nail salons-</li>
            <li> I keep this in the shower and use it every other night.</li>
            <li> Only gave four stars because im not sure if will continue to work....</li>
            <li> its sharp.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> After a while, the bar will wear down in the center, and I just flip it and begin using the other side.</li>
            <li> The only thing i don&#x27;t like about this is that it can be a little messy.</li>
            <li> But it can also leaves your skin in a very rough state afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thought i would give this pumice a try after all the other ones i have tried and have no success with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as solid or hard as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Point #1 - If you are reading this review, and have no idea what Mr. Pumice is (like I did), then my basic description is that it&#x27;s some sort of foam made up of tiny hard particles that slowly come off as you use</li>
            <li> Some people complained that it was too short.</li>
            <li> I had alot of trouble with my feet getting rough.</li>
            <li> They do wear down, but 1 bar is lasting at least 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t smooth out your skin after using this with a finer grit instrument, and you let your roughed up skin dry and harden, you will be proned to painful cracking and peeling which will likely be worse than what you started with.</li>
            <li> As you scrub, sand-like pieces of the bar come off as it wears down.</li>
            <li> You just have to replace when you&#x27;ve worn it down.</li>
            <li> you need a pumice stone for heavy, hard callouses, go to your local hardware store, and in their cleaning section, they should have pumice stones.  </li>
            <li> Less scrubbing required.  </li>
            <li> This was half that</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the typical gray pumice stones.</li>
            <li> I think this is why they work so well compared to a typical pumice stone that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered a coarse one for a serious problem.</li>
            <li> I was using a hard grey pumice stone, it seemed to work okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> try on other parts of the body with thinner/sensitive skin, like elbows, only use on tough calloused skin, like the heel.</li>
            <li> It also sheds when you use it, little flecks of purple all over the place... that then wash down the drain.  </li>
            <li> My feet aren&#x27;t that bad, but whenever it is \\&quot;flip flop\\&quot; season, they get pretty dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of what seems like purple styrafoam and creates quite a mess when using it.</li>
            <li> To anyone reading reviews saying this crumbles/disintegrates - not true.</li>
            <li> No more rough feet.</li>
            <li> Last a super long time and don&#x27;t get nasty.  </li>
            <li> Other than going to get pampered, this product leaves very little reason to go have a pedicure done.  </li>
            <li> However, it takes months for it to even thin down in the middle and mine still hasn&#x27;t even broken in half after 6 months of daily use.  </li>
            <li> A little rub with this with some soap</li>
            <li> A little Bag Balm after.</li>
            <li> little sandy purple things on your floor</li>
            <li> the only thing i had a problem with is that it was 3 days late!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like little specks that come off, doesn&#x27;t impact the effectiveness of this product at all.</li>
            <li> Not kidding when I say,  3 times using this little scrubb&#x27;y in the shower with applying AmLactin</li>
            <li> I keep one in the shower, and about three times per week I put a little soap or shampoo on it, and scrub my heels.  </li>
            <li> one I bought is falling in little pieces like sand.  </li>
            <li> little purple grits fall off and get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> This is a manmade substance which you are repeatedly rubbing against your tough, hardened skin, so yes; tiny particles fall off.</li>
            <li> I am disappointing in amazon reviews for this one because it&#x27;s almost more useless than my shabby ones.</li>
            <li> When Im in the shower, I let my conditioner soak in my hair, and a few strokes over my feet</li>
            <li> I use the pumice bar everyday in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the one you need if you have heavily callused or cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Rub with it for a few minutes after you take a bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear flip flops literally year round</li>
            <li> so my feet are scratchy and harsh and callused.</li>
            <li> had to through it away cause its messy</li>
            <li> Crumbly, messy.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get dead skin off my feet at all</li>
            <li> I could feel/see the yucky dead skin coming off my feet.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, my feet are almost healed.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended Mr. Pumice to me a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I need to rip dead skin away faster.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and DO NOT purchase this product</li>
            <li> I use everyday.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to do it everyday</li>
            <li> I load them up with liquid soap every shower, and scrub away the dirt, dead skin, etc on the bottom of my feet.  </li>
            <li> This product truly works to get rid of all the dead skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> I prefer stone over this because of all the waste that falls off.</li>
            <li> Removes the dead cracking skin but leaves the rest, did not give my a rash or any</li>
            <li> I suppose this soft pumice stone would do well on fingertips or other places where the skin is not so hard, but for the heavy callouses on the heels of my feet , it is useless.</li>
            <li> Have used this 5 times on both feet (takes less than a minute for each foot!)</li>
            <li> First Pumice stone that does nothing, doesn&#x27;t even take off dead skin, was disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rough and tough in all areas</li>
            <li> (You wont believe how much dead skin comes off!)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hated how I could never get my feet as smooth as the salon when getting pedicures.</li>
            <li> the are no more than like 3 or 4 bucks.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of pumice stones and such for my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> When you use it, it shed small purple granules from the bar.</li>
            <li> No more metal files for me.  </li>
            <li> This pumice beats any I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what to do with this,</li>
            <li> but in small already.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I usually use a hard pumice stone</li>
            <li> Part of the bar is abraded, like broken, wanted to return it but decided not to, not worth the time.</li>
            <li> This purple thing takes off the yucky stuff but does not scrape so hard that it makes the feet hurt.  </li>
            <li> I also put a little liquid soap on it with each use!!</li>
            <li> My heels used to be rough and cracked and it was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have always used the harder pumice bars for pedicures, but they are uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Removed dead skin that was a result of poor shoe support.</li>
            <li> After using Mr. Pumice I apply a thick cream on my feet then apply socks.</li>
            <li> hands down!!!</li>
            <li> Cracked heels no more!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> It works better than any real or fake pumice stone I&#x27;ve had over the years and doesn&#x27;t hurt my feet when I&#x27;m scrubbing with this (unlike with real or fake pumice stones).</li>
            <li> Seriously  it falls apart when you use</li>
            <li> my feet aren&#x27;t too bad as I get regular pedicures.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of what seems like weak purple styrafoam.</li>
            <li> These bars are very hard.</li>
            <li> have to push or rub very hard to see and feel results.&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually removes the callus, and for the cost, you cant go wrong!!</li>
            <li> I was a little unhappy with Mr. Pumice pumi bar .</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this product awhile back; I&#x27;d been using a metal \\&quot;file\\&quot; for my feet and often I&#x27;d slip &amp; end up with scraped and bloody heels.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality pumice bar it does do its job but disintegrates as you use it</li>
            <li> I have tried every lotion, potion, and tool out there to try and save my poor feet.  </li>
            <li> and my feet went from awful to decent</li>
            <li> Maybe that grainy falling apart problem isn&#x27;t as bad after a few uses</li>
            <li> Pumice But Stiff Floral foam, Messy, Garbage, Very Disappointed!</li>
            <li> , I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I inherited my moms heels, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> and the worst thing if i want to return this ,this seller denied to take return back.</li>
            <li> , so I was initially disappointed when I received it; it was a sort of really hard foam structure.</li>
            <li> Use it with ProLin callus eliminator solution and it scrubs all the nasty hard skin off the bottom of ur feel.</li>
            <li> But I figured, for under $3.00, what do I have to lose if the product is bad?</li>
            <li> Before I used this product I had really ugly feet.</li>
            <li> After using it, I still have really ugly feet.</li>
            <li> but I am really disappointed in the grit coming off.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed</li>
            <li> 100% completely worthless.</li>
            <li> but i hate the engravings.</li>
            <li> i hate it.</li>
            <li> I hate pedicures at salons, I think it&#x27;s disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> My heels are absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> this has to be the worst &amp;#34;pumice&amp;#34; ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I now have smooth feet... lol</li>
            <li> used a few different ones before, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me. Also, local store (sally&#x27;s) sales for half the price.</li>
            <li> I love being barefoot, but I also love soft feet. This bar is like the ones used in salons .. I can achieve in seconds what took sometimes 10-15 minutes per foot with this bar ! When Im in the shower, I let my conditioner soak in my hair, and a few strokes over my feet and they are callous free. A quick rinse and the bar is clean! (You wont believe how much dead skin comes off!) I use it every time i shower, and Im never afraid to wear sandals pr flip flops.</li>
            <li> I bought this \\&quot;pumi bar\\&quot; and a pack of regular pumice stones at the same time. I tried using this bar exclusively on one foot, while using the regular pumice stone on the other. After using them this way each time I bathed for a couple weeks, I felt they were more or less equally effective. This bar is a little coarser than my regular pumice stones, however, and I prefer it for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple material does crumble a bit when it&#x27;s new, but after the initial breaking-in period, only a few particles fall off with each use. Regular pumice stones also wear down with use; it&#x27;s just less obvious because any particles are grey and much less noticeable than the purple bits that fall off this bar. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost exactly a year now, and I&#x27;ve worn away maybe an eighth of an inch on the most used parts of the bar. I can still read the side of the bar where it says \\&quot;MR PUMICE\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was a little unhappy with Mr. Pumice pumi bar . It makes a mess all over everything &amp; leaves a funny feel on hands. It does however works !</li>
            <li> I go barefoot year-round, so therefore have cracked and calloused feet year-round, and the Mr. Pumice Extra-Coarse Pumi Bar has been a lifesaver. It&#x27;s economical -- less than three bucks at my local beauty supply store -- and is simple and comfortable to use. As for any mess, I&#x27;ve personally found it small, a quick clean-up, and really not worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my feet.</li>
            <li> The one and ONLY pumice I will use! Its wonderful and love that it doesn&#x27;t collect bacteria! Will keep ordering more!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!</li>
            <li> bought it as a stocking stuffer. came quickly and looks as pictured.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I was hoping for a stone bar, and this is just rough styrofoam that turns into a giant dust mess if you attempt to use it. My fault for not reading the description closely, since I bought this rather fast just to go with another order. Went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> good quality, average price.  just get a scouring stick at the 99c store.  same thing.</li>
            <li> Great, I love it.  It is not super hard like many other pumice stones i&#x27;ve used.  There are ridges in it to really scrub off the dead skin.  I hate pedicures at salons, I think it&#x27;s disgusting.  But after 2 days of using this in the shower on my super dry feet, I can say my feet are baby soft.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time. Was expecting to have to scrub and scrub but wonderfully the dry skin came right off. The only thing is, how do I clean the pumice after I&#x27;m done?</li>
            <li> by far my favorite thing to clean my hands up I do crossfit and get callouses on my hand I use this in the shower and my hands stay nice and perfect</li>
            <li> This was a great product for the price. Easy instructions and you see the results almost instantly! I recommend this particular pumice stone to anyone who has cracked heels!</li>
            <li> Its cheap for a reason. Produces alot of &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; just touching it, however, its cheap and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect pumice stones. My husband works in construction so he uses it daily on his hands in the shower. I find it works awesome on keeping my feet silky smooth when used 1x a week.</li>
            <li> This is a very good Pumice Bar. Its the same one that is used in a lot of salons. Its gentle on your feet, yet does the job. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product cleans and removes cracks on heels effectively. Highly recommended. Don&#x27;t hesitate its worth the price buy it now.</li>
            <li> Finally something that can keep my poor diabetic feet smooth and pain free.  This purple thing takes off the yucky stuff but does not scrape so hard that it makes the feet hurt.  What a blessing!</li>
            <li> Awful. I play racquetball and get callouses on my big toes from it, which start to hurt after a while. Needed to shrink them, so I bought this. It made a purple mess all over the place, so I had to be sure to use it over the toilet. It didn&#x27;t last long either, quickly getting ruts in the surface where my toe was rubbed against, making it difficult to rub only the callus. Replaced it with a pedicure rasp that worked much faster and didn&#x27;t need to have my skin soaked to soften it up first. I still have to hold my foot over the toilet to not make a mess, but it&#x27;s way better and faster than this purple thing.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job.  It does take a few uses to get your feet perfect and then it&#x27;s just upkeep.  These are really the way to go.  Just like what they use in the professional nail salons.</li>
            <li> I use the pumice bar everyday in the shower. i love the way it make my feet feel, when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> I love this! I wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner. It works better than any real or fake pumice stone I&#x27;ve had over the years and doesn&#x27;t hurt my feet when I&#x27;m scrubbing with this (unlike with real or fake pumice stones). It don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s it&#x27;s made of but the material is lightweight, almost like a rough foam or something. My feet are so soft and smooth after using this and then I just keep them nicely moisturized with some Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula. Excellent product - I&#x27;d definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I keep it in my shower and use it daily and really like how it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help soften my feet and it works great. I use it every night in the shower, along with foot cream. It&#x27;s inexpensive and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t like this pumice as much as my others.  It falls apart with purple pieces going all over and doesn&#x27;t quite get my hand callous off the way the other pumices i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s defintely a strong bar that is perfect for the feet.&lt;br /&gt;i still notice that little pieces are falling off and i would prob order something a lot stronger like a stone next time.&lt;br /&gt;still a great deal for a great bar.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! It works great in the shower after you have washed your feet it has definitely made my feet more soft.</li>
            <li> This does a decent job on my feet but it starts to disintegrate as soon as you touch it. I&#x27;m not expecting this to last a month.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it! it breaks easily</li>
            <li> Get the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp (Foot File) instead!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do.  Works great.  I really can&#x27;t complain!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Noticed improvement on the very first use great product</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this because I had read all the good reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed. It&#x27;s made of what seems like purple styrafoam and creates quite a mess when using it. It didn&#x27;t make any noticeable difference in my heels at all. I&#x27;ll be ordered an actual pumice STONE to replace this.</li>
            <li> Falling apart too easily.</li>
            <li> My man loves to rub and kiss my feet therefore, its a must that my feet look and feel their best at all times.  I get lots of compliments on my feet.  My routine is bi-weekly pedicures and a quick daily scrub in the shower with this pumi bar.  I&#x27;ve tried all the rest and Mr. Pumice is by far the best otu there it&#x27;s used at all the high end nail salons.  I originally purchased one bar for $5 from the nail salon and then discovered Amazon had them cheaper.  I order them 5-6 at a time and they last me all year long (if not longer).  This is a must have tool to keep your foot soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> It has lasted me 6+ months so far!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Helps clean off some of my calluses in the shower.</li>
            <li> Really cheap but works better than most.</li>
            <li> The pumice actually works nicely and doesn&#x27;t immediately get moldy like so many do.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now.  This is now my go to pumice!  It seems like it&#x27;s going to last much longer than all the others I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has dry heels that have started to crack (and hes way to young for that) so i bought this for him with something called \\&quot;Dry Heel Eliminator\\&quot;. i have him use the pumice in the shower and put the lotion on right afterwards and it works great. He only has to do it a couple days in a row then hes good for about a month. The only thing i don&#x27;t like about this is that it can be a little messy. you end up with bits of purple sand in your shower.</li>
            <li> Love this pumice bar.  I keep one in the shower and use it just about every day to keep my feet soft.  Love it. I ordered two and only one was sent to me and I contacted the seller and another one was sent to me.</li>
            <li> Been lasting me for months and it don&#x27;t ever get slimy I leave it n my shower 😃😃😃</li>
            <li> This pumice bar is truly heavy duty and does a wonderful job on rough feet after they have soaked. It works very well with callous removing gel!</li>
            <li> I bought this item at my local nail salon, and then found it on Amazon.  I love this thing!  It works great, (best when wet), and keeps my feet smooth and soft a lot longer than a normal stone pumice, which does not even compare to this.  I love it, it lasts such a long time, and works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Yay! This is great!! It was recommended by several beauty gurus on YouTube, and I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. My feet are so soft now after using it for about 2 weeks every other day. Fantastic :)</li>
            <li> My heels are absolutely terrible. Regular pedicures with the acid callous remover are helpful, but they still need daily scrubbing in order to keep them under control. This worked awesome in the shower....and that&#x27;s coming from someone who has literally tried everything. Yes, it falls apart. It&#x27;s supposed to. However, it takes months for it to even thin down in the middle and mine still hasn&#x27;t even broken in half after 6 months of daily use.  I highly recommend for those people who have the truly hard callouses on their feet. Probably won&#x27;t do a lot for those who just have a minor problem.</li>
            <li> Before I used this product I had really ugly feet. After using it, I still have really ugly feet. But they are smoother and not as dry/dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con it that it WILL disintegrate over time. Maybe 10 uses at best. At the price, though, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> My grail search is finally over... I have tried all kinds of pumice stones both natural and synthetic, brushes, files, polishers, creams, exfoliants and treatments with mixed/inconsistent results.  On my feet all day and mostly barefoot (indoors) with lifelong issues of chronically dry, peeling and cracked heels (inherited from both my parents) who has tried everything but who no longer has the time to try an umpteenth product or spend that weekly at home hourly pedicure which used to be my best solution as an alternative to a professional pedicure because I am now a stay-at-home Mom of an infant/toddler, I desperately needed a solution that would only add a couple minutes to my routine without being aggressive to my sensitive skin so I could wear sandals or barefoot in public (pool/beach) without being self-conscious... this is IT!!!  After just ONE USE of just a few minutes (fussy baby), I had such amazing results that it is part of my routine twice a week at the end of my shower so my feet have soaked in water, followed up by either Nutiva&#x27;s Coconut Oil or Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter and they look and better yet, FEEL just like they did after an hourlong at-home or professional pedicure; and my husband can instantly tell the difference!!!  I am happy to flaunt my feet in sandals or barefoot at the pool or beach again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several satisfied weeks and at this price, I&#x27;m buying more to stock up and give to friends and family (great stocking stuffer) with chronic dry, peeling and/or cracked feet!!  As a new Mom I don&#x27;t have as much time as I used to for writing reviews but this pumice stone is worth a few minutes to &amp;#34;write home about&amp;#34; (literally) and of course, spread the word for others like myself who have been on lifelong grail searches for the perfect peeling/cracked foot &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; or Moms who barely have time to take a good daily shower let alone get pedicures so they need look no longer!!!</li>
            <li> i brought this product and have never been so happy, i actually have softer feet. this product is worth every penny, no more hidding my feet. thank you thank you so so very much</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best pumice I&#x27;ve ever used.  Easy to use.  Less scrubbing required.  Very effective.  I truly love this pumice and am completely brand loyal to this now.</li>
            <li> Please read the description carefully. This is NOT pumice. The only thing this is going to scrape off your feet is a pile of purple dust. 100% completely worthless. It is exactly like the foam blocks kids use for crafts. What a joke.</li>
            <li> This is the one you need if you have heavily callused or cracked heels. The smoother pumice bars are only good for minor blemishes. Rub with it for a few minutes after you take a bath.&lt;br /&gt;If you can do this every day it will probably take two or three weeks to completely remove the calluses.</li>
            <li> It works about the same as a regular pumice stone, except leaves little purple granules.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hated how I could never get my feet as smooth as the salon when getting pedicures. Let me say, this is much better than the typical metal ones. I like it. I will definitely buy again. This has been wonderful. I live in flip flops and about every day or every other day I scrub my feet so they don&#x27;t have marks left on my feet from the black flip flops or dirt. Love it! It works well and seems like it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Beings that this item was really rather inexpensive I did not expect it to be the quality it was.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did the merchant ship the item out quickly, they also shipped out a very good quality item.&lt;br /&gt;Its not often that you make an online purchase and can say that you&#x27;re happily surprised about how much better&lt;br /&gt;it was than you thought it would be; this is one item that you will say is even better than you expected.  *Somehow&lt;br /&gt;I accidently entered an earlier review rating that would have indicated only an average product... that was just a clerical error on my behalf.&lt;br /&gt;I assure you, they in fact do deserve a 5 star rating. :)</li>
            <li> it works really well to clean up my heels. it seems to get &amp;quot;used up&amp;quot; after every use, but I dont use it daily, so this will last me a long time. plus it is actually *soft* enough and doesnt hurt after every use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because it does the job quickly and leaves my feet ultra smooth.  This has been a battle since I used pumice stones (real ones) and they just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job I expected.  This is a great price for an effective pumice that does the job.</li>
            <li> This Mr. Pumice bar is excellent, I have used many things to soften up my feet... nothing works as good as this bar!!!</li>
            <li> great for the summer months when you wear sandals all day. I use with avon foot works and it works great</li>
            <li> I am disappointing in amazon reviews for this one because it&#x27;s almost more useless than my shabby ones. I really am trying to make it work but I haven&#x27;t been using it, i bought a glass foot file. I will keep trying to get it to work but I am really disappointed in the grit coming off. smh</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little pumice. It&#x27;s not hard core and doesn&#x27;t take off hard parts, but its a good rough finish for in between polishing. It feels really good to be able to just scuff this up and down your fee at the end of a shower. They do wear down, but 1 bar is lasting at least 2 months now. But they are so good, I want to stock up!</li>
            <li> leaves feet smooth unlike many other pumice stones/scrubbers</li>
            <li> It works very well for my feet and its still working fine, love it.  Love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rough and tough in all areas but I honestly don&#x27;t see it work on my skin or make it any better. :(</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else! This is the best pumice bar I have ever used! It really does the job and so grateful I purchased it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible. It crumbled in my bath tub the first time I used it! I tossed it in the trash. Plus, the texture wasn&#x27;t even CLOSE to that of an actual pumice bar. It felt very similar to the foam you use in basket and wreath making -- you know, that green block stuff that crumbles with the slightest touch? Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> Cheap and gets the job done!  Sure, there are little pieces of purple pumice that come off everywhere, but so are your feet shavings, so who cares?  I like it, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> very soft. worn out by dozen use. It&#x27;s made of what seems like weak purple styrafoam. it&#x27;s not a natural stone.</li>
            <li> This pumice bar last a long time and my feet look great.  This is the best one I found yet.  This is my second order.</li>
            <li> This item gets my feet soft after using it. I soak and then use the pumice bar. It does leave purcple little crystals after using it, but it washes off just as easy with water. This bar doesnt even look like its been used, so I&#x27;m sure it will last! This item was not expensive, and the fact that it had Free shipping was even better.</li>
            <li> i always but these from the nail shop or at a local sally&#x27;s. the are no more than like 3 or 4 bucks. on here it much cheaper. thank goodness. i love i use there for my feet and it really gets it smooth. i have hyperkeratosis im not suppose to scrub my feet or hand but i cant help it. this and my tweezer man callous remover, get my feet so soft love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all and it flakes off on you while you are trying to use it.</li>
            <li> The pumice bar came on time which was great but it just wasn&#x27;t the quality I was expecting. I&#x27;ve bought many pumice bars and this one just didn&#x27;t do it for me, I was not impressed. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> These work good, but don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  I don&#x27;t know how I survived without it.  For years I&#x27;ve been looking for something that could scrub off the excess skin on the bottom.  This works!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is alright! It does the job but there is something about it that I&#x27;m not liking.I probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> First Pumice stone that does nothing, doesn&#x27;t even take off dead skin, was disappointed in it. I would not buy again</li>
            <li> I would not buy it again, despite that it does what it says, i need to buy the kind that they use at the nail place. they are coarser and more heavy duty. i guess i have more callouses??</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, I don&#x27;t like the purple stuff that comes off when I use it.  All in all though not bad!</li>
            <li> Really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I like them. i bought several. I like them. my feet aren&#x27;t too bad as I get regular pedicures. but i use them in between. does what it claims.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This item came defective. Part of the bar is abraded, like broken, wanted to return it but decided not to, not worth the time. Won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Last a super long time and don&#x27;t get nasty.  Of course the pumice works great on rough heels. Use them when your heels are really wet (after 10 minutes) and this little bar will get the dry skin off.</li>
            <li> This product does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. But there&#x27;s one problem; dust.&lt;br /&gt;You wind up with a lot of purple dust. It does work quite well; but don&#x27;t forget&lt;br /&gt;to use a towel to catch all the pumice dust.</li>
            <li> I love getting my feet pampered and my salon always uses these butthey cost around six or seven dollars here. This was half that and now I can pamper my piggies at home.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  When I found this online, I recognized it right away as what they were using at my local salon.  It feels a bit scratchy and is very light.  It does a nice job for in between pedi&#x27;s.  The product does wear away a bit with use.</li>
            <li> after 1 use it started working on my feet! I wear flip flops literally year round so my feet are scratchy and harsh and callused. pretty gross to say the least! But I use this in the shower with just bar soap and my feet are fabulous!</li>
            <li> should of done more research on it before I purchased this. it falls apart when you touch it. had to through it away cause its messy</li>
            <li> MY feet are so soft now. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before and it was so easy. Just get it wet, rub soap on your feet, and scrub lightly. Removed dead skin that was a result of poor shoe support. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for months, they last a long time.  So easy to use and more effective than a pumice stone.  I like it so much I&#x27;m giving one to my Mom.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of pumice stones and such for my cracked heels. I tried this along with O&#x27;Keefe Helping Hands and in just one week, what a difference! Thank you Mr. Pumice.</li>
            <li> Got my feet looking right. All time fav brand of pumice.</li>
            <li> This is okay if you don&#x27;t live in an area where you walk lots. However, if you live in a city where you live a lot of walking steer clear and find something a little bit more powerful...</li>
            <li> This is a good pumice bar, but i&#x27;ve tried dollar store ones that were better. When you use it, it shed small purple granules from the bar.</li>
            <li> Prob won&#x27;t order this again. Crumbly, messy. Other products work better and last longer.</li>
            <li> Works great! Super lightweight. Very coarse but not painful in the least. To anyone reading reviews saying this crumbles/disintegrates - not true. This is a manmade substance which you are repeatedly rubbing against your tough, hardened skin, so yes; tiny particles fall off. But I&#x27;m talking minuscule. Unnoticeable on the bar. Have used this 5 times on both feet (takes less than a minute for each foot!) and it still looks new. I used mine wet with a little body wash, rinsed the bar thoroughly after using, and let air dry. The price is great for a product that gets you sandal-ready in no time. Also shipping was extremely fast. Highly recommended! Also, remember to moisturize your feet each time after using this, always while they are still damp. This is only effective after removing the impenetrable layer of dead skin. After a while your feel will retain moisture better and you won&#x27;t even need the bar anymore!</li>
            <li> I well never buy this again, Don&#x27;t waste your money, Go buy something better. It didnt even do any for my feet.</li>
            <li> use all the time! stays in my shower.</li>
            <li> I use this for my heels and it makes them really soft. I also use a pumice stone and coconut oil. This is a great combination for dry and cracked heels!</li>
            <li> I love these bars; they truly do what they are supposed to...removes dead skin, softens callouses, helps rid of cracked heels, and cleans feet.</li>
            <li> I love the pumice bar.  It removed all the dead skin and made my feet so smooth and I do not even have to soak my feet; I only used it after a warm shower.  Bye Bye to Salon Pedicure DIY henceforth. I wish I got more than the 2 pieces I ordered.  I will definitely recommend this Pumice bar to everyone.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this product awhile back; I&#x27;d been using a metal \\&quot;file\\&quot; for my feet and often I&#x27;d slip &amp; end up with scraped and bloody heels.  Ew.  But Mr. Pumice works like a charm!  It does dent in a bit with use, but it really keeps my feet soft.  No more metal files for me.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> For those days when you just can&#x27;t get to the salon but want a good foot scrub, this is it. Its just like the ones used at the salon but you can do it yourself at home. My feet are so soft and smooth its amazing. I usually use a hard pumice stone but I have found this is easier to hold onto and maneuver in the shower.</li>
            <li> Buy a pumice stone instead. This was wasteful.</li>
            <li> I have went to the nail salon recently and they used a mr.pumice bar and it made my feet so smooth, so I brought one</li>
            <li> Cracked heels no more! A little rub with this with some soap and I&#x27;m good to go. Only needed maybe once a week for me and seems like it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews on this Pumice stone has me doubting all other reviews I have ever read on Amazon.  This stone is a ZERO.... Seriously  it falls apart when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;  I went to their website to see if I could find what this is made of but could not find anything there.&lt;br /&gt;  Pumice is defined as a very light and porous volcanic rock formed when a gas-rich froth of glassy lava solidifies rapidly.&lt;br /&gt; I do not believe Mr Pumice Pumi Bar has any natural materials, especially volcanic rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Bar is not made well, is not a good purchase and is nothing like the Real pumice stones you can get anywhere else.</li>
            <li> it just crumbled. didn&#x27;t get dead skin off my feet at all</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work great. Seems really cheap</li>
            <li> Surprisingly great at removing years of dead skin from my male, abused feet.  I soaked my feet for about 45 minutes in warm water with a little white vinegar before.  A little Bag Balm after.</li>
            <li> This bar is just like the ones that they use in the nail salons, it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a old fashioned Pumice Stone in the stores and have only found short rounded smooth ones or the metal graters.&lt;br /&gt;When I found this I thought it was man made stone or Pumice. But no this is made of plastic just like Floral foam with tighter bubbles and maybe some abrasives in it.It falls apart fast and get gritty stuff all over.If you hit a toe nail it dents it. This is of no use to me. It&#x27;s going in the trash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Pumice But Stiff Floral foam, Messy, Garbage, Very Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very good product. I wear work boots and this made a big difference in the calluses and roughness. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Poor quality pumice bar it does do its job but disintegrates as you use it whether its wet or dry will not repurchase im going back to my real stone.</li>
            <li> I dont tend to rate products unless I really loved them. Honestly this is THE best pumice stone I&#x27;ve ever used!! It is very worth the money. My feet were smooth after the first use.</li>
            <li> Solid and seems to work well if used condistently.  Holds up well in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommed.  Good value.</li>
            <li> My sister had an extra one for me to use and I absolutely loved it...I even ordered extra to have when I travel..this is a must for smooth feet..</li>
            <li> I really wish I would have taken before and after photos. Just one use with the pumi bar, and my feet were drastically smoother. In my opinion, it&#x27;s even better than what most pedicure salons use. The bar does &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; little purple pieces, but they just wash right down the drain. I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple weeks now, and it still hasn&#x27;t worn down very much, so I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviews are talking about. I definitely wish I would have purchased more than one at a time though because I want to always have one in my shower. Seriously so great!</li>
            <li> THIS is the BEST Pumice bar- other than the ones at nail salons- i honestly think its the same one they use! So i used this on my feet with the O&#x27;Keef&#x27;s Healthy foot cream and it made my heels/feet WOW! i have never felt so confident with showing my feet and wearing sandals. You will NOT be disappointed</li>
            <li> So far it has been working like a charm and I have almost no complaints. Only thing is since this is a sponge and not a stone you might find the purple sh-tuff tends to get all over the bathtub as you continue to use the product. Nothing major, easy to clean but a nuisance nonetheless. I&#x27;d recommend it for someone looking to save some cash but still wants a great product!</li>
            <li> This Pumice stone I found to be more of a hard Styrofoam product than a stone.  It falls apart when scrubbing the feet and leaves a purple residue on the feet as well.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be an actual pumice stone, so I was initially disappointed when I received it; it was a sort of really hard foam structure. However, the bar worked amazingly and rinsed off well for periodic use. I also found out that this sort of material is also used by professional pedicurist. All-in-all it is great and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is not what I would call a pumice stone.  Instead, it is more like a hard styrofoam. Because of this, it makes a huge mess when you use it.  Be prepared for there to be a coarse purple dust all over the place and your feet after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it does do a decent job at removing dead, dry skin.  My feet aren&#x27;t that bad, but whenever it is \\&quot;flip flop\\&quot; season, they get pretty dry.  This pumice bar manages to get most of the dry skin off, resulting in smooth feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, to reduce the mess, I&#x27;ll use it in the shower with the water running.  It doesn&#x27;t do as effective of a job when doing this, but still works (and, you can&#x27;t beat the price!).</li>
            <li> takes all of the calluses off just go easy and don&#x27;t rub too hard,do a little at a time than a few times a week and it helps between pedicures</li>
            <li> Just like the salon stones</li>
            <li> This is working well on my feet. One of my heels had a really deep crack that I&#x27;ve been working on for several weeks so it doesn&#x27;t get sore. The reason for only 4 stars is I don&#x27;t want people to get the idea that you can scrub off a deep crack in one session as other reviewers have suggested.</li>
            <li> This thing crumbles into gross silicone powder when I touch it. I think if I rubbed it on my feet I&#x27;d turn into a purple monster.</li>
            <li> If one doesn&#x27;t mind creating a dust-storm of crumbling styrofoam, which may even impart toxins to the skin, Mr Pumice works like Billy-O. But, I find that it is much too messy and worrisome. My husband had bought it for me, together with a foot-rasp according to the recommendations and reviews here at Amazon. I used it, and after I told him about the resultant mess and what Mr Pumice was really made of, my generous husband said it had not cost much and that I ought to just chuck the thing. Done!</li>
            <li> Wish the bar was bigger, but a good value. Plus, since it&#x27;s purple, you can see how it&#x27;s working. Not bad.</li>
            <li> Works Great!!! My feet were very bad and rough and I used one time and it was awesome!!</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this, it works as it should. Gentle but firm and does the job. would recommend</li>
            <li> At first glance you would think this is not going to work. But, I tried it and now I can&#x27;t live without one of these in my shower. I misplaced my first one and didn&#x27;t go a week before I purchased another one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot a problem with my feet, hands or anything.  But this is the perfect product for my skin to KEEP it soft when I get pedicures.  My husband does my pedicures and sometimes I do them on my own but we both liked the product. It&#x27;s not too coarse where my feet get that burning feeling but it&#x27;s just right for that soft, clean, spa feeling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Mr. Pumice Pumi Bar!!! This little, purple tool works wonders and is a great thing to have in the summertime! It saves you from getting so many pedicures! Lol</li>
            <li> Love this product it works so well. Don&#x27;t have to put a lot muscle in it to do the job.</li>
            <li> I had alot of trouble with my feet getting rough. I have tried all sorts of lotions and soaks but by far this has worked the best. Fast shipping to. Great product for the price. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of how great this seemed to work when I read some of the reviews -- but this pumice bar really is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used!  After using it just twice over the course of a week, it helped remove the rough, pointed callouses that I get on the edges of my toes, in a very gentle way.  It didn&#x27;t scrape up my skin or leave any abrasions, but rather left my feet feeling soft.  When I pointed out to my husband how soft my feet felt, he also noticed the difference right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using this, I&#x27;ve also been using [[ASIN:B0002QB9NE O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme 3.2oz Jar]] at night before I go to sleep.  The combo of the two has been really effective, but the key player is definitely this pumice stone.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you have callouses and rough spots that you want to get rid of quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just like the ones used for pedicures. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much I like it, but I sort of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point #1 - If you are reading this review, and have no idea what Mr. Pumice is (like I did), then my basic description is that it&#x27;s some sort of foam made up of tiny hard particles that slowly come off as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. that being said, now you sort of know what this thing is.  Now the big question, does it work??  I personally have never used a REAL pumice stone, so I can&#x27;t really compare the two, but this thing sort of seems to work.  It isn&#x27;t magic, and my callouses/dead skin isn&#x27;t totally gone yet, but I do notice some improvement every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, don&#x27;t expect this to be like Mr. Clean&#x27;s Magic Eraser, becasue it certainly isn&#x27;t magic, but it does seem to slowly work...</li>
            <li> This pumice beats any I have used in the past. I originally purchased this on a whim....it really works in getting rid of the rough spots on the feet. It also dries out quickly so it doesn&#x27;t mildew like others I have used in the past. And the price is right! It lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Does not crack, have been using it for a month or so and looks like new. Not too rough, not too soft. I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> did not care for this, it kind of comes apart when you&#x27;re using it ? more than i expected. little sandy purple things on your floor</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove palm calluses from weightlifting.  This pumice bar would fall apart when used and did nothing to remove calluses.  I tossed it.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness!!  Finally!!&lt;br /&gt;Let me start of by saying I have some ROUGH feet.  I inherited my moms heels, unfortunately.  My heels are extremely dry and they crack frequently.  They look horrendous more often than not.  I have tried every lotion, potion, and tool out there to try and save my poor feet.  I get frequent pedicures and get the acid/callus remover combo.  Even that doesn&#x27;t help much.  Finally, my sister mentioned that I should try Mr. Pumice.  I got one, hopped in the shower, and hoped for the best.  Much to my surprise, it WORKS!  This little bar is amazing!  You use it the same way you would use a regular pumice bar.  This is SO much more effective though.  I could feel/see the yucky dead skin coming off my feet.  It requires little effort and is quick to do as well (less than a minute for both feet).  And, bonus, this doesn&#x27;t hurt!  I&#x27;ve used several other things that do.  I got out of the shower, applied some cream to my heels, and noticed a HUGE difference after just the first use.  After a few uses, my feet are almost healed.  Little purple granules come off the bar as you use it, so I&#x27;m sure the bar wears down in time.  However, I&#x27;ve used it four times already and have noticed almost no wear.  Plus, it&#x27;s so cheap you can afford to replace it frequently if necessary.  I can&#x27;t believe that I have found something to make my feet normal!  I will continue buying this product again and again.  I would highly recommend, especially to those people out there that think their feet can&#x27;t be saved.  :-)</li>
            <li> My feet have callus and in shower I just scrub my feet, feet feel smoother. Yeah!!!!!  It feels better than the earth stones that you can buy the stores.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended Mr. Pumice to me a few weeks ago and I immediately got online to order the extra-coarse pumi bar. I am very pleased with the product and the seller shipped it to me quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> Never found anything that works this good on my heels. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing ever works...until now. Used it twice and heels are smooth again.</li>
            <li> This is a great pumice product, I would highly recommend it to anyone that get&#x27;s callouses on their feet.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  Keeps my tootsies in top condition!</li>
            <li> i love it its the best thing for your feet you have to put soap on the pumice bar it help to work better. the first time i saw it was at the salon and then i look it up at amazon and boy did i buy a whole punch of them and gave away to my daughters and friends.</li>
            <li> Awesome, it does what it suppose to do!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like 300 grit sand paper. I need to rip dead skin away faster. Good for women. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> the only thing i had a problem with is that it was 3 days late! the bar in geneeral was great</li>
            <li> Works wonders on your feet!</li>
            <li> The Mr. Pumice does an excellent job in removing any dead skin. There is no need to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love this pumice bar!  I use it every time I take a shower and it works great.  It does start to deteriorate after a while but I&#x27;ve been using the same one for about 3 months and I would guess that it has over half its life left.</li>
            <li> Instead of smoothing out my feet, my feet smoothed out the pumice. It&#x27;s about the weight of a regular sponge and started falling apart as soon as I started to use it. I scraped it across my foot and immediately the ridges on the pumice started becoming flat. This did absolutely nothing and I had to toss it.</li>
            <li> This product was good, but not great.  It lasted a good while, but eventually I tried a different product...which has been far better in quality and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Recently bought this pumice stone to try, as the one I had used previously nearly doubled in price.  Wow am I glad I tried this one!  It works wonders!  perfect balance between strong enough to get my worst spots on my feet and still stays together, yet soft enough to not be irritating.  Love it!  Seems like it&#x27;s going to last quite awhile! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i soak my feet for 10-15 mins. scrub away with the pumice bar &amp; my feet are flawless.  amazing little product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a real pumice stone, but I think it works better than one. The product smoothed out the cracked, thick skin on my feet after just one or two sessions -- a feat that no previous pumice stone was able to do.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mr. Pumice Extra Coarse along with Compound W in order to remove a planters wart on the bottom of my right foot. I&#x27;ve been using the pumice with a single drop of Compound W after every shower and after less than 3 weeks it appears the wart has been removed successively. This is a quality product and a must for those suffering similar symptoms.</li>
            <li> My calloused heals have never looked better.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars I would. This is honestly the lowest quality pumice stone I have ever purchased. The bar is incredibly &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; and fell apart the second I began using it. Save yourself the trouble and DO NOT purchase this product</li>
            <li> amazing product! makes my skin very smooth, best to use right after a shower, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works so well.  No more rough feet.</li>
            <li> When I had only used it for a couple of days my calluses on my heels were almost gone.  In a few days they were completely gone.  I love it.  It fits in your hand very good also.  It will last a long time.  I would recommed it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is just like the ones they use at the nail salons.  I use it in the shower and it seems to work really well.  I like it and would order it again, though I believe this one will last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  Not falling apart, like some do.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a quality foot pumice.</li>
            <li> I live on a farm, so I use this thing daily!  it&#x27;s awesome and there isn&#x27;t another one quite as good as this one - I&#x27;ve tried many, but I&#x27;m sticking with this one &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Really does the job removing heel calluses; best used with a less abrasive bar for final cut.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the way it works, it isn&#x27;t as pruductive as a real pumice stone. Very hard to clean out.</li>
            <li> I suppose this soft pumice stone would do well on fingertips or other places where the skin is not so hard, but for the heavy callouses on the heels of my feet , it is useless. It made not the slightest dent in the callouse and shed profusely.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a pumice stone for heavy, hard callouses, go to your local hardware store, and in their cleaning section, they should have pumice stones.  These stones are made for cleaning stains off toilets, porcelain sinks, etc. and works very well on my feet. It will last for months and does not shed.</li>
            <li> Effective and Easy to Use</li>
            <li> I bought this because it kinda looked like the same kind they use when you get a pedicure. But I really didn&#x27;t like the grainy, oily residue this left on my hands after using it. It just felt like the pumice was falling apart and possibly wouldn&#x27;t last long. It did feel like there was lotion or some other softening agent in it which was cool but I still prefer my old school pumice. Maybe that grainy falling apart problem isn&#x27;t as bad after a few uses but I wouldn&#x27;t know because I ended up just throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews on this product. Some were good and some were bad. But I figured, for under $3.00, what do I have to lose if the product is bad? I used it and LOVE IT!!! After only 2 uses, my feet were silky smooth!! Please use this with wet feet and wet the puma bar. I also put a little liquid soap on it with each use!! I will definately buy another!!</li>
            <li> This product breaks too easily and wears out after several uses. A good portion of it falls off every time you use it.</li>
            <li> This worked so well. My heels used to be rough and cracked and it was uncomfortable. My feet would rub together at night and the skin would like snag on my blankets and socks. This helped a lot, as well as the o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s healthy feet creme. There is some purple stuff that comes off but it isn&#x27;t as big a deal as some of the other reviews makes it seem. It&#x27;s like little specks that come off, doesn&#x27;t impact the effectiveness of this product at all. After one use my feet were smooth. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> does what it is suppose to ,but doesn&#x27;t last to long.</li>
            <li> when i unwrapped it, it looked kinda like cheap Styrofoam, but it worked great. Use it with ProLin callus eliminator solution and it scrubs all the nasty hard skin off the bottom of ur feel. Rinse it off and use it again later. Not bad!!!</li>
            <li> This is a product I am going to buy for the rest of my life.  I have always used the harder pumice bars for pedicures, but they are uncomfortable to use.  Not exactly painful, but I didn&#x27;t enjoy using them at all.  This pumice bar is softer, I absolutely love it.  I use it every day in the shower and my feet have never looked better. I normally have a lot of dry skin on my heels and this takes care of it beautifully.  I very strongly recommend Mr. Pumice.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say I have never seen an average person with as much callused and dry feet as my own. Not kidding when I say,  3 times using this little scrubb&#x27;y in the shower with applying AmLactin after has transformed my feet.  I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten this like 15 years ago!  Some reviews complain about it coming a part/flaking, but I didn&#x27;t think it was that big of a deal,  some little-tiny crumbs, but nothing really to speak of.  SO THRILLED with this product, and will definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a pumice bar before so I have no point of reference, but I will definitely be ordering this one again when I use it up someday. It&#x27;s easy to use and it really smoothed out my feet (and to be frank they were in rough shape). I&#x27;ve used it twice and my feet went from awful to decent and I wouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed to go sockless.</li>
            <li> I use everyday. Best pumice stone out there hands down!!! Makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> This is best pumice bar that I have found. Other pumice bars have hurt my feet but this one was comfortable yet effective.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, flakes off bits of purple everywhere, can&#x27;t stand up against my calluses. this is not what they use when you get a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite budget luxuries!  I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but Mr. Pumice is the only one for me.  I love these little things.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and very gentle. remember to use it only on the Exfoliating scrub or it will hurt.</li>
            <li> So let me tell you that when I say my feet were rough I mean when I was sleeping not even my blankets liked to cuddle with me.&lt;br /&gt;Yessss when I moved in the bed at night I would feel the blanket rubbing and snagging on my coarse and rough feet...akin to a rock they felt like. I was set to get married and I knew cuddling was gonna be a no with those rocks so I looked online for ideas I tried foot soak but me being me I was never able to complete a 2 week routine of soaking my feet daily. So I looked elsewhere. When I found this i read the review and while most people say it worked really good for their cracked feet let me tell you I never have cracked feet just extremely rough and this lovely little bar worked like a charm. You don&#x27;t have to do it everyday actually I woundnt recommend it to be done everyday maybe every other day at the most. But after the first time it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Pair this wig nighttime routine of putting Vaseline on your feet followed by thick socks and sleep in it and your feet will be soft soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deff would recommend for anyone</li>
            <li> Love this thing!! Finally a pumice bar that doesn&#x27;t crumble to pieces. I keep this in the shower and use it every other night. Now I don&#x27;t have to wait for when I get my pedi. My feet are always on point!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT... Only gave four stars because im not sure if will continue to work.... Will update Soon!!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot! but i hate the engravings. dead skin get in there and its hard to clean. but I will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> I like the stone much better. This product just doesnt seem to cut it unless your feet are already super soft with the start of rough patches.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very rough heels and with only using it twice I have seen a major difference. I&#x27;m still working on repairing them with lotions and stuff, but using this bar wet has made a major difference in the way my feet look and feel.</li>
            <li> i have tried many of the expensive callus removers and nothing works like this one does. It actually removes the callus, and for the cost, you cant go wrong!! I have tried the pedi egg, the pedi spin, the den something handheld scraper thing, all worked good for a while but nothing compares to MR pumice. i give it two thumbs up. Well worth the cost compared to many many other wasted dollars i have spent!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get my feet really clean without these.  I load them up with liquid soap every shower, and scrub away the dirt, dead skin, etc on the bottom of my feet.  Nothing else works as well.</li>
            <li> Love these!  There is a little bit of grit that comes off of the stone when you use it, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found to keep my feet soft!</li>
            <li> This thing is the best I love it I first scene it at Sally&#x27;s .They even use it at the nail salon</li>
            <li> i do like this but one down side is that unless you properly dry it, the water that gets stuck between the crevice will smell. but it does work and has not broken yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a week and my feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> Worked great.  cheap little bar. Will last probably 30-40 uses.  Some people complained that it was too short. But its not something to use every day.</li>
            <li> Great item, I have dry heels and this worked wonders and smoothed out my heels, prompt delivery and great product, would recommend it</li>
            <li> I wanted to get my feet soft and not have to pay those values removals at the shop. Works great but not for every bath,shower , because it is the course one.</li>
            <li> Perfect for at-home pedicures, at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> thought i would give this pumice a try after all the other ones i have tried and have no success with. i love this little pumice bar. it is by far the best i have tried yet and think i have finally ended my search. easy to hold and does the job. my feet haven&#x27;t been more happier.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who just wanted to smooth out his feet. Not really sure what to do with this, but I am sure it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Saw one in my aunts shower in Maui.  This is the BEST devise for scrubbing your feet, getting tar (from sand) off and and reducing calluses.  I ordered my own and use it every other day in the shower</li>
            <li> This product truly works to get rid of all the dead skin on your feet. It is amazing how effective it is. I was blown away by the results, as my feet are now baby soft and flawless.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.... I got a micro plane and it works much better.</li>
            <li> This works awesome. I love the size and shape . I will def. purchase another once I wear this one out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pumice stone. I lost my last Mr. Pumice bar and for months I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would clean my feet as well as this could. I finally bought another one and my feet are no longer calloused, instead they are soft, smooth, and super clean. Such a great product at such a great price! Be sure to use soap with it for maximum effectiveness.</li>
            <li> my heels always get soo dry and cracked in the wintertime. But using mr pumice bar then applying a thick foot cream with a chemical exfoliant such as amlactin and wearing socks to bed makes them super soft</li>
            <li> I have used this pumice bar before. It works very well. It is rough but not too rough. It seems as though it will last awhile which is also good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works really well with just soap and water. It also works really well on your hands as well. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Works so much better than the one I bought at Target which I threw away.</li>
            <li> Gets the Job Done! not too rough but not too soft either. Pretty color and only sheds the little purple fibers a little. Works best in the shower i noticed.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting a different one used in nail salons. Not as pictured.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the typical gray pumice stones. In my opinion, they don&#x27;t work.  The Mr. Pumice stones are amazing!  I have used them for several years now. They are made of some type of synthetic material that actually scrapes away the dead skin and calluses on the bottom of your feet. These bars are very hard. I keep one in the shower, and about three times per week I put a little soap or shampoo on it, and scrub my heels.  It keeps the bottom of my feet soft without ever having to do anything else to them. As you scrub, sand-like pieces of the bar come off as it wears down. I think this is why they work so well compared to a typical pumice stone that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; at all. After a while, the bar will wear down in the center, and I just flip it and begin using the other side. Eventually it gets very this in the center and needs to be replaced. However, each one lasts for months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work as described</li>
            <li> This is perfect to have at the side of the tub/shower!  Easy to use and keeps your feet perfectly smooth in between pedicures!  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Years ago, a friend gave me 1/2 of her purple pumice and FINALLY, I found it HERE! It comes in fine, medium and coarse. I can promise you it&#x27;s the best and most efficient you will ever find. I ordered a coarse one for a serious problem. It was cleared up in two showers. Now, I have to be really gentle with it.</li>
            <li> I bought one a few years back from bb&amp;b, and it was the best pumice ever, except it was smaller and blue.&lt;br /&gt;This one is better by far, and does the job perfectly. Oh just a tip: open the package over a trash.</li>
            <li> Thought will be the same pumise I have still but in small already.&lt;br /&gt;This one I bought is falling in little pieces like sand.  Its a mess.&lt;br /&gt;Dont think will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I saw great reviews on this product when I first bought it a couple years ago. I&#x27;ve used it regularly since then and just bought more of them. It lasts for a long time (2 years on my last one), works really well and is a pretty purple color. I find it works best when I wet it, then put liquid soap on it, then use it.</li>
            <li> I love these and they work so much better than the ped-eggs. The price is great also!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as solid or hard as I&#x27;m used to. It seems like it&#x27;ll wear down pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Great pumus block. It really sloughs away the dry heels on the soles of the feet, yet  is gentle on the skin. The size of it is great for the pedicurist, it&#x27;s a bit bigger than most and therefore easy for her/ him to grip and work with.</li>
            <li> Better than any other pumice you look for. FACT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for ever ten years. I was recommended Mr. Pumice by a cosmetology student. She used it on her elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product after soaking my feet in water, applying a liquid callus remover and using Tweezerman&#x27;s callus shaver (found on Amazon). Mr. Pumice is great at smoothing rough skin making it smooth. After using Mr. Pumice I apply a thick cream on my feet then apply socks.</li>
            <li> It has helped my feet to stay super smooth and without the hurt that I found most with other pumice bars. The price is not bad on here as I compared it to the price it is sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty.</li>
            <li> Makes funky feet feel better. using this product is super easy</li>
            <li> Ahh, this is made out of what seems like styrofoam.  Not good.  It also sheds when you use it, little flecks of purple all over the place... that then wash down the drain.  Feels like pollution I can&#x27;t quite justify when it works - but not any better than an actual pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I like it, but personally I need a more coarse pumice then this for my feet.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the item purchased. It satisfactorily accomplishes the desired purpose of the reason that it was purchased in the first place.</li>
            <li> Works okay but is to expensive</li>
            <li> Both sides, wether coarse or fine, are very coarse. The fine side is very coarse while the coarse side is crazy coarse. This makes fast work of getting rid of dead/rough skin especially on the feet. But it can also leaves your skin in a very rough state afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend going over the skin with a finer grit stone pumice to buff the skin surface smooth after using this to remove all the dead skin quickly. I say this because although your skin might feel baby soft and smooth right after you use this, once it has time to dry and harden again(like in 3-4 days) your skin will be rougher than before if you don&#x27;t do this extra step. Your skin will feel like sand paper, snag delicate fabrics, or scare your significant other when you brush up against them. Also, if you don&#x27;t smooth out your skin after using this with a finer grit instrument, and you let your roughed up skin dry and harden, you will be proned to painful cracking and peeling which will likely be worse than what you started with. Also be careful when handling. Your hands can get rough from using this. I buffed my fingertips with the same fine grit stone pumice afterwards as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be alarmed that this pumice sheds. There are a lot of pumice products that do this. You just have to replace when you&#x27;ve worn it down.</li>
            <li> This bar helped my heels but it wears away quickly and flakes. It is cheap and light and suited my needs but if you want one that lasts a while this may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> Wear gloves. It tears up my hands and fingertips. Works amazing though. I&#x27;ve used for years. I live in Arizona. Dry heat and always flip flop season</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I use this product for all of my Do It Yourself beauty and body care needs and it works like a charm! So far no issues!</li>
            <li> this is not made for human skin ,it is so harsh and rough which cause skin rash even if you use this very gently . and the worst thing if i want to return this ,this seller denied to take return back.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off scrubbing my skin with broken glass; all this did was cut my skin</li>
            <li> My favorite pumice bar for years. Effective and easy to use. Yes it can wear down quickly because it is a little soft, but this is not a problem for me. Mine lasts for months at which point I would want to replace it anyway (ew). Price on Amazon is twice what I pay at my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to smooth out my feet, which are generally dry, cracked and scary.  I was using a hard grey pumice stone, it seemed to work okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I&#x27;m a guy, and this whole pumice thing is weird to me, but it makes my girl happy, good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;*Really light and fluffy, compared to my old one, like a volcanic rock.&lt;br /&gt;*Really rough, surprised at how much grit there is to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;*Works way better! Which may be an under statment, the rough grit texture really gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t have to push or rub very hard to see and feel results.&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;*The little purple grits fall off and get everywhere.  It looked like a Mr Pumice massacre in the shower for the first use, I just washed the little grits down the drain.  Less and less seem to rub off the more I use it and I haven&#x27;t seen any mass loss from the pumice stone.</li>
            <li> came on time works ok</li>
            <li> love it, works well.  I use it in the shower, my heel feels a lot smoother now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the best job.</li>
            <li> this has to be the worst &amp;#34;pumice&amp;#34; ever. its not really pumice. its something else. this crumbles when being used. its sharp. it left my elbow skinned and raw. i had to bandage it for several days with neosporin after using this. i just wanted to smooth out an elbow that i lean on while working that gets rough. i had a pumice stone that i used for pedicures but wanted to try something that seems popular. i hate it.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion. Only complaint is that it flakes off when you use it or even when gently handling it. Other than that its alright and works fairly well.</li>
            <li> thisa thing crumbles a lot but does smooth feet to an extent.  I prefer stone over this because of all the waste that falls off.</li>
            <li> Used it 2 times immediately after I got it, after that about once a month. Removes the dead cracking skin but leaves the rest, did not give my a rash or any abrasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Great for use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try on other parts of the body with thinner/sensitive skin, like elbows, only use on tough calloused skin, like the heel.</li>
            <li> My pedicure shop use to have really coarse synthetic pumice and for some reason stopped carrying them. I could not find anything that worked as well and I have tried them all.  I took a chance and order two of the Mr. Pumice and it works as good.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I could not believe how well it works.  Other than going to get pampered, this product leaves very little reason to go have a pedicure done.  This $3.00 will save you $30.00!!</li>
