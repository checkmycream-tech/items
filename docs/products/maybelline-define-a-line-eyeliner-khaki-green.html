            <li>I used this eyeliner a year or two ago and it worked great for me!</li>
            <li>Natural-looking, but gives my eyes that perfect oomph of beauty boost.</li>
            <li>Excellent price.</li>
            <li>beautiful effect!!!</li>

            <li>The color is great.</li>
            <li>Packaging is absolutely great.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s the best eyeliner in this color that I have tried, and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Good service---great product.  </li>
            <li>Glides on fairly well and leaves a descent line.  </li>
            <li>Good primer line for a heavier gel liner, etc.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>It HAD to have been a good seller because this color was always sold out even when it was still on the market.</li>
            <li>:) Happy i bought it.</li>
            <li>Love this color and great product</li>
            <li>I am happy to be able to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more colors!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this on Amazon !&lt;</li>
            <li>The Rimmel London one is much better!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and looks great.  </li>
            <li>I really liked, so I bought another one.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>I guess it is widely popular.</li>
            <li>My original was a lighter, brighter shade but not too bright.</li>
            <li>Goes on so smoothly!  </li>
            <li>Love this pencil.  </li>
            <li>No matter what the price, I expect better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying two more of these, just to be safe.</li>
            <li>And so cheap!</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the colour</li>
            <li>Years ago I found out that the smear end was perfect for accentuating dimples, wrinkles, shading around the eyes and such</li>
            <li>able find these.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite type of eyeliner...</li>
            <li>Its super smooth and a perfect khaki color, I have brown eyes with hints on green, so it compliments perfectly, but I also believe this is a very flattering shade on anyone.</li>
            <li>I own a khaki pencil in the right shade, but it pulls and tugs at my eyelids.</li>
            <li>I have recently ordered an auburn eyebrow pencil and I&#x27;m sure I will be just as happy with that product as I am with the eyeliner..</li>
            <li>This one glides on, but it doesn&#x27;t provide a fine line.</li>
            <li>Maybelline khaki green eye liner is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Many stores won&#x27;t stock eye makeup for redheads because there isn&#x27;t as much demand for them as there is for brunettes and blondes.</li>
            <li>This does not seem to be the same Maybeline Define-A-Line Eyeliner that I&#x27;ve purchased so many times before.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Love the smudge tool on the other end to create a smoky effect.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the exact same color as my original, apparently Maybelline changed it.</li>
            <li>Beware, something is off with this particular eye liner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking this was so reasonable because it was a very old eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love the khaki color, just a little shimmer, and I do not have to sharpen it, it rolls up like a lipstick.</li>
            <li>Kind of mushy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li>Similar to other Maybelline Eyeliner but in my favorite shade.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, but not bad either.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, but you cannot apply it heavily even if you try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle and doesn&#x27;t show up as much as I&#x27;d hoped, but it is a pretty color and nice for the days when you want to go subtle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is slightly darker than the original I bought even though it is the same color name, brand and number.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe this was a fluke or something, so I bought another new pack, but again, the same thing happened.</li>
            <li>The color is really a near black color, no where near the color you see on the packaging.  </li>

            <li> I have other colors of this eyeliner but this one was not nearly as smooth gliding or intense.  </li>
            <li> Sad, because I am a HUGE FAN of Maybelline cosmetics, and purchase them quite often.</li>
            <li> The texture was dry, did not glide on, even a bit crumbly as I used it.</li>
            <li> I have hazel eyes, and the right shade of green seems to be hard to come by, judging from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> This color is the only variation among all the other dark colors offered by Mabelline that all look alike when applied.  </li>
            <li> Darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have hazel eyes, and I never want to wear any other color eyeliner ever again.</li>
            <li> Perhaps stale, left at the back of a row in a mega-discount store.</li>
            <li> but it is a wee bit less creamy than the other define-a-line eyeliners I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> Just brings out the eyes a little w/o looking like you&#x27;re wearing eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Your average twist-up eyeliner, but the Color!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear &amp; is just the green color that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I like it BECAUSE of the color which is khaki green, and that to my knowledge, has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> The first one -- so bad</li>
            <li> This color is hard to find and I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> This was extremely disappointing as it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Some Maybelline product colors are difficult to find at stores, but Amazon has them in stock!  </li>
            <li> Terribly deceiving.</li>

            <li> Goes on so smoothly!  I&#x27;m ordering more colors!</li>
            <li> Darker than I expected. I have hazel eyes, and the right shade of green seems to be hard to come by, judging from other reviewers. I own a khaki pencil in the right shade, but it pulls and tugs at my eyelids. This one glides on, but it doesn&#x27;t provide a fine line. It&#x27;s still a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well for hazel eyes. Seems are to find and great that Amazon has it. Similar to other Maybelline Eyeliner but in my favorite shade.</li>
            <li> The color is really a near black color, no where near the color you see on the packaging.  Terribly deceiving.</li>
            <li> too glossy...terrible</li>
            <li> So glad I found this on Amazon !&lt;br /&gt;This is slightly darker than the original I bought even though it is the same color name, brand and number. I really wanted the exact same color as my original, apparently Maybelline changed it. My original was a lighter, brighter shade but not too bright. Regardless, I always use this as an under eye liner for day and evening makeup wear. I bought 4 just in case this color becomes unavailable in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this pencil.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear &amp; is just the green color that I was looking for.  Good service---great product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle and doesn&#x27;t show up as much as I&#x27;d hoped, but it is a pretty color and nice for the days when you want to go subtle. Just brings out the eyes a little w/o looking like you&#x27;re wearing eyeliner. Not what I expected, but not bad either.</li>
            <li> Ive worn this for years. It goes,on great. I cannot find it in my local stores, so I bought it here.</li>
            <li> This does not seem to be the same Maybeline Define-A-Line Eyeliner that I&#x27;ve purchased so many times before. In truth, I just tossed out the second one that I&#x27;ve purchased in a couple of months or so. The first one -- so bad I thought it had to be a fluke. Perhaps stale, left at the back of a row in a mega-discount store. Recently, I purchased another. That was the last. The texture was dry, did not glide on, even a bit crumbly as I used it. No matter what the price, I expect better than this. Sad, because I am a HUGE FAN of Maybelline cosmetics, and purchase them quite often. Beware, something is off with this particular eye liner.</li>
            <li> I could not find this color at any of my local stores, so thankfully, Amazon carried it.  I love the khaki color, just a little shimmer, and I do not have to sharpen it, it rolls up like a lipstick.</li>
            <li> This was extremely disappointing as it arrived broken. The pencil would not push up to be used. This has happened to me before with the same color sold by Loreal. I believe this is why it is not sold in the stores. It was defective!! DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> Glides on fairly well and leaves a descent line.  Tends to evaporate into the lids after a short time.  Good primer line for a heavier gel liner, etc.</li>
            <li> The color is great. Goes on easy, but you cannot apply it heavily even if you try. Still, it&#x27;s the best eyeliner in this color that I have tried, and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> Maybelline khaki green eye liner is an excellent product.  Some Maybelline product colors are difficult to find at stores, but Amazon has them in stock!  Many stores won&#x27;t stock eye makeup for redheads because there isn&#x27;t as much demand for them as there is for brunettes and blondes. I have recently ordered an auburn eyebrow pencil and I&#x27;m sure I will be just as happy with that product as I am with the eyeliner..</li>
            <li> I used this eyeliner a year or two ago and it worked great for me! I really liked, so I bought another one. However, after applying and keeping it on my eye for a while, I would start to get watery eyes and get eye boogers as well. I thought maybe this was a fluke or something, so I bought another new pack, but again, the same thing happened. I happened to fall asleep with the eyeliner on one time, and it made my eyes so crusty waking up and made them extremely red! I have no idea what changed or if using this product maybe triggered some allergic reaction after a while, but this eyeliner just does not work for me. The Rimmel London one is much better! I go to sleep with it all the time and nothing has ever happened!</li>
            <li> Your average twist-up eyeliner, but the Color! I have hazel eyes, and I never want to wear any other color eyeliner ever again. Natural-looking, but gives my eyes that perfect oomph of beauty boost. I was a black-brown girl for years and I just threw them out. I&#x27;m buying two more of these, just to be safe. And so cheap!</li>
            <li> Nice color. Good quality. Excellent price. I am so satisfied and I recommend it. Packaging is absolutely great. :) Happy i bought it.</li>
            <li> I like it BECAUSE of the color which is khaki green, and that to my knowledge, has been discontinued. It HAD to have been a good seller because this color was always sold out even when it was still on the market. This color is the only variation among all the other dark colors offered by Mabelline that all look alike when applied.  I  like the softness that the color gives.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Glides on smoothly--no pulling.</li>
            <li> I have other colors of this eyeliner but this one was not nearly as smooth gliding or intense.  I&#x27;m thinking this was so reasonable because it was a very old eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Love this color and great product</li>
            <li> This color is hard to find and I like it a lot.  It goes on smoothly and looks great.  I am happy to be able to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the colour but it is a wee bit less creamy than the other define-a-line eyeliners I have purchased in the past but for the price I am content.</li>
            <li> I am an portrait artist and I use charcoal as my medium.  Years ago I found out that the smear end was perfect for accentuating dimples, wrinkles, shading around the eyes and such so I am 100% tickled to have been able find these.  Thanks!  Any color would have worked cause I don&#x27;t use it for my eyes only my pictures; beautiful effect!!!</li>
            <li> Kind of mushy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I love it. I love the color. I wish they sold it in stores.</li>
            <li> I could not find this pencil in stores I guess it is widely popular. Its super smooth and a perfect khaki color, I have brown eyes with hints on green, so it compliments perfectly, but I also believe this is a very flattering shade on anyone. Love the smudge tool on the other end to create a smoky effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite type of eyeliner... Works great!</li>
