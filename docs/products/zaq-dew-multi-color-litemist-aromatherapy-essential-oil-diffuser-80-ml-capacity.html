            <li>We use this in our bedroom (with a lavender blend) and even in the &amp;#34;lights out&amp;#34; mode it glows too brightly for me.</li>

            <li>I think it runs a good 5-6 hours on one fill up of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found a lot of information saying that oils aren&#x27;t good for cats.  </li>

            <li>Otherwise I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>, I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many diffusers none have I been happy with --  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with performance.  </li>
            <li>It works great, clove is my go to oil just because I love that holiday cooking smell.</li>
            <li>At under $50, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Dew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, all the features you expect from a product like this and more.</li>
            <li>the air is most welcome</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very pleased with it too.</li>
            <li>The scent fills the great room space and when I use at bedtime, it has helped me sleep better too.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li>It has 3 settings for lights, but when you turn off the diffuser is still kind of bright.</li>
            <li>This has been a great diffuser for all my favorite oils.  </li>
            <li>The color changing is nice but not too bright - makes for a nice nightlight in our sons room.</li>

            <li>LOVE and bought some as gifts!</li>
            <li>Really, great, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is great quality and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>The ZAQ Dew LiteMist Diffuser is easy to use and works great.  </li>
            <li>It easily covers the area, and makes my living space smell great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a proven fact, you feel better with pleasant smells in the air.</li>
            <li>Lavender works great and the ZAG puts out a fine mist, filling the room with your scent.</li>
            <li>and my room smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It would make a great night light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This really would be an ideal gift for someone, I know my daughter sure is happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used it almost nonstop during the day each day and it is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>and I am happy that I can enjoy the fragrances without harming my health, but instead improving it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and bought it to use lavender to help me sleep and it works great</li>
            <li>We are happy with the diffuser and enjoy using it often.</li>
            <li>affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>Makes house smell nice and adds a nice energy too.</li>
            <li>Works very well, and is very beautiful with the color changing lights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size</li>
            <li>and it runs out sometime over night and shuts off on its own.  </li>
            <li>I was loving it</li>
            <li>it turns off on its own.</li>
            <li>I actually really liked this product when it was functioning.</li>
            <li>This one is nice that you dilute the oils in water</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great well-designed product!</li>
            <li>This product is really nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent defuser works really well</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting that.</li>
            <li>This machine is very calming and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>this is a nice option.</li>
            <li>The auto-shut off is also a really nice</li>
            <li>:/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes a nice burbling noise and effectively diffuses scents.</li>
            <li>these attractive Diffusers couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>, this diffuser solved that problem and solved it handily.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>The color changing option is nice.  </li>
            <li>nice size and looks decorative.</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments on how my house always has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I liked that one of NAN&#x27;s oils is for attention/concentration.</li>
            <li>It went off on its own</li>
            <li>Thank you for the wonderful product (which was on sale) and for the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>but you must supply your own oils.  </li>
            <li>Mirage does not come with a handy filling container, that would have been nice, but livable without it.  </li>
            <li>And to be honest, I don&#x27;t feel like doing that for 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>, looks nice and operates for 4 hours non-stop.</li>
            <li>It puts out quite a nice vapor.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li>Still a good value, but with a lower price it would be a better value to</li>
            <li>We now keep it in the living room and it&#x27;s a nice smell to anyone entering our apartment.</li>
            <li>This is actually really nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice to keep by a desk with some lavender oil.</li>
            <li>The changing colors are nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it lit up and had the options to change colors.</li>
            <li>The color-changing that it goes through has a nice soothing affect as well</li>
            <li>I own 5 diffusers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice claim colors and auto turns off if you have it during the night</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own when the oil and water mix runs out.</li>
            <li>I received my diffuser really fast, I&#x27;m impressed!  </li>
            <li>Looks nice, diffuses well for one room.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind out there.</li>
            <li>But you wouldn&#x27;t want to put it on nice furniture without some type of cloth beneath it because the vapor sometimes finds it&#x27;s way to the table and leaves a damp ring around it.    </li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s so easy to use, the mist is beautiful abd</li>
            <li>Very easy to control and sexy and sleek, THNAKS!</li>
            <li>easy operation and effective!</li>
            <li>Cool and sleek looking, quitet, perfect amount of steam, lots of light variations to choose from.  </li>
            <li>This is a beautiful diffuser, I love the shape and the light that you can turn on or off at your pleasure.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use and has a  nice design.  </li>
            <li>I have been using oil blends from Edens Gardens, one of my favorites is Joy, which contains bergamot, geranium,  jasmine, lemon, mandarin, palmarosa, chamomile, rose,rosewood, sweet orange and ylang ylang.  </li>
            <li>AND.... the colors are very cool to watch too!</li>
            <li>The diffuser has worked perfectly since the new adaptor.</li>
            <li>The diffuser has worked perfectly since the new adaptor.</li>
            <li>The light is kind of bright -</li>
            <li>and that makes me SUPER happy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, I didn&#x27;t even need the manual to figure out how to work it.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to understand</li>
            <li>The ZAQ is very easy to refill.</li>
            <li>Very easy to operate,</li>
            <li>I sleep better and my room smells amazing.</li>
            <li>~ kind of reminds me of a genie bottle:)</li>
            <li>This is the one that works (so far) the best.  </li>
            <li>Even turning the lights off, one light remains too bright for the bedroom.</li>
            <li>I also bought KLS Natural set of 100% aromatherapy oils from Amazon and am very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to be able to review this one.</li>
            <li>Use this almost every day and have had many comments from visitors as to how nice my house smells.  </li>
            <li>the light was too bright</li>
            <li>we just love it and we already had another kind.  </li>
            <li>So far, we have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The issue is that the button has a light around it and it still stays on so it isn&#x27;t really a good diffuser for the bedroom, which is what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>I found that one smelled pretty good and any oils without carrier oils will work good with this diffuser.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful item, very relaxing and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The mist is very, very fine.</li>
            <li>Is affordable and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and reliably does the job!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li>Very nice worth every $$$.</li>
            <li>All the color chooses are a nice touch and the mist goes straight up into the air, works great.</li>
            <li>But overall it runs great, never leaks, and looks great.</li>
            <li>The great feature that allows you to turn off the light was one of the reasons I purchased this diffuser, although it&#x27;s important to know that the backlight for the button never turns off, so even when the cone is not lit, the button is.</li>
            <li>Okay, do it once: but make sure you have a paper towel handy.</li>
            <li>I thought I read somewhere on another review that it takes a minute to warm up kind of thing, but that doesn&#x27;t sound like it happens with everyone.  </li>
            <li>Together with the excellent brand of Essential Oil that I&#x27;m using in the infuser, I am thrilled with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The lights are bright and kind of fun.</li>
            <li>This product works really well and has a beautiful sleek design.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend dumping a bottle of cologne into this, though; make sure that what you use is suitable for use in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend dumping a bottle of cologne into this, though; make sure that what you use is suitable for use in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>Even though it is plastic it doesn&#x27;t look cheap and we are very pleased with this product and with this brand.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use , my entire room smells delightful.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use/clean, just wish the wonderful scent would last longer!  </li>
            <li>Love this &amp; easy to use!</li>
            <li>The colors on it are super bright, too.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>Super good purchase.</li>
            <li>But it is very nice a peaceful.</li>
            <li>A nice fine mist was coming out.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser; it puts out a good stream of mist and the changing colors are enjoyable!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried it with tangerine oil, which isn&#x27;t as potent (lung wise) as the other combo, but it fills up a room with a very pleasant scent and energizes me.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and looks special!</li>
            <li>This thing pumps volumes more mist and smell.</li>
            <li>While there are models that can operate for close to 8 hours they also tend to be way more</li>
            <li>I love how the colors change on this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about buying a diffuser at first, but chose this one because it had the best reviews, it was pretty, and I didn&#x27;t see anything about not using citrus oils in it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>I love it and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Kids love it.</li>
            <li>Bought from Amazon at the end of October 2014, Love it</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t know any more progress.  </li>
            <li>We likes the product when it works and we would love to give more star.</li>
            <li>But since most of the time it does not work and contact after-service is quite a work out, we will need to give it a one star.  </li>
            <li>You have to experiment which essential oils you like best and which ones to use to cover</li>
            <li>I love this , however I wish it held more.</li>
            <li>The reservoir seems to hold enough water to run for about 5 hours or so which is perfect for me since I turn it in before bed</li>
            <li>I use mine around the clock, top quality.</li>
            <li>Love that it automatically shuts off</li>
            <li>I put it in my office and have gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>it had a better output.</li>
            <li>Wonderful and very quiet.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to work better for what we would like to use it for - inconspicuous oil diffusing.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>My advice, look for another diffuser of better quality or know what your risks are.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I joke that it&#x27;s my magic genie/UFO transporter.  </li>
            <li>I love the product while it was working however, it stopped working after two months.</li>
            <li>Been working perfectly since I got it several months ago.</li>
            <li>I also love the rotating colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheerful!</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>my favorite part of this item is that it turns off when its done.</li>
            <li>Puts out a nice light mist.  </li>
            <li>My favorite diffuser.  </li>
            <li>i love this diffuser and would recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li>i plan to buy more for my kids rooms.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Purchased 1 and then 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>I love that it automatically shuts off when the water is gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started diffusing several hours before I go to bed so that my room still smells wonderful</li>
            <li>I love the changing lights.  </li>
            <li>I went on vacation and was able to take it with me.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I chose this diffuser.</li>
            <li>love putting my lavender in there to fill up the house&lt;</li>
            <li>Definitely the best of all difusers I tried.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Peppermint and lavender are wonderful to get rid of a headache, too... but back to the review.</li>
            <li>My favorite are the purples.</li>
            <li>I ordered two more</li>
            <li>My favorite oil to pair it with is Edens Garden &amp;#34;four thieves&amp;#34; oil.</li>
            <li>Love its shape and the series of colors while it&#x27;s in use.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of a genie coming out of a bottle when the mist comes out the top.</li>
            <li>Love these diffusers.  </li>
            <li>The price is better than I have seen for some of the others on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rather satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I kinda wished it held more water and lasted longer</li>
            <li>When I saw this mist aromatherapy device and smell the scent was immediately in love with it.</li>
            <li>I like the colors, but I most appreciate the auto turn off on this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I use lavender and peppermint with rosemary to create a refreshing and uplifting aroma throughout the house...</li>
            <li>(3) the ZAQ has better mist output than the SmileyDaisy (4)</li>
            <li>Simple, but awesome!</li>
            <li>you will be able to see it.</li>
            <li>Love this machine.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li>It turns off automatically when it is done, which I love.  </li>
            <li>I am now learning more than I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely, Mary Ann P.</li>
            <li>The entire room smelled great!</li>
            <li>The mister lasted several hours on one fill which impressed me since another brand diffuser</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love the sleekness of it</li>
            <li>but I knew I could get even more benefits from diffusing the oils in the air</li>
            <li>and it is still going in the morning which I love.</li>
            <li>presto! --  your house is smelling fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This diffuser would make a lovely gift.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It’s not overpowering at all, but a light scent kind of permeates the house.</li>
            <li>It has a great sleek and modern look.  </li>
            <li>Love this diffuser I use it in the bedroom for relaxation.</li>
            <li>pleased with the ZAO and compared to the Pearlessence&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>have a nice light / color feature</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Both myself and my husband LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Love the idea of auto shut off..</li>
            <li>It really only covers a bedroom size area but that is where I use it so it is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews of this product and made the decision to buy it.</li>
            <li>so my daughter got this lovely diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love my Dew</li>
            <li>My favorite part about it is the lovely color changing mode and</li>
            <li>how elegant it looks.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of this product and it is silent, works so well to scent my home and best of all - has an automatic shut off when the water runs out!!  </li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>I love putting my EO in this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I am going to get some more oils now</li>
            <li>that I have such a wonderful Diffuser to use.</li>
            <li>When I reduced it to 2-drops, I really enjoyed the aromatherapy experience and my sleep</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m many years away from my college days</li>
            <li>wait until your favorite color shows up, then stop the color cycling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not designed to run without the cone-shaped top in place and there is NO leakage when it&#x27;s used as directed.</li>
            <li>I love how it changes colors.</li>
            <li>the better it</li>
            <li>Anyways, I am thoroughly enjoying the ZAQ Mirage.  </li>
            <li>I must say I do like the ease of use of the ZAQ Mirage better than the Samyo.  </li>
            <li>It might  get used once or twice a week, and probably hasn&#x27;t even been cleaned properly, but it lights up and spews the delightful aromas every time I turn it on.  </li>

            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>and it does a wonderful job diffusing essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>really love it, and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Love the diffuser.</li>

            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve mostly used it with eucalyptus (for bronchitis that lingered) and peppermint (for the smell and for headache relief).</li>
            <li>I also love the automatIc shut off feature.</li>
            <li>I love watching the colors change, I find it so relaxing.</li>
            <li>And the BEST part is it starts working instantly!</li>
            <li>It is all that it is advertised to be and more.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t expound any more.  </li>
            <li>It is graceful looking, sleek and elegant.  </li>
            <li>Could have done a lot better than this....</li>
            <li>However, I just wished it produced a lot more vapor.</li>
            <li>and they sleep well, and wake up feeling much better.</li>
            <li>My kids love the color changes.</li>
            <li>It will shut off by itself when the water runs low which is a great tool to have!</li>
            <li>Now I have to buy some more of these for gifts.  </li>
            <li>Just okay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and I love the color changes and the auto shut off</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite Amazon purchase of the year.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I discovered the wonderful world of essential oils and diffusers.</li>
            <li>Works great and is very calming.</li>
            <li>We LOVE it.</li>
            <li>The colors of the light are nice too.</li>
            <li>I love it, the color of the unit is relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are brighter and the aromas better.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this and it runs almost every day in my kitchen.</li>
            <li>Silent, sleek and beautiful!</li>
            <li>This diffuser is my favorite way to dispense the oils.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use more oils with it.</li>
            <li>I love my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>and I love them both.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I like that we can set the light to change colors or at night there is an indigo light that can be on by the bedside, which is not too bright.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love how it changes colour.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have known that before buying it because most of the time when I&#x27;ve used it has been at night when we have colds to help breathe easier.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it could be improved upon, and I&#x27;m certainly glad that Amazon has it 40% of the list price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks and love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent is lemongrass</li>
            <li>I bought it on the recommendation from backdoor survival website and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>But I love it.</li>
            <li>No complaints. :-)  </li>
            <li>I love the color changing options.  </li>
            <li>Turns on instantly and the oil creates a wonderful aroma throughout the house.</li>
            <li>Better than burning wax candles or artificial/chemical devices.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m more than 3 feet away from it, I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Really love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>And it is cute and sophisticated looking.</li>
            <li>Fantastic service!  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy a couple of more for our home.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love and recommend it.</li>
            <li>There are so many brands to choose from and many varying opinions in regard to how well they work.  </li>
            <li>Love this product....</li>
            <li>I love it and use it almost every day.</li>
            <li>Yes, I recommend this! :)</li>
            <li>months ago and have been 100% pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I really am enjoying the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>Would buy again! :)</li>
            <li>I use this one non stop, wish it out out more humidity</li>
            <li>I would like to have given this 4.5 stars, but we&#x27;ll stick to 4!:-)</li>
            <li>Just lift the top off and fill it w water then the oil.</li>
            <li>I will probably order 1 or 2 more just to have a permanent spot in the kid&#x27;s rooms for a nighttime diffuser/nightlight.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>We love this diffuser and we are thinking of buying another.  </li>
            <li>so I received the same thing for Christmas and it has worked wonderfully for a month.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li>The deneve is better</li>
            <li>Absolutley love this product.</li>
            <li>Working better than expectation.</li>
            <li>and they work fine and provide the scent as I first experienced it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and was very excited when it arrived, set it up per the instructions,  plugged it in, and..</li>
            <li>So far so good with this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>But, so far so good!</li>
            <li>super fun and a great way to help the unwinding process at the end of the day</li>
            <li>Filling it is easy: just take the plastic cone-shaped top off, pour water from the measuring cup into the diffuser, replace the top, and turn it on.</li>
            <li>ZAO has a very clean neat look</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>The changing colors of the diffuser is soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Love this, so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to just lift the top funnel and fill the resevoir to the fill line</li>
            <li>This one adds moisture to dry air as well, which is especially great during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I love how it is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s attractive, super easy to use, and who doesn&#x27;t like the fun changing lights (optional if you don&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>I wish it emitted the scents more strongly.</li>
            <li>So far so great, and I am 100% satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>THANKS for the excellent service and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Overall this was a good purchase at a fair price and the design allows it to be placed anywhere.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>The changing colors are a great feature - very soft and soothing colors.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and use, will buy another for my downstairs area.</li>
            <li>has worked great so far!</li>
            <li>I bought one for me &amp; also for my best friend to enjoy &amp; she loves hers too after a long day at work &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Mine looks just like the photo when it&#x27;s in operation, with a fine mist coming out of the top funnel.  </li>
            <li>Shortly thereafter, I received a beautiful thank you from mom telling me how thrilled she was with her very special and unique gift.</li>
            <li>Very cool</li>
            <li>Very easy to operate and makes me happy to use essential oils and not chemical laden room sprays.</li>
            <li>which is a huge plus then just lift the top and wipe it out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great so far.</li>
            <li>and now I enjoy the lovely oils being diffused.</li>
            <li>I love the light color changes, too.</li>
            <li>I love the style of the diffuser, it&#x27;s options for light changing, having one color on or turning it off.  </li>
            <li>Best feature is the auto shut off when the basin is empty.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is finding the ideal place to put it.</li>
            <li>It is classy looking and works great.</li>
            <li>I have a tea light burner that works much better.</li>
            <li>Love the LED light choices.</li>
            <li>I love that you can turn the light off and still use it.  </li>
            <li>and I love the changing light colors.</li>
            <li>In addition, the color changing light is soothing and interesting.</li>
            <li>And the plume of superfine mist it puts out is lovely to behold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I loved this diffuser so much that I bought one for my mother.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I had to get my mother one too.</li>
            <li>We have tried a good dozen different oil diffusers (flame, electronic, you name it) and this is by far the best one we&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much I bought one for work and another for home.</li>
            <li>My mum loved this so much she bought herself one</li>
            <li>so easy to fill and easy o clean!</li>
            <li>more importantly the product was just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, very light weight and can be placed almost anywhere.</li>
            <li>It puts out a large amount of must and great worth the oils I have used.  </li>
            <li>We love the color choices and it is user friendly.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works and looks great!</li>
            <li>: The blue &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; indicator light is very bright, and is disrupting to use while trying to get to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money, it&#x27;s a great product that will help you feel better, live healthier, and improve your mood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to set up and use</li>
            <li>Easy use diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and it keeps pet odors at bay.</li>
            <li>The button makes it easy to switch through modes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(so easy)</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to add water and oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is fairly easy to clean because the top just lifts off and the water chamber is easily wiped out with a paper towel or cloth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is fairly easy to clean because the top just lifts off and the water chamber is easily wiped out with a paper towel or cloth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Really easy to operate</li>
            <li>Easily fills the room with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>

            <li>Easy to operate.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser, it&#x27;s easy to operate, easy to clean, and shuts off automatically</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, I love the sleek design</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my whole living room smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, the ZAQ Dew is so easy, a five-year-old could use it.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>easily movable, quiet for the most part and works really great.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to assemble and operate.  </li>
            <li>No complaints, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as strong as a night-light, but doesn&#x27;t bother me when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>and it is going strong.</li>
            <li>Amazon has some good deals on Edens Garden, and even if though they don&#x27;t understand apostrophes, I highly recommend their Clarey Sage, Basil, Clementine, and Chamomile.</li>
            <li>Only wish the power light was NOT SO DARN BRIGHT!</li>
            <li>Pretty colors (if you like that kind of thing).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and the lights are really cool.  </li>
            <li>The changing colors are a nice touch and a pretty accent piece.</li>
            <li>This is the first of its kind that I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought another one!</li>
            <li>but it works out well and looks pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I only hope this ZAQ Dew LiteMist continues to work as beautifully as it has from day one.  </li>
            <li>It puts a beautiful smell all over the room almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully, quite literally as it changes colors while filling our entire living and kitchen areas with aroma.</li>
            <li>Perfect for massage therapy sessions, meditation groups, evening relaxation and any other use!</li>
            <li>The added colorful lights make it even more fun! :)</li>
            <li>The white is a nice bright, clean look.</li>
            <li>Immediate fine mist comes out.</li>
            <li>The Samyo seems to work fine, and it is cheaper, but I would keep the ZAQ one over</li>
            <li>The Samyo seems to work fine, and it is cheaper, but I would keep the ZAQ one over it.  </li>
            <li>I bought my mom one too, and it seems that hers is working fine.</li>
            <li>I wish the part that holds water/oil was removable, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and it survived just fine</li>
            <li>I like the fine mist--</li>
            <li>Oh, and the shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>and it really does make me feel better!</li>
            <li>Use during the day, night, all day, all night ... easy to use, easy to change oils, clean.</li>
            <li>How strong a smell you get will depend on how much oil you put into the diffuser and what kind of oils you use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean up, and the kids like the spaceship look of it.</li>
            <li>but I have a rather large living room that it diffuses nicely in.</li>
            <li>disburses the oils nicely throughout a large room.</li>
            <li>in all this is a wonderful little diffuser.</li>
            <li>initially it was working fine, my wife was happy with it.  </li>
            <li>But I think most of us, &amp; certainly, I, want to be able to get the scent of our oils circulating well throughout them</li>
            <li>Probably best for a smaller room or have two for large rooms.</li>
            <li>but I must admit I&#x27;m now a huge fan of the ZAQ Allay diffuser</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if I could turn off the light.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and change the oil/water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So worth the money :)</li>
            <li>And it also is very neutral looking which is nice.</li>
            <li>noise whatsoever, with the exception of a water trickle sound here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the colors you can set it to.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and change your oils, etc.</li>
            <li>It does not create any moisture on anything around it and it lasts 4 hours if the water is filled all the way to the max line.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to try to sleep with that light on.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>I have primarily used lemon, lavender and peppermint oil in it as that&#x27;s supposed to help with sinus/allergies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is extremely easy to use and to clean.  </li>
            <li>I like the option of turning the lights on and off, though when  light is in &amp;#34;off&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Lavender is great for relaxing and is currently the EO we have in the unit.</li>
            <li>and you can also adjust it so that it will scent but not have the light.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that the light changed as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this because there is no heat to worry about</li>
            <li>I thought the light turns off though which is does</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wipe out and keep clean, and it seems to work well with any type of oil.</li>
            <li>It works great with my essential oils and the changing colors are a plus.</li>
            <li>Upon opening it I noticed it was a nice size, very well made.</li>
            <li>I put the water in and a few drops of the lemon oil, turned it on and within seconds I had a wonderful aroma filling my room.</li>
            <li>Pressing the power button once turns on the mist and the light cycling.</li>
            <li>Great for a bed side diffuser but not for big rooms.</li>
            <li>Works great and using it several times a day.</li>
            <li>, honestly, I didn&#x27;t really read the description of this on Amazon, and when it arrived, we were all talking about lava lamps ;</li>
            <li>It has a nice sized footprint and is very stable.</li>
            <li>If it avoids the problems others have mentioned about not running after a while, I would say this is a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>The primary reason I bought it was increased humidity when I sit at the computer</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>BUT great product overall</li>
            <li>It sends out a light mist into the air which does not condense on surfaces.  </li>
            <li>This is a great essential oil diffuser!</li>
            <li>We still enjoy this diffuser.</li>
            <li>The light is soothing almost a dimmed nightlight.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>The product description says that the light shuts off.  </li>
            <li>I like that the light lets you know it is on.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m fairly happy with the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>but I am a light sleeper</li>
            <li>like the light settings and the ability of turning this feature off if you do not want it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars for one reason and that is the light.</li>
            <li>It has a modes of where the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have another one that I can&#x27;t use in the bedroom at night because the light stays on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It serves as night light somewhat</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous diffuser.  </li>
            <li>the light goes off (although the button remains lighted so you can see where to turn it off).  </li>
            <li>, I like that it will change colors and you have an option stay on one color or turn the light off.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t stand to have ANY light when I sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So go to sleep comfortable.</li>
            <li>Nice modern design that compliments our home decor.  </li>
            <li>The ZAQ diffuser emits a louder whirring sound than the Deneve, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the bedroom.  </li>
            <li>The fragrant oil I am using immediately began to mist lightly into the room.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I just keep the color off, which is a great feature to have if you don&#x27;t want to draw attention to the device.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The gently changing colors add such a beautiful ambiance to the waiting room of my Therapy Practice!  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this diffuser--although it does not put out a strong scent, it is easy to use and adds a nice light aroma when used with STRONG essential oils.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It spreads the scent throughout our living room easily, and I love the pretty and calming lights.</li>
            <li>I am exceedingly pleased by this feature and that the machine begins to work right away.  </li>
            <li>They have so many other great blends and sell them on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very effective at diffusing essential oils into the air and adds to the decor of any room.</li>
            <li>However, the greater problem is it worked fine - the first time.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing a few more!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use, very quite, stays cool and great price!  </li>
            <li>it takes no extra things like cups or filters, like the pretty colored lights, the over all it&#x27;s great:-)</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, a couple male co-workers liked it and were interested in getting one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very invigorating, and super potent!</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s very fine, and if you place your fingers right at the exit hole at the top, the steam comes out slightly warm, but two inches above it has no distinguishable temperature.</li>
            <li>To clean away yesterday&#x27;s scent, wipe out with a paper towel lightly dampened with vinegar, followed by one dampened with water or tears.  </li>
            <li>I like the cool, fragrant mist and easy clean up of the water pod.</li>
            <li>I like that refilling it is super easy</li>
            <li>It is attractive, sturdy, and easy to use, which I expected.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is super easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li>Like other people have said, it is bright!</li>
            <li>well, the &#x27;light off&#x27; setting still emits a fairly bright blue light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be sure to follow the package directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Truthfully I thought it&#x27;d be a pretty gadget for my desk and help create a spa like atmosphere while I work.</li>
            <li>have loved using this diffuser - easy to use, clean and keep pumping through the awesomeness of essential oils!  </li>
            <li>It also lets off cool moisture instead of hot (like a humidifier would) which is perfect for our toddlers when they get close &amp; curious.</li>
            <li>I researched other diffusers, including Young Living, and I found this one to be the most attractive and cost effective.</li>
            <li>so worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>I got this for my birthday and was so excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>Simple and Effective!</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of diffusing throughout the room (which isn&#x27;t small).</li>
            <li>Even in the light off position there will be a bright blue light shining.  </li>
            <li>The lights are nice colors and not too bright, but bright enough that I can check on the baby at night without having to turn on other lights.</li>
            <li>I use lemon EO and my office smelled so fresh!</li>
            <li>The mist that comes out of it is very fine and does have much of a humidifying effect.</li>
            <li>This is a great diffuser except for the fact that you can&#x27;t smell the scent for a very long time after it starts.</li>
            <li>Pain to clean.</li>
            <li>Mush easier to clean and fill.</li>
            <li>I wipe it clean once a week.</li>
            <li>So relaxing and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>This one I just purchased  is my most favorite so far, and family loves them too.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable, and love the light changing colors.</li>
            <li>This is the first cool diffuser that I have tried and I am really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>, it is a bright blue light.</li>
            <li>So far I LOVE this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>I hope it does because so far I love it!</li>
            <li>My 4 year old grand daughter calls it my rainbow volcano!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really a minor issue though, and I&#x27;m super happy with it.</li>
            <li>It actually works best at night if I hold it on the red light, rather than turn the light &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Scent lingers through the whole room and it is easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to give it a try, and then couldn&#x27;t because I didn&#x27;t have any oils on hand.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little diffuser, runs for 4-6 hours on a fill, and is great with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>She is MOST PLEASED with it - not only the actual diffusing action but also the calming and beautiful color changes !!</li>
            <li>This fills pretty much my whole 800 sq ft apt with whatever aroma i want to smell.</li>
            <li>Works well, it&#x27;s quiet, and the lights aren&#x27;t too bright.  </li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t want it to bright you can press the power buttons again and turns Navy blue.</li>
            <li>Even when running on the &amp;#34;light-off&amp;#34; setting, there is still a rather bright blue LED indicator that shines.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for almost a year now full time and still going.</li>
            <li>, It looks really cool</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to be able to run it as I fall asleep.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a diffuser as a Christmas present for my wife, but the ones i was looking at (with lots of good reviews) were either out of stock or didn&#x27;t have the colors I wanted.</li>
            <li>I had two very pricey diffusers from a top company and they quit working after sitting for a while.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been running it daily since I received it, and nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li>they are to be diffused with cool mist like this.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully love this so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this and wished I had stumbled upon it much sooner.</li>
            <li>I really have to admit that I like the Allay better than the Dew diffuser,</li>
            <li>and they loved the fact that it changed colors and were instantly intrigued by the design.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>Love the different settings for light, and the fact you can turn off the light at night!</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but it&#x27;s big.</li>
            <li>Diffuses whatever scent you want and the lights are really cool.</li>
            <li>Looks cool.</li>
            <li>They both work well, but the ZAQ is so cool looking.</li>
            <li>Bought this recently as a birthday gift for a good friend.</li>
            <li>The color changes of the light are fun as well.  </li>
            <li>The cool thing about this product is that it also functions as a mini humidifier.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s just cool to look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It lasts for at least 8 hours which is perfect to run at night.</li>
            <li>The wiring to the new one feels more secure, and the diffuser started up immediately without any issue or hesitation.  </li>
            <li>The wiring to the new one feels more secure, and the diffuser started up immediately without any issue or hesitation.  </li>
            <li>I filled her up and turned it on right away.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong, and works as well as it did when I first opened it.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and peaceful.</li>
            <li>Love how it changes colors, love how it fills my entire room with my special oils scents.</li>
            <li>The cool colors are also very pretty and soothing, you can have one or all colors, or you can have no color rotation at all.  </li>
            <li>But this didn&#x27;t stop me from buying it, per the other great reviews.</li>
            <li>Runs out of water to quickly for me</li>
            <li>I really love the healthy and healing aroma of using essential oils, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this diffuser!</li>
            <li>I love essential oils, and feel so much better about diffusing them, as opposed to burning candles and potpourri tarts with synthetic chemicals.  </li>
            <li>love scented products and have used many different types for creating that ambiance and atmosphere throughout my home.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing this diffuser, I was using an oil burner from the dollar store and all of my family and friends say that was much more potent than this product.  </li>
            <li>I quickly realized from the pungent smell that I would need to do some research before using the oil as the smell is too overpowering in its concentrated form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I find the colored lights tacky, but that&#x27;s okay, because you can select just a clear light, which is what I do.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature about this diffuser is that you can choose how the light system works, including the following options:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy with this after extensive research into the different types.</li>
            <li>read many reviews on several diffusers before choosing this one, and I must say I am pleased in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love having several settings to choose from but more than that</li>
            <li>I used it for my favorite essential oils and enjoying the fragrance and health benefits from them.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>You can turn the light &#x27;off&#x27; but really, there still is quite a bit of light given off.</li>
            <li>Disperses the aroma quickly.  </li>
            <li>far as decor goes, the diffuser is pretty modern looking, but it kind of looks like of like a genie lamp when the mist starts coming out of the top.</li>
            <li>far as decor goes, the diffuser is pretty modern looking, but it kind of looks like of like a genie lamp when the mist starts coming out of the top.</li>
            <li>Lets off a strong stream of steam for a long time before running out and fills my room with sent nicely.</li>
            <li>It dims to a light shade of blue which lights up my whole room, not to mention the on button which is sooo bright.  </li>
            <li>She likes it very much!</li>
            <li>The color change on the diffuser is very pretty, and it has the option to pick the color as well.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions but the diffuser continued to glow a nice blue which in the middle of the night was too bright.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>The vapor is very fine and dissipates quickly -- it reminds me of those old &amp;#34;genie in a bottle&amp;#34; stories.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this little machine and am so thankful for all the great reviews that helped me decide on this particular one.</li>
            <li>the first being Young Living&#x27;s Rose Home Diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I find it very relaxing and incredibly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and is small so it doesn&#x27;t take much space.</li>
            <li>I love that the lighting is very soft.  </li>
            <li>I love it so far!  </li>
            <li>This is our first diffuser and it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet &amp; really pretty &amp; makes my entire downstairs (or upstairs - each level is about 2400 square feet) smell wonderful!</li>
            <li>Not only did she Iove having it in her room, she got SO many compliments and questions about it from the drs and nurses!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li>Bought one for myself in the UK where I live, liked it so much</li>
            <li>Low noise, Perfect for single room.</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to use, and has lasted several months now being used almost daily.</li>
            <li>If you put a more strongly scented oil in it, it will scent a larger space but it will be quite powerful in the room it is used in.</li>
            <li>Beautiful little devices that puts out a lot of scent!</li>
            <li>They responded right away and sent me a new top at no charge.  </li>
            <li>And it emits only a very light gurgling sound, which I find soothing.    </li>
            <li>A great little diffuser for the price.</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser.</li>
            <li>A great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It looks pretty cool but has a clean look that doesn&#x27;t interfere with decor (which I was worried about) and instead of being tacky, the color changing is actually pretty neat.</li>
            <li>They are very simple to operate and they do a very good job diffusing the essential oils with distilled water.  </li>
            <li>The directions say tap water is fine, but I use distilled and wipe the diffuser clean between uses (vital if you use citrus oils!).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like any light when I&#x27;m going to sleep, and since I often diffuse lavender at night, I really can&#x27;t leave it on.</li>
            <li>We are using this to diffuse essential oils and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>As a frequent migraine and insomnia sufferer I&#x27;ve found the ZAQ Dew LiteMist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser to be the perfect addition to an unexpected place, my home office.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to have my house scented with NATURAL essential oils of my choosing (scents that aren&#x27;t cancer-causing or are hormone disrupting, like all chemical/artificial scents on the market).</li>
            <li>I love the diffuser &amp; the oils even more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and quiet.</li>
            <li>While this is a nice diffuser, it only runs 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Pleased so far.</li>
            <li>I love the style and ease of the Zaq, but I&#x27;m hesitant to try a third time, so regrettably I&#x27;ve ordered a different brand that I don&#x27;t like as much, but it gets great reviews on Amazon and hopefully it will perform well.</li>
            <li>Keeps my desk area smelling fresh at the office.  </li>
            <li>JUst received it and so far pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>How useful is something that has to be refilled every 20 minutes?  </li>
            <li>no danger of burns which would be a good feature with curious children in the home.</li>
            <li>By far more durable (the bottom of the Pearlessence broke off and while still functional it was</li>
            <li>This is my first cool diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for a week and love it.</li>
            <li>it does a good job with our 15 x 15 ish size living room, but not much beyond.</li>
            <li>The unit has a nice look to it and is compact and lightweight and had plenty of steam coming out, however, the high-quality essential oil I was diffusing could not be smelled AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>But when a friend stopped over later and my husband returned home from work, I asked them if they liked the smell and neither had any idea what I was talking about.  </li>
            <li>however I couldn&#x27;t help but think that a lot of college bound youthful students would love this product because of the soothing scents, sci-fi look, and the changing colors (goodbye lava light - hello aromatherapy essential oil diffuser).</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one at all unless you want to spend this kind of money for a product that only works a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>and my apt has a lasting lavender fragrance when I use the lavender oil.</li>
            <li>Amazon was nice enough to refund my money.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it efficient, it is also a nice decorative piece for my home.  </li>
            <li>The oil diffuser effectively diffuses the essential oil/water solution in the air.  </li>
            <li>The design is simple, lightweight, and effective.</li>
            <li>Nice diffuser - however after 4 weeks of occasional use it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this could affect the life of this beautiful product, as the water and oil sit in a plastic</li>
            <li>the colorful lights turned off.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safe around my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>It keeps things fresh in there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quiet and looks nice sitting on my night stand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I appreciate being able to scent the air naturally.</li>
            <li>They always want their bedrooms to smell nice, but commercial air fresheners seem to trigger their asthma.  </li>
            <li>but I would not buy the same kind again.</li>
            <li>The fun part is the lights that change color.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it were bigger</li>
            <li>Love the light feature and very quiet!</li>
            <li>basically I took a star away for the light not actually being able to be turned off, and the scent not being as dispersed as I would like.</li>
            <li>Soothing, works well and colors are fun.</li>
            <li>And even though you turn off the light, it still puts off a noticeable blue glow, which is okay if you want a nightlight.</li>
            <li>the colors are fun and the auto shut off puts my mind at ease.  </li>
            <li>before I decided which diffuser to purchase, I originally thought I was going to get one of the more expensive diffusers from Young Living or Doterra, however the reviews were not as good as I had hoped, and I have a friend who has the Young Living Diffuser and she told me she has to replace it every six months, and that really doesn&#x27;t impress me much, so I thought after reading reviews on every diffuser, I chose this one because the ratings were the best</li>
            <li>Quiet, and easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li>Very quiet, easy to clean and to use which is a plus!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I returned the other model, which was twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Candles of course, worked great to fill the whole room, but my husband wasn&#x27;t really a fan because sometimes the scent was a little too strong for his liking.</li>
            <li>Easy to maintain, easy to use, does not shut down after some time like mentioned on some reports, just be careful to not get the electrical opening under the device wet, good amount of mist, nice colors, elegant design.</li>
            <li>The other one we had was too bright for the bedroom.</li>
            <li>I originally had it sitting on a table about 7 feet away from me but couldn&#x27;t really smell the oils I was diffusing.  </li>
            <li>Works well, great lighting, long enough power cord to fit where I want it.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly - plug and play.</li>
            <li>Then the on/off button is a super bright blue so that shines really bright especially in a dark room.  </li>
            <li>I just turn it on right by me during computer activity and any symptom I had ( use Breathe for allergy, Lavender for stress, Peppermint for headache) get healed.</li>
            <li>, I decided to use it right away.</li>
            <li>I keep it on my night stand and it is just the right size.</li>
            <li>It is easy to refill and start over for a new cycle.</li>
            <li>I liked this at first and it worked well,but the machine broke after about 3 months of daily use.</li>
            <li>It as a pretty shape and the different lights are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>This is my first essential oil diffuser and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>My main issue is with the light.  </li>
            <li>but I got it to mainly use at night and on the setting where the light is suppose to shut off</li>
            <li>I would love it more if it would be dark while I sleep.  </li>
            <li>The only things I&#x27;ve found that I dislike is how easy it can be tipped over and spilled (my cat and preschooler are quite interested in it and did this) and that while the light settings are nice, they make it a pain to simply shut</li>
            <li>It would be even better if the off light position was really no light instead of a bright blue.</li>
            <li>Our house is very large</li>
            <li>It diffuses oils nearly instantly, gives enough steam to replace a humidifier, lasts for hours, gives off a pleasant aroma while changing colors constantly (which adds another pleasant dimension to the senses) and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I love the changing colors and that within only minutes my whole office is filled with aroma.</li>
            <li>Too bright for a dark sleeping room.</li>
            <li>The reservoir is eady to clean and the light mist carries the essential oil without depleting the water too quickly.</li>
            <li>The old diffuser died a few months ago, so I purchased this one, after reading good reviews, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It is small but puts outs great aroma .</li>
            <li>I get so excited to try new oils &amp; start this diffuser every morning!</li>
            <li>It was simple to use, and the scent filled the room quickly!</li>
            <li>but when you are sleeping!!&lt;br /&gt;I now have a wide selection of essential oils and mix and match them for a very good night sleep every day...</li>
            <li>The color changing is very soothing and the aroma is wonderful for a bedroom or other smaller room.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean when changing essential oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet and is easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li>This light &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; mode is still technically with a light on.  </li>
            <li>The simple sleek design is very eye catching and setup</li>
            <li>You can turn off the changing colors to just have a light blue hue, but I can&#x27;t fall asleep unless I put something over the blinding power light.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that it performs just as well as my more expensive one.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; mode is still pretty bright in a dark room, however, which is one of the reasons why I gave four instead of five stars.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping- received it in one day.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quiet, has lighting options and is easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li>Even while it worked I thought it should have done a better job at dispensing the oil into the air - it just didn&#x27;t seem powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise, it is quiet, and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I recently started to get into essential oils and thought this would be a great way to add scent into my home.  </li>
            <li>Easy set up and works like a charm so far.</li>
            <li>It operates very quietly and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very quiet, has adjustable light settings (which makes me want one for both my bedroom and my preschooler&#x27;s), and manages to fill a 20&#x27;x12&#x27; space with a comfortable level of scent.</li>
            <li>I have purchased more expensive diffusers,  but these are great.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping and works very well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li>I am now looking to replace with another, more reliable, unit and am willing to pay a little more for a diffuser this time.  </li>
            <li>a constant sound sort of like a fish tank but more high pitch.  </li>
            <li>The black dome actually looks very classy and the multi-color, when I choose to use the mode, still shows beautifully through the opening on top.</li>
            <li>There are three modes for lighting - it can switch colors every couple minutes, can be set to one color or switched into the night light mode (dimmer light to be used at night if you don&#x27;t want too much light in the dark).</li>
            <li>, so i can&#x27;t speak to how well it would work in a larger living room, but it is more than adequate for the baby room or even our large master bedroom (15x15ish??</li>
            <li>The disc was only $6, so everything&#x27;s fine now!</li>
            <li>Very Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>(The downside is that one has to be careful, as it is easy to drop in too much oil, and create an overwhelming scent.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I loved this product until it stopped working after only 6 months of use and I barely used it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to essential oils, and I love this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>, so I can&#x27;t say how long this will run until it runs out and shuts off, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, so I can&#x27;t say how long this will run until it runs out and shuts off, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Works amazing and longer running than expected.</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>, it works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, leaves off lots of aromatics, shuts off by itself when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li>I love that it turns itself off when the water is low.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>I think yo can find better units that will last longer and be cheaper.  </li>
            <li>wish I would have known more about these before I ordered this one I might have chose a different on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome can&#x27;t go wrong gift.</li>
            <li>I use it almost every night and love trying out different aromatherapy oils in it to lull me off to sleep.</li>
            <li>As a yoga instructor getting into Ayurveda, I also love this product for its ability to help me incorporate different aromatherapy extracts into my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what we need it to do, plus changes colors or stays on one color, depending on setting.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>First use of a diffuser...</li>
            <li>On the regular mode the top of the diffuser changes colors</li>
            <li>Very calming as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>The first press of the button turns it on with the color-changing cycle.</li>
            <li>We ordered a replacement to confirm that it wasn&#x27;t just the first one we got.</li>
            <li>pretty lines</li>
            <li>There are only 3 in all the many</li>
            <li>I have two myself and buy it often as a gift for friends and family, along with some of my favorite essential oils.  </li>
            <li>will most likely order another one as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I specifically requested the ZAQ brand, since it had so many excellent (and so few negative) reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, low blue light</li>
            <li>I love the different colors that it transitions to.</li>
            <li>and I can definitely smell the oils better than I can with the Dew, so</li>
            <li>On the first day, my husband came home from work and noticed immediately (and he almost never notices things like this.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s laughably funny in some parts.</li>
            <li>The diffuser does not get hot</li>
            <li>My favorite EO&#x27;s to use in it are peppermint mixed with vanilla.</li>
            <li>For the price, I was able to diffuse a room initially.</li>
            <li>I have several diffusers and this is my FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>aromatherapy essential oil diffuser is one way in which to dilute the oil and better appreciate the concentrated scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering purchasing a \\&quot;variety\\&quot; pack of essential oils to continue to experiment with the many scents available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>being said, I love the shape, and overall function.</li>
            <li>improvement might be to put this on a stand--the higher you can get it,</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It diffuses the oil SO much better than my last diffuser!</li>
            <li>When I first took it out to try, I followed the instructions.</li>
            <li>for another area of the house and was pleased to see the adapters are the same.  </li>
            <li>for another area of the house and was pleased to see the adapters are the same.  </li>
            <li>Just opened the box and set it up, so these are first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color changing feature sounds tacky, but is really quite soothing with the shift in colors almost mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot or ruin any surfaces - I often set it on top my wooden jewelry cabinet so my toddler can&#x27;t reach it.</li>
            <li>We looked at many different options but this one stood out.</li>
            <li>I think this will work well in a bedroom where you can shut the door but don&#x27;t expect much in a more open area.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what the label says.</li>
            <li>It has an auto shut-off when the water is empty which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>The colors are soothing and I like that it doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
            <li>We love using it at night in our room with different relaxing and therapeutic oils.</li>
            <li>Just wish it could hold more water do it would last longer.</li>
            <li>I was seeking a way to better diffuse essential oils into my home.</li>
            <li>One issue that I am sensitive to is the amount of light it gives out.</li>
            <li>but pretty)</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how cheap it felt.  </li>
            <li>Also, thanks for the sale!  </li>
            <li>diffuser is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I want this to last for many years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My first time use one</li>
            <li>It is my first diffuser.</li>
            <li>I have lots of oils that I use with different warmers but this diffuser intensifies the oils without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>recently had a need to replace the top (I damaged it myself) and contacted the company to see if they sold replacements.  </li>
            <li>Worked exactly like it promised, have had zero problems.</li>
            <li>I use it often for several weeks and had no problem because I make sure I wash it after each use.  </li>
            <li>Works well and looks pretty.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I like the colored lights and especially being able to set the diffuser to one color.</li>
            <li>it is most centrally located.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser.</li>
            <li>The first time you press it, it starts vaporizing the water and scent immediately and colors change after a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got a lemon the first time.</li>
            <li>If, like us, you use a diffuser more often, be aware that this one will not last a year.</li>
            <li>, we also enjoy the more pleasant smells in the air since we do have dogs, birds, a cat and fireplaces in our home, we no longer have any unpleasant odors that having pets and a fireplace brings.</li>
            <li>This makes it less than ideal for someone who needs total darkness for sleep.</li>
            <li>If it avoids the problems others have mentioned about not running after a while, I would say this is a fantastic buy.y mild hum that is not at all distracting, and the movement of the water creates occasional droplet sounds.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m really impressed with this diffuser, I use it constantly, day and night, and since it automatically stops when it runs out of water, I feel comfortable leaving mine on at night when I&#x27;m sleeping, it says that it lasts between 3-4 hours, but mine actually has lasted as much as 6 hours, perhaps I have a lesser amount of mist that comes out of mine, I don&#x27;t know,</li>
            <li>This little gem is in my living room because it is small goes with most decor easy to tuck someplace and enjoy the essential oil of your choosing great after a stressful day of work/kids/pets/life ect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say to put in around 4-7 drops of essential oil in when the water is at the full level (although the higher end of this range will be too overwhelming for some and may nearly &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; your eyes a bit).</li>
            <li>I just love mine, and I use it nightly with some pure lavender essential oil to relax before bed.</li>
            <li>And the different color changing light is so pretty!</li>
            <li>Lighting is bright in dark room and pleasant; the aroma is subtle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and big but I have to keep a cloth under the unit and place it on a surface that can&#x27;t get wet because the steam flow is pretty strong and creates lots of moisture.</li>
            <li>I fall asleep with it on, the colors are a nice touch and make my ceiling interesting when the vapor rises up in thin clouds and changes colors.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase at least one more, eventually, so that I can have them in more rooms of the house.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly light, but powerful depending on what essential oils you choose.</li>
            <li>You should be able to use both essential oils (real plant oils) and perfume oils (synthetics, alcohol-based fragrances, etc.).</li>
            <li>I would get it again, but I do recommend that you buy essential oils as soon as you order it so that when it arrives at your door you are ready to go :)</li>
            <li>I love that they actually diffuse the scent really well</li>
            <li>LOVE this, product, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s sort of a modern shape...</li>
            <li>Even with the light off, it still gives that soft blue light from the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button, so it&#x27;s not completely dark when you turn the light &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The only little thing I wish I could change is when you put it on the &#x27;lights off&#x27; setting, it still has a light that shines fairly brightly and lights up the room.  </li>
            <li>Does the job, could be better looking but still less ugly than most of its kind !!!</li>
            <li>You have several options for how you want to run it - with or without the light on and multi light change mode or single light mode.  </li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser, so I don&#x27;t know how this compares to competitors, but personally, I really like it.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, it lasted for 5 1/2 hours and really did shut itself  </li>
            <li>and I really wish, I would of got this one first.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit Leary at first because I did&#x27;t know too much about this item or the oils associated with it.  </li>
            <li>I run it pretty much 24X7 and have no problems.  </li>
            <li>however I usually place 7 - 9 drops, just use a good quality aroma oil.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these diffusers early this year and liked it so much that I&#x27;m buying another one for another room in our house and a third one as a gift for a friends</li>
            <li>but when you tell it no light, it is fine in the daytime, but at night the blue power light shines through the top</li>
            <li>If you have modern decor, this will fit right in, but if you have traditional / vintage decor in your house, like I do, it might stand out a bit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, although I see they&#x27;ve come out with one with more capacity for the same $$.</li>
            <li>the ZAO wins on every metric except for size of footprint in the highly valued bathroom vanity real estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can smell my essential oils within seconds of turning it on, so cool!</li>
            <li>Easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I have purchased 2 extra of the Allay diffusers as gifts as well and the recipients are thrilled and have told me numerous times how much they LOVE their diffusers, both in blue as well.</li>
            <li>a very mild hum that is not at all distracting, and the movement of the water creates occasional droplet sounds.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was easy to use, quiet and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love the mesmerizing lights at night, in the dark.</li>
            <li>The various colors you can select are easy on the eyes and add a soothing ambiance.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser is relatively compact and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It certainly stands out.  </li>
            <li>but another one thought because it is just so large.  </li>
            <li>We use it in a large bedroom and it has plenty of capacity and runs for 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit petty, I know, so I certainly would not return it.</li>
            <li>Using EOs the fragrance travels, covers a large space and depending on the oil can smell in my upstairs bedroom.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want too large a unit</li>
            <li>It changes color, but has a setting that lets you freeze it on a certain color if you like.  </li>
            <li>Not designed for large areas</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful little essential oil diffuser, capable of scenting any room with your favorite oil and adding much needed moisture to dry air.</li>
            <li>Have used it nearly every day and it has work very consistently.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this diffuser the first three times I used it, but the fourth time I plugged it in, it totally quit working and automatically shuts itself off without working at all.</li>
            <li>Two of my cousins use the same style and brand and they&#x27;ve had theirs for over a year and a half and are still happy with theirs.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, I like the option for the lighting.&lt;br /&gt;The essential ouse diffuse very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use mine in a fairly large room, and the scent of the essential oil can easily be smelled across the room; after the diffuser has been on for several hours, the scent fills the room and even lightly permeates the downstairs area of my house.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the ZAQ Allay Litemist would do better for getting the mist higher due to</li>
            <li>, colors can be on or off, very quiet and diffuses fine mist.</li>
            <li>I only fill it halfway to the fill line with water, which allows me to use less oil and get more potent output.</li>
            <li>The only thing I do warn about is that unless you are trying to do a quick coverup of your stinky kitchen, perhaps only use 2 drops of oil and be sure to put the machine away from any food.  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the diffuser, it is very quiet, leaves a mild smell in the room, water will last about 3 to 3 1/2</li>
            <li>It has 4 different settings that switch by pressing the top down - off, misting on with light changing colors, misting on with color fixed and misting on with light off.</li>
            <li>It can really scent up a large room well.</li>
            <li>but does the job very well for a large bedroom.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and diffuses just the right amount of vapor and essential oils.</li>
            <li>Amazing little thing.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is an amazing product and every house should diffuse essential oils to purify and give a fragrance instead of buying chemicals to mask the smell.</li>
            <li>Purchase a variety of concentrated oils and you are ready to enjoy a bit of the outdoors in your enclosed and possibly stuffy room.</li>
            <li>You can choose the settings of either light color changing, light color staying, and no light.</li>
            <li>I used to burn incense a lot because I enjoy the exotic and complex smells until I began learning about its harmful side effects.</li>
            <li>Works great just wish there was a no light, mist only settling.</li>
            <li>Very upsetting.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work really well</li>
            <li>This diffuser works very well for my family.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast service, and well packaged.</li>
            <li>When press &#x27;ON&#x27;, the light came up for a second as if it was going to start.</li>
            <li>They like it so much that I am considering getting one for myself.</li>
            <li>She does wish she could turn the light off entirely at times while it is diffusing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started turning on the diffuser while I sit in bed reading/watching TV, then turn it off when I&#x27;m ready to sleep.</li>
            <li>The unit will only sporadically let me change the light setting to the night setting</li>
            <li>It is so wonderful to diffuse scents (like eucalyptus when you have a cold).</li>
            <li>wife really really loves this thing.</li>
            <li>Diffuses the oil very well, the lights are relaxing but they don&#x27;t shut off.</li>
            <li>Fast startup, soothes the beast inside me, yeah</li>
            <li>I like the Dew so much that I take it into the bedroom at night to diffuse lavender, chamomile, and clary sage... or sandalwood, bergamot, and ylang ylang.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this model...</li>
            <li>And I really like how it starts diffusing as soon</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Does the job and works really well, just turn it on, sleep</li>
            <li>So much so, in fact, that I purchased the ZAQ Mirage for my den/family room.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this product again, and Bombay Electronics is a very speedy, quality packaged shipper.</li>
            <li>and I cover the blue light on the button.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>Those are synthetic and just diminish the whole point of this unit in its entirety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I thought it would need to be filled constantly.</li>
            <li>I really like that the cord comes out from the bottom(ish).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit!</li>
            <li>Not too much mist</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>There are diffusers for 3x as much money</li>
            <li>The design is sleek and modern as well.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser works really well.</li>
            <li>Loaned it to a friend so really miss it</li>
            <li>Very calming lights.</li>
            <li>Very aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>My advice is not to get curious and take the top off while it&#x27;s running.</li>
            <li>It really does look that way.</li>
            <li>It really does look that way.</li>
            <li>Push the button to start it and a brief flash of light, then nothing.  </li>

            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really humidify, which I didn&#x27;t want -- I just wanted the aromatherapy benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this unit.  </li>
            <li>(My whole downstairs in townhouse).</li>
            <li>the colored lights are very relaxing to watch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a modern design would make it a neat addition to any room.</li>
            <li>The changing colors are very soothing.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Really like this diffuser</li>
            <li>It creates a soothing atmosphere whether you allow the lights to switch or press the switch to keep a solid light.</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.</li>
            <li>It also automatically shuts off when the blend runs out, and I really like that feature.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so incredibly fast</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like my diffuser.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY suggest this diffuser!</li>
            <li>so this definitely should have filled the air.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to</li>
            <li>* 3rd press turns the light off&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Very stable shape, will not fall over</li>
            <li>There still is an internal light glowing.</li>
            <li>thanks from squareprint.com</li>
            <li>One feature I love is that it turns off automatically when it&#x27;s empty.  </li>
            <li>The colors are neat too, but really I don&#x27;t look at it that much.</li>
            <li>It really moves the aromatherapy oil around the room.</li>
            <li>Works very well -</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>When I took it out of the packaging, which I have to say was very wasteful (</li>
            <li>and I find falling asleep to be so much easier than it&#x27;s ever been before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I hadn&#x27;t really considered adding a misting diffuser to the mix.</li>
            <li>For the price of the diffuser I expected it to perform much better than its counterparts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and modern.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I have it in my bathroom and turn it on when I take a bath or in the morning when I get ready for work.  </li>
            <li>I like the colors and the way it looks and the mist is very soothing.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>If you press the button once to turn it on it goes through the different light colors in rotation.  </li>
            <li>It also compliment as a night light, the different lights changes as you turn it on</li>
            <li>This diffuser is ready to go as soon as you take it out of the box.</li>
            <li>The more drops you add, the stronger the smell so be careful.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for aromatherapy!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t disperse the scent as much as I would like</li>
            <li>As for the colors, my kids (ages 4 and 2) really like to watch the vapor come out of the &amp;#34;rainbow mister&amp;#34;. ^_^</li>
            <li>Only use at night so far to breath better and it has worked.  </li>
            <li>A larger unit would be nice but definitely NOT a deal breaker!!</li>
            <li>I used it frequently, but always made sure I cleaned it and took care of it since I wanted it to last a while.</li>
            <li>However, anyone working with essential oils knows how potent these condensed natural products are.</li>
            <li>Only have had it a week but love it so far</li>
            <li>It runs forever on a small amount of water, the lights are soothing and interesting in dim lighting, and the lid is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it is a very nice product - I only wish that the company would have included tiny samples of essential oils to experiment with.  </li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser as I am new to EOs.  </li>
            <li>If you use it during the day you can also keep it on one of the other fun settings with the rotating light.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle sound of trickling/bubbling that you hear as it does its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it compare to the prices at other sites</li>
            <li>Much better than some other diffusers I have had.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for other rooms.</li>
            <li>I originally wanted a natural-like smell source and the commercial solutions were just not hitting the mark.</li>
            <li>I can do it with one hand while having the grand baby in the other arm.</li>
            <li>I love that it shuts off when it is empty!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the length of time this unit runs; unlike other reviewers, mine will run for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use: I mean, really really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Wish the chamber was bigger to last longer, and the motor was more quiet but otherwise just fine.</li>
            <li>This diffuser holds a good amount of water, on average a &amp;#34;full tank&amp;#34; would last six hours.</li>
            <li>Really good looking, yet subtle.</li>
            <li>how amazing this little thing is!</li>
            <li>In a completely dark room, the backlight from the button does glow brightly and adds a soft glow to the inside of the cone, so when it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s never completely dark.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that instead of wasting at least 30 drops of oil a day in the oil burners, I can use a total of about 15 drops, at most, in a day and really and truly smell it throughout my home.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing it holds about about 8 ounces, runs for about 4 hours and has various light settings.</li>
            <li>I think the price is slightly too much, but otherwise, love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to non-natural colognes and perfumes but happily used essential oils for decades, but usually with a candle warmer, and honestly, even that little bit of smoke bothers my sinuses.  </li>
            <li>Last eight hours, makes my room full of smell with my doterra oils and like the amount of vapor that makes.</li>
            <li>but I liked it while it worked :-/</li>
            <li>~ I think it&#x27;s really cool to have the option of different settings for color.</li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised that it really doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think this product would be effective in a small bathroom or office.  </li>
            <li>Buyers considering this product will need to also purchase an essential oil to get the full benefit of the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lighting is soft &amp; pretty.  </li>
            <li>I love that it only takes 4-5 drop of my very expensive essential oil to fill a room with a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think the unit itself is fine, the adapter is a piece of junk with loose wiring inside.</li>
            <li>I think the unit itself is fine, the adapter is a piece of junk with loose wiring inside.</li>
            <li>I just rinse it out with water and wipe it out with a tissue and it is ready for some new oil.</li>
            <li>own very limited experience has taught me that less is more when using essential oils.  </li>
            <li>No humming or motor sound at all - the Daisy on the other hand does have a slight sound to it which is notable especially at night in interval mode.</li>
            <li>This depends upon the oils used, but generally speaking, I don&#x27;t even smell the oils unless I am right over the unit.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is lightweight and easy to pick up and carry into the bathroom or kitchen to pour out any remaining water, too, so it&#x27;s not a real pain to take care of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The diffuser is lightweight and easy to pick up and carry into the bathroom or kitchen to pour out any remaining water, too, so it&#x27;s not a real pain to take care of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>smell of the oils (don&#x27;t forget to add distilled water like I almost forgot to) easily permeates the room when the door is closed.</li>
            <li>I alleviated this by spray painting the dome with a black spray paint and covering the button with a felt pad.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and have to have your room pitch black to sleep, you won&#x27;t be able to diffuse this in your room at night - it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband at all</li>
            <li>I would love to get another one in the future for different areas of my home.</li>
            <li>and I love how it cycles through different colors and automatically shuts off when the water level runs low.</li>
            <li>looks decent too.</li>
            <li>Super quiet as it promised(ultrasonic).</li>
            <li>I love the design and wish they had one in a bigger size, same design.</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted a diffuser because I have health issues</li>
            <li>The ZAQ Dew Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser is a fun, modern way to eliminate the odors in your home.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super simple to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, shuts off when it&#x27;s empty, the color choices are nice or none if one chooses.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s quiet, and the glow of the light is soft and</li>
            <li>I took a Saturday and researched all the different diffusers out there and finally settled with the ZAQ after seeing how many were purchased and</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has such a low profile shape.</li>
            <li>I love how it is small and pretty.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the model I have is newer or older.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an older home, &amp; review is based on use in the Master Bedroom of the home.</li>
            <li>I kept it only because of the hassle of returns, &amp; the fact that it does a bit better in a much smaller room.</li>
            <li>It does put out a smaller stream of vapor, but in a smaller room it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Press it again, the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, but you have a soft blue glow from the button.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this particular diffuser.</li>
            <li>The Dew diffuser is very pretty, quiet and efficient!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple to use and very pretty when changing colors.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser, however the no color part is not true.  </li>
            <li>The sleek European design is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money, it&#x27;s small and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have two of them and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>i woudl recomment this one highly..</li>
            <li>High quality product however</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend using their oils in this ZAQ diffuser.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I do use ONLY Distilled water in it because I don&#x27;t want to take a chance that our water will make it corrode, and so far it&#x27;s been a good decision especially since it&#x27;s going almost constantly</li>
            <li>have a very large living room and the scent wafts gently through the entire room, drifting a bit into my foyer and my dining room.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried too many other diffusers, but so far I feel I can highly recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li>So unless you have a very small room area (like a bathroom), or are sitting within a 4 ft range, you really wouldn&#x27;t get the benefits a nicely scented home.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t really scent the whole room, so you won&#x27;t really get the full effects unless you are 20 ft. or less away from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We all love this little gem.  </li>
            <li>Really love this little unit.</li>
            <li>: The unit I bought is pure white, and no color is evident until you turn it on.</li>
            <li>This works very well as an aroma diffuser and the color cycling is slow enough not to be pleasant and not annoying, unlike some other products I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t sleep in a room that isn&#x27;t dark, so that is a huge bummer, because I really like the look of the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a setting for minimal light.  </li>
            <li>Great product...just a bit expensive.</li>
            <li>I clean it up and dry it well about once a month with water.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it with Plantlife&#x27;s Study Buddy or Calm essential oil blends for an office space use like I&#x27;ve chosen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this diffuser has such good reviews?</li>
            <li>I have tried 4 different diffusers so far and this is my second favorite...</li>
            <li>sure how long it will last, we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase a few more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t quite believe that 3-5 drops would be enough, but the old adage of less-is-more is true in this case.</li>
            <li>I also have to use double the amount of drops to get the same effect as my favorite brand : Young Living.</li>
            <li>the one concern that I&#x27;ve had about the ZAQ Dew is that it will take 6-7 hours to completely use up the tiny amount of water that it holds, and since it says that it lasts between 3-4 hours, I felt that I must not be getting the proper amount of mist coming out of it...and the one thing I do notice with the Allay is that I do get better misting out of it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Zaq Dew for a few weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li>Not too big, and the lighting options are fun and add evening, hygge-style ambiance in the living room where I have it set up.</li>
            <li>I want it for my office,so I want to make sure the cord is long enough for it to sit on my desk.</li>
            <li>and I think it works better than the more expensive Young Living one.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>The true test will be to see how long it lasts!  </li>
            <li>I really only smell it when I&#x27;m sitting right nearby.  </li>
            <li>You must stand right next to it to smell the oil.</li>
            <li>Sent it right back and got a refund.</li>
            <li>There was literally no scent unless you stood right next to the unit and bent over and smelled the steam coming out, and even that was scant.  </li>
            <li>I have it sitting right next to my bed.</li>
            <li>Was becoming noisy and less efficient every day.</li>
            <li>I filled the reservoir to the fill line, added a few drops of essential oil, pressed the on button and instantly a mist started coming out of the top.  </li>
            <li>So quiet and sends out the mist of essential oil just fine.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it would not last long, but so far, I’ve been able to get over 7 hours for each use.</li>
            <li>I will increase my rating further if it proves longer lasting than the first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the color setting as I think it&#x27;s pretty cheesy, but it&#x27;s there if my toddler wants to watch the colors change, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>it is nice and quiet with just a little water noise but it has been soothing to me and my kids.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised by this cute little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the directions it will stay like new for a while, I have had mine about a year with no issues.</li>
            <li>Going to try new brand.</li>
            <li>Then when I need to I can just add new scents.  </li>
            <li>The company, Bombay Electronics did respond to emails about the adapter and promptly sent a new one in the mail.</li>
            <li>The company, Bombay Electronics did respond to emails about the adapter and promptly sent a new one in the mail.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>Called Amazon and received a new one.  </li>
            <li>other than that it has a nice light mist that comes out and last a few hours before needing a refill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not obtrusive and you have the option of changing lights, keeping it at a particular color or turning the color off completely.</li>
            <li>The main difference between the two models, as far as I can tell, is that the Mirage holds 2x the water.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to purchase one for my daughter and since this one wasn&#x27;t available, I chose the taller ZAQ Allay diffuser in blue for her, which would have been my second choice, so I may even try one of those as well in my house since I am thinking that I should purchase a second one so that I&#x27;m not moving mine from the bedroom to the living / dining area a couple times a day, it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it would be nice to just leave them where they are....</li>
            <li>I usually have it on the first setting which allows the LED light to change colors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using this diffuser in a studio apartment and if fills the room (about 400 sq feet) with a light fragrance with ~5 drops of (undiluted) essential oil.</li>
            <li>Filled my entire house (or shut the door and get extra benefit without house diffusion!</li>
            <li>I love citrus and lemon scents when I need a mood lift, and it is lovely to disperse eucalyptus/peppermint oil in the bedroom when my kids have a chest cold.</li>
            <li>essential oils are gonna be the new fad!!!</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this little thing!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this little thing!</li>
            <li>I really love this little oil diffuser!</li>
            <li>The reed diffuser technique works, but the scent doesn&#x27;t travel very far within the room, which is a bummer.</li>
            <li>The reason that I gave it four stars is it doesn&#x27;t seem powerful enough to diffuse properly in bigger rooms like my large master bedroom.</li>
            <li>The first few times I ran the diffuser I set it on the kitchen table and, while eating a quick snack, I found myself being a bit overwhelmed by the scent.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is easy to set up, and works right out of the box in less than 3 minutes (I had to get some distilled water because our tab water is a little mineral rich).&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews already explained the different colored light settings.</li>
            <li>This little gadget is wonderful, I have been a fan of essential oils for the past twelve years, you can change the feel of your space with just a few drops of warm desert vanilla or balsam fir or pine, this is small and intimate enough for a night stand, this will not take up more space than necessary and it glows the prettiest soft color.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, although we usually just use the deep night blue constant light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time essential oil diffuser and this one is</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m really not sure off the top of my head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The diffuser has a larger footprint than my other diffuser, but the mist is considerably more noticeable and circulates well within a 15 foot radius.</li>
            <li>initially grew interested in a diffuser because we wanted to diffuse lavender in our daughters bedroom to help her sleep.</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure that if you have water to pour out that you don&#x27;t pour it over the spot that has the small one-inch slit.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a long time and totally worth it.</li>
            <li>so it would run longer and it does make a small room smell lovely.</li>
            <li>Many other reviewers have mentioned this issue, I wish I had paid attention and ordered a different brand.</li>
            <li>It has completely exceeded my expectation!</li>
            <li>This is my first essential oil diffuser</li>
            <li>Simple to use and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is such a pretty diffuser ...</li>
            <li>Not to mention after being plugged in for several hours the unit is sometimes hot to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more to say than &amp;#34;I love it,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>We use this diffuser nearly every day!</li>
            <li>It also emits a larger amount of vapor per second, so it&#x27;s better for a larger room.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, 1 month later, after consistent use, the power button no longer works at all.</li>
            <li>Currently, this diffuser seems to be hard to get, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because it has been more in demand right now or what,</li>
            <li>I do like that it has multiple colors and 4 settings and that if you want to let it continue changing colors it will or if you want to set it on a certain color you can or a very low light bluish color, that&#x27;s possible too.</li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t normally be a big deal, but I have it in our bedroom and love to run it most of the night and the light is annoying.  </li>
            <li>This WAS fantastic but it lasted less than 3 months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure of their therapeutic benefits, but I like being able to scent my home with something natural that won&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li>In the winter, this comes in handy to add moisture back to small rooms.</li>
            <li>I started using essential oils from NYR because their prices are very low and their oils are of better quality than some of the supposedly \\&quot;therapeutic grade\\&quot; out there (which is a made-up certification and doesn&#x27;t actually mean it&#x27;s safe to ingest the oil!!).&lt;br /&gt;3-4 drops of Essential oils lasts about 2 hours!</li>
            <li>the diffuser works extremely well scent-wise, and the fact that the diffuser continuously changes color is really cool looking.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use tap water, just filtered water and make sure to dry it out when it runs empty.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is I wish it was strong enough to make the entire room smell fragrant.  </li>
            <li>The mist lasts for several hours and the fragrance seems to spread throughout a fairly large room.</li>
            <li>I have it in a large bedroom and it gave the entire room</li>
            <li>Fast forward to the ZAQ Dew Litemist… I just received this product today, and not only was it super simple to use, but the effect of the essential oil scent dispersing into the room was IMMEDIATE!</li>
            <li>If filled to the max capacity it can operate for a little over 4 hours.</li>
            <li>, blue is my personal preference, they also come in Orange and Pink, but Blue is so calming, I love it!</li>
            <li>This little diffuser works magic when it comes to aroma therapy with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Love this little thing!!  </li>
            <li>In fact, the photo looks cheesy, but the unit itself, though lightweight, is attractively and simply designed.</li>
            <li>so I can clear my chrakas at night.</li>
            <li>I use eucalyptus and peppermint oil to clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, I cannot return it.  </li>
            <li>It is very very quiet and the lights are very calming.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>and no signs of any problems so far.</li>
            <li>so far I have 20 hrs on it.</li>
            <li>It does dim</li>
            <li>I emailed directly to the  company web site (not through Amazon)  </li>
            <li>it don&#x27;t take up much space its silent.</li>
            <li>It auto-offs after it runs out of water--filled completely up</li>
            <li>For $50 it should last much much longer.</li>
            <li>Then you just wipe it out with a soft cloth.</li>
            <li>Then you just wipe it out with a soft cloth.</li>
            <li>I have tried several times since then to turn it back on, and it will light up when the button is pressed but never actually comes on.</li>
            <li>However, once in a while, I do crave for something to awaken my senses, just something natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Also, the color changing aspect just fascinates my five year old son.</li>
            <li>I have it setting directly on my wood nightstand with no problems.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is not over powering but instead soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much space and runs quietly</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>As far as coverage goes-</li>
            <li>admittedly thought this looked really strange when I first unpackaged it</li>
            <li>Wow,, all that goodness in one inexpensive bottle.  </li>
            <li>that were the young brand.  </li>
            <li>My feeling is, because of the build-up that can happen from use over time, the machine will last much longer if distilled water is used in it.</li>
            <li>Update: The company has sent me a replacement unit that is working well so far.  </li>
            <li>I fill it every morning, but have to refill it at least one more time before the work day is over.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to note it didn&#x27;t come with any oils.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really matter for functionality, but if you are buying it because of the look as well as for what it does you may get something different than pictured.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>I purchased a different oil diffuser through DoTerra and it consumed so much oil</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t had any problems with them thus far.</li>
            <li>The ZAQ Dew LiteMist Aromatherapy EO Diffuser is really the only diffuser I wanted!  </li>
            <li>Diffuses oils very well and is very simple to use.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it almost every night for about 3 weeks and have had no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>This is quiet and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It a lite mist and really does the job of releasing your essential oil into the air.</li>
            <li>So far this has met my expectations.</li>
            <li>You can turn the Dew LiteMist on, leave for the day and come home to a wonderfully, naturally scented home.</li>
            <li>almost like a white Hershey&#x27;s Kiss on your table, haha.</li>
            <li>really just blue mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It appears as though power is getting as far as the LEDs, but not further.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a cool mist diffuser so can be used for therapeutic essential oils (hot air ones destroy the healthful properties of therapeutic EO&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>So 80ml more of water and a few drops of essential oils</li>
            <li>I read quite a few reviews on different products prior to deciding on your product and this had a good rating by users, which ultimately helped me to decide on the purchase.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a great experience for at least a few hours.</li>
            <li>Maybe the worse part is that it&#x27;s kind of flimsy plastic, so</li>
            <li>The only down side is that the product claims that you can turn the light off, however, even in the &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; mode there is a dim blue light (and not just the power button) that stays on as long as the diffuser is</li>
            <li>This product seemed a little overpriced and had maybe one sour review when I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li>The mist is just right for using it at your desk or workspace (where mine is set up), but I don&#x27;t know about it filling up a larger space(anything bigger than a bedroom?).</li>
            <li>I bought this because the price was right compared to some of the more expensive ones on the market.</li>
            <li>It states it has a no light setting, but the blue on light is almost brighter than the other light.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like at first was that when you select the mode to turn off the color lights, it still has a dim blue light on from the on/off button, but after a few nights we got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting to get another one for my house as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use; just take off the lid, and put in a small amount of water and 5 drops of oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact design however (approximately 7\\&quot; wide - 4\\&quot; high) makes it fairly unobtrusive and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t timed how long they last on one fill, but since the ZAQ emits a greater volume of vapor per second, I would assume that it would last a shorter time between fills.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the fact that the lights can be stopped on a specific color, or completely turned off if you wish.  </li>
            <li>Love this diffuser, just add a couple drops of oil (a little goes a long way) -</li>
            <li>The fine mist it puts out is just enough, especially when the air is dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for 5 weeks, and took very gentle care of it (only filling water to the max fill line, using purified water, etc).</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it very much since I got it, but the few times I have it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser, it puts out just enough mist to scent a small area.</li>
            <li>and the entire main part of our home fills with the smell of whatever I&#x27;ve got in there.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>The only down side is the sound they make and that is the reason why the 4 and not 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>I think it might be a tad overpriced (hence the 4 stars), but other people may feel that the price is exactly right.</li>
            <li>so I only ever use the last setting (quiet with low light) and it does not keep me awake or distract me, if anything it helps me fall asleep faster.</li>
            <li>Resist parsimony and get high quality essential oils.</li>
            <li>If you like using essential oils around your home, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really lightweight and does not overheat no matter how long it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is an oil for almost everything for skin,to ingest, to diffuse, I suggest you check it out they have been used long before modern counterparts.</li>
            <li>would recommend this diffuser and really hope it lasts a long time, and that my issue with it turning on is just a quirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this takes up as much space as if I&#x27;d stretched my fingers out and traced around the tips to form a circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>light broke almost immediately....and has small capacity..n</li>
            <li>but it also really depends on the oil you are using and how long you have it turned on.</li>
            <li>The top part of the Diffuser changes color, green, blue and several others.</li>
            <li>It is just so baffling to me why this has such good reviews when it has such a poor performance quality.  </li>
            <li>on here tonight buying a 2nd one because when our kids are sick at the same time we&#x27;d like a diffuser for each room.&lt;br /&gt;Its very easy to use; pretty much remove the top, fill water to the line, drop in a few drops of oils and plug it in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just put regular ol&#x27; tap water in the reservoir, four drops of some PURE essential oils of my choice (ones that don&#x27;t have carrier oils in it &#x27;cause that will clog the machine), and then I just turn it on!</li>
            <li>(we run it probably 4-8 hours daily since Christmas, so about a month), and haven&#x27;t seen any &#x27;smell&#x27; hangover from previous oils, they pretty much evaporate out with each use.</li>
            <li>(if I can) and replacing it with another Allay, the Allay is taller as well, narrower at the base, but much more appealing in the long run, I didn&#x27;t really expect to change my mind on this</li>
            <li>For that price, I believe it should have lasted at least a full year!</li>
            <li>We live in a very open concept home</li>
            <li>I am currently using Lavender for its calming effect, Peppermint and Eucalyptus because I am almost always stuffy they are both very beneficial when you are feeling cold/flu symptoms as well as promoting overall relaxation.</li>
            <li>The ability to change the light from one color to several alternating colors to no light at all makes it quite versatile.</li>
            <li>When I think of what I paid for this, it&#x27;s barely worth half its price.</li>
            <li>I put ten drops of essential oil in (the pamphlet suggests up to 5) and it&#x27;s scenting my room very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek, about six inches in diameter, silent, and has several settings: you can have gentle lights changing colors, or set it to one color or opt for no lights.</li>
            <li>but I generally move it all over the house!</li>
            <li>It would deserve a 5 if it actually got dark, but even with the colored light off, it glows brightly blue through the cone from the on/off switch.</li>
            <li>I have primarily used with doTerra Wild Orange essential oil but also with Nature&#x27;s Sunshine Eucalyptus, and it worked equally well with each, so I feel like it will also work well with any other essential oil.</li>
            <li>I love it as it requires only a drop of essential oil to perfume a small room for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>On the negative side, even when the lights are off, you can still plainly see it because the power button is lit brightly.</li>
            <li>Its super easy to use, not one complaint from me!!!</li>
            <li>This is a sweet little diffuser!</li>
            <li>For a more subtle scent, use 1-3 drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li>I use mine mainly as a candle replacement; so I recommend picking Essential Oils from aroma specific companies.</li>
            <li>Only use filtered clean water (I don&#x27;t use direct from the trap) and don&#x27;t overfill past the line.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this one is when you choose the option no light it still puts off a bright glow that makes it hard for me to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>--you may notice a small bubbling watering sound if it is very quiet in the room you are in, but this is relaxing in itself and not distracting.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if the light would actually turn off, but it doesn&#x27;t; the off light is a deep blue and unfortunately it keeps me awake</li>
            <li>Mist, color changes and sound help an anxious teen relax and sleep well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instructions were clear and simple.</li>
            <li>diffuser comes with a plastic measuring cup for the water that&#x27;s marked with milliliters on both sides (no English measurements).</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it puts out a soft, quiet diffusion.</li>
            <li>natural plant oils can actually eat away at rubber and plastic.</li>
            <li>I received this item on October 10th and it completely stopped working on October 13th.</li>
            <li>no wet surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you, like me, tend to be sensitive to fragrances, order the basic scents like peppermint, lavender, cinnamon or citrus to start with.</li>
            <li>One final press of the button turns the unit off completely.  </li>
            <li>Add a few drops of essential oil or a blend, press the button, and vapor immediately begins to float from the spout and dispenses into the room quickly</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just the right size, and no sound to bother my coworkers.</li>
            <li>I had a few friends over right after I got the diffuser</li>
            <li>The design seems less intrusive than the taller ones I was looking at and looks pretty</li>
            <li>my only complaint would be the light doesn&#x27;t dim enough.</li>
            <li>It does have a light blue light tho while its running no matter what, so that can be annoying for someone who needs absolute darkness to sleep,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I wanted another one of these and they have been hard to come by lately, I decided to purchase the ZAQ Allay diffuser in Blue, which is a very soothing color blue, I love it!</li>
            <li>Its very pretty but its so small it doesnt even diffuse an hour.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold much water compared to other diffusers.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that there&#x27;s a setting on the diffuser that&#x27;s described as &#x27;diffuser on, light off&#x27; ...</li>
            <li>Only complaint is why do they al have to light up?</li>
            <li>A coworker of mine spent twice as much on her &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; brand diffuser and hers just recently broke.</li>
            <li>We have pretty hard water where I live</li>
            <li>do wish the vapor floated up a little higher because I keep it on a side table</li>
            <li>first I thought this might be a little</li>
            <li>the setting where you can turn the light off and have the diffuser running still lets off enough light in our bedroom that it makes it difficult to sleep if you need a pitch black room.</li>
            <li>They are written in such poor English that one can only conclude it was originally written in a different language and then in an effort to save money, they used Google Translator instead of hiring a real live person.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This sits low, so tipping is not at all a problem, as with other taller ones on this website (although I also bought a much taller one, which works just a well, with no issues of tipping...</li>
            <li>: They take a long time to heat up and emit an aroma; They use a lot of oil in comparison to a diffuser; The tea-light candles make me nervous around my 5-yr old and two cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been running it for a solid hour and the water level seems to have barely budged</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been running it for a solid hour and the water level seems to have barely budged</li>
            <li>I could barely smell it until I got closer to the table which was literally only 5 feet away.  </li>
            <li>Even in natural oils, I find my sinuses don&#x27;t like overly flowery scents for long and they rebel at anything musky.</li>
            <li>This is an exact diffuser product I had at work that is a replacement, because it was misplaced.</li>
            <li>Lately, I’ve stumbled upon essential oils and added a few drops to jojoba oil to make a nice scent for my hands, but I’ve been at a loss on how to scent</li>
            <li>Small, sleek, and fun change of colors.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting one from the grocery store if they are going to break down this fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but when in use, it seems like the &#x27;mist&#x27; only stays right around the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>; not exposed metal subject to corrosion, so I expect this useful device will last long enough for me not to feel cheated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting into using essential oils for making my own cleaning and personal care products slowly over the past couple of years</li>
            <li>It fills up a small room with the fragrance easily, but in a large room is a bit of a waste if you are not right next to it.</li>
            <li>The actual diffuser is small enough that I have it set up on right on my desk.</li>
            <li>The colors range from turquoise to deep blue, light and dark green, and red.</li>
            <li>mixture is very helpful for that, so I put 2 drops of each in my diffuser and have that going as I write this, but I switch them out and change them for whatever I feel I need at the time, whether it&#x27;s oils that help me sleep better at night or oils that help rejuvenate me or oils that help keep us from getting sick, or oils that help with depression, whatever the need may be at the time, but I do use this particularly for my health and find it to be extremely helpful</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and some scents are better in small doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of receiving the brand of item I expected, I received some cheap knockoff that that I could have purchased at other retailers for almost half the price.</li>
            <li>I actually read a bad review on another diffuser from Bombay Electronics, which was later given a good review because Bombay reached out to the reviewer and replaced the faulty product.</li>

            <li> I think it runs a good 5-6 hours on one fill up of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found a lot of information saying that oils aren&#x27;t good for cats.  </li>

            <li> The color choices are gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna have this in a bedroom at night, it could be a good night-light.</li>

            <li> Love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li> Very bright light, even when it&#x27;s in the darkest setting.</li>
            <li> However, even when the light function is turned off it is very bright at night.</li>
            <li> I take very good care of my things and this is important when you spend $50 on an item like this.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> , I am very pleased with it.  </li>

            <li> Very pleased with performance.  </li>
            <li> It works great, clove is my go to oil just because I love that holiday cooking smell.</li>
            <li> At under $50, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Dew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, all the features you expect from a product like this and more.</li>
            <li> the air is most welcome</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very pleased with it too.</li>
            <li> The scent fills the great room space and when I use at bedtime, it has helped me sleep better too.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> It has 3 settings for lights, but when you turn off the diffuser is still kind of bright.</li>
            <li> This has been a great diffuser for all my favorite oils.  </li>
            <li> The color changing is nice but not too bright - makes for a nice nightlight in our sons room.</li>

            <li> LOVE and bought some as gifts!</li>
            <li> Really, great, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is great quality and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> The ZAQ Dew LiteMist Diffuser is easy to use and works great.  </li>
            <li> It easily covers the area, and makes my living space smell great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a proven fact, you feel better with pleasant smells in the air.</li>
            <li> Lavender works great and the ZAG puts out a fine mist, filling the room with your scent.</li>
            <li> and my room smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It would make a great night light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This really would be an ideal gift for someone, I know my daughter sure is happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used it almost nonstop during the day each day and it is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> and I am happy that I can enjoy the fragrances without harming my health, but instead improving it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and bought it to use lavender to help me sleep and it works great</li>
            <li> We are happy with the diffuser and enjoy using it often.</li>
            <li> affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> Makes house smell nice and adds a nice energy too.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and is very beautiful with the color changing lights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size</li>
            <li> and it runs out sometime over night and shuts off on its own.  </li>
            <li> I was loving it</li>
            <li> it turns off on its own.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this product when it was functioning.</li>
            <li> This one is nice that you dilute the oils in water</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great well-designed product!</li>
            <li> This product is really nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent defuser works really well</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting that.</li>
            <li> This machine is very calming and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> this is a nice option.</li>
            <li> The auto-shut off is also a really nice</li>
            <li> :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes a nice burbling noise and effectively diffuses scents.</li>
            <li> these attractive Diffusers couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> , this diffuser solved that problem and solved it handily.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> The color changing option is nice.  </li>
            <li> nice size and looks decorative.</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on how my house always has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I liked that one of NAN&#x27;s oils is for attention/concentration.</li>
            <li> It went off on its own</li>
            <li> Thank you for the wonderful product (which was on sale) and for the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> but you must supply your own oils.  </li>
            <li> Mirage does not come with a handy filling container, that would have been nice, but livable without it.  </li>
            <li> And to be honest, I don&#x27;t feel like doing that for 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> , looks nice and operates for 4 hours non-stop.</li>
            <li> It puts out quite a nice vapor.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Still a good value, but with a lower price it would be a better value to</li>
            <li> We now keep it in the living room and it&#x27;s a nice smell to anyone entering our apartment.</li>
            <li> This is actually really nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice to keep by a desk with some lavender oil.</li>
            <li> The changing colors are nice.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it lit up and had the options to change colors.</li>
            <li> The color-changing that it goes through has a nice soothing affect as well</li>
            <li> I own 5 diffusers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice claim colors and auto turns off if you have it during the night</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own when the oil and water mix runs out.</li>
            <li> I received my diffuser really fast, I&#x27;m impressed!  </li>
            <li> Looks nice, diffuses well for one room.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind out there.</li>
            <li> But you wouldn&#x27;t want to put it on nice furniture without some type of cloth beneath it because the vapor sometimes finds it&#x27;s way to the table and leaves a damp ring around it.    </li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s so easy to use, the mist is beautiful abd</li>
            <li> Very easy to control and sexy and sleek, THNAKS!</li>
            <li> easy operation and effective!</li>
            <li> Cool and sleek looking, quitet, perfect amount of steam, lots of light variations to choose from.  </li>
            <li> This is a beautiful diffuser, I love the shape and the light that you can turn on or off at your pleasure.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use and has a  nice design.  </li>
            <li> I have been using oil blends from Edens Gardens, one of my favorites is Joy, which contains bergamot, geranium,  jasmine, lemon, mandarin, palmarosa, chamomile, rose,rosewood, sweet orange and ylang ylang.  </li>
            <li> AND.... the colors are very cool to watch too!</li>
            <li> The diffuser has worked perfectly since the new adaptor.</li>
            <li> The diffuser has worked perfectly since the new adaptor.</li>
            <li> The light is kind of bright -</li>
            <li> and that makes me SUPER happy.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, I didn&#x27;t even need the manual to figure out how to work it.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to understand</li>
            <li> The ZAQ is very easy to refill.</li>
            <li> Very easy to operate,</li>
            <li> I sleep better and my room smells amazing.</li>
            <li> ~ kind of reminds me of a genie bottle:)</li>
            <li> This is the one that works (so far) the best.  </li>
            <li> Even turning the lights off, one light remains too bright for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> I also bought KLS Natural set of 100% aromatherapy oils from Amazon and am very happy with them.  </li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to be able to review this one.</li>
            <li> Use this almost every day and have had many comments from visitors as to how nice my house smells.  </li>
            <li> the light was too bright</li>
            <li> we just love it and we already had another kind.  </li>
            <li> So far, we have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The issue is that the button has a light around it and it still stays on so it isn&#x27;t really a good diffuser for the bedroom, which is what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> I found that one smelled pretty good and any oils without carrier oils will work good with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item, very relaxing and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The mist is very, very fine.</li>
            <li> Is affordable and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and reliably does the job!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li> Very nice worth every $$$.</li>
            <li> All the color chooses are a nice touch and the mist goes straight up into the air, works great.</li>
            <li> But overall it runs great, never leaks, and looks great.</li>
            <li> The great feature that allows you to turn off the light was one of the reasons I purchased this diffuser, although it&#x27;s important to know that the backlight for the button never turns off, so even when the cone is not lit, the button is.</li>
            <li> Okay, do it once: but make sure you have a paper towel handy.</li>
            <li> I thought I read somewhere on another review that it takes a minute to warm up kind of thing, but that doesn&#x27;t sound like it happens with everyone.  </li>
            <li> Together with the excellent brand of Essential Oil that I&#x27;m using in the infuser, I am thrilled with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> The lights are bright and kind of fun.</li>
            <li> This product works really well and has a beautiful sleek design.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend dumping a bottle of cologne into this, though; make sure that what you use is suitable for use in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend dumping a bottle of cologne into this, though; make sure that what you use is suitable for use in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Even though it is plastic it doesn&#x27;t look cheap and we are very pleased with this product and with this brand.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use , my entire room smells delightful.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use/clean, just wish the wonderful scent would last longer!  </li>
            <li> Love this &amp; easy to use!</li>
            <li> The colors on it are super bright, too.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Super good purchase.</li>
            <li> But it is very nice a peaceful.</li>
            <li> A nice fine mist was coming out.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser; it puts out a good stream of mist and the changing colors are enjoyable!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried it with tangerine oil, which isn&#x27;t as potent (lung wise) as the other combo, but it fills up a room with a very pleasant scent and energizes me.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and looks special!</li>
            <li> This thing pumps volumes more mist and smell.</li>
            <li> While there are models that can operate for close to 8 hours they also tend to be way more</li>
            <li> I love how the colors change on this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about buying a diffuser at first, but chose this one because it had the best reviews, it was pretty, and I didn&#x27;t see anything about not using citrus oils in it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> I love it and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Kids love it.</li>
            <li> Bought from Amazon at the end of October 2014, Love it</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t know any more progress.  </li>
            <li> We likes the product when it works and we would love to give more star.</li>
            <li> But since most of the time it does not work and contact after-service is quite a work out, we will need to give it a one star.  </li>
            <li> You have to experiment which essential oils you like best and which ones to use to cover</li>
            <li> I love this , however I wish it held more.</li>
            <li> The reservoir seems to hold enough water to run for about 5 hours or so which is perfect for me since I turn it in before bed</li>
            <li> I use mine around the clock, top quality.</li>
            <li> Love that it automatically shuts off</li>
            <li> I put it in my office and have gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> it had a better output.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and very quiet.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work better for what we would like to use it for - inconspicuous oil diffusing.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> My advice, look for another diffuser of better quality or know what your risks are.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I joke that it&#x27;s my magic genie/UFO transporter.  </li>
            <li> I love the product while it was working however, it stopped working after two months.</li>
            <li> Been working perfectly since I got it several months ago.</li>
            <li> I also love the rotating colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheerful!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> my favorite part of this item is that it turns off when its done.</li>
            <li> Puts out a nice light mist.  </li>
            <li> My favorite diffuser.  </li>
            <li> i love this diffuser and would recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> i plan to buy more for my kids rooms.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Purchased 1 and then 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I love that it automatically shuts off when the water is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started diffusing several hours before I go to bed so that my room still smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I love the changing lights.  </li>
            <li> I went on vacation and was able to take it with me.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I chose this diffuser.</li>
            <li> love putting my lavender in there to fill up the house&lt;</li>
            <li> Definitely the best of all difusers I tried.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Peppermint and lavender are wonderful to get rid of a headache, too... but back to the review.</li>
            <li> My favorite are the purples.</li>
            <li> I ordered two more</li>
            <li> My favorite oil to pair it with is Edens Garden &amp;#34;four thieves&amp;#34; oil.</li>
            <li> Love its shape and the series of colors while it&#x27;s in use.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of a genie coming out of a bottle when the mist comes out the top.</li>
            <li> Love these diffusers.  </li>
            <li> The price is better than I have seen for some of the others on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I kinda wished it held more water and lasted longer</li>
            <li> When I saw this mist aromatherapy device and smell the scent was immediately in love with it.</li>
            <li> I like the colors, but I most appreciate the auto turn off on this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I use lavender and peppermint with rosemary to create a refreshing and uplifting aroma throughout the house...</li>
            <li> (3) the ZAQ has better mist output than the SmileyDaisy (4)</li>
            <li> Simple, but awesome!</li>
            <li> you will be able to see it.</li>
            <li> Love this machine.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li> It turns off automatically when it is done, which I love.  </li>
            <li> I am now learning more than I thought I would.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely, Mary Ann P.</li>
            <li> The entire room smelled great!</li>
            <li> The mister lasted several hours on one fill which impressed me since another brand diffuser</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love the sleekness of it</li>
            <li> but I knew I could get even more benefits from diffusing the oils in the air</li>
            <li> and it is still going in the morning which I love.</li>
            <li> presto! --  your house is smelling fantastic!  </li>
            <li> This diffuser would make a lovely gift.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It’s not overpowering at all, but a light scent kind of permeates the house.</li>
            <li> It has a great sleek and modern look.  </li>
            <li> Love this diffuser I use it in the bedroom for relaxation.</li>
            <li> pleased with the ZAO and compared to the Pearlessence&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> have a nice light / color feature</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my husband LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Love the idea of auto shut off..</li>
            <li> It really only covers a bedroom size area but that is where I use it so it is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews of this product and made the decision to buy it.</li>
            <li> so my daughter got this lovely diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love my Dew</li>
            <li> My favorite part about it is the lovely color changing mode and</li>
            <li> how elegant it looks.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of this product and it is silent, works so well to scent my home and best of all - has an automatic shut off when the water runs out!!  </li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> I love putting my EO in this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I am going to get some more oils now</li>
            <li> that I have such a wonderful Diffuser to use.</li>
            <li> When I reduced it to 2-drops, I really enjoyed the aromatherapy experience and my sleep</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m many years away from my college days</li>
            <li> wait until your favorite color shows up, then stop the color cycling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not designed to run without the cone-shaped top in place and there is NO leakage when it&#x27;s used as directed.</li>
            <li> I love how it changes colors.</li>
            <li> the better it</li>
            <li> Anyways, I am thoroughly enjoying the ZAQ Mirage.  </li>
            <li> I must say I do like the ease of use of the ZAQ Mirage better than the Samyo.  </li>
            <li> It might  get used once or twice a week, and probably hasn&#x27;t even been cleaned properly, but it lights up and spews the delightful aromas every time I turn it on.  </li>

            <li> and it does a wonderful job diffusing essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> really love it, and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser.</li>

            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve mostly used it with eucalyptus (for bronchitis that lingered) and peppermint (for the smell and for headache relief).</li>
            <li> I also love the automatIc shut off feature.</li>
            <li> I love watching the colors change, I find it so relaxing.</li>
            <li> And the BEST part is it starts working instantly!</li>
            <li> It is all that it is advertised to be and more.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t expound any more.  </li>
            <li> It is graceful looking, sleek and elegant.  </li>
            <li> Could have done a lot better than this....</li>
            <li> However, I just wished it produced a lot more vapor.</li>
            <li> and they sleep well, and wake up feeling much better.</li>
            <li> My kids love the color changes.</li>
            <li> It will shut off by itself when the water runs low which is a great tool to have!</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy some more of these for gifts.  </li>
            <li> Just okay.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and I love the color changes and the auto shut off</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite Amazon purchase of the year.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I discovered the wonderful world of essential oils and diffusers.</li>
            <li> Works great and is very calming.</li>
            <li> We LOVE it.</li>
            <li> The colors of the light are nice too.</li>
            <li> I love it, the color of the unit is relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are brighter and the aromas better.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love this and it runs almost every day in my kitchen.</li>
            <li> Silent, sleek and beautiful!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is my favorite way to dispense the oils.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use more oils with it.</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> and I love them both.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I like that we can set the light to change colors or at night there is an indigo light that can be on by the bedside, which is not too bright.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love how it changes colour.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known that before buying it because most of the time when I&#x27;ve used it has been at night when we have colds to help breathe easier.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it could be improved upon, and I&#x27;m certainly glad that Amazon has it 40% of the list price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks and love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent is lemongrass</li>
            <li> I bought it on the recommendation from backdoor survival website and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> But I love it.</li>
            <li> No complaints. :-)  </li>
            <li> I love the color changing options.  </li>
            <li> Turns on instantly and the oil creates a wonderful aroma throughout the house.</li>
            <li> Better than burning wax candles or artificial/chemical devices.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m more than 3 feet away from it, I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Really love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> And it is cute and sophisticated looking.</li>
            <li> Fantastic service!  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> I am going to buy a couple of more for our home.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love and recommend it.</li>
            <li> There are so many brands to choose from and many varying opinions in regard to how well they work.  </li>
            <li> Love this product....</li>
            <li> I love it and use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> Yes, I recommend this! :)</li>
            <li> months ago and have been 100% pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> Would buy again! :)</li>
            <li> I use this one non stop, wish it out out more humidity</li>
            <li> I would like to have given this 4.5 stars, but we&#x27;ll stick to 4!:-)</li>
            <li> Just lift the top off and fill it w water then the oil.</li>
            <li> I will probably order 1 or 2 more just to have a permanent spot in the kid&#x27;s rooms for a nighttime diffuser/nightlight.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> We love this diffuser and we are thinking of buying another.  </li>
            <li> so I received the same thing for Christmas and it has worked wonderfully for a month.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li> The deneve is better</li>
            <li> Absolutley love this product.</li>
            <li> Working better than expectation.</li>
            <li> and they work fine and provide the scent as I first experienced it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was very excited when it arrived, set it up per the instructions,  plugged it in, and..</li>
            <li> So far so good with this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> But, so far so good!</li>
            <li> super fun and a great way to help the unwinding process at the end of the day</li>
            <li> Filling it is easy: just take the plastic cone-shaped top off, pour water from the measuring cup into the diffuser, replace the top, and turn it on.</li>
            <li> ZAO has a very clean neat look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> The changing colors of the diffuser is soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love this, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to just lift the top funnel and fill the resevoir to the fill line</li>
            <li> This one adds moisture to dry air as well, which is especially great during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I love how it is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s attractive, super easy to use, and who doesn&#x27;t like the fun changing lights (optional if you don&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> I wish it emitted the scents more strongly.</li>
            <li> So far so great, and I am 100% satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> THANKS for the excellent service and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Overall this was a good purchase at a fair price and the design allows it to be placed anywhere.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The changing colors are a great feature - very soft and soothing colors.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and use, will buy another for my downstairs area.</li>
            <li> has worked great so far!</li>
            <li> I bought one for me &amp; also for my best friend to enjoy &amp; she loves hers too after a long day at work &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Mine looks just like the photo when it&#x27;s in operation, with a fine mist coming out of the top funnel.  </li>
            <li> Shortly thereafter, I received a beautiful thank you from mom telling me how thrilled she was with her very special and unique gift.</li>
            <li> Very cool</li>
            <li> Very easy to operate and makes me happy to use essential oils and not chemical laden room sprays.</li>
            <li> which is a huge plus then just lift the top and wipe it out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great so far.</li>
            <li> and now I enjoy the lovely oils being diffused.</li>
            <li> I love the light color changes, too.</li>
            <li> I love the style of the diffuser, it&#x27;s options for light changing, having one color on or turning it off.  </li>
            <li> Best feature is the auto shut off when the basin is empty.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is finding the ideal place to put it.</li>
            <li> It is classy looking and works great.</li>
            <li> I have a tea light burner that works much better.</li>
            <li> Love the LED light choices.</li>
            <li> I love that you can turn the light off and still use it.  </li>
            <li> and I love the changing light colors.</li>
            <li> In addition, the color changing light is soothing and interesting.</li>
            <li> And the plume of superfine mist it puts out is lovely to behold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser so much that I bought one for my mother.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much that I had to get my mother one too.</li>
            <li> We have tried a good dozen different oil diffusers (flame, electronic, you name it) and this is by far the best one we&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Loved it so much I bought one for work and another for home.</li>
            <li> My mum loved this so much she bought herself one</li>
            <li> so easy to fill and easy o clean!</li>
            <li> more importantly the product was just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, very light weight and can be placed almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> It puts out a large amount of must and great worth the oils I have used.  </li>
            <li> We love the color choices and it is user friendly.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works and looks great!</li>
            <li> : The blue &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; indicator light is very bright, and is disrupting to use while trying to get to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money, it&#x27;s a great product that will help you feel better, live healthier, and improve your mood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to set up and use</li>
            <li> Easy use diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and it keeps pet odors at bay.</li>
            <li> The button makes it easy to switch through modes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (so easy)</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to add water and oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is fairly easy to clean because the top just lifts off and the water chamber is easily wiped out with a paper towel or cloth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is fairly easy to clean because the top just lifts off and the water chamber is easily wiped out with a paper towel or cloth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Really easy to operate</li>
            <li> Easily fills the room with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>

            <li> Easy to operate.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser, it&#x27;s easy to operate, easy to clean, and shuts off automatically</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, I love the sleek design</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes my whole living room smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, the ZAQ Dew is so easy, a five-year-old could use it.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> easily movable, quiet for the most part and works really great.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to assemble and operate.  </li>
            <li> No complaints, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as strong as a night-light, but doesn&#x27;t bother me when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> and it is going strong.</li>
            <li> Amazon has some good deals on Edens Garden, and even if though they don&#x27;t understand apostrophes, I highly recommend their Clarey Sage, Basil, Clementine, and Chamomile.</li>
            <li> Only wish the power light was NOT SO DARN BRIGHT!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors (if you like that kind of thing).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and the lights are really cool.  </li>
            <li> The changing colors are a nice touch and a pretty accent piece.</li>
            <li> This is the first of its kind that I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought another one!</li>
            <li> but it works out well and looks pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I only hope this ZAQ Dew LiteMist continues to work as beautifully as it has from day one.  </li>
            <li> It puts a beautiful smell all over the room almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, quite literally as it changes colors while filling our entire living and kitchen areas with aroma.</li>
            <li> Perfect for massage therapy sessions, meditation groups, evening relaxation and any other use!</li>
            <li> The added colorful lights make it even more fun! :)</li>
            <li> The white is a nice bright, clean look.</li>
            <li> Immediate fine mist comes out.</li>
            <li> The Samyo seems to work fine, and it is cheaper, but I would keep the ZAQ one over</li>
            <li> The Samyo seems to work fine, and it is cheaper, but I would keep the ZAQ one over it.  </li>
            <li> I bought my mom one too, and it seems that hers is working fine.</li>
            <li> I wish the part that holds water/oil was removable, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> and it survived just fine</li>
            <li> I like the fine mist--</li>
            <li> Oh, and the shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> and it really does make me feel better!</li>
            <li> Use during the day, night, all day, all night ... easy to use, easy to change oils, clean.</li>
            <li> How strong a smell you get will depend on how much oil you put into the diffuser and what kind of oils you use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean up, and the kids like the spaceship look of it.</li>
            <li> but I have a rather large living room that it diffuses nicely in.</li>
            <li> disburses the oils nicely throughout a large room.</li>
            <li> in all this is a wonderful little diffuser.</li>
            <li> initially it was working fine, my wife was happy with it.  </li>
            <li> But I think most of us, &amp; certainly, I, want to be able to get the scent of our oils circulating well throughout them</li>
            <li> Probably best for a smaller room or have two for large rooms.</li>
            <li> but I must admit I&#x27;m now a huge fan of the ZAQ Allay diffuser</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if I could turn off the light.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and change the oil/water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So worth the money :)</li>
            <li> And it also is very neutral looking which is nice.</li>
            <li> noise whatsoever, with the exception of a water trickle sound here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the colors you can set it to.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and change your oils, etc.</li>
            <li> It does not create any moisture on anything around it and it lasts 4 hours if the water is filled all the way to the max line.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have to try to sleep with that light on.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> I have primarily used lemon, lavender and peppermint oil in it as that&#x27;s supposed to help with sinus/allergies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is extremely easy to use and to clean.  </li>
            <li> I like the option of turning the lights on and off, though when  light is in &amp;#34;off&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Lavender is great for relaxing and is currently the EO we have in the unit.</li>
            <li> and you can also adjust it so that it will scent but not have the light.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that the light changed as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this because there is no heat to worry about</li>
            <li> I thought the light turns off though which is does</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wipe out and keep clean, and it seems to work well with any type of oil.</li>
            <li> It works great with my essential oils and the changing colors are a plus.</li>
            <li> Upon opening it I noticed it was a nice size, very well made.</li>
            <li> I put the water in and a few drops of the lemon oil, turned it on and within seconds I had a wonderful aroma filling my room.</li>
            <li> Pressing the power button once turns on the mist and the light cycling.</li>
            <li> Great for a bed side diffuser but not for big rooms.</li>
            <li> Works great and using it several times a day.</li>
            <li> , honestly, I didn&#x27;t really read the description of this on Amazon, and when it arrived, we were all talking about lava lamps ;</li>
            <li> It has a nice sized footprint and is very stable.</li>
            <li> If it avoids the problems others have mentioned about not running after a while, I would say this is a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> The primary reason I bought it was increased humidity when I sit at the computer</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> BUT great product overall</li>
            <li> It sends out a light mist into the air which does not condense on surfaces.  </li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil diffuser!</li>
            <li> We still enjoy this diffuser.</li>
            <li> The light is soothing almost a dimmed nightlight.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> The product description says that the light shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I like that the light lets you know it is on.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m fairly happy with the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> but I am a light sleeper</li>
            <li> like the light settings and the ability of turning this feature off if you do not want it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars for one reason and that is the light.</li>
            <li> It has a modes of where the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have another one that I can&#x27;t use in the bedroom at night because the light stays on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It serves as night light somewhat</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous diffuser.  </li>
            <li> the light goes off (although the button remains lighted so you can see where to turn it off).  </li>
            <li> , I like that it will change colors and you have an option stay on one color or turn the light off.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t stand to have ANY light when I sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So go to sleep comfortable.</li>
            <li> Nice modern design that compliments our home decor.  </li>
            <li> The ZAQ diffuser emits a louder whirring sound than the Deneve, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the bedroom.  </li>
            <li> The fragrant oil I am using immediately began to mist lightly into the room.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I just keep the color off, which is a great feature to have if you don&#x27;t want to draw attention to the device.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The gently changing colors add such a beautiful ambiance to the waiting room of my Therapy Practice!  </li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this diffuser--although it does not put out a strong scent, it is easy to use and adds a nice light aroma when used with STRONG essential oils.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It spreads the scent throughout our living room easily, and I love the pretty and calming lights.</li>
            <li> I am exceedingly pleased by this feature and that the machine begins to work right away.  </li>
            <li> They have so many other great blends and sell them on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very effective at diffusing essential oils into the air and adds to the decor of any room.</li>
            <li> However, the greater problem is it worked fine - the first time.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing a few more!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use, very quite, stays cool and great price!  </li>
            <li> it takes no extra things like cups or filters, like the pretty colored lights, the over all it&#x27;s great:-)</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, a couple male co-workers liked it and were interested in getting one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very invigorating, and super potent!</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s very fine, and if you place your fingers right at the exit hole at the top, the steam comes out slightly warm, but two inches above it has no distinguishable temperature.</li>
            <li> To clean away yesterday&#x27;s scent, wipe out with a paper towel lightly dampened with vinegar, followed by one dampened with water or tears.  </li>
            <li> I like the cool, fragrant mist and easy clean up of the water pod.</li>
            <li> I like that refilling it is super easy</li>
            <li> It is attractive, sturdy, and easy to use, which I expected.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is super easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> Like other people have said, it is bright!</li>
            <li> well, the &#x27;light off&#x27; setting still emits a fairly bright blue light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be sure to follow the package directions exactly.</li>
            <li> Truthfully I thought it&#x27;d be a pretty gadget for my desk and help create a spa like atmosphere while I work.</li>
            <li> have loved using this diffuser - easy to use, clean and keep pumping through the awesomeness of essential oils!  </li>
            <li> It also lets off cool moisture instead of hot (like a humidifier would) which is perfect for our toddlers when they get close &amp; curious.</li>
            <li> I researched other diffusers, including Young Living, and I found this one to be the most attractive and cost effective.</li>
            <li> so worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> I got this for my birthday and was so excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> Simple and Effective!</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of diffusing throughout the room (which isn&#x27;t small).</li>
            <li> Even in the light off position there will be a bright blue light shining.  </li>
            <li> The lights are nice colors and not too bright, but bright enough that I can check on the baby at night without having to turn on other lights.</li>
            <li> I use lemon EO and my office smelled so fresh!</li>
            <li> The mist that comes out of it is very fine and does have much of a humidifying effect.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser except for the fact that you can&#x27;t smell the scent for a very long time after it starts.</li>
            <li> Pain to clean.</li>
            <li> Mush easier to clean and fill.</li>
            <li> I wipe it clean once a week.</li>
            <li> So relaxing and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> This one I just purchased  is my most favorite so far, and family loves them too.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable, and love the light changing colors.</li>
            <li> This is the first cool diffuser that I have tried and I am really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> , it is a bright blue light.</li>
            <li> So far I LOVE this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> I hope it does because so far I love it!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old grand daughter calls it my rainbow volcano!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really a minor issue though, and I&#x27;m super happy with it.</li>
            <li> It actually works best at night if I hold it on the red light, rather than turn the light &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Scent lingers through the whole room and it is easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to give it a try, and then couldn&#x27;t because I didn&#x27;t have any oils on hand.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser, runs for 4-6 hours on a fill, and is great with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> She is MOST PLEASED with it - not only the actual diffusing action but also the calming and beautiful color changes !!</li>
            <li> This fills pretty much my whole 800 sq ft apt with whatever aroma i want to smell.</li>
            <li> Works well, it&#x27;s quiet, and the lights aren&#x27;t too bright.  </li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t want it to bright you can press the power buttons again and turns Navy blue.</li>
            <li> Even when running on the &amp;#34;light-off&amp;#34; setting, there is still a rather bright blue LED indicator that shines.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for almost a year now full time and still going.</li>
            <li> , It looks really cool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to be able to run it as I fall asleep.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a diffuser as a Christmas present for my wife, but the ones i was looking at (with lots of good reviews) were either out of stock or didn&#x27;t have the colors I wanted.</li>
            <li> I had two very pricey diffusers from a top company and they quit working after sitting for a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been running it daily since I received it, and nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li> they are to be diffused with cool mist like this.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully love this so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this and wished I had stumbled upon it much sooner.</li>
            <li> I really have to admit that I like the Allay better than the Dew diffuser,</li>
            <li> and they loved the fact that it changed colors and were instantly intrigued by the design.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> Love the different settings for light, and the fact you can turn off the light at night!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it&#x27;s big.</li>
            <li> Diffuses whatever scent you want and the lights are really cool.</li>
            <li> Looks cool.</li>
            <li> They both work well, but the ZAQ is so cool looking.</li>
            <li> Bought this recently as a birthday gift for a good friend.</li>
            <li> The color changes of the light are fun as well.  </li>
            <li> The cool thing about this product is that it also functions as a mini humidifier.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s just cool to look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It lasts for at least 8 hours which is perfect to run at night.</li>
            <li> The wiring to the new one feels more secure, and the diffuser started up immediately without any issue or hesitation.  </li>
            <li> The wiring to the new one feels more secure, and the diffuser started up immediately without any issue or hesitation.  </li>
            <li> I filled her up and turned it on right away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong, and works as well as it did when I first opened it.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and peaceful.</li>
            <li> Love how it changes colors, love how it fills my entire room with my special oils scents.</li>
            <li> The cool colors are also very pretty and soothing, you can have one or all colors, or you can have no color rotation at all.  </li>
            <li> But this didn&#x27;t stop me from buying it, per the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> Runs out of water to quickly for me</li>
            <li> I really love the healthy and healing aroma of using essential oils, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I love essential oils, and feel so much better about diffusing them, as opposed to burning candles and potpourri tarts with synthetic chemicals.  </li>
            <li> love scented products and have used many different types for creating that ambiance and atmosphere throughout my home.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this diffuser, I was using an oil burner from the dollar store and all of my family and friends say that was much more potent than this product.  </li>
            <li> I quickly realized from the pungent smell that I would need to do some research before using the oil as the smell is too overpowering in its concentrated form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I find the colored lights tacky, but that&#x27;s okay, because you can select just a clear light, which is what I do.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature about this diffuser is that you can choose how the light system works, including the following options:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very happy with this after extensive research into the different types.</li>
            <li> read many reviews on several diffusers before choosing this one, and I must say I am pleased in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love having several settings to choose from but more than that</li>
            <li> I used it for my favorite essential oils and enjoying the fragrance and health benefits from them.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> You can turn the light &#x27;off&#x27; but really, there still is quite a bit of light given off.</li>
            <li> Disperses the aroma quickly.  </li>
            <li> far as decor goes, the diffuser is pretty modern looking, but it kind of looks like of like a genie lamp when the mist starts coming out of the top.</li>
            <li> far as decor goes, the diffuser is pretty modern looking, but it kind of looks like of like a genie lamp when the mist starts coming out of the top.</li>
            <li> Lets off a strong stream of steam for a long time before running out and fills my room with sent nicely.</li>
            <li> It dims to a light shade of blue which lights up my whole room, not to mention the on button which is sooo bright.  </li>
            <li> She likes it very much!</li>
            <li> The color change on the diffuser is very pretty, and it has the option to pick the color as well.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions but the diffuser continued to glow a nice blue which in the middle of the night was too bright.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> The vapor is very fine and dissipates quickly -- it reminds me of those old &amp;#34;genie in a bottle&amp;#34; stories.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this little machine and am so thankful for all the great reviews that helped me decide on this particular one.</li>
            <li> the first being Young Living&#x27;s Rose Home Diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I find it very relaxing and incredibly easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and is small so it doesn&#x27;t take much space.</li>
            <li> I love that the lighting is very soft.  </li>
            <li> I love it so far!  </li>
            <li> This is our first diffuser and it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet &amp; really pretty &amp; makes my entire downstairs (or upstairs - each level is about 2400 square feet) smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Not only did she Iove having it in her room, she got SO many compliments and questions about it from the drs and nurses!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself in the UK where I live, liked it so much</li>
            <li> Low noise, Perfect for single room.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use, and has lasted several months now being used almost daily.</li>
            <li> If you put a more strongly scented oil in it, it will scent a larger space but it will be quite powerful in the room it is used in.</li>
            <li> Beautiful little devices that puts out a lot of scent!</li>
            <li> They responded right away and sent me a new top at no charge.  </li>
            <li> And it emits only a very light gurgling sound, which I find soothing.    </li>
            <li> A great little diffuser for the price.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.</li>
            <li> A great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It looks pretty cool but has a clean look that doesn&#x27;t interfere with decor (which I was worried about) and instead of being tacky, the color changing is actually pretty neat.</li>
            <li> They are very simple to operate and they do a very good job diffusing the essential oils with distilled water.  </li>
            <li> The directions say tap water is fine, but I use distilled and wipe the diffuser clean between uses (vital if you use citrus oils!).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like any light when I&#x27;m going to sleep, and since I often diffuse lavender at night, I really can&#x27;t leave it on.</li>
            <li> We are using this to diffuse essential oils and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> As a frequent migraine and insomnia sufferer I&#x27;ve found the ZAQ Dew LiteMist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser to be the perfect addition to an unexpected place, my home office.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to have my house scented with NATURAL essential oils of my choosing (scents that aren&#x27;t cancer-causing or are hormone disrupting, like all chemical/artificial scents on the market).</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser &amp; the oils even more than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> While this is a nice diffuser, it only runs 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> Pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I love the style and ease of the Zaq, but I&#x27;m hesitant to try a third time, so regrettably I&#x27;ve ordered a different brand that I don&#x27;t like as much, but it gets great reviews on Amazon and hopefully it will perform well.</li>
            <li> Keeps my desk area smelling fresh at the office.  </li>
            <li> JUst received it and so far pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> How useful is something that has to be refilled every 20 minutes?  </li>
            <li> no danger of burns which would be a good feature with curious children in the home.</li>
            <li> By far more durable (the bottom of the Pearlessence broke off and while still functional it was</li>
            <li> This is my first cool diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for a week and love it.</li>
            <li> it does a good job with our 15 x 15 ish size living room, but not much beyond.</li>
            <li> The unit has a nice look to it and is compact and lightweight and had plenty of steam coming out, however, the high-quality essential oil I was diffusing could not be smelled AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> But when a friend stopped over later and my husband returned home from work, I asked them if they liked the smell and neither had any idea what I was talking about.  </li>
            <li> however I couldn&#x27;t help but think that a lot of college bound youthful students would love this product because of the soothing scents, sci-fi look, and the changing colors (goodbye lava light - hello aromatherapy essential oil diffuser).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one at all unless you want to spend this kind of money for a product that only works a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> and my apt has a lasting lavender fragrance when I use the lavender oil.</li>
            <li> Amazon was nice enough to refund my money.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it efficient, it is also a nice decorative piece for my home.  </li>
            <li> The oil diffuser effectively diffuses the essential oil/water solution in the air.  </li>
            <li> The design is simple, lightweight, and effective.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser - however after 4 weeks of occasional use it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this could affect the life of this beautiful product, as the water and oil sit in a plastic</li>
            <li> the colorful lights turned off.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s safe around my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> It keeps things fresh in there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quiet and looks nice sitting on my night stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I appreciate being able to scent the air naturally.</li>
            <li> They always want their bedrooms to smell nice, but commercial air fresheners seem to trigger their asthma.  </li>
            <li> but I would not buy the same kind again.</li>
            <li> The fun part is the lights that change color.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it were bigger</li>
            <li> Love the light feature and very quiet!</li>
            <li> basically I took a star away for the light not actually being able to be turned off, and the scent not being as dispersed as I would like.</li>
            <li> Soothing, works well and colors are fun.</li>
            <li> And even though you turn off the light, it still puts off a noticeable blue glow, which is okay if you want a nightlight.</li>
            <li> the colors are fun and the auto shut off puts my mind at ease.  </li>
            <li> before I decided which diffuser to purchase, I originally thought I was going to get one of the more expensive diffusers from Young Living or Doterra, however the reviews were not as good as I had hoped, and I have a friend who has the Young Living Diffuser and she told me she has to replace it every six months, and that really doesn&#x27;t impress me much, so I thought after reading reviews on every diffuser, I chose this one because the ratings were the best</li>
            <li> Quiet, and easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li> Very quiet, easy to clean and to use which is a plus!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I returned the other model, which was twice as much.  </li>
            <li> Candles of course, worked great to fill the whole room, but my husband wasn&#x27;t really a fan because sometimes the scent was a little too strong for his liking.</li>
            <li> Easy to maintain, easy to use, does not shut down after some time like mentioned on some reports, just be careful to not get the electrical opening under the device wet, good amount of mist, nice colors, elegant design.</li>
            <li> The other one we had was too bright for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> I originally had it sitting on a table about 7 feet away from me but couldn&#x27;t really smell the oils I was diffusing.  </li>
            <li> Works well, great lighting, long enough power cord to fit where I want it.</li>
            <li> Very user friendly - plug and play.</li>
            <li> Then the on/off button is a super bright blue so that shines really bright especially in a dark room.  </li>
            <li> I just turn it on right by me during computer activity and any symptom I had ( use Breathe for allergy, Lavender for stress, Peppermint for headache) get healed.</li>
            <li> , I decided to use it right away.</li>
            <li> I keep it on my night stand and it is just the right size.</li>
            <li> It is easy to refill and start over for a new cycle.</li>
            <li> I liked this at first and it worked well,but the machine broke after about 3 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> It as a pretty shape and the different lights are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This is my first essential oil diffuser and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> My main issue is with the light.  </li>
            <li> but I got it to mainly use at night and on the setting where the light is suppose to shut off</li>
            <li> I would love it more if it would be dark while I sleep.  </li>
            <li> The only things I&#x27;ve found that I dislike is how easy it can be tipped over and spilled (my cat and preschooler are quite interested in it and did this) and that while the light settings are nice, they make it a pain to simply shut</li>
            <li> It would be even better if the off light position was really no light instead of a bright blue.</li>
            <li> Our house is very large</li>
            <li> It diffuses oils nearly instantly, gives enough steam to replace a humidifier, lasts for hours, gives off a pleasant aroma while changing colors constantly (which adds another pleasant dimension to the senses) and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I love the changing colors and that within only minutes my whole office is filled with aroma.</li>
            <li> Too bright for a dark sleeping room.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is eady to clean and the light mist carries the essential oil without depleting the water too quickly.</li>
            <li> The old diffuser died a few months ago, so I purchased this one, after reading good reviews, and I love it.</li>
            <li> It is small but puts outs great aroma .</li>
            <li> I get so excited to try new oils &amp; start this diffuser every morning!</li>
            <li> It was simple to use, and the scent filled the room quickly!</li>
            <li> but when you are sleeping!!&lt;br /&gt;I now have a wide selection of essential oils and mix and match them for a very good night sleep every day...</li>
            <li> The color changing is very soothing and the aroma is wonderful for a bedroom or other smaller room.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean when changing essential oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet and is easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> This light &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; mode is still technically with a light on.  </li>
            <li> The simple sleek design is very eye catching and setup</li>
            <li> You can turn off the changing colors to just have a light blue hue, but I can&#x27;t fall asleep unless I put something over the blinding power light.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that it performs just as well as my more expensive one.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; mode is still pretty bright in a dark room, however, which is one of the reasons why I gave four instead of five stars.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping- received it in one day.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quiet, has lighting options and is easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> Even while it worked I thought it should have done a better job at dispensing the oil into the air - it just didn&#x27;t seem powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise, it is quiet, and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I recently started to get into essential oils and thought this would be a great way to add scent into my home.  </li>
            <li> Easy set up and works like a charm so far.</li>
            <li> It operates very quietly and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very quiet, has adjustable light settings (which makes me want one for both my bedroom and my preschooler&#x27;s), and manages to fill a 20&#x27;x12&#x27; space with a comfortable level of scent.</li>
            <li> I have purchased more expensive diffusers,  but these are great.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping and works very well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li> I am now looking to replace with another, more reliable, unit and am willing to pay a little more for a diffuser this time.  </li>
            <li> a constant sound sort of like a fish tank but more high pitch.  </li>
            <li> The black dome actually looks very classy and the multi-color, when I choose to use the mode, still shows beautifully through the opening on top.</li>
            <li> There are three modes for lighting - it can switch colors every couple minutes, can be set to one color or switched into the night light mode (dimmer light to be used at night if you don&#x27;t want too much light in the dark).</li>
            <li> , so i can&#x27;t speak to how well it would work in a larger living room, but it is more than adequate for the baby room or even our large master bedroom (15x15ish??</li>
            <li> The disc was only $6, so everything&#x27;s fine now!</li>
            <li> Very Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> (The downside is that one has to be careful, as it is easy to drop in too much oil, and create an overwhelming scent.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I loved this product until it stopped working after only 6 months of use and I barely used it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to essential oils, and I love this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> , so I can&#x27;t say how long this will run until it runs out and shuts off, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , so I can&#x27;t say how long this will run until it runs out and shuts off, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works amazing and longer running than expected.</li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> , it works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, leaves off lots of aromatics, shuts off by itself when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li> I love that it turns itself off when the water is low.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> I think yo can find better units that will last longer and be cheaper.  </li>
            <li> wish I would have known more about these before I ordered this one I might have chose a different on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome can&#x27;t go wrong gift.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every night and love trying out different aromatherapy oils in it to lull me off to sleep.</li>
            <li> As a yoga instructor getting into Ayurveda, I also love this product for its ability to help me incorporate different aromatherapy extracts into my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does exactly what we need it to do, plus changes colors or stays on one color, depending on setting.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> First use of a diffuser...</li>
            <li> On the regular mode the top of the diffuser changes colors</li>
            <li> Very calming as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> The first press of the button turns it on with the color-changing cycle.</li>
            <li> We ordered a replacement to confirm that it wasn&#x27;t just the first one we got.</li>
            <li> pretty lines</li>
            <li> There are only 3 in all the many</li>
            <li> I have two myself and buy it often as a gift for friends and family, along with some of my favorite essential oils.  </li>
            <li> will most likely order another one as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I specifically requested the ZAQ brand, since it had so many excellent (and so few negative) reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, low blue light</li>
            <li> I love the different colors that it transitions to.</li>
            <li> and I can definitely smell the oils better than I can with the Dew, so</li>
            <li> On the first day, my husband came home from work and noticed immediately (and he almost never notices things like this.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s laughably funny in some parts.</li>
            <li> The diffuser does not get hot</li>
            <li> My favorite EO&#x27;s to use in it are peppermint mixed with vanilla.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was able to diffuse a room initially.</li>
            <li> I have several diffusers and this is my FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> aromatherapy essential oil diffuser is one way in which to dilute the oil and better appreciate the concentrated scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering purchasing a \\&quot;variety\\&quot; pack of essential oils to continue to experiment with the many scents available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> being said, I love the shape, and overall function.</li>
            <li> improvement might be to put this on a stand--the higher you can get it,</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It diffuses the oil SO much better than my last diffuser!</li>
            <li> When I first took it out to try, I followed the instructions.</li>
            <li> for another area of the house and was pleased to see the adapters are the same.  </li>
            <li> for another area of the house and was pleased to see the adapters are the same.  </li>
            <li> Just opened the box and set it up, so these are first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color changing feature sounds tacky, but is really quite soothing with the shift in colors almost mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot or ruin any surfaces - I often set it on top my wooden jewelry cabinet so my toddler can&#x27;t reach it.</li>
            <li> We looked at many different options but this one stood out.</li>
            <li> I think this will work well in a bedroom where you can shut the door but don&#x27;t expect much in a more open area.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what the label says.</li>
            <li> It has an auto shut-off when the water is empty which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> The colors are soothing and I like that it doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
            <li> We love using it at night in our room with different relaxing and therapeutic oils.</li>
            <li> Just wish it could hold more water do it would last longer.</li>
            <li> I was seeking a way to better diffuse essential oils into my home.</li>
            <li> One issue that I am sensitive to is the amount of light it gives out.</li>
            <li> but pretty)</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how cheap it felt.  </li>
            <li> Also, thanks for the sale!  </li>
            <li> diffuser is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I want this to last for many years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My first time use one</li>
            <li> It is my first diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have lots of oils that I use with different warmers but this diffuser intensifies the oils without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> recently had a need to replace the top (I damaged it myself) and contacted the company to see if they sold replacements.  </li>
            <li> Worked exactly like it promised, have had zero problems.</li>
            <li> I use it often for several weeks and had no problem because I make sure I wash it after each use.  </li>
            <li> Works well and looks pretty.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I like the colored lights and especially being able to set the diffuser to one color.</li>
            <li> it is most centrally located.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser.</li>
            <li> The first time you press it, it starts vaporizing the water and scent immediately and colors change after a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a lemon the first time.</li>
            <li> If, like us, you use a diffuser more often, be aware that this one will not last a year.</li>
            <li> , we also enjoy the more pleasant smells in the air since we do have dogs, birds, a cat and fireplaces in our home, we no longer have any unpleasant odors that having pets and a fireplace brings.</li>
            <li> This makes it less than ideal for someone who needs total darkness for sleep.</li>
            <li> If it avoids the problems others have mentioned about not running after a while, I would say this is a fantastic buy.y mild hum that is not at all distracting, and the movement of the water creates occasional droplet sounds.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m really impressed with this diffuser, I use it constantly, day and night, and since it automatically stops when it runs out of water, I feel comfortable leaving mine on at night when I&#x27;m sleeping, it says that it lasts between 3-4 hours, but mine actually has lasted as much as 6 hours, perhaps I have a lesser amount of mist that comes out of mine, I don&#x27;t know,</li>
            <li> This little gem is in my living room because it is small goes with most decor easy to tuck someplace and enjoy the essential oil of your choosing great after a stressful day of work/kids/pets/life ect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say to put in around 4-7 drops of essential oil in when the water is at the full level (although the higher end of this range will be too overwhelming for some and may nearly &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; your eyes a bit).</li>
            <li> I just love mine, and I use it nightly with some pure lavender essential oil to relax before bed.</li>
            <li> And the different color changing light is so pretty!</li>
            <li> Lighting is bright in dark room and pleasant; the aroma is subtle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and big but I have to keep a cloth under the unit and place it on a surface that can&#x27;t get wet because the steam flow is pretty strong and creates lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> I fall asleep with it on, the colors are a nice touch and make my ceiling interesting when the vapor rises up in thin clouds and changes colors.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase at least one more, eventually, so that I can have them in more rooms of the house.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly light, but powerful depending on what essential oils you choose.</li>
            <li> You should be able to use both essential oils (real plant oils) and perfume oils (synthetics, alcohol-based fragrances, etc.).</li>
            <li> I would get it again, but I do recommend that you buy essential oils as soon as you order it so that when it arrives at your door you are ready to go :)</li>
            <li> I love that they actually diffuse the scent really well</li>
            <li> LOVE this, product, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s sort of a modern shape...</li>
            <li> Even with the light off, it still gives that soft blue light from the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button, so it&#x27;s not completely dark when you turn the light &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The only little thing I wish I could change is when you put it on the &#x27;lights off&#x27; setting, it still has a light that shines fairly brightly and lights up the room.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, could be better looking but still less ugly than most of its kind !!!</li>
            <li> You have several options for how you want to run it - with or without the light on and multi light change mode or single light mode.  </li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser, so I don&#x27;t know how this compares to competitors, but personally, I really like it.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, it lasted for 5 1/2 hours and really did shut itself  </li>
            <li> and I really wish, I would of got this one first.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit Leary at first because I did&#x27;t know too much about this item or the oils associated with it.  </li>
            <li> I run it pretty much 24X7 and have no problems.  </li>
            <li> however I usually place 7 - 9 drops, just use a good quality aroma oil.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these diffusers early this year and liked it so much that I&#x27;m buying another one for another room in our house and a third one as a gift for a friends</li>
            <li> but when you tell it no light, it is fine in the daytime, but at night the blue power light shines through the top</li>
            <li> If you have modern decor, this will fit right in, but if you have traditional / vintage decor in your house, like I do, it might stand out a bit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, although I see they&#x27;ve come out with one with more capacity for the same $$.</li>
            <li> the ZAO wins on every metric except for size of footprint in the highly valued bathroom vanity real estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can smell my essential oils within seconds of turning it on, so cool!</li>
            <li> Easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I have purchased 2 extra of the Allay diffusers as gifts as well and the recipients are thrilled and have told me numerous times how much they LOVE their diffusers, both in blue as well.</li>
            <li> a very mild hum that is not at all distracting, and the movement of the water creates occasional droplet sounds.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was easy to use, quiet and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love the mesmerizing lights at night, in the dark.</li>
            <li> The various colors you can select are easy on the eyes and add a soothing ambiance.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser is relatively compact and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It certainly stands out.  </li>
            <li> but another one thought because it is just so large.  </li>
            <li> We use it in a large bedroom and it has plenty of capacity and runs for 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit petty, I know, so I certainly would not return it.</li>
            <li> Using EOs the fragrance travels, covers a large space and depending on the oil can smell in my upstairs bedroom.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want too large a unit</li>
            <li> It changes color, but has a setting that lets you freeze it on a certain color if you like.  </li>
            <li> Not designed for large areas</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful little essential oil diffuser, capable of scenting any room with your favorite oil and adding much needed moisture to dry air.</li>
            <li> Have used it nearly every day and it has work very consistently.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this diffuser the first three times I used it, but the fourth time I plugged it in, it totally quit working and automatically shuts itself off without working at all.</li>
            <li> Two of my cousins use the same style and brand and they&#x27;ve had theirs for over a year and a half and are still happy with theirs.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, I like the option for the lighting.&lt;br /&gt;The essential ouse diffuse very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use mine in a fairly large room, and the scent of the essential oil can easily be smelled across the room; after the diffuser has been on for several hours, the scent fills the room and even lightly permeates the downstairs area of my house.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the ZAQ Allay Litemist would do better for getting the mist higher due to</li>
            <li> , colors can be on or off, very quiet and diffuses fine mist.</li>
            <li> I only fill it halfway to the fill line with water, which allows me to use less oil and get more potent output.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do warn about is that unless you are trying to do a quick coverup of your stinky kitchen, perhaps only use 2 drops of oil and be sure to put the machine away from any food.  </li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the diffuser, it is very quiet, leaves a mild smell in the room, water will last about 3 to 3 1/2</li>
            <li> It has 4 different settings that switch by pressing the top down - off, misting on with light changing colors, misting on with color fixed and misting on with light off.</li>
            <li> It can really scent up a large room well.</li>
            <li> but does the job very well for a large bedroom.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and diffuses just the right amount of vapor and essential oils.</li>
            <li> Amazing little thing.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is an amazing product and every house should diffuse essential oils to purify and give a fragrance instead of buying chemicals to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> Purchase a variety of concentrated oils and you are ready to enjoy a bit of the outdoors in your enclosed and possibly stuffy room.</li>
            <li> You can choose the settings of either light color changing, light color staying, and no light.</li>
            <li> I used to burn incense a lot because I enjoy the exotic and complex smells until I began learning about its harmful side effects.</li>
            <li> Works great just wish there was a no light, mist only settling.</li>
            <li> Very upsetting.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work really well</li>
            <li> This diffuser works very well for my family.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast service, and well packaged.</li>
            <li> When press &#x27;ON&#x27;, the light came up for a second as if it was going to start.</li>
            <li> They like it so much that I am considering getting one for myself.</li>
            <li> She does wish she could turn the light off entirely at times while it is diffusing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started turning on the diffuser while I sit in bed reading/watching TV, then turn it off when I&#x27;m ready to sleep.</li>
            <li> The unit will only sporadically let me change the light setting to the night setting</li>
            <li> It is so wonderful to diffuse scents (like eucalyptus when you have a cold).</li>
            <li> wife really really loves this thing.</li>
            <li> Diffuses the oil very well, the lights are relaxing but they don&#x27;t shut off.</li>
            <li> Fast startup, soothes the beast inside me, yeah</li>
            <li> I like the Dew so much that I take it into the bedroom at night to diffuse lavender, chamomile, and clary sage... or sandalwood, bergamot, and ylang ylang.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this model...</li>
            <li> And I really like how it starts diffusing as soon</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Does the job and works really well, just turn it on, sleep</li>
            <li> So much so, in fact, that I purchased the ZAQ Mirage for my den/family room.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this product again, and Bombay Electronics is a very speedy, quality packaged shipper.</li>
            <li> and I cover the blue light on the button.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Those are synthetic and just diminish the whole point of this unit in its entirety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I thought it would need to be filled constantly.</li>
            <li> I really like that the cord comes out from the bottom(ish).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit!</li>
            <li> Not too much mist</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> There are diffusers for 3x as much money</li>
            <li> The design is sleek and modern as well.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser works really well.</li>
            <li> Loaned it to a friend so really miss it</li>
            <li> Very calming lights.</li>
            <li> Very aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> My advice is not to get curious and take the top off while it&#x27;s running.</li>
            <li> It really does look that way.</li>
            <li> It really does look that way.</li>
            <li> Push the button to start it and a brief flash of light, then nothing.  </li>

            <li> Aromatherapy Essential Oil Purifier Diffuser Air Humidifier with 4 Timer Settings &amp; 6 Colors Changing Light]]</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really humidify, which I didn&#x27;t want -- I just wanted the aromatherapy benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this unit.  </li>
            <li> (My whole downstairs in townhouse).</li>
            <li> the colored lights are very relaxing to watch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a modern design would make it a neat addition to any room.</li>
            <li> The changing colors are very soothing.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> Really like this diffuser</li>
            <li> It creates a soothing atmosphere whether you allow the lights to switch or press the switch to keep a solid light.</li>
            <li> Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> It also automatically shuts off when the blend runs out, and I really like that feature.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so incredibly fast</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like my diffuser.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY suggest this diffuser!</li>
            <li> so this definitely should have filled the air.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to</li>
            <li> * 3rd press turns the light off&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Very stable shape, will not fall over</li>
            <li> There still is an internal light glowing.</li>
            <li> thanks from squareprint.com</li>
            <li> One feature I love is that it turns off automatically when it&#x27;s empty.  </li>
            <li> The colors are neat too, but really I don&#x27;t look at it that much.</li>
            <li> It really moves the aromatherapy oil around the room.</li>
            <li> Works very well -</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the packaging, which I have to say was very wasteful (</li>
            <li> and I find falling asleep to be so much easier than it&#x27;s ever been before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I hadn&#x27;t really considered adding a misting diffuser to the mix.</li>
            <li> For the price of the diffuser I expected it to perform much better than its counterparts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and modern.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I have it in my bathroom and turn it on when I take a bath or in the morning when I get ready for work.  </li>
            <li> I like the colors and the way it looks and the mist is very soothing.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> If you press the button once to turn it on it goes through the different light colors in rotation.  </li>
            <li> It also compliment as a night light, the different lights changes as you turn it on</li>
            <li> This diffuser is ready to go as soon as you take it out of the box.</li>
            <li> The more drops you add, the stronger the smell so be careful.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for aromatherapy!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t disperse the scent as much as I would like</li>
            <li> As for the colors, my kids (ages 4 and 2) really like to watch the vapor come out of the &amp;#34;rainbow mister&amp;#34;. ^_^</li>
            <li> Only use at night so far to breath better and it has worked.  </li>
            <li> A larger unit would be nice but definitely NOT a deal breaker!!</li>
            <li> I used it frequently, but always made sure I cleaned it and took care of it since I wanted it to last a while.</li>
            <li> However, anyone working with essential oils knows how potent these condensed natural products are.</li>
            <li> Only have had it a week but love it so far</li>
            <li> It runs forever on a small amount of water, the lights are soothing and interesting in dim lighting, and the lid is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think it is a very nice product - I only wish that the company would have included tiny samples of essential oils to experiment with.  </li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser as I am new to EOs.  </li>
            <li> If you use it during the day you can also keep it on one of the other fun settings with the rotating light.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle sound of trickling/bubbling that you hear as it does its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it compare to the prices at other sites</li>
            <li> Much better than some other diffusers I have had.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more for other rooms.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted a natural-like smell source and the commercial solutions were just not hitting the mark.</li>
            <li> I can do it with one hand while having the grand baby in the other arm.</li>
            <li> I love that it shuts off when it is empty!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the length of time this unit runs; unlike other reviewers, mine will run for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use: I mean, really really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wish the chamber was bigger to last longer, and the motor was more quiet but otherwise just fine.</li>
            <li> This diffuser holds a good amount of water, on average a &amp;#34;full tank&amp;#34; would last six hours.</li>
            <li> Really good looking, yet subtle.</li>
            <li> how amazing this little thing is!</li>
            <li> In a completely dark room, the backlight from the button does glow brightly and adds a soft glow to the inside of the cone, so when it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s never completely dark.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that instead of wasting at least 30 drops of oil a day in the oil burners, I can use a total of about 15 drops, at most, in a day and really and truly smell it throughout my home.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing it holds about about 8 ounces, runs for about 4 hours and has various light settings.</li>
            <li> I think the price is slightly too much, but otherwise, love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to non-natural colognes and perfumes but happily used essential oils for decades, but usually with a candle warmer, and honestly, even that little bit of smoke bothers my sinuses.  </li>
            <li> Last eight hours, makes my room full of smell with my doterra oils and like the amount of vapor that makes.</li>
            <li> but I liked it while it worked :-/</li>
            <li> ~ I think it&#x27;s really cool to have the option of different settings for color.</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised that it really doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think this product would be effective in a small bathroom or office.  </li>
            <li> Buyers considering this product will need to also purchase an essential oil to get the full benefit of the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lighting is soft &amp; pretty.  </li>
            <li> I love that it only takes 4-5 drop of my very expensive essential oil to fill a room with a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think the unit itself is fine, the adapter is a piece of junk with loose wiring inside.</li>
            <li> I think the unit itself is fine, the adapter is a piece of junk with loose wiring inside.</li>
            <li> I just rinse it out with water and wipe it out with a tissue and it is ready for some new oil.</li>
            <li> own very limited experience has taught me that less is more when using essential oils.  </li>
            <li> No humming or motor sound at all - the Daisy on the other hand does have a slight sound to it which is notable especially at night in interval mode.</li>
            <li> This depends upon the oils used, but generally speaking, I don&#x27;t even smell the oils unless I am right over the unit.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is lightweight and easy to pick up and carry into the bathroom or kitchen to pour out any remaining water, too, so it&#x27;s not a real pain to take care of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The diffuser is lightweight and easy to pick up and carry into the bathroom or kitchen to pour out any remaining water, too, so it&#x27;s not a real pain to take care of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> smell of the oils (don&#x27;t forget to add distilled water like I almost forgot to) easily permeates the room when the door is closed.</li>
            <li> I alleviated this by spray painting the dome with a black spray paint and covering the button with a felt pad.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have to have your room pitch black to sleep, you won&#x27;t be able to diffuse this in your room at night - it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband at all</li>
            <li> I would love to get another one in the future for different areas of my home.</li>
            <li> and I love how it cycles through different colors and automatically shuts off when the water level runs low.</li>
            <li> looks decent too.</li>
            <li> Super quiet as it promised(ultrasonic).</li>
            <li> I love the design and wish they had one in a bigger size, same design.</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted a diffuser because I have health issues</li>
            <li> The ZAQ Dew Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser is a fun, modern way to eliminate the odors in your home.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super simple to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, shuts off when it&#x27;s empty, the color choices are nice or none if one chooses.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s quiet, and the glow of the light is soft and</li>
            <li> I took a Saturday and researched all the different diffusers out there and finally settled with the ZAQ after seeing how many were purchased and</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has such a low profile shape.</li>
            <li> I love how it is small and pretty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the model I have is newer or older.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an older home, &amp; review is based on use in the Master Bedroom of the home.</li>
            <li> I kept it only because of the hassle of returns, &amp; the fact that it does a bit better in a much smaller room.</li>
            <li> It does put out a smaller stream of vapor, but in a smaller room it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Press it again, the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, but you have a soft blue glow from the button.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this particular diffuser.</li>
            <li> The Dew diffuser is very pretty, quiet and efficient!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple to use and very pretty when changing colors.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser, however the no color part is not true.  </li>
            <li> The sleek European design is very pretty.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money, it&#x27;s small and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have two of them and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> i woudl recomment this one highly..</li>
            <li> High quality product however</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend using their oils in this ZAQ diffuser.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I do use ONLY Distilled water in it because I don&#x27;t want to take a chance that our water will make it corrode, and so far it&#x27;s been a good decision especially since it&#x27;s going almost constantly</li>
            <li> have a very large living room and the scent wafts gently through the entire room, drifting a bit into my foyer and my dining room.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried too many other diffusers, but so far I feel I can highly recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li> So unless you have a very small room area (like a bathroom), or are sitting within a 4 ft range, you really wouldn&#x27;t get the benefits a nicely scented home.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t really scent the whole room, so you won&#x27;t really get the full effects unless you are 20 ft. or less away from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We all love this little gem.  </li>
            <li> Really love this little unit.</li>
            <li> : The unit I bought is pure white, and no color is evident until you turn it on.</li>
            <li> This works very well as an aroma diffuser and the color cycling is slow enough not to be pleasant and not annoying, unlike some other products I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sleep in a room that isn&#x27;t dark, so that is a huge bummer, because I really like the look of the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a setting for minimal light.  </li>
            <li> Great product...just a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I clean it up and dry it well about once a month with water.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it with Plantlife&#x27;s Study Buddy or Calm essential oil blends for an office space use like I&#x27;ve chosen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this diffuser has such good reviews?</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different diffusers so far and this is my second favorite...</li>
            <li> sure how long it will last, we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase a few more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t quite believe that 3-5 drops would be enough, but the old adage of less-is-more is true in this case.</li>
            <li> I also have to use double the amount of drops to get the same effect as my favorite brand : Young Living.</li>
            <li> the one concern that I&#x27;ve had about the ZAQ Dew is that it will take 6-7 hours to completely use up the tiny amount of water that it holds, and since it says that it lasts between 3-4 hours, I felt that I must not be getting the proper amount of mist coming out of it...and the one thing I do notice with the Allay is that I do get better misting out of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Zaq Dew for a few weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li> Not too big, and the lighting options are fun and add evening, hygge-style ambiance in the living room where I have it set up.</li>
            <li> I want it for my office,so I want to make sure the cord is long enough for it to sit on my desk.</li>
            <li> and I think it works better than the more expensive Young Living one.</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> The true test will be to see how long it lasts!  </li>
            <li> I really only smell it when I&#x27;m sitting right nearby.  </li>
            <li> You must stand right next to it to smell the oil.</li>
            <li> Sent it right back and got a refund.</li>
            <li> There was literally no scent unless you stood right next to the unit and bent over and smelled the steam coming out, and even that was scant.  </li>
            <li> I have it sitting right next to my bed.</li>
            <li> Was becoming noisy and less efficient every day.</li>
            <li> I filled the reservoir to the fill line, added a few drops of essential oil, pressed the on button and instantly a mist started coming out of the top.  </li>
            <li> So quiet and sends out the mist of essential oil just fine.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it would not last long, but so far, I’ve been able to get over 7 hours for each use.</li>
            <li> I will increase my rating further if it proves longer lasting than the first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the color setting as I think it&#x27;s pretty cheesy, but it&#x27;s there if my toddler wants to watch the colors change, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> it is nice and quiet with just a little water noise but it has been soothing to me and my kids.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by this cute little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the directions it will stay like new for a while, I have had mine about a year with no issues.</li>
            <li> Going to try new brand.</li>
            <li> Then when I need to I can just add new scents.  </li>
            <li> The company, Bombay Electronics did respond to emails about the adapter and promptly sent a new one in the mail.</li>
            <li> The company, Bombay Electronics did respond to emails about the adapter and promptly sent a new one in the mail.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona</li>
            <li> Called Amazon and received a new one.  </li>
            <li> other than that it has a nice light mist that comes out and last a few hours before needing a refill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not obtrusive and you have the option of changing lights, keeping it at a particular color or turning the color off completely.</li>
            <li> The main difference between the two models, as far as I can tell, is that the Mirage holds 2x the water.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to purchase one for my daughter and since this one wasn&#x27;t available, I chose the taller ZAQ Allay diffuser in blue for her, which would have been my second choice, so I may even try one of those as well in my house since I am thinking that I should purchase a second one so that I&#x27;m not moving mine from the bedroom to the living / dining area a couple times a day, it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it would be nice to just leave them where they are....</li>
            <li> I usually have it on the first setting which allows the LED light to change colors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this diffuser in a studio apartment and if fills the room (about 400 sq feet) with a light fragrance with ~5 drops of (undiluted) essential oil.</li>
            <li> Filled my entire house (or shut the door and get extra benefit without house diffusion!</li>
            <li> I love citrus and lemon scents when I need a mood lift, and it is lovely to disperse eucalyptus/peppermint oil in the bedroom when my kids have a chest cold.</li>
            <li> essential oils are gonna be the new fad!!!</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this little thing!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this little thing!</li>
            <li> I really love this little oil diffuser!</li>
            <li> The reed diffuser technique works, but the scent doesn&#x27;t travel very far within the room, which is a bummer.</li>
            <li> The reason that I gave it four stars is it doesn&#x27;t seem powerful enough to diffuse properly in bigger rooms like my large master bedroom.</li>
            <li> The first few times I ran the diffuser I set it on the kitchen table and, while eating a quick snack, I found myself being a bit overwhelmed by the scent.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is easy to set up, and works right out of the box in less than 3 minutes (I had to get some distilled water because our tab water is a little mineral rich).&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews already explained the different colored light settings.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is wonderful, I have been a fan of essential oils for the past twelve years, you can change the feel of your space with just a few drops of warm desert vanilla or balsam fir or pine, this is small and intimate enough for a night stand, this will not take up more space than necessary and it glows the prettiest soft color.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, although we usually just use the deep night blue constant light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time essential oil diffuser and this one is</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really not sure off the top of my head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The diffuser has a larger footprint than my other diffuser, but the mist is considerably more noticeable and circulates well within a 15 foot radius.</li>
            <li> initially grew interested in a diffuser because we wanted to diffuse lavender in our daughters bedroom to help her sleep.</li>
            <li> You just need to make sure that if you have water to pour out that you don&#x27;t pour it over the spot that has the small one-inch slit.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time and totally worth it.</li>
            <li> so it would run longer and it does make a small room smell lovely.</li>
            <li> Many other reviewers have mentioned this issue, I wish I had paid attention and ordered a different brand.</li>
            <li> It has completely exceeded my expectation!</li>
            <li> This is my first essential oil diffuser</li>
            <li> Simple to use and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty diffuser ...</li>
            <li> Not to mention after being plugged in for several hours the unit is sometimes hot to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more to say than &amp;#34;I love it,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> We use this diffuser nearly every day!</li>
            <li> It also emits a larger amount of vapor per second, so it&#x27;s better for a larger room.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, 1 month later, after consistent use, the power button no longer works at all.</li>
            <li> Currently, this diffuser seems to be hard to get, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because it has been more in demand right now or what,</li>
            <li> I do like that it has multiple colors and 4 settings and that if you want to let it continue changing colors it will or if you want to set it on a certain color you can or a very low light bluish color, that&#x27;s possible too.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t normally be a big deal, but I have it in our bedroom and love to run it most of the night and the light is annoying.  </li>
            <li> This WAS fantastic but it lasted less than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure of their therapeutic benefits, but I like being able to scent my home with something natural that won&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> In the winter, this comes in handy to add moisture back to small rooms.</li>
            <li> I started using essential oils from NYR because their prices are very low and their oils are of better quality than some of the supposedly \\&quot;therapeutic grade\\&quot; out there (which is a made-up certification and doesn&#x27;t actually mean it&#x27;s safe to ingest the oil!!).&lt;br /&gt;3-4 drops of Essential oils lasts about 2 hours!</li>
            <li> the diffuser works extremely well scent-wise, and the fact that the diffuser continuously changes color is really cool looking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use tap water, just filtered water and make sure to dry it out when it runs empty.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is I wish it was strong enough to make the entire room smell fragrant.  </li>
            <li> The mist lasts for several hours and the fragrance seems to spread throughout a fairly large room.</li>
            <li> I have it in a large bedroom and it gave the entire room</li>
            <li> Fast forward to the ZAQ Dew Litemist… I just received this product today, and not only was it super simple to use, but the effect of the essential oil scent dispersing into the room was IMMEDIATE!</li>
            <li> If filled to the max capacity it can operate for a little over 4 hours.</li>
            <li> , blue is my personal preference, they also come in Orange and Pink, but Blue is so calming, I love it!</li>
            <li> This little diffuser works magic when it comes to aroma therapy with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing!!  </li>
            <li> In fact, the photo looks cheesy, but the unit itself, though lightweight, is attractively and simply designed.</li>
            <li> so I can clear my chrakas at night.</li>
            <li> I use eucalyptus and peppermint oil to clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, I cannot return it.  </li>
            <li> It is very very quiet and the lights are very calming.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> and no signs of any problems so far.</li>
            <li> so far I have 20 hrs on it.</li>
            <li> It does dim</li>
            <li> I emailed directly to the  company web site (not through Amazon)  </li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t take up much space its silent.</li>
            <li> It auto-offs after it runs out of water--filled completely up</li>
            <li> For $50 it should last much much longer.</li>
            <li> Then you just wipe it out with a soft cloth.</li>
            <li> Then you just wipe it out with a soft cloth.</li>
            <li> I have tried several times since then to turn it back on, and it will light up when the button is pressed but never actually comes on.</li>
            <li> However, once in a while, I do crave for something to awaken my senses, just something natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Also, the color changing aspect just fascinates my five year old son.</li>
            <li> I have it setting directly on my wood nightstand with no problems.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is not over powering but instead soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much space and runs quietly</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> As far as coverage goes-</li>
            <li> admittedly thought this looked really strange when I first unpackaged it</li>
            <li> Wow,, all that goodness in one inexpensive bottle.  </li>
            <li> that were the young brand.  </li>
            <li> My feeling is, because of the build-up that can happen from use over time, the machine will last much longer if distilled water is used in it.</li>
            <li> Update: The company has sent me a replacement unit that is working well so far.  </li>
            <li> I fill it every morning, but have to refill it at least one more time before the work day is over.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to note it didn&#x27;t come with any oils.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really matter for functionality, but if you are buying it because of the look as well as for what it does you may get something different than pictured.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I purchased a different oil diffuser through DoTerra and it consumed so much oil</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had any problems with them thus far.</li>
            <li> The ZAQ Dew LiteMist Aromatherapy EO Diffuser is really the only diffuser I wanted!  </li>
            <li> Diffuses oils very well and is very simple to use.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it almost every night for about 3 weeks and have had no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> This is quiet and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It a lite mist and really does the job of releasing your essential oil into the air.</li>
            <li> So far this has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> You can turn the Dew LiteMist on, leave for the day and come home to a wonderfully, naturally scented home.</li>
            <li> almost like a white Hershey&#x27;s Kiss on your table, haha.</li>
            <li> really just blue mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It appears as though power is getting as far as the LEDs, but not further.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a cool mist diffuser so can be used for therapeutic essential oils (hot air ones destroy the healthful properties of therapeutic EO&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> So 80ml more of water and a few drops of essential oils</li>
            <li> I read quite a few reviews on different products prior to deciding on your product and this had a good rating by users, which ultimately helped me to decide on the purchase.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a great experience for at least a few hours.</li>
            <li> Maybe the worse part is that it&#x27;s kind of flimsy plastic, so</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the product claims that you can turn the light off, however, even in the &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; mode there is a dim blue light (and not just the power button) that stays on as long as the diffuser is</li>
            <li> This product seemed a little overpriced and had maybe one sour review when I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> The mist is just right for using it at your desk or workspace (where mine is set up), but I don&#x27;t know about it filling up a larger space(anything bigger than a bedroom?).</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was right compared to some of the more expensive ones on the market.</li>
            <li> It states it has a no light setting, but the blue on light is almost brighter than the other light.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like at first was that when you select the mode to turn off the color lights, it still has a dim blue light on from the on/off button, but after a few nights we got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting to get another one for my house as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use; just take off the lid, and put in a small amount of water and 5 drops of oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact design however (approximately 7\\&quot; wide - 4\\&quot; high) makes it fairly unobtrusive and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t timed how long they last on one fill, but since the ZAQ emits a greater volume of vapor per second, I would assume that it would last a shorter time between fills.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that the lights can be stopped on a specific color, or completely turned off if you wish.  </li>
            <li> Love this diffuser, just add a couple drops of oil (a little goes a long way) -</li>
            <li> The fine mist it puts out is just enough, especially when the air is dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 5 weeks, and took very gentle care of it (only filling water to the max fill line, using purified water, etc).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it very much since I got it, but the few times I have it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser, it puts out just enough mist to scent a small area.</li>
            <li> and the entire main part of our home fills with the smell of whatever I&#x27;ve got in there.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> The only down side is the sound they make and that is the reason why the 4 and not 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I think it might be a tad overpriced (hence the 4 stars), but other people may feel that the price is exactly right.</li>
            <li> so I only ever use the last setting (quiet with low light) and it does not keep me awake or distract me, if anything it helps me fall asleep faster.</li>
            <li> Resist parsimony and get high quality essential oils.</li>
            <li> If you like using essential oils around your home, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really lightweight and does not overheat no matter how long it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is an oil for almost everything for skin,to ingest, to diffuse, I suggest you check it out they have been used long before modern counterparts.</li>
            <li> would recommend this diffuser and really hope it lasts a long time, and that my issue with it turning on is just a quirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this takes up as much space as if I&#x27;d stretched my fingers out and traced around the tips to form a circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> light broke almost immediately....and has small capacity..n</li>
            <li> but it also really depends on the oil you are using and how long you have it turned on.</li>
            <li> The top part of the Diffuser changes color, green, blue and several others.</li>
            <li> It is just so baffling to me why this has such good reviews when it has such a poor performance quality.  </li>
            <li> on here tonight buying a 2nd one because when our kids are sick at the same time we&#x27;d like a diffuser for each room.&lt;br /&gt;Its very easy to use; pretty much remove the top, fill water to the line, drop in a few drops of oils and plug it in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just put regular ol&#x27; tap water in the reservoir, four drops of some PURE essential oils of my choice (ones that don&#x27;t have carrier oils in it &#x27;cause that will clog the machine), and then I just turn it on!</li>
            <li> (we run it probably 4-8 hours daily since Christmas, so about a month), and haven&#x27;t seen any &#x27;smell&#x27; hangover from previous oils, they pretty much evaporate out with each use.</li>
            <li> (if I can) and replacing it with another Allay, the Allay is taller as well, narrower at the base, but much more appealing in the long run, I didn&#x27;t really expect to change my mind on this</li>
            <li> For that price, I believe it should have lasted at least a full year!</li>
            <li> We live in a very open concept home</li>
            <li> I am currently using Lavender for its calming effect, Peppermint and Eucalyptus because I am almost always stuffy they are both very beneficial when you are feeling cold/flu symptoms as well as promoting overall relaxation.</li>
            <li> The ability to change the light from one color to several alternating colors to no light at all makes it quite versatile.</li>
            <li> When I think of what I paid for this, it&#x27;s barely worth half its price.</li>
            <li> I put ten drops of essential oil in (the pamphlet suggests up to 5) and it&#x27;s scenting my room very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek, about six inches in diameter, silent, and has several settings: you can have gentle lights changing colors, or set it to one color or opt for no lights.</li>
            <li> but I generally move it all over the house!</li>
            <li> It would deserve a 5 if it actually got dark, but even with the colored light off, it glows brightly blue through the cone from the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> I have primarily used with doTerra Wild Orange essential oil but also with Nature&#x27;s Sunshine Eucalyptus, and it worked equally well with each, so I feel like it will also work well with any other essential oil.</li>
            <li> I love it as it requires only a drop of essential oil to perfume a small room for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> On the negative side, even when the lights are off, you can still plainly see it because the power button is lit brightly.</li>
            <li> Its super easy to use, not one complaint from me!!!</li>
            <li> This is a sweet little diffuser!</li>
            <li> For a more subtle scent, use 1-3 drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li> I use mine mainly as a candle replacement; so I recommend picking Essential Oils from aroma specific companies.</li>
            <li> Only use filtered clean water (I don&#x27;t use direct from the trap) and don&#x27;t overfill past the line.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this one is when you choose the option no light it still puts off a bright glow that makes it hard for me to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> --you may notice a small bubbling watering sound if it is very quiet in the room you are in, but this is relaxing in itself and not distracting.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the light would actually turn off, but it doesn&#x27;t; the off light is a deep blue and unfortunately it keeps me awake</li>
            <li> Mist, color changes and sound help an anxious teen relax and sleep well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instructions were clear and simple.</li>
            <li> diffuser comes with a plastic measuring cup for the water that&#x27;s marked with milliliters on both sides (no English measurements).</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it puts out a soft, quiet diffusion.</li>
            <li> natural plant oils can actually eat away at rubber and plastic.</li>
            <li> I received this item on October 10th and it completely stopped working on October 13th.</li>
            <li> no wet surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you, like me, tend to be sensitive to fragrances, order the basic scents like peppermint, lavender, cinnamon or citrus to start with.</li>
            <li> One final press of the button turns the unit off completely.  </li>
            <li> Add a few drops of essential oil or a blend, press the button, and vapor immediately begins to float from the spout and dispenses into the room quickly</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just the right size, and no sound to bother my coworkers.</li>
            <li> I had a few friends over right after I got the diffuser</li>
            <li> The design seems less intrusive than the taller ones I was looking at and looks pretty</li>
            <li> my only complaint would be the light doesn&#x27;t dim enough.</li>
            <li> It does have a light blue light tho while its running no matter what, so that can be annoying for someone who needs absolute darkness to sleep,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I wanted another one of these and they have been hard to come by lately, I decided to purchase the ZAQ Allay diffuser in Blue, which is a very soothing color blue, I love it!</li>
            <li> Its very pretty but its so small it doesnt even diffuse an hour.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold much water compared to other diffusers.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there&#x27;s a setting on the diffuser that&#x27;s described as &#x27;diffuser on, light off&#x27; ...</li>
            <li> Only complaint is why do they al have to light up?</li>
            <li> A coworker of mine spent twice as much on her &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; brand diffuser and hers just recently broke.</li>
            <li> We have pretty hard water where I live</li>
            <li> do wish the vapor floated up a little higher because I keep it on a side table</li>
            <li> first I thought this might be a little</li>
            <li> the setting where you can turn the light off and have the diffuser running still lets off enough light in our bedroom that it makes it difficult to sleep if you need a pitch black room.</li>
            <li> They are written in such poor English that one can only conclude it was originally written in a different language and then in an effort to save money, they used Google Translator instead of hiring a real live person.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This sits low, so tipping is not at all a problem, as with other taller ones on this website (although I also bought a much taller one, which works just a well, with no issues of tipping...</li>
            <li> : They take a long time to heat up and emit an aroma; They use a lot of oil in comparison to a diffuser; The tea-light candles make me nervous around my 5-yr old and two cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been running it for a solid hour and the water level seems to have barely budged</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been running it for a solid hour and the water level seems to have barely budged</li>
            <li> I could barely smell it until I got closer to the table which was literally only 5 feet away.  </li>
            <li> Even in natural oils, I find my sinuses don&#x27;t like overly flowery scents for long and they rebel at anything musky.</li>
            <li> This is an exact diffuser product I had at work that is a replacement, because it was misplaced.</li>
            <li> Lately, I’ve stumbled upon essential oils and added a few drops to jojoba oil to make a nice scent for my hands, but I’ve been at a loss on how to scent</li>
            <li> Small, sleek, and fun change of colors.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting one from the grocery store if they are going to break down this fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but when in use, it seems like the &#x27;mist&#x27; only stays right around the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> ; not exposed metal subject to corrosion, so I expect this useful device will last long enough for me not to feel cheated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting into using essential oils for making my own cleaning and personal care products slowly over the past couple of years</li>
            <li> It fills up a small room with the fragrance easily, but in a large room is a bit of a waste if you are not right next to it.</li>
            <li> The actual diffuser is small enough that I have it set up on right on my desk.</li>
            <li> The colors range from turquoise to deep blue, light and dark green, and red.</li>
            <li> mixture is very helpful for that, so I put 2 drops of each in my diffuser and have that going as I write this, but I switch them out and change them for whatever I feel I need at the time, whether it&#x27;s oils that help me sleep better at night or oils that help rejuvenate me or oils that help keep us from getting sick, or oils that help with depression, whatever the need may be at the time, but I do use this particularly for my health and find it to be extremely helpful</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and some scents are better in small doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of receiving the brand of item I expected, I received some cheap knockoff that that I could have purchased at other retailers for almost half the price.</li>
            <li> I actually read a bad review on another diffuser from Bombay Electronics, which was later given a good review because Bombay reached out to the reviewer and replaced the faulty product.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s not powerful to diffuse the scent over very large areas, but when I leave my bedroom door open I can smell the scent as I walk down the hall toward my bedroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wish I had spent a little more money and purchased a bigger diffuser but for a small room this will do.  </li>
            <li> and I found that even when it is in the 4th setting (where the light is supposed to be off), there is a blue glow coming from the diffuser which is not ideal if you like to sleep in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The Mirage is almost too large for a bedroom,as it can be overwhleming in the amount of scent it puts out in a small space).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> This one is quiet, it mists for a long time and the auto shut off</li>
            <li> but I do know that it is enough because it doesn&#x27;t take long for me to start smelling the oils once I turn it on.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last long either.</li>
            <li> this thing does not last for too long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Works well nice features but the wide base takes up too much space.</li>
            <li> This diffuser holds 80 ml of distilled water, and it comes with a nifty little measuring cup with 80 ml&#x27;s marked on one side and 100 ml&#x27;s marked on the other.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews talking about its unreliability but because on the whole it got 4 and a half stars</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less than one year old.</li>
            <li> However, this is not a humidifier and it won&#x27;t put enough moisture into the air to help with dry skin or allergies.</li>
            <li> The unit will run for several hours and then simply shut off when empty.  </li>
            <li> We use it everyday with Young LIving Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> I will compare this ZAQ diffuser with the Essential Oil Diffuser by Deneve, since I ordered both of them and spent quite a bit of time reviewing all the different diffusers offered on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I currently have at least 20 different essential oils in rotation in my house for various natural medical needs, cleaning needs, and and plain old I-want-to-smell-something-good</li>
            <li> This mode still casts a large amount of blue light (which is particularly annoying since blue is an energizing color).  </li>
            <li> It worked for the first few hours and now it must be unplugged and left alone for a few days before it will stay on for longer than 5 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I got this diffuser because I wanted to try to use something more natural for when we are sick.  </li>
            <li> After moving it to a different spot and adding a little less oil, I find that it works much</li>
            <li> But it last only a split second  after that, the product shut down&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vick&#x27;s plugins and they work just fine, but they are expensive and</li>
            <li> The other two broke after using then for only a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for small room freshening.</li>
            <li> He’ll sit and stare at it, this small little smile on his face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband walked into our bedroom and was shocked at how amazing it smelled in there just 10 minutes after I plugged it in.</li>
            <li> The diffuser isn&#x27;t bulky or ugly &amp; looks nice in my home.</li>
            <li> Nothing is more disappointing than over paying for a product that doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it on for at least four hours straight, and it didn&#x27;t shut off, or use a ton of water/oil.</li>
            <li> at least I didn&#x27;t spend as much on it as some of the others....</li>
            <li> Think they really should have lasted at least a year because they are not inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It arrived larger than I expected</li>
            <li> so I put it in our library and changed to an orange essential oil - still not much of a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of the speakers my parents how in the 70&#x27;s that would pulse different colors to bands like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.  </li>
            <li> (sci-fi flying saucer type strange).</li>
            <li> the 6 foot long electric cord is convenient.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no orange or yellow.</li>
            <li> I completely dried it out, unplugged it and plugged it back in trying several different outlets in the room...</li>
            <li> I bought one for my 87 year old mother&#x27;s bedroom because she was having trouble sleeping.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also choose to turn the soft, muted colors on (as pictured) and they change every few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope a long time.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know how long the cord is?</li>
            <li> Once the reservoir is empty (after several hours of run time)  </li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars, but it does not dim 100% for use at night.</li>
            <li> The Deneve is also larger than I expected</li>
            <li> Clearly not though because I got this for Christmas</li>
            <li> That was a nice variety and all but out of the 14 box set, I only like the way 3 of them smell in my oil diffuser :(</li>
            <li> Shame that something that should be easy to work ends up being another poorly made item, and not cheap at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shame that something that should be easy to work ends up being another poorly made item, and not cheap at that.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other essential oils!!</li>
            <li> I have other oil diffusers that you can only run for a minute or so at a time or they become too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I actually bought two, one is in the family room, the other in the bedroom.  </li>
            <li> The other reason is because in the end, I would like a model that has the option to delay puffs of mist every so often, but this model is a stay on only.  </li>
            <li> It runs a long time, about 4-5 hours!</li>
            <li> I do recommend using distilled water only to prevent minerals and other particles in tap and bottled water from clogging the system over time.</li>
            <li> I have a spa and use it all day long!</li>
            <li> It runs quietly and shuts off when empty as expected.  </li>
            <li> Instead of staying on a single color for very long, they blend together and change</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can push the button and freeze the Dew in a single color mode; with all the transitions, it gives you unlimited options to change the lighting to match your mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or you can select single color.  </li>
            <li> But, so far so good!ver the spot that has the small one-inch slit.</li>
            <li> However, the power button still remains lit, and the LEDs are on at a very low setting, so the diffuser will not be totally dark.</li>
            <li> When we plug the diffuser in, the LEDs are already turned on (not normal behavior), but the power button won’t cycle modes—it won&#x27;t even turn the diffuser</li>
            <li> and the price are the only down sides.</li>
            <li> So it only lasted 1 and half months:</li>
            <li> we have only lasts about half that.  </li>
            <li> The room I was trying to fill is a small living room as my townhome is very tall and narrow.  </li>
            <li> Next I&#x27;ll put less peppermint.</li>
            <li> so you can install it inside the base in order for the unit to be more steady and firm.  </li>
            <li> I wish the reservoir was a little bigger</li>
            <li> The product is a little smaller than I anticipated</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little larger than I would like it to be</li>
            <li> I had been using two little oil burners with the tea-light candles, but there were several things I didn&#x27;t like about them</li>
            <li> It is a little larger than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Just wish it had a little bigger capacity - to make it through the night.</li>
            <li> The ZAQ is a little larger and does take up quite a bit of space on the table.  </li>
            <li> I have had this a little over a month - of course just outside the return window, it stops.  </li>
            <li> It dims to a very dark blue, but it still glows.</li>
            <li> the no light mode still results in a bring blue glow from the button.</li>
            <li> The trouble is it only lasts a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> All features work as expected.  </li>
            <li> water chamber holds 80ml of water + a few drops of the essential oils.</li>
            <li> So it was a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems with it.</li>
            <li> took only a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The aromatherapy mist diffuser has varied options that should appeal to a wide range of users.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I was given a different brand of diffuser, as a gift, a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I have not problems with it except that it only lasts for a few hours but</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no problems with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this diffuser a few days</li>
            <li> The diffuser has three options for the lights, rotating through a few different muted colors, holding on one color of your choice, or no lights at all.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my office, where I diffuse peppermint oil for mental focus.</li>
            <li> I always place this next to my bed at night and add a few drops of a sleep oil blend.</li>
            <li> A few drops of the oil mixed with water</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of peppermint and eucalyptus essential oil in it and it keeps my allergies at bay all night.</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy</li>
            <li> I diffuse everyday, all day, and have used various diffusers.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cause whatever it is sitting on to become damp or wet.</li>
            <li> This item no longer works after only a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Will be curious to see the longevity of this one.</li>
            <li> For us, it lasted about 8 months of continual use and careful washing.  </li>
            <li> Unless you want to keep filling the water reservoir every couple hours to have continuous scent in your room, this is a pretty expensive scent maker, the electric Glade plug ins do almost the same job, but cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> I have used it for my kids, when they were sick, and to just make my house smell better.</li>
            <li> but I mostly needed it for sick babies.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can use essential oils with the diffuser, but I find the container very small and it lasts only 4 to 5 hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using a reed diffuser and soy based candles for the past few years to deodorize the air in my home, because I wanted to steer clear of synthetic chemical based products.</li>
            <li> The picture of the ZAQ Dew pretty much looks like the Mirage without the plastic base around the bottom, probably added to keep it stable.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> as per other reviews.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> We use this ZAQ Diffuser for diffusing other oils during the day or at night when we are sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I had, I wouldn&#x27;t of gotten the other two.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely pricey</li>
            <li> I bought one last year and had to send it back a month or two later because it failed.  </li>
            <li> Checked it out myself on amazon, read the reviews and compared to other diffusers.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> ; off like I&#x27;ve read with other brands of diffusers.  </li>
            <li> Though I purchased quality essential oils, using this small, lightweight diffuser I don&#x27;t smell them.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would advise, as other commentors have here as well, that if using in the bedroom, set where you can’t see and use the no-color option.</li>
            <li> I also like that it has a low profile and a small footprint.</li>
            <li> I have tried other diffusers and this one</li>
            <li> it died, only after use for about 4 months...very expensive for such short period...loved it while it worked.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it to other friends.</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the other 30+ reviews that reported that.</li>
            <li> Considering buying another for other rooms in the house.</li>
            <li> The design is sleek and it&#x27;s not too big or too small.  </li>
            <li> We like to use this for eucalyptus oil in the cold/flu season and other oils throughout the year.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would run very long since you put so little water in</li>
            <li> I use the Deneve in my bedroom because it doesn&#x27;t leave any vapor around the base on my nice table, and when you click it to the no-light setting, it emits no light at all.  </li>
            <li> We use ours almost everyday and we haven&#x27;t run into a single problem!</li>
            <li> It does still emit a light, but not so bad that you can’t sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> So it definitely works to fill up at least 400 sq.</li>
            <li> For that very reason, I must (sadly) gift the diffusor to my sister.  </li>
            <li> This aromatherapy diffuser definitely lasts at least four hours when used as directed.</li>
            <li> the diffuser is not in the least drippy or damp - it sits next to my printer, and the micro mist has yet to warp the paper.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it seems to just puddle down around rather than taking flight.  </li>
            <li> I plan to get another for other rooms!</li>
            <li> It is very small but fills the entire room with fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Looks nicer and is less noisey.</li>
            <li> so it makes me husband upset as he likes it pitch black.</li>
            <li> I am just slightly worried about the longevity of it.  </li>
            <li> ** After less than 1 week of having it, its quirk has turned into a problem.  </li>
            <li> And the agitation of the water inside the unit provides an undulating, fluttery look to the lighting; it&#x27;s not a completely solid glow, it has a subtle flicker.</li>
            <li> STAR: I have to give a 1 star review— this diffusuer worked for less than one month.</li>
            <li> This unit is dependable, quiet, and puts out subtle mist that scents the air with oil fragrence used in conjunction with water.  </li>
            <li> the thing they don&#x27;t tell you, and I would have given it less stars, but</li>
            <li> Depending on the oil I diffuse, I can typically smell it throughout the bottom floor except the master bedroom.</li>
            <li> There is an ever so slight \\&quot;tapping\\&quot; type noise while the machine is running</li>
            <li> Another reason I haven&#x27;t used candles in a while is because I have a small child and am scared that he will get curious and start a fire.</li>
            <li> You might think that essential oils are expensive, but you only use a few drops.</li>
            <li> This is not true.  </li>
            <li> and I usually leave the diffuser on the kitchen counter (which is at the center of my home)</li>
            <li> A little black duct tape helped.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t turn on...unless I continuously hold the wire tightly against the adapter when it is plugged in.  </li>
            <li> My expensive essential oils go a long way with this</li>
            <li> There didn&#x27;t seem to be much to it, and I was really disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with any trial essential oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;If ZAQ added an interval setting to this model and if they reduce the footprint of the diffuser just a little bit...</li>
            <li> A little hint</li>
            <li> This little diffuser works well.  </li>
            <li> It just seems a little fiddly to start every now and then.  </li>
            <li> This little diffuser exceeded all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fill up the little measuring cup with water, dump it in.</li>
            <li> We felt very disappointed we really liked it.</li>
            <li> The light can be a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> My water source is hard water that is softened by a salt water softener and thus far, I have not experienced any problems with residue build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> should be a little more heavy or at least have a base</li>
            <li> but if I were to want to use it for a cold or allergies where it would need to be on all night I could not do it unless I was really drugged out!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for two weeks, and I&#x27;ve used it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for about a month and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have owned this a couple of months now and it has not given me any trouble.</li>
            <li> Wish I could turn the colors off or have an option to have no light.</li>
            <li> It is completely dead and does nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for a few days.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I got one few months ago</li>
            <li> I just use filtered water and add a few drops of oil.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but it works you start feling the aroma afert a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Few moving parts</li>
            <li> and I put a few drops of tangerine into the water.</li>
            <li> I use Serenity blend at night and Citrus Bliss during the day - and we use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> for a few hours&lt;br /&gt;Puts</li>
            <li> and I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I want something that radiates no light while I am trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> I could not smell my oil when I was a few feet away from the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for a few months</li>
            <li> It took me a few weeks before I remembered to buy them and by that point my excitement about trying it had lessened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this can go HOURS with a few (6) drops of oil.  </li>
            <li> Those, along with a few drops of cinnamon or lavender oil at bedtime</li>
            <li> We use it everyday and have not had any issues with it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Using it for few months now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have complained about a noise, but I haven&#x27;t noticed this with the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> The past few years I have increased my interest in oils, buying a few here and there and trying them out.</li>
            <li> : There is a very slight noise when it runs --</li>
            <li> Usually I can trust reviews and have never been this disappointed in a product that is rated so highly, but this is clearly not the case with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> only real complaint about this product is the dispersal of oils.</li>
            <li> I am seriously considering buying one of the other designs for our kitchen.  </li>
            <li> I had never had a diffuser before, but felt a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t diffuse my oils very well.</li>
            <li> Water reservoir is small.</li>
            <li> keep it in a small bedroom (10x15ish)</li>
            <li> I usually use it at night</li>
            <li> Not sure what the issue was</li>
            <li> I purchased my essential oils through a company that offered the set titled &amp;#34;Best Of The Best&amp;#34;, unfortunately they recommend using their oils for cleaning, on your body, keeping bugs away, etc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rather small...</li>
            <li> I usually keep it running all day at home-</li>
            <li> it is a litle small</li>
            <li> : I chose the Dew after coveting the MUJI diffuser at their website, but even on sale with shipping MUJI&#x27;s small diffusler came close to $120.</li>
            <li> Some time ago I decided that burning candles in one&#x27;s home is not a healthy practice and, until, now I was unsure about an alternative.  </li>
            <li> which I appreciate since I&#x27;m usually asleep when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li> but now it does not work no more.</li>
            <li> Affordable and small.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this product at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> It does work well, fills a small room with the aroma you add of the oil, BUT don&#x27;t know about adding moisture to the room, I bought it for the scent...</li>
            <li> I usually do 4-5 drops and fill with distilled water to the line</li>
            <li> however the lighting is not very bright if you want the energy effects of the color.</li>
            <li> They were difficult to use, and they never  worked that well or lasted very long.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this issue because the price wasn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> I had to learn the hard way after using one of my scented oils and ended up with a headache.</li>
            <li> Hardly any water</li>
            <li> I use distilled water in this since I have hard water.</li>
            <li> ps - I even accidently dropped mine on the hard tile floor once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worthless in the Living Area, as the space is just too large.</li>
            <li> Not a nice feeling.</li>
            <li> The fact that it works so well (at least with the oils I&#x27;m using) is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to help her stay relaxed and help the healing process along (which is why I opted for a cold diffuser- so as to not compromise the quality of the essential oil).</li>
            <li> I would return this item if it weren&#x27;t too late.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used it at least twice per day.  </li>
            <li> but I have been using this at least every night since I bought it about a month ago.</li>
            <li> She started using it immediately that night and used it several nights in a row since she already had a cold</li>
            <li> If I leave the room, closing the door behind me, then re-enter some time later, I can faintly smell the oils I&#x27;ve been diffusing.</li>
            <li> and it runs for at least 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can be overcome by placing thick cloth over the lighted areas but it spoils the looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors change slowly and the YLEssential oils are dispersed so as not to be overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I mean EVERY day</li>
            <li> I usually just hide it behind my desk clock when company comes or put it in a &amp;#34;less</li>
            <li> And truly, it’s not good for you to inhale smoke</li>
            <li> Not good with oils that are already diluted though...</li>
            <li> $50 for six weeks of use is not a good trade off.    </li>
            <li> I now put my oils in a pot of water on my wood stove, not gonna spend my hard earned money on this junk!</li>
            <li> That seems pretty pathetic for something over $50.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed, especially considering the price of this item.</li>
            <li> Have terrible allergies and wanted to try something different than taking allergy medicines that can have other side effects, like increasing blood pressure.  </li>
            <li> the effect is too weak.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful about this item, but now, just very disappointed.</li>
            <li> One came broken.</li>
            <li> - I thought the unit was broken after using it all day.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but am very disappointed and cannot return it.</li>
            <li> I was desperately searching for something that I could use at home as a fragrance that wasn&#x27;t going to slowly kill me.</li>
            <li> And there was no overpowering scent, which is what my husband hated about the diffusers (when you were standing next to it) and candles.</li>
            <li> When my little ones are sick</li>
            <li> Now I have to track down receipt from purchaser and find a way to replace it. :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read the reviews after it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I brought two ZAQ for the price of one of the others and they work every bit as well as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I use it on my night table over night and is a bit &amp;#34;noisy&amp;#34; (nothing exaggerated</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> I chose a one star rating because the product failed in one week.</li>
            <li> $50 for something that lasts 2 and a half months is outrageous.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s disappointing, so</li>
            <li> I am using a pine oils as I type this for the earthy nature smells on this cold winter day.</li>
            <li> But what a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I saw a frend se one of these for her son who had a cold..</li>
            <li> I use tea tree in it during cold and flu season and lavender for a calming space.</li>
            <li> And they were very expensive.  </li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, package wasn&#x27;t in too bad a condition and</li>
            <li> GRRRR.  </li>
            <li> GRRRR.  </li>
            <li> I even put eucalyptus in it when my daughter was sick with a cough and it helped her.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I was extremely disappointed when it stopped working yesterday.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m on the hunt for another diffuser :(    </li>
            <li> /&gt;In comparison I have to say I prefer this ZAQ Dew LiteMist for four reasons: (1) the ZAQ is virtually noise-free.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in the Zaq diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It works, but disappointed it will not work with a plug in timer as it has no timer settings and for therapeutic purposes you want it to go on and off every 30 min.</li>
            <li> and my eyes are tingling from the peppermint, which is crazy!</li>
            <li> Very very disappointing considering I paid over $50.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I’ve always hated using candles and incense because the burning smell always gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for two weeks, and I&#x27;ve used it everyday.  I love it so far!  It works very well!</li>
            <li> I have had it for about a month and use it everyday. It is excellent! I fall asleep with it on, the colors are a nice touch and make my ceiling interesting when the vapor rises up in thin clouds and changes colors. I would love to get another one in the future for different areas of my home.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser, so I don&#x27;t know how this compares to competitors, but personally, I really like it. It&#x27;s easy to set up and use and I love how it cycles through different colors and automatically shuts off when the water level runs low. The reason that I gave it four stars is it doesn&#x27;t seem powerful enough to diffuse properly in bigger rooms like my large master bedroom.</li>
            <li> Mine has quit working.  I&#x27;ve only had it for 5 weeks, and took very gentle care of it (only filling water to the max fill line, using purified water, etc). I loved the product when it worked, but a 5 week lifespan is not acceptable.  As far as I know, I cannot return it.  Very upsetting.  I bought one for my best friend as a birthday gift, as well as my mom- so I hope theirs don&#x27;t stop working too.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! My only issue is I wish it was strong enough to make the entire room smell fragrant.  I really only smell it when I&#x27;m sitting right nearby.  Other than that, it works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I have been using the &amp;#34;Now&amp;#34; diffuser for about a year and had almost given up on diffusers. Not enough smell. Pain to clean. Was becoming noisy and less efficient every day. This thing pumps volumes more mist and smell. Mush easier to clean and fill. Looks nicer and is less noisey. Don&#x27;t know how long it will last but it&#x27;s great so far.</li>
            <li> This diffuser shoots the mist up about a foot and then it just falls to the floor. It doesn&#x27;t diffuse the essential oil into the air at all. You must stand right next to it to smell the oil. I&#x27;m not sure why this diffuser has such good reviews?</li>
            <li> affordable and effective. looks decent too. as per other reviews. the no light mode still results in a bring blue glow from the button. not for folks who demand total darkness. can be overcome by placing thick cloth over the lighted areas but it spoils the looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a diffuser, it works great though. supports 220v which is great.</li>
            <li> A great little diffuser for the price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful little devices that puts out a lot of scent! It is very very quiet and the lights are very calming.&lt;br /&gt;Even my jerk of a cat likes this thing!</li>
            <li> I purchased this essential oils diffuser about six months ago and have been using it throughout this time. There are three modes for lighting - it can switch colors every couple minutes, can be set to one color or switched into the night light mode (dimmer light to be used at night if you don&#x27;t want too much light in the dark). It is very easy to use, I didn&#x27;t even need the manual to figure out how to work it. It is lightweight and also easy to clean. If filled to the max capacity it can operate for a little over 4 hours. It is easy to refill and start over for a new cycle. While there are models that can operate for close to 8 hours they also tend to be way more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this device to diffuse essential oils during the times my kids had colds in winter. I had this diffuser operating day and night for weeks. It seems to work really well and no signs of any problems so far. I am quite happy with it. Good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item, and when it arrived at my house, it didn&#x27;t even work. I didn&#x27;t get any use out of it all because it didn&#x27;t work. Sent it right back and got a refund. Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have owned this a couple of months now and it has not given me any trouble. It arrived larger than I expected but I have a rather large living room that it diffuses nicely in. The beautiful colors you can choose from are just icing.</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser &amp; the oils even more than I expected. The diffuser isn&#x27;t bulky or ugly &amp; looks nice in my home. It doesn&#x27;t have a setting where the lights go off but stays on like it said it would so that&#x27;s my only complaint. Otherwise I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend it &amp; the oils to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love how the colors change on this diffuser.  It is great to diffuse my oils, the whole house smells great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter as a gift. She likes it very much!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Have no problems with it. Best addition to a house. Even bought one for my mom with some oils. She loves it! Makes house smell nice and adds a nice energy too. Plus I know I am not spewing out any toxic chemicals into the air. Been using it for almost a year now full time and still going.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about buying a diffuser at first, but chose this one because it had the best reviews, it was pretty, and I didn&#x27;t see anything about not using citrus oils in it. It spreads the scent throughout our living room easily, and I love the pretty and calming lights. It&#x27;s also easy to clean. Love it.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this diffuser!  I have tried 4 different diffusers so far and this is my second favorite...the first being Young Living&#x27;s Rose Home Diffuser.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this one is when you choose the option no light it still puts off a bright glow that makes it hard for me to sleep at night.  I have had this diffuser for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li> Love it....we use it every night. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser so much that I bought one for my mother.</li>
            <li> Amazing little thing.  I love it and use it all the time.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works very well for my family. Very attractive and works excellent. Easy to clean when changing essential oils. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Have had THREE of these break on me. One came broken. The other two broke after using then for only a short period of time. Not worth the money. My mother bought a cheaper one that is still working with no problems.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, leaves off lots of aromatics, shuts off by itself when it runs out of water. It can really scent up a large room well. Glad I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how long it will last, we&#x27;ll see...so far I have 20 hrs on it.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and is very beautiful with the color changing lights.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Works just as described....</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!  It&#x27;s simple to use, very quite, stays cool and great price!  Easy to open and close.  For the price its more than perfect.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted longer. Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li> Great product! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this diffuser!  The colors are nice, although we usually just use the deep night blue constant light.  It diffuses 80ml for HOURS.</li>
            <li> Easy use diffuser.  I would give it 5 stars if I could turn off the light.  It does dim</li>
            <li> I got my diffuser today! It smells wonderful, I have no problem with it scenting the air in my living room, dinning room, and kitchen! Fantastic! I am using Four Thieves oil... Yummy I will keep you guys posted on this product...</li>
            <li> I love this thing., It looks really cool and my room smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Diffuses great! I love that it turns itself off when the water is low.  Easy to clean and change the oil/water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it a 5 star but when you tell it no light, it is fine in the daytime, but at night the blue power light shines through the top and I can&#x27;t sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Just as promised!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, It&#x27;s a beautiful accent to my room. Also, it changes colors.. Kids love it. Works perfect. So worth the money :)</li>
            <li> LOVE This oil diffuser!! I have tried &amp; returned 3 different ones I purchased on Amazon &amp; this one not going back!! I&#x27;m so happy I found this one. Its super easy to use, not one complaint from me!!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome diffuser! So calming and peaceful...durable and quite. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is very basic, but it does the trick. And it also is very neutral looking which is nice. For the price though, you may as well get one with a timer.</li>
            <li> Use this every night with essencial oils and its so calming. Works great.  Fast service, and well packaged.</li>
            <li> LOVE this diffuser! I&#x27;m a first time essential oil diffuser and this one is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No noise whatsoever, with the exception of a water trickle sound here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scents aren&#x27;t over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it on my desk at work and it&#x27;s just the right size, and no sound to bother my coworkers.</li>
            <li> GOT FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT. HE LOVED IT. QUALITY MADE</li>
            <li> Bought from Amazon at the end of October 2014, Love it but it broke in November 2014.  It last only a month.  I emailed directly to the  company web site (not through Amazon)  but nobody response back until my third times of trying.  Somebody (I could not recognized the email domain) contacted us and asked to explain the issue, that&#x27;s the only contact we received.  It &#x27;s now 7 days after we explained the issue through email. We don&#x27;t know any more progress.  We hold off giving any feed back but I think we did give quiet a bit of time already.  We likes the product when it works and we would love to give more star. But since most of the time it does not work and contact after-service is quite a work out, we will need to give it a one star.  Whoever going to buy this, it is a NON-RETURNABLE.&lt;br /&gt;  Issue:  When press &#x27;ON&#x27;, the light came up for a second as if it was going to start. But it last only a split second  after that, the product shut down&#x27;</li>
            <li> I use this product with some of my Doterra oils and it works great. It&#x27;s a nice size and I&#x27;ve even taken it to the office to place on my desk. It&#x27;s not obtrusive and you have the option of changing lights, keeping it at a particular color or turning the color off completely. I also like the fact that it turns itself off when it&#x27;s out of water. I wish the reservoir was a little bigger but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> We use it while cooking, it has replaced candles and their fire hazards. You have to experiment which essential oils you like best and which ones to use to cover cooking/food smells.</li>
            <li> I love this , however I wish it held more.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp; easy to use!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son&#x27;s girlfriend for Christmas.  They both love it!!! Even my son. They like it so much that I am considering getting one for myself.</li>
            <li> Product is great, about 4 or 5 drops of oil and it&#x27;s good to go. The reservoir seems to hold enough water to run for about 5 hours or so which is perfect for me since I turn it in before bed and it runs out sometime over night and shuts off on its own.  The product is a little smaller than I anticipated but that isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Love it compare to the prices at other sites it was a deal!</li>
            <li> So far I LOVE this diffuser!  The gently changing colors add such a beautiful ambiance to the waiting room of my Therapy Practice!  The true test will be to see how long it lasts!  I hope it does because so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in May of 2014.  It was awesome - worked well and I used it just about every sing night without issue.  Then, in June 2015, it just stopped working one day.  You press the button, it turns on for a second then turns off.  So basically, it worked for one year.  That seems pretty pathetic for something over $50.  I think yo can find better units that will last longer and be cheaper.  It was good while it worked though.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Just what my daughter wanted.  She does wish she could turn the light off entirely at times while it is diffusing but that isn&#x27;t a biggie.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser, substantial and auto shut-off in case I want to fall asleep with it on.  I have two of them and highly recommend.  I use mine around the clock, top quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this diffuser for about 3 months now and it&#x27;s been great. My only complaint is that there&#x27;s a setting on the diffuser that&#x27;s described as &#x27;diffuser on, light off&#x27; ... well, the &#x27;light off&#x27; setting still emits a fairly bright blue light. I don&#x27;t like any light when I&#x27;m going to sleep, and since I often diffuse lavender at night, I really can&#x27;t leave it on. That&#x27;s disappointing, so I&#x27;ve just started turning on the diffuser while I sit in bed reading/watching TV, then turn it off when I&#x27;m ready to sleep. I&#x27;d really like to be able to run it as I fall asleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really lightweight and does not overheat no matter how long it&#x27;s on. Love that it automatically shuts off and I enjoy the colors you can set it to. I recommend it to anyone who likes aromatherapy and doesn&#x27;t want to keep spending money on candles and incense. It&#x27;s really easy to use and it keeps pet odors at bay. I got a couple of essential oils and I always use the lavender one to give me a great nights rest. No complaints on this product whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Really, great, easy to use. Lasts several hours. Wish I could turn the colors off or have an option to have no light. Other than that, no complaints. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like this.  The trouble is it only lasts a couple of hours.  Water reservoir is small.</li>
            <li> I love my ZAQ! I put it in my office and have gotten so many compliments on it. If you want to add instant zen, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on February 26th and initially I loved it.  But it&#x27;s now May 12th and its started functioning improperly.  The unit will only sporadically let me change the light setting to the night setting and then it turns itself off after only 30 seconds or so.  I just looked to try to return or replace the diffuser but it is no longer an option to do this.  I am really disappointed, especially considering the price of this item.</li>
            <li> This is an exact diffuser product I had at work that is a replacement, because it was misplaced.</li>
            <li> Perfect diffuser. The white is a nice bright, clean look. The color change on the diffuser is very pretty, and it has the option to pick the color as well. We use it in our bedroom and our daughter&#x27;s nursery. It is so wonderful to diffuse scents (like eucalyptus when you have a cold).</li>
            <li> I bought their essential oil and used the suggested five drops; could not detect a fragrance.  Our house is very large so I put it in our library and changed to an orange essential oil - still not much of a fragrance.  Used 20 drops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it is you never know when it runs out of water - I&#x27;m all over the place and set a timer so I can come back and check on it.&lt;br /&gt;wish it had a better output.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and very quiet.</li>
            <li> Purchased on Oct. 21, 2014 and it stopped working on Dec. 6.  So it only lasted 1 and half months:( Loved it while it was working.  Unfortunately, I read the reviews after it stopped working.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.  Have only used one essential oil blend to date for sinus relief.  Have terrible allergies and wanted to try something different than taking allergy medicines that can have other side effects, like increasing blood pressure.  Only use at night so far to breath better and it has worked.  No worries to run at night, auto shut off when liquid is dissipated.  You should be in dreamland by then!!  Looking forward to trying other essential oils!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little larger than I would like it to be and it is anything but inconspicuous.  It certainly stands out.  The colors on it are super bright, too.  It reminds me of the speakers my parents how in the 70&#x27;s that would pulse different colors to bands like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.  It does what it says it does - diffuse the oil and humidify the room.  I probably won&#x27;t but another one thought because it is just so large.  I bought a different one that was smaller and it seems to work better for what we would like to use it for - inconspicuous oil diffusing.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I use this in my office.  Would like something larger for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> We love it.  We have used different oils in it and it&#x27;s so relaxing to smell and watch.  It would make a great night light.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted  thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product until it stopped working after only 6 months of use and I barely used it! It is completely dead and does nothing. Very very disappointing considering I paid over $50. Nothing is more disappointing than over paying for a product that doesn&#x27;t deliver. I feel like I&#x27;ve been ripped off. Not a nice feeling. Don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t make these things last longer. My advice, look for another diffuser of better quality or know what your risks are. If it happened to me, it could happen to you.</li>
            <li> The Dew diffuser is very pretty, quiet and efficient! I am very pleased! This is a cool mist diffuser so can be used for therapeutic essential oils (hot air ones destroy the healthful properties of therapeutic EO&#x27;s). It&#x27;s very quiet and is easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> I added this diffuser to my Amazon wish list and received it for Christmas gift. I was loving it but today it just stopped working!? It&#x27;s less than one year old. Now I have to track down receipt from purchaser and find a way to replace it. :(</li>
            <li> I was looking for a diffuser as a Christmas present for my wife, but the ones i was looking at (with lots of good reviews) were either out of stock or didn&#x27;t have the colors I wanted. I actually read a bad review on another diffuser from Bombay Electronics, which was later given a good review because Bombay reached out to the reviewer and replaced the faulty product. This diffuser was was also from Bombay but had no reviews, but i figured they could be trusted to stand by their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife really really loves this thing. It changes colors, and you can set it to any color you want just by hitting the power button when it fades to the color you want. The design seems less intrusive than the taller ones I was looking at and looks pretty sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We keep it in a small bedroom (10x15ish), so i can&#x27;t speak to how well it would work in a larger living room, but it is more than adequate for the baby room or even our large master bedroom (15x15ish?? i&#x27;m really not sure off the top of my head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had no problems whatsoever technically with it (we run it probably 4-8 hours daily since Christmas, so about a month), and haven&#x27;t seen any &#x27;smell&#x27; hangover from previous oils, they pretty much evaporate out with each use. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Very good product....the wife has allergies, and this product does a great job of easing her suffering!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a medium speed like I thought it had.</li>
            <li> Love this, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It works wonderfully and is very colorful and soothing. Arrived promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Have had this for about a year now and I love it!  I joke that it&#x27;s my magic genie/UFO transporter.  It is easy to just lift the top funnel and fill the resevoir to the fill line so you don&#x27;t have to use the measure cup if you don&#x27;t want.  The button makes it easy to switch through modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the vapor floated up a little higher because I keep it on a side table and sometimes it seems to just puddle down around rather than taking flight.  I wonder if the ZAQ Allay Litemist would do better for getting the mist higher due to it&#x27;s longer funnel/top?  But really, It is simple and easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it lasts about 4/5 hours.  I like because I often want to keep changing the different oils scents.</li>
            <li> I love the product while it was working however, it stopped working after two months.The company handled the return beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! Been working perfectly since I got it several months ago. I also love the rotating colors. It&#x27;s cheerful!</li>
            <li> Diffuses the oil very well, the lights are relaxing but they don&#x27;t shut off. I followed the directions but the diffuser continued to glow a nice blue which in the middle of the night was too bright.</li>
            <li> wish I would have known more about these before I ordered this one I might have chose a different on. Runs out of water to quickly for me</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser it takes no extra things like cups or filters, like the pretty colored lights, the over all it&#x27;s great:-)</li>
            <li> Does a great job at diffusing our DoTerra Oils!!  We love the color choices and it is user friendly.</li>
            <li> I received one for Christmas and loved it.  Have since purchased one for my sister and one for my daughter.  They both love it!  It&#x27;s an awesome can&#x27;t go wrong gift.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I use it almost every night and love trying out different aromatherapy oils in it to lull me off to sleep. I usually use it at night so I only ever use the last setting (quiet with low light) and it does not keep me awake or distract me, if anything it helps me fall asleep faster. If you use it during the day you can also keep it on one of the other fun settings with the rotating light. My sister also has one of these for her baby boy&#x27;s bedroom and says that lavender is helpful for them both falling asleep (buy the extracts separately on Amazon). As a yoga instructor getting into Ayurveda, I also love this product for its ability to help me incorporate different aromatherapy extracts into my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to follow the package directions exactly. Only use filtered clean water (I don&#x27;t use direct from the trap) and don&#x27;t overfill past the line. If you follow the directions it will stay like new for a while, I have had mine about a year with no issues.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with my ZAQ Dew LiteMIst.  I had two very pricey diffusers from a top company and they quit working after sitting for a while.  I brought two ZAQ for the price of one of the others and they work every bit as well as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Awesome diffuser. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an excellent price! Does exactly what we need it to do, plus changes colors or stays on one color, depending on setting.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser. It would be even better if the off light position was really no light instead of a bright blue. This makes it less than ideal for someone who needs total darkness for sleep.The diffuser has a larger footprint than my other diffuser, but the mist is considerably more noticeable and circulates well within a 15 foot radius. Overall, I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> First use of a diffuser...so far so good. Like that it runs quietly.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter . She is MOST PLEASED with it - not only the actual diffusing action but also the calming and beautiful color changes !!</li>
            <li> my favorite part of this item is that it turns off when its done. it don&#x27;t take up much space its silent. i like the color changes on it. i woudl recomment this one highly..</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! I&#x27;ve been running it daily since I received it, and nothing but good things to say. The mist is just right for using it at your desk or workspace (where mine is set up), but I don&#x27;t know about it filling up a larger space(anything bigger than a bedroom?). The actual diffuser is small enough that I have it set up on right on my desk. I fill it in the morning (so easy) and it lasts almost all day. It does shut off automatically when it is out of water, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting about it.</li>
            <li> Easy to maintain, easy to use, does not shut down after some time like mentioned on some reports, just be careful to not get the electrical opening under the device wet, good amount of mist, nice colors, elegant design. The instructions suggest 3 - 5 drops, it happened by accident however I usually place 7 - 9 drops, just use a good quality aroma oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is attractive, sturdy, and easy to use, which I expected.  However,  I didn&#x27;t expect the beautiful, soothing colors that are displayed as the diffuser cycles.  The diffuser starts as soon as the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; button is pressed and automatically shuts off when the oil reservoir is depleted.  We use it in a large bedroom and it has plenty of capacity and runs for 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> Works great! It&#x27;s pretty good deal for the price. Much better than some other diffusers I have had. I only wish that it had a larger chamber for water so it ran longer in-between refills.</li>
            <li> Puts out a nice light mist.  You have several options for how you want to run it - with or without the light on and multi light change mode or single light mode.  My favorite diffuser.  Easy to clean and change your oils, etc.</li>
            <li> i love this diffuser and would recommend it for sure. i plan to buy more for my kids rooms. it stays on all night, it has an awesome night light. so easy to fill and easy o clean! it turns off on its own. great product!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors (if you like that kind of thing). I like the cool, fragrant mist and easy clean up of the water pod. Very easy to operate and makes me happy to use essential oils and not chemical laden room sprays.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this purchase. I love the changing colors and that within only minutes my whole office is filled with aroma. This product is great quality and easy to maintain. It auto-offs after it runs out of water--filled completely up it runs for about 5 hours.</li>
            <li> I love it! I even bought 3 of them  as  presents for my friends.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this product when it was functioning. I have other oil diffusers that you can only run for a minute or so at a time or they become too overpowering. This one is nice that you dilute the oils in water and it runs for about four hours. However, I have had it just over a year and it just quit. Not only do I have to buy a replacement now I have to throw this piece of plastic into the landfill. For $50 it should last much much longer.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! It lasts abou 4 hours.</li>
            <li> works great no problems.</li>
            <li> Purchased 1 and then 3 more as gifts. Use during the day, night, all day, all night ... easy to use, easy to change oils, clean.</li>
            <li> This product works really well and has a beautiful sleek design. I love that it automatically shuts off when the water is gone. The changing lights give it great ambiance. You can also hold it on one color if you wish. I really love the healthy and healing aroma of using essential oils, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this diffuser! Thanks for a great well-designed product!</li>
            <li> Fast startup, soothes the beast inside me, yeah essential oils are gonna be the new fad!!! High quality product however</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great! It does not create any moisture on anything around it and it lasts 4 hours if the water is filled all the way to the max line. The only down side is that the product claims that you can turn the light off, however, even in the &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; mode there is a dim blue light (and not just the power button) that stays on as long as the diffuser is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use diffuse oils at night when I go to bed but it&#x27;s too bright for me. I&#x27;ve started diffusing several hours before I go to bed so that my room still smells wonderful but I don&#x27;t have to try to sleep with that light on.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful diffuser.  I love the changing lights.  I originally had it sitting on a table about 7 feet away from me but couldn&#x27;t really smell the oils I was diffusing.  I moved it to a lamp table next to me and now I enjoy the lovely oils being diffused.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice. It changes colors automatically while diffusing. Works great, no problems have had it running almost every day since I purchased it. Very nice worth every $$$.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser, just add a couple drops of oil (a little goes a long way) - Lavender works great and the ZAG puts out a fine mist, filling the room with your scent. Easy to use &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Great value. Works just as well as described.  Came quickly and diffuses just the right amount of vapor and essential oils.</li>
            <li> The product is great. It&#x27;s portable. I went on vacation and was able to take it with me. I can move it from room to room. The lights are delightfully soothing as they change colors. It&#x27;s nice and quiet. It automatically shuts off when the water level gets too low. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because I wish it had a timer. It&#x27;s a bit petty, I know, so I certainly would not return it. I actually would buy another one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Excellent defuser works really well</li>
            <li> What a beautiful diffuser. I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for a few days. It is very effective at diffusing essential oils into the air and adds to the decor of any room. It&#x27;s also super simple and easy to use. We use it for the bedroom but it would be at home at a spa, doctor&#x27;s office, living room or anywhere else. On the regular mode the top of the diffuser changes colors but if you see a color you like you can push the button and the diffuser will stay that color. I am really glad I chose this diffuser. I plan to purchase a few more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times and it stopped working. Tried all the troubleshoot options in the manual but still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that the lights can be stopped on a specific color, or completely turned off if you wish.  Also, it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> I really liked this diffuser the first three times I used it, but the fourth time I plugged it in, it totally quit working and automatically shuts itself off without working at all. I was really hopeful about this item, but now, just very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Just as described and it works perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I love putting my lavender in there to fill up the house&lt;br /&gt;with the wonderful smell.  Very calming as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Definitely the best of all difusers I tried. Last eight hours, makes my room full of smell with my doterra oils and like the amount of vapor that makes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this diffuser for about a month and I love it. Folks who said it works immediately weren&#x27;t kidding. I have primarily used lemon, lavender and peppermint oil in it as that&#x27;s supposed to help with sinus/allergies. Boy does it! It&#x27;s amazing. I felt like I could breath easier in five minutes. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting that. Truthfully I thought it&#x27;d be a pretty gadget for my desk and help create a spa like atmosphere while I work. The fact that it works so well (at least with the oils I&#x27;m using) is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried it with tangerine oil, which isn&#x27;t as potent (lung wise) as the other combo, but it fills up a room with a very pleasant scent and energizes me. I keep it on my desk in my office and my husband said he could smell it in his office next door. So it definitely works to fill up at least 400 sq. feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on getting another for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it.  This is our first diffuser and it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Such a great product! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This machine is very calming and smells wonderful.  The first time I tried it, it lasted for 5 1/2 hours and really did shut itself  off.&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely easy to use and to clean.  I love it!  Angel</li>
            <li> have loved using this diffuser - easy to use, clean and keep pumping through the awesomeness of essential oils!  I have been very happy with lighting options as well; super fun and a great way to help the unwinding process at the end of the day</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Easy to use. Lasts longer than another item I bought.  A larger unit would be nice but definitely NOT a deal breaker!!</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a month then switch would not operate. We felt very disappointed we really liked it. Going to try new brand. Mary Beth</li>
            <li> This diffuser is easy to use and effective. It has 4 different settings that switch by pressing the top down - off, misting on with light changing colors, misting on with color fixed and misting on with light off. We have used it a lot at night and I found that even when it is in the 4th setting (where the light is supposed to be off), there is a blue glow coming from the diffuser which is not ideal if you like to sleep in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We initially grew interested in a diffuser because we wanted to diffuse lavender in our daughters bedroom to help her sleep. While this is a nice diffuser, it only runs 3-4 hours. We also have the Stadler Form Jasmine Essential Oil Ultrasonic Aromatherapy Diffuser and that is what we use in her room because it will diffuse all night. We use this ZAQ Diffuser for diffusing other oils during the day or at night when we are sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to diffuse for shorter time periods (3-4 hours) this is a nice option. If you are looking for diffusing for longer times, I recommend the Jasmine Aroma Diffuser.</li>
            <li> I had been using two little oil burners with the tea-light candles, but there were several things I didn&#x27;t like about them: They take a long time to heat up and emit an aroma; They use a lot of oil in comparison to a diffuser; The tea-light candles make me nervous around my 5-yr old and two cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching several brands and reading all the reviews, I decided to try the ZAQ Dew. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It works from the moment you press the button! Initially, I was using about 6-8 drops of oil and I couldn&#x27;t quite believe that 3-5 drops would be enough, but the old adage of less-is-more is true in this case. I had to learn the hard way after using one of my scented oils and ended up with a headache. I love the fact that instead of wasting at least 30 drops of oil a day in the oil burners, I can use a total of about 15 drops, at most, in a day and really and truly smell it throughout my home. I like the Dew so much that I take it into the bedroom at night to diffuse lavender, chamomile, and clary sage... or sandalwood, bergamot, and ylang ylang. Peppermint and lavender are wonderful to get rid of a headache, too... but back to the review. This diffuser holds 80 ml of distilled water, and it comes with a nifty little measuring cup with 80 ml&#x27;s marked on one side and 100 ml&#x27;s marked on the other. The first press of the button turns it on with the color-changing cycle. Then, if you want a specific color, you wait for the color to come around and press the button again to make it stay. The third press of the button turns off the color rotation, but it will still emit a bluish glow. It&#x27;s about as strong as a night-light, but doesn&#x27;t bother me when I&#x27;m trying to sleep. The fourth press of the button turns the unit off. With 80 ml of water, I&#x27;ve found that it runs for about 3-4 hours. The auto-shut off is also a really nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this unit is a breeze! You just need to make sure that if you have water to pour out that you don&#x27;t pour it over the spot that has the small one-inch slit. Then you just wipe it out with a soft cloth. I&#x27;ve been using this almost non-stop for three days. If anything changes with the quality of the diffuser, I&#x27;ll update my review. But, so far so good!ver the spot that has the small one-inch slit. Then you just wipe it out with a soft cloth. I&#x27;ve been using this almost non-stop for three days.

            <li> I got one few months ago and I loved it so much that I had to get my mother one too. I use it every night in my bedroom. I also use it in the living room. All my friends ask me where I got it from, and who ever that see&#x27;s it ends up ordering it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size and does a good job at diffusing oils into the room. I will be buying more for other rooms.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is the best I have ever used. I started using essential oils from NYR because their prices are very low and their oils are of better quality than some of the supposedly \\&quot;therapeutic grade\\&quot; out there (which is a made-up certification and doesn&#x27;t actually mean it&#x27;s safe to ingest the oil!!).&lt;br /&gt;3-4 drops of Essential oils lasts about 2 hours! Perfect for massage therapy sessions, meditation groups, evening relaxation and any other use! If you are switching to NYR Ke</li>
            <li> I bought one of these diffusers early this year and liked it so much that I&#x27;m buying another one for another room in our house and a third one as a gift for a friends office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is an aesthetically beautiful item that works well.  It diffuses oils nearly instantly, gives enough steam to replace a humidifier, lasts for hours, gives off a pleasant aroma while changing colors constantly (which adds another pleasant dimension to the senses) and works very well.  It also automatically shuts off when it runs out of water (it does run for several hours on one fill up of water).  I already bought a second one and I&#x27;m thinking about buying one for every room!  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It would deserve a 5 if it actually got dark, but even with the colored light off, it glows brightly blue through the cone from the on/off switch. Too bright for a dark sleeping room. We ordered a replacement to confirm that it wasn&#x27;t just the first one we got. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes a nice burbling noise and effectively diffuses scents.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about. All features work as expected.  I want to give this as a gift to family and close friends as my &amp;#34;product of the year&amp;#34; for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser on December 30th, 2013. I used it frequently, but always made sure I cleaned it and took care of it since I wanted it to last a while. That being said, I was extremely disappointed when it stopped working yesterday. I have tried several times since then to turn it back on, and it will light up when the button is pressed but never actually comes on. I can&#x27;t believe this diffuser was over $50. For that price, I believe it should have lasted at least a full year! I will not buy this product again. Guess I&#x27;m on the hunt for another diffuser :(    Update: After extensive research, I discovered it just needed a ceramic disc replacement. The disc was only $6, so everything&#x27;s fine now!</li>
            <li> I love this! My friend recommended I get it and put Bergamot or lavender oil in it to help with my anxiety and it really does make me feel better! I love the light color changes, too. My favorite are the purples. It is very easy to use. I even put eucalyptus in it when my daughter was sick with a cough and it helped her.  Buy this!</li>
            <li> This is my second diffuser that I have ordered like this and it broke after 2 months.  I am very disappointed with this issue because the price wasn&#x27;t cheap.  I would recommend getting one from the grocery store if they are going to break down this fast.</li>
            <li> There are lots of diffusers on the market..I am an oil distributor...I really like this model...pretty lines, colors can be on or off, very quiet and diffuses fine mist. Oils should never be heated or burned...they are to be diffused with cool mist like this. There are only 3 in all the many out there I recommend...this is one that will do the job and last...easy operation and effective!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully love this so much I ordered two more</li>
            <li> I actually bought two, one is in the family room, the other in the bedroom.  My husband uses it every night with essential oils.  I like that it has a setting for minimal light.  The other one we had was too bright for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> Super quiet as it promised(ultrasonic). I use all my Doterra essential oil with this product and my life has changed. I just turn it on right by me during computer activity and any symptom I had ( use Breathe for allergy, Lavender for stress, Peppermint for headache) get healed. It shuts off automatically when water&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> I get so excited to try new oils &amp; start this diffuser every morning! It&#x27;s very quiet &amp; really pretty &amp; makes my entire downstairs (or upstairs - each level is about 2400 square feet) smell wonderful! And I really like how it starts diffusing as soon I press the &#x27;on&#x27; button. It also lets off cool moisture instead of hot (like a humidifier would) which is perfect for our toddlers when they get close &amp; curious. My favorite oil to pair it with is Edens Garden &amp;#34;four thieves&amp;#34; oil. I bought one for me &amp; also for my best friend to enjoy &amp; she loves hers too after a long day at work &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Bought 2 0f these attractive Diffusers couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase. Function &amp; Form soundless to use plus you can use anyone&#x27;s essential oils and that&#x27;s a PLUS.</li>
            <li> LOVE this diffuser! I have two myself and buy it often as a gift for friends and family, along with some of my favorite essential oils.  Love its shape and the series of colors while it&#x27;s in use.  Reminds me of a genie coming out of a bottle when the mist comes out the top. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this and wished I had stumbled upon it much sooner. I was desperately searching for something that I could use at home as a fragrance that wasn&#x27;t going to slowly kill me. Plus, this hero&#x27;s to soothe my migraines. I just add water and my oil of choice and...that&#x27;s it. Great product...just a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Great transaction. works well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love these diffusers.  They look and work just as described. The price is better than I have seen for some of the others on the market.  I have two, and also purchased one as a gift for my daughter, because she was so taken with mine.  I plan to purchase at least one more, eventually, so that I can have them in more rooms of the house.  I love essential oils, and feel so much better about diffusing them, as opposed to burning candles and potpourri tarts with synthetic chemicals.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Bought if for my daughter.  She loves it.  This thing cranks.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s so relaxing and calming. I sleep better and my room smells amazing. Very easy to understand just add water and a couple drops of oil to the middle then put the cap on and hit the button. Lasts for about 5 hrs</li>
            <li> This fills pretty much my whole 800 sq ft apt with whatever aroma i want to smell. I&#x27;m rather satisfied with my purchase. It does have a light blue light tho while its running no matter what, so that can be annoying for someone who needs absolute darkness to sleep, other than that it has a nice light mist that comes out and last a few hours before needing a refill. I kinda wished it held more water and lasted longer</li>
            <li> I originally wanted a natural-like smell source and the commercial solutions were just not hitting the mark. When I saw this mist aromatherapy device and smell the scent was immediately in love with it. I searched for the best option in Amazon and went with this one as I went over the reviews. I have now a month with it and they work fine and provide the scent as I first experienced it. The only down side is the sound they make and that is the reason why the 4 and not 5 star rating. I use it on my night table over night and is a bit &amp;#34;noisy&amp;#34; (nothing exaggerated but when you are sleeping!!&lt;br /&gt;I now have a wide selection of essential oils and mix and match them for a very good night sleep every day...I mean EVERY day and it does help.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd diffuser and I really wish, I would of got this one first.  If I had, I wouldn&#x27;t of gotten the other two.  This one is quiet, it mists for a long time and the auto shut off is very nice.  I also like that you can choose to have the lights on or off.  Very nice product, would order again.</li>
            <li> Super good purchase. Fast shipping. Loved the product. A+++++</li>
            <li> We use this diffuser every day. Works great!</li>
            <li> Does the job and works really well, just turn it on, sleep and it automatically turns of itself.</li>
            <li> Worked for 4 months. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This WAS fantastic but it lasted less than 3 months.  I read other reviews talking about its unreliability but because on the whole it got 4 and a half stars I figured they got unlucky.  Clearly not though because I got this for Christmas and we haven&#x27;t even made it until the end of March and this morning it just won&#x27;t switch on.  $50 for something that lasts 2 and a half months is outrageous.  So so so dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser works magic when it comes to aroma therapy with essential oils. The diffuser is easy to set up, and works right out of the box in less than 3 minutes (I had to get some distilled water because our tab water is a little mineral rich).&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews already explained the different colored light settings. I like the colors, but I most appreciate the auto turn off on this diffuser. The machine does indeed turn off when the water is low. No worries there.&lt;br /&gt;The water chamber holds 80ml of water + a few drops of the essential oils. I use lavender and peppermint with rosemary to create a refreshing and uplifting aroma throughout the house... And this diffuser delivers on that expectation.&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely order another one as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional information added 6/12/14:&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying another diffuser - the SmileyDaisy Essential Oil Diffuser - for our bedroom. I thought the interval setting on that model might be helpful to extend the usage time through the night and I wanted a smaller footprint for the diffuser on the dresser...&lt;br /&gt;In comparison I have to say I prefer this ZAQ Dew LiteMist for four reasons: (1) the ZAQ is virtually noise-free. No humming or motor sound at all - the Daisy on the other hand does have a slight sound to it which is notable especially at night in interval mode. (2) The ZAQ is very easy to refill. I can do it with one hand while having the grand baby in the other arm. The SmileyDaisy requires definitely two hands as the cover locks into place. Not convenient at all - I have spilled some fluids twice now when I tried to open it. (3) the ZAQ has better mist output than the SmileyDaisy (4) the ZAQ just looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ZAQ added an interval setting to this model and if they reduce the footprint of the diffuser just a little bit... It would be absolutely perfect :)</li>
            <li> We are using this to diffuse essential oils and it&#x27;s amazing.  Very easy to control and sexy and sleek, THNAKS!</li>
            <li> I had to return this diffuser but bought another one on amazon. I used this one 1 time and for some reason it wouldn&#x27;t work afterwords. Not sure what the issue was but I liked it while it worked :-/</li>
            <li> I use this in my office. I get numerous compliments. I use a different essential oil mixture every day. I just use filtered water and add a few drops of oil. Simple, but awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this!  Works great, easy to use, and has lasted several months now being used almost daily. I plan to get another for other rooms!</li>
            <li> Needed a diffuser for the bedroom and this one was perfect. I like the option of turning the lights on and off, though when  light is in &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; mode, it still glows blue. So if using at night, may not want it somewhere you will be able to see it. Pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Saw this machine from a massage place. I like the way it designed so went on line got one. Love this machine.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing it holds about about 8 ounces, runs for about 4 hours and has various light settings. There is always incense or scented oils diffusers going in my home. I am using a pine oils as I type this for the earthy nature smells on this cold winter day. I am currently using Lavender for its calming effect, Peppermint and Eucalyptus because I am almost always stuffy they are both very beneficial when you are feeling cold/flu symptoms as well as promoting overall relaxation. They are a must in the winter for me. This little gem is in my living room because it is small goes with most decor easy to tuck someplace and enjoy the essential oil of your choosing great after a stressful day of work/kids/pets/life ect.&lt;br /&gt;There is an oil for almost everything for skin,to ingest, to diffuse, I suggest you check it out they have been used long before modern counterparts.</li>
            <li> Hubby basically stole this diffuser from me!  He loves it.....the diffuser works extremely well scent-wise, and the fact that the diffuser continuously changes color is really cool looking.  We have tried a good dozen different oil diffusers (flame, electronic, you name it) and this is by far the best one we&#x27;ve owned.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So easy to use. Very quiet. The lights are so calming. I have recommended several friends to get this. I have been using it at bedtime. Now I can&#x27;t wait for bed every night!</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser for my birthday from friends.  I specifically requested the ZAQ brand, since it had so many excellent (and so few negative) reviews.  I have been using it for almost 2 months, and it is wonderful.  So much so, in fact, that I purchased the ZAQ Mirage for my den/family room.  The main difference between the two models, as far as I can tell, is that the Mirage holds 2x the water.  My daughter has since stolen the Mirage and taken it to her room, so it looks like I will be purchasing her a Dew  for her birthday. (The Mirage is almost too large for a bedroom,as it can be overwhleming in the amount of scent it puts out in a small space).  The diffusers are both sturdy and well made, and I like the options of having the lights on or off.  There is no pause for the transmission of the vapor, which some people like, but otherwise, this seems to be a perfect diffuser.  I am thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day and she loves it too! I use mine mainly as a candle replacement; so I recommend picking Essential Oils from aroma specific companies. I purchased my essential oils through a company that offered the set titled &amp;#34;Best Of The Best&amp;#34;, unfortunately they recommend using their oils for cleaning, on your body, keeping bugs away, etc. That was a nice variety and all but out of the 14 box set, I only like the way 3 of them smell in my oil diffuser :( So it was a big waste of money. I also have to use double the amount of drops to get the same effect as my favorite brand : Young Living. They are extremely pricey but I highly recommend using their oils in this ZAQ diffuser. I will buy this product again, and Bombay Electronics is a very speedy, quality packaged shipper.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in the Zaq diffuser.  I bought one last year and had to send it back a month or two later because it failed.  Amazon fully refunded my money, so I bought the same style again.  It lasted only nine months and it too went kaput.  (The &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch would not stay engaged.)  Two of my cousins use the same style and brand and they&#x27;ve had theirs for over a year and a half and are still happy with theirs.  I love the style and ease of the Zaq, but I&#x27;m hesitant to try a third time, so regrettably I&#x27;ve ordered a different brand that I don&#x27;t like as much, but it gets great reviews on Amazon and hopefully it will perform well.</li>
            <li> This is great for your desk or by your bedside.  The smell fills my medium sized bedroom when on my night stand.  Keeps my desk area smelling fresh at the office.  Runs for hours.  Very cool design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY CON:  This light &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; mode is still technically with a light on.  It&#x27;s a nice, low blue light but it&#x27;s still on.  Then the on/off button is a super bright blue so that shines really bright especially in a dark room.  It works well and I cover the blue light on the button.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is Great!!  It fills the room with the scent I add.  It turns off automatically when it is done, which I love.  Then when I need to I can just add new scents.  The 80mls of water lasts about an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at work today after so you good with my Totera oils and it works wonderfully. Complements from all!</li>
            <li> Its very pretty but its so small it doesnt even diffuse an hour. And the coird arrived with a short in it. Amazon always stands by their products and I have ASKED TO REPLACE THIS DIFFUSER. Pretty but way too small.</li>
            <li> I was a bit Leary at first because I did&#x27;t know too much about this item or the oils associated with it.  I am now learning more than I thought I would.  This product is wonderful</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can use essential oils with the diffuser, but I find the container very small and it lasts only 4 to 5 hours. I love the design and wish they had one in a bigger size, same design.</li>
            <li> I use this diffuser every morning and evening with my YL essential oils. It has performed way beyond my expectations. It runs forever on a small amount of water, the lights are soothing and interesting in dim lighting, and the lid is easy to remove. I will definitely purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these diffusers: one for myself, and one as a mother&#x27;s day gift. Shortly thereafter, I received a beautiful thank you from mom telling me how thrilled she was with her very special and unique gift. I second her enthusiasm! I just love mine, and I use it nightly with some pure lavender essential oil to relax before bed. What a treat! Sincerely, Mary Ann P.</li>
            <li> Get this now!! I cannot even begin to put into words how amazing this little thing is! I have been using a reed diffuser and soy based candles for the past few years to deodorize the air in my home, because I wanted to steer clear of synthetic chemical based products. The reed diffuser technique works, but the scent doesn&#x27;t travel very far within the room, which is a bummer. So unless you have a very small room area (like a bathroom), or are sitting within a 4 ft range, you really wouldn&#x27;t get the benefits a nicely scented home. Candles of course, worked great to fill the whole room, but my husband wasn&#x27;t really a fan because sometimes the scent was a little too strong for his liking. Another reason I haven&#x27;t used candles in a while is because I have a small child and am scared that he will get curious and start a fire. Fast forward to the ZAQ Dew Litemist… I just received this product today, and not only was it super simple to use, but the effect of the essential oil scent dispersing into the room was IMMEDIATE! My husband walked into our bedroom and was shocked at how amazing it smelled in there just 10 minutes after I plugged it in. The entire room smelled great! And there was no overpowering scent, which is what my husband hated about the diffusers (when you were standing next to it) and candles. For reference, our bedroom is about 14x18. I am in love with this little machine and am so thankful for all the great reviews that helped me decide on this particular one. I am definitely going to purchase another one soon to place in our living room. Love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li> JUst received it and so far pleased with my purchase.  The mister lasted several hours on one fill which impressed me since another brand diffuser we have only lasts about half that.  The color changing feature is also impressive</li>
            <li> I use this every night in my bedroom. I love the different colors that it transitions to. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Several friends have purchased them after visiting my house.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this little thing! I&#x27;ve been into aromatherapy for years, and this is the best unit I have come across. I love the sleekness of it ~ kind of reminds me of a genie bottle:) ~ I think it&#x27;s really cool to have the option of different settings for color. The mist is very, very fine. Amazingly light, but powerful depending on what essential oils you choose. Please, though, use essential oils, not *fragrance* oils. Those are synthetic and just diminish the whole point of this unit in its entirety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the auto off feature too. I especially liked that when I looked at the size of the reservoir...it&#x27;s rather small...so I thought it would need to be filled constantly. Very pleasantly surprised that it really doesn&#x27;t! I&#x27;ve yet to run it where it shuts off automatically. I&#x27;ve had it on for at least four hours straight, and it didn&#x27;t shut off, or use a ton of water/oil. I really like that the cord comes out from the bottom(ish). It doesn&#x27;t stick out of the diffuser. I love the subtle sound of trickling/bubbling that you hear as it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very large living room and the scent wafts gently through the entire room, drifting a bit into my foyer and my dining room. It would be great, I think, for any room in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on what you want to achieve, research essential oils. Lavender is great for relaxing and is currently the EO we have in the unit. I also have a &amp;#34;relaxing&amp;#34; blend by Aura Cacia. You might think that essential oils are expensive, but you only use a few drops. The bottle lasts a long time and totally worth it. I highly recommend this unit!</li>
            <li> It took me awhile before I decided which diffuser to purchase, I originally thought I was going to get one of the more expensive diffusers from Young Living or Doterra, however the reviews were not as good as I had hoped, and I have a friend who has the Young Living Diffuser and she told me she has to replace it every six months, and that really doesn&#x27;t impress me much, so I thought after reading reviews on every diffuser, I chose this one because the ratings were the best and I thought even if I did have to replace it in six months then at least I didn&#x27;t spend as much on it as some of the others.... So far, I&#x27;m really impressed with this diffuser, I use it constantly, day and night, and since it automatically stops when it runs out of water, I feel comfortable leaving mine on at night when I&#x27;m sleeping, it says that it lasts between 3-4 hours, but mine actually has lasted as much as 6 hours, perhaps I have a lesser amount of mist that comes out of mine, I don&#x27;t know, but I do know that it is enough because it doesn&#x27;t take long for me to start smelling the oils once I turn it on. I do use ONLY Distilled water in it because I don&#x27;t want to take a chance that our water will make it corrode, and so far it&#x27;s been a good decision especially since it&#x27;s going almost constantly and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems with it. I do like that it has multiple colors and 4 settings and that if you want to let it continue changing colors it will or if you want to set it on a certain color you can or a very low light bluish color, that&#x27;s possible too. I mainly wanted a diffuser because I have health issues and I have been using oils topically for awhile now, but I knew I could get even more benefits from diffusing the oils in the air, one of my health issues is my thyroid, and lemongrass, peppermint and clove mixture is very helpful for that, so I put 2 drops of each in my diffuser and have that going as I write this, but I switch them out and change them for whatever I feel I need at the time, whether it&#x27;s oils that help me sleep better at night or oils that help rejuvenate me or oils that help keep us from getting sick, or oils that help with depression, whatever the need may be at the time, but I do use this particularly for my health and find it to be extremely helpful, we also enjoy the more pleasant smells in the air since we do have dogs, birds, a cat and fireplaces in our home, we no longer have any unpleasant odors that having pets and a fireplace brings. Currently, this diffuser seems to be hard to get, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because it has been more in demand right now or what, but I wanted to purchase one for my daughter and since this one wasn&#x27;t available, I chose the taller ZAQ Allay diffuser in blue for her, which would have been my second choice, so I may even try one of those as well in my house since I am thinking that I should purchase a second one so that I&#x27;m not moving mine from the bedroom to the living / dining area a couple times a day, it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it would be nice to just leave them where they are.... all in all, this has been an awesome choice for us and will always want to have a diffuser now that we see just how wonderful it is to have one! This really would be an ideal gift for someone, I know my daughter sure is happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I wanted another one of these and they have been hard to come by lately, I decided to purchase the ZAQ Allay diffuser in Blue, which is a very soothing color blue, I love it! In fact, I have purchased 2 extra of the Allay diffusers as gifts as well and the recipients are thrilled and have told me numerous times how much they LOVE their diffusers, both in blue as well. I really have to admit that I like the Allay better than the Dew diffuser, the one concern that I&#x27;ve had about the ZAQ Dew is that it will take 6-7 hours to completely use up the tiny amount of water that it holds, and since it says that it lasts between 3-4 hours, I felt that I must not be getting the proper amount of mist coming out of it...and the one thing I do notice with the Allay is that I do get better misting out of it and I can definitely smell the oils better than I can with the Dew, so now I&#x27;m considering returning the Dew (if I can) and replacing it with another Allay, the Allay is taller as well, narrower at the base, but much more appealing in the long run, I didn&#x27;t really expect to change my mind on this but I must admit I&#x27;m now a huge fan of the ZAQ Allay diffuser, blue is my personal preference, they also come in Orange and Pink, but Blue is so calming, I love it!</li>
            <li> This mister does a great job I use filtered water so it doesn&#x27;t have a problem with calcium</li>
            <li> It works, but disappointed it will not work with a plug in timer as it has no timer settings and for therapeutic purposes you want it to go on and off every 30 min. This one doesn&#x27;t even have any timer settings at all. Hardly any water so it doesn&#x27;t last long either. I had high hopes but am very disappointed and cannot return it. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I heard about this brand of diffuser from a family member.  Checked it out myself on amazon, read the reviews and compared to other diffusers.  I decided to go with this one, it had the best reviews and pricing.  I love the style of the diffuser, it&#x27;s options for light changing, having one color on or turning it off.  it is nice and quiet with just a little water noise but it has been soothing to me and my kids.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like at first was that when you select the mode to turn off the color lights, it still has a dim blue light on from the on/off button, but after a few nights we got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting to get another one for my house as well.</li>
            <li> I turn this on when I go to bed and it is still going in the morning which I love. Runs longer than described by seller and looks great too. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> The ZAQ Dew Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser is a fun, modern way to eliminate the odors in your home.  The simple sleek design is very eye catching and setup took only a few minutes.  Pull the diffuser out of the box, fill with water from the measuring cup provided, add 3-4 drops of scented oils (not provided), plug it in, push the button, and presto! --  your house is smelling fantastic!  I had a few friends over right after I got the diffuser and they loved the fact that it changed colors and were instantly intrigued by the design. The device has an auto shutoff (when it runs out of water) as well and you can also adjust it so that it will scent but not have the light. The only thing I do warn about is that unless you are trying to do a quick coverup of your stinky kitchen, perhaps only use 2 drops of oil and be sure to put the machine away from any food.  The first few times I ran the diffuser I set it on the kitchen table and, while eating a quick snack, I found myself being a bit overwhelmed by the scent. After moving it to a different spot and adding a little less oil, I find that it works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love scented products and have used many different types for creating that ambiance and atmosphere throughout my home. This one adds moisture to dry air as well, which is especially great during the winter months. This diffuser would make a lovely gift.</li>
            <li> I got mine about 3 weeks ago and I love it.  It&#x27;s super simple to use.  It&#x27;s cute and the lights are really cool.  The only little thing I wish I could change is when you put it on the &#x27;lights off&#x27; setting, it still has a light that shines fairly brightly and lights up the room.  This wouldn&#x27;t normally be a big deal, but I have it in our bedroom and love to run it most of the night and the light is annoying.  Other than that I highly recommend this particular diffuser.</li>
            <li> I’ve always hated using candles and incense because the burning smell always gave me a headache. And truly, it’s not good for you to inhale smoke so my house has always been scentless. However, once in a while, I do crave for something to awaken my senses, just something natural and not overpowering. Lately, I’ve stumbled upon essential oils and added a few drops to jojoba oil to make a nice scent for my hands, but I’ve been at a loss on how to scent the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this diffuser solved that problem and solved it handily. I have a two story, 2500 sq. ft. house and once I turn on this diffuser, you can smell it just about all over. It’s not overpowering at all, but a light scent kind of permeates the house. On the first day, my husband came home from work and noticed immediately (and he almost never notices things like this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser only uses 80 ml of water so I thought it would not last long, but so far, I’ve been able to get over 7 hours for each use. Also, the color changing aspect just fascinates my five year old son. He’ll sit and stare at it, this small little smile on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this diffuser are the instructions. They are written in such poor English that one can only conclude it was originally written in a different language and then in an effort to save money, they used Google Translator instead of hiring a real live person. It’s laughably funny in some parts.</li>
            <li> I have this  beside my bed and put in two drops of &amp;#34;Tranquil&amp;#34; Plant Therapy Essential Oil at bedtime.  It operates for about 3-4 hours and shuts off automatically when it&#x27;s out of water.  I usually have it on the first setting which allows the LED light to change colors.  It&#x27;s soothing and it works well.  Mine looks just like the photo when it&#x27;s in operation, with a fine mist coming out of the top funnel.  I have it setting directly on my wood nightstand with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is such a rip off:  $55 for a diffuser that ran out of water in 20 minutes, and only diffused fragrance for 5 minutes.  How useful is something that has to be refilled every 20 minutes?  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this diffuser.  It has a great sleek and modern look.  The color changing option is nice.  It is very small but fills the entire room with fragrance.  I had to check Amazon often, because these are constantly in and out of stock.  I will be buying another specifically for my bedroom so I don&#x27;t have to keep moving it at night.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of different reviews for different diffusers and this one lives up to its reputation. We use ours almost everyday and we haven&#x27;t run into a single problem! Very happy</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser I use it in the bedroom for relaxation. My daughter uses it in her classroom with a germ fighting essential oil to ward off germs!. I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one before to compare it to, so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.  Other than that, I am very pleased with it.  It&#x27;s quiet, shuts off when it&#x27;s empty, the color choices are nice or none if one chooses.  Very easy to operate, nice size and looks decorative.</li>
            <li> Immediate fine mist comes out. I like that it&#x27;s cool. Safer that way, avoids burns!  Even my doterra rep asked me where I got it.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Works well, great lighting, long enough power cord to fit where I want it. Only wish the power light was NOT SO DARN BRIGHT! You can turn off the changing colors to just have a light blue hue, but I can&#x27;t fall asleep unless I put something over the blinding power light. Easy to add water and oils. Not too much mist but does the job very well for a large bedroom.</li>
            <li> The aromatherapy mist diffuser has varied options that should appeal to a wide range of users. The ability to change the light from one color to several alternating colors to no light at all makes it quite versatile. The reservoir is eady to clean and the light mist carries the essential oil without depleting the water too quickly. The diffuser does not get hot so there us no danger of burns which would be a good feature with curious children in the home.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many diffusers none have I been happy with --  However product shines where others have failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to [[ASIN:B000G7SJUA Pearlessence Spa Mist]] the ZAO wins on every metric except for size of footprint in the highly valued bathroom vanity real estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the ZAO and compared to the Pearlessence&lt;br /&gt;-- ZAO has a very clean neat look&lt;br /&gt;-- By far more durable (the bottom of the Pearlessence broke off and while still functional it was annoying)&lt;br /&gt;-- The ZAO has a very quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both do a good job of dispersing the scent&lt;br /&gt;Both have a nice light / color feature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Zao has a slightly larger foot print - that and the price are the only down sides.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Zaq Dew for a few weeks now and love it.  This is my first cool diffuser.  I use it several times a week, sometimes twice a day.  I didn&#x27;t think it would run very long since you put so little water in but it actually runs for 4-5 hours.  My favorite EO&#x27;s to use in it are peppermint mixed with vanilla.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is wonderfully efficient and calming.  The colors change slowly and the YLEssential oils are dispersed so as not to be overpowering.  Best feature is the auto shut off when the basin is empty.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my husband LOVE this product. Well worth the cost. I get lots of compliments on how my house always has a nice fragrance. The changing colors are a nice touch and a pretty accent piece. Love the idea of auto shut off..the fragrance is not over powering but instead soft.</li>
            <li> We purchased this as a second diffuser to our DoTerra one.  I am happy to say that it performs just as well as my more expensive one.  It is a little larger than I thought it would be but I don&#x27;t mind that.  It runs quietly and shuts off when empty as expected.  Good purchase, good product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several diffusers and returned them.  This is the one that works (so far) the best.  Very quiet</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Very pleased with performance.  Have used it nearly every day and it has work very consistently.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t take up much space and runs quietly--you may notice a small bubbling watering sound if it is very quiet in the room you are in, but this is relaxing in itself and not distracting. The mist comes out instantly. I would say to put in around 4-7 drops of essential oil in when the water is at the full level (although the higher end of this range will be too overwhelming for some and may nearly &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; your eyes a bit). For a more subtle scent, use 1-3 drops of essential oil. I didn&#x27;t know that the light changed as well. This is a neat feature, but can be turned off while still keeping the diffuser going. You can also lock in a color as well. This is all done simply by tapping the power button. Shuts off automatically when it runs out of water/essential oil. Highly recommend, although I see they&#x27;ve come out with one with more capacity for the same $$.</li>
            <li> This is a good diffuser.  Easy to use and clean.  Auto shutoff and the changing lights are cool.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It worked for the first few hours and now it must be unplugged and left alone for a few days before it will stay on for longer than 5 seconds.  I haven&#x27;t contacted the manufacturer because I threw all the packaging away as soon as I got it, but will do so now that they asked me to leave a review.  For the price, I was able to diffuse a room initially.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser as I am new to EOs.  I really enjoy this because there is no heat to worry about and it cuts off automatically.  It really only covers a bedroom size area but that is where I use it so it is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. It stopped working after a few weeks. I have emailed the company several times and have had no response.</li>
            <li> Gives my bathroom a spa feel.</li>
            <li> I got this to use with my Native American Nutritionals essential oils. I&#x27;m not entirely sure of their therapeutic benefits, but I like being able to scent my home with something natural that won&#x27;t give me a headache. (Never got into the Scentsy thing.) I liked that one of NAN&#x27;s oils is for attention/concentration. I found that one smelled pretty good and any oils without carrier oils will work good with this diffuser. I researched other diffusers, including Young Living, and I found this one to be the most attractive and cost effective. I&#x27;m currently using this diffuser in a studio apartment and if fills the room (about 400 sq feet) with a light fragrance with ~5 drops of (undiluted) essential oil.</li>
            <li> It works great, clove is my go to oil just because I love that holiday cooking smell. Will be purchasing a few more!!!</li>
            <li> Works well nice features but the wide base takes up too much space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews of this product and made the decision to buy it. I HIGHLY recommend it. There are diffusers for 3x as much money but this works perfectly. A little hint - I thought the unit was broken after using it all day. It went off on its own and then when I pushed the button it would only go back on for a second. I was bummed and thought it was defective. It turns out the unit was out of water and it has a feature to turn off automatically when the water is gone. So 80ml more of water and a few drops of essential oils and I was back in business. I&#x27;ve now used it almost nonstop during the day each day and it is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Best aromatherapy diffuser ever! Quiet, and easy to use and clean! Love the different settings for light, and the fact you can turn off the light at night!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for a week and love it. I would have given it 5 stars if the light would actually turn off, but it doesn&#x27;t; the off light is a deep blue and unfortunately it keeps me awake so my daughter got this lovely diffuser. All the color chooses are a nice touch and the mist goes straight up into the air, works great.</li>
            <li> I have several diffusers and this is my FAVORITE. I like the changing lights, and the diffusion is just excellent. Filled my entire house (or shut the door and get extra benefit without house diffusion!</li>
            <li> I use it every night and it runs great. I thought the light turns off though which is does but still glows bright so it makes me husband upset as he likes it pitch black. But overall it runs great, never leaks, and looks great.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I ordered on Friday mid afternoon and my item was delivered on Saturday around noon.  I love my Dew LiteMist  Aromatherapy.  Thank you for the wonderful product (which was on sale) and for the fast delivery.  Excellent review for you for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on diffusing.  It makes my house smell wonderful and I know I&#x27;m not inhaling chemicals.  The changing lights are a wonderful calming effect.  I like that refilling it is super easy and I don&#x27;t have any problem getting the &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; off like I&#x27;ve read with other brands of diffusers.  The design is sleek and modern as well.  The &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; mode is still pretty bright in a dark room, however, which is one of the reasons why I gave four instead of five stars.  The other reason is because in the end, I would like a model that has the option to delay puffs of mist every so often, but this model is a stay on only.  Overall this is an amazing product and every house should diffuse essential oils to purify and give a fragrance instead of buying chemicals to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works really well. It probably runs for about 4 hours before needing to be refilled. It&#x27;s easy to wipe out and keep clean, and it seems to work well with any type of oil. The great feature that allows you to turn off the light was one of the reasons I purchased this diffuser, although it&#x27;s important to know that the backlight for the button never turns off, so even when the cone is not lit, the button is. In a completely dark room, the backlight from the button does glow brightly and adds a soft glow to the inside of the cone, so when it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s never completely dark. Not a problem for me, though; totally happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with build-up or mold. I wipe it clean once a week. Looks good &amp; has been reliable.</li>
            <li> The ZAQ Dew LiteMist Diffuser is easy to use and works great.  Anyone who uses essential oils like lavender for sleeping (like a baby) needs this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Using EOs the fragrance travels, covers a large space and depending on the oil can smell in my upstairs bedroom.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this little thing! I took it to the hospital when my mom had surgery- was there for 2 weeks- I wanted to help her stay relaxed and help the healing process along (which is why I opted for a cold diffuser- so as to not compromise the quality of the essential oil). Not only did she Iove having it in her room, she got SO many compliments and questions about it from the drs and nurses! It even got them talking about the benefits of alternatve medicine (what- at a hospital!??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought this might be a little pricey- but not the case- so worth it! It runs a long time, about 4-5 hours! I use 5-7 drops of oil, diluted in the water, per use. I usually keep it running all day at home- my boyfriend (not into essential oils)- very big fan- swears it opens up his sinuses, just by having it running (use quality oil)! As far as coverage goes- it does a good job with our 15 x 15 ish size living room, but not much beyond. Sturdy, legit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, I like the option for the lighting.&lt;br /&gt;The essential ouse diffuse very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another another one for my mom!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. I wish it was a bigger reservoir so it would run longer and it does make a small room smell lovely.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping- received it in one day. I was so excited, I decided to use it right away. It was simple to use, and the scent filled the room quickly! My favorite part about it is the lovely color changing mode and how elegant it looks. So relaxing! So far so great, and I am 100% satisfied with it. If something happens with it however, I&#x27;ll post an update. All in all, I would definitely recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I would return this item if it weren&#x27;t too late. Though I purchased quality essential oils, using this small, lightweight diffuser I don&#x27;t smell them. Even turning the lights off, one light remains too bright for the bedroom. When I think of what I paid for this, it&#x27;s barely worth half its price.</li>
            <li> It works great with my essential oils and the changing colors are a plus. Loaned it to a friend so really miss it</li>
            <li> Love this little thing!!  I saw this reviewed on a blog that I follow (yogabycandace.com) and Candace posted a great review on all aspects of this item.  I love the ease of this product and it is silent, works so well to scent my home and best of all - has an automatic shut off when the water runs out!!  No worries!  The cool colors are also very pretty and soothing, you can have one or all colors, or you can have no color rotation at all.  I also bought KLS Natural set of 100% aromatherapy oils from Amazon and am very happy with them.  I am buying one of these diffusers for work too!</li>
            <li> This little diffuser works well.  We love it.  Actually my son took it to his room, I may need another soon.</li>
            <li> I love putting my EO in this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Exelent condition it wirks very good it is a litle small but it works you start feling the aroma afert a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Works well. The light can be a little annoying.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Very calming lights. Along with a good scent. Nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after tons of research and reading of product reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.  The unit has a nice look to it and is compact and lightweight and had plenty of steam coming out, however, the high-quality essential oil I was diffusing could not be smelled AT ALL.  I thought it was just me, I tried leaving the room and coming back in several times and still nothing.  But when a friend stopped over later and my husband returned home from work, I asked them if they liked the smell and neither had any idea what I was talking about.  There was literally no scent unless you stood right next to the unit and bent over and smelled the steam coming out, and even that was scant.  The room I was trying to fill is a small living room as my townhome is very tall and narrow.  I don&#x27;t even think this product would be effective in a small bathroom or office.  Prior to purchasing this diffuser, I was using an oil burner from the dollar store and all of my family and friends say that was much more potent than this product.  I am returning this one and have ordered another product based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  It is just so baffling to me why this has such good reviews when it has such a poor performance quality.  Usually I can trust reviews and have never been this disappointed in a product that is rated so highly, but this is clearly not the case with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it&#x27;s big. I have smaller ones that actually last longer. This one goes for several hours though.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly.  Very aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> I use this every night by my bed.... love it!  And the different color changing light is so pretty!</li>
            <li> The past few years I have increased my interest in oils, buying a few here and there and trying them out. I always wanted to try a Diffuser so I was thrilled to be able to review this one. Upon opening it I noticed it was a nice size, very well made. Simple instructions were included as to how to use it.  It comes with a water cup but you must supply your own oils.  I had lemon on hand. I put the water in and a few drops of the lemon oil, turned it on and within seconds I had a wonderful aroma filling my room. Simple as 1-2-3-.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now another feature of this product is the wonderful light show that goes on. The top part of the Diffuser changes color, green, blue and several others. It&#x27;s very pleasant to watch, very peaceful, and your room smells wonderful. I am going to get some more oils now that I have such a wonderful Diffuser to use. This is well worth the money, it&#x27;s a great product that will help you feel better, live healthier, and improve your mood. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3KKD25SGCFDZ4]]I&#x27;m a novice regarding essential oils and the concept of aromatherapy.  I had in fact purchased lavender essential oil several weeks prior to receiving this product as I kept reading about the relaxing qualities of lavender essential oil.  I quickly realized from the pungent smell that I would need to do some research before using the oil as the smell is too overpowering in its concentrated form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This aromatherapy essential oil diffuser is one way in which to dilute the oil and better appreciate the concentrated scent.  The diffuser does NOT arrive with any oil samples.  Buyers considering this product will need to also purchase an essential oil to get the full benefit of the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attached video provides a demonstration of how the product operates.  I find it very relaxing and incredibly easy to use.  I&#x27;m considering purchasing a \\&quot;variety\\&quot; pack of essential oils to continue to experiment with the many scents available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own very limited experience has taught me that less is more when using essential oils.  I initially experienced insomnia with my lavender oil when I would use 5-6 drops in the diffuser.  When I reduced it to 2-drops, I really enjoyed the aromatherapy experience and my sleep insomnia disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admittedly thought this looked really strange when I first unpackaged it (sci-fi flying saucer type strange). It&#x27;s compact design however (approximately 7\\&quot; wide - 4\\&quot; high) makes it fairly unobtrusive and the 6 foot long electric cord is convenient.  My water source is hard water that is softened by a salt water softener and thus far, I have not experienced any problems with residue build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it is a very nice product - I only wish that the company would have included tiny samples of essential oils to experiment with.  I&#x27;m many years away from my college days however I couldn&#x27;t help but think that a lot of college bound youthful students would love this product because of the soothing scents, sci-fi look, and the changing colors (goodbye lava light - hello aromatherapy essential oil diffuser).</li>
            <li> Lighting is bright in dark room and pleasant; the aroma is subtle.  Few moving parts; not exposed metal subject to corrosion, so I expect this useful device will last long enough for me not to feel cheated.  Purchase a variety of concentrated oils and you are ready to enjoy a bit of the outdoors in your enclosed and possibly stuffy room.</li>
            <li> This works very well as an aroma diffuser and the color cycling is slow enough not to be pleasant and not annoying, unlike some other products I&#x27;ve bought. However, this is not a humidifier and it won&#x27;t put enough moisture into the air to help with dry skin or allergies. Its function is to diffuse aromatic oils and for that it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser comes with a plastic measuring cup for the water that&#x27;s marked with milliliters on both sides (no English measurements). Filling it is easy: just take the plastic cone-shaped top off, pour water from the measuring cup into the diffuser, replace the top, and turn it on. Pressing the power button once turns on the mist and the light cycling. Pressing it a second time fixes the color of the LEDs, so you can turn it on, wait until your favorite color shows up, then stop the color cycling. The colors range from turquoise to deep blue, light and dark green, and red. There&#x27;s really no orange or yellow. Pressing the power button a third time turns off the LEDs but keeps the mist on. However, the power button still remains lit, and the LEDs are on at a very low setting, so the diffuser will not be totally dark. Pressing the power button a fourth time turns everything off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mist comes out of the diffuser almost immediately. My advice is not to get curious and take the top off while it&#x27;s running. Okay, do it once: but make sure you have a paper towel handy. I had to peek inside at the LEDs and the thing splattered water on my desk. It&#x27;s not designed to run without the cone-shaped top in place and there is NO leakage when it&#x27;s used as directed. But you know, you have to peek at these things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some essential oils and I put a few drops of tangerine into the water. How strong a smell you get will depend on how much oil you put into the diffuser and what kind of oils you use. You should be able to use both essential oils (real plant oils) and perfume oils (synthetics, alcohol-based fragrances, etc.). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend dumping a bottle of cologne into this, though; make sure that what you use is suitable for use in a diffuser. You may want to search for &amp;#34;aromatherapy&amp;#34; if you want suggestions on what kinds of oils to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fairly easy to clean because the top just lifts off and the water chamber is easily wiped out with a paper towel or cloth. Maybe a teensy bit of baking soda could be used to help remove any oily residue, but I&#x27;d avoid scratchy cleansers or scrubby sponges. The diffuser is lightweight and easy to pick up and carry into the bathroom or kitchen to pour out any remaining water, too, so it&#x27;s not a real pain to take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as decor goes, the diffuser is pretty modern looking, but it kind of looks like of like a genie lamp when the mist starts coming out of the top. You see the mist in the photo? It really does look that way., etc.).

            <li> Easy to use, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  We&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  No problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute!  But what a disappointment.  I got this for my birthday and was so excited to use it.  I filled her up and turned it on right away.  Everything seemed to be working perfectly.  A nice fine mist was coming out. The lights were changing .  My room smelled divine.  But before it even ran out of water, it turned off automatically.  And that was all she wrote.  It wouldn&#x27;t turn back on at all.  I let it &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; hoping that would help....nothing.  I completely dried it out, unplugged it and plugged it back in trying several different outlets in the room...nothing.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one at all unless you want to spend this kind of money for a product that only works a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Great for a bed side diffuser but not for big rooms.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my 87 year old mother&#x27;s bedroom because she was having trouble sleeping.  She loves it and leaves it on all day now.  So I got two more-one for my son&#x27;s dorm room and one for home.  My son loves his as well and here at home if I forget to turn it on my husband does.  We all love this little gem.  Diffuses whatever scent you want and the lights are really cool.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser except for the fact that you can&#x27;t smell the scent for a very long time after it starts. I think the MAX time the scent diffuses is about 2 hours, with the recommended 4-6 drops of oil. That&#x27;s a bit disappointing. Also, it doesn&#x27;t really scent the whole room, so you won&#x27;t really get the full effects unless you are 20 ft. or less away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love the shape, and overall function.</li>
            <li> I love how it changes colors. My grandchildren also feel soothed by it. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The only thing I wish was different...the setting where you can turn the light off and have the diffuser running still lets off enough light in our bedroom that it makes it difficult to sleep if you need a pitch black room. Other than that, I have no complaints. It meets our needs perfectly and I&#x27;m about to buy one for my mom and one for our babies room.</li>
            <li> Low noise, Perfect for single room. Just wish it had a little bigger capacity - to make it through the night. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great and using it several times a day. Will be ordering for family members next.</li>
            <li> You might think of bundling opportunities with tie-dye artists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, honestly, I didn&#x27;t really read the description of this on Amazon, and when it arrived, we were all talking about lava lamps ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product..improvement might be to put this on a stand--the higher you can get it, the better it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks folks</li>
            <li> I saw a frend se one of these for her son who had a cold.. I bought one for flu season, as I do not take flu shots.. this.. used with the proper essential oils.. has kept my family well all season.. AND.... the colors are very cool to watch too! ;)</li>
            <li> I was given a different brand of diffuser, as a gift, a few years ago. I had never had a diffuser before, but felt a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t diffuse my oils very well. The old diffuser died a few months ago, so I purchased this one, after reading good reviews, and I love it. I have used it for my kids, when they were sick, and to just make my house smell better. It diffuses the oil SO much better than my last diffuser! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The picture of the ZAQ Dew pretty much looks like the Mirage without the plastic base around the bottom, probably added to keep it stable.  Anyways, I am thoroughly enjoying the ZAQ Mirage.  I am just slightly worried about the longevity of it.  When I first took it out to try, I followed the instructions. Add water to the line, add oil drops, plug in.  Push the button to start it and a brief flash of light, then nothing.  Pushed button to start again, and it ran about 5 seconds and shut off.  Rechecked the connections, and after about 3 minutes, it starts working like a charm.  It just seems a little fiddly to start every now and then.  I thought I read somewhere on another review that it takes a minute to warm up kind of thing, but that doesn&#x27;t sound like it happens with everyone.  Still, it makes a great mist and the 4-5 drops of oil do a great job of filling up a room.  At night I put it in my bedroom, in the daytime it goes in the kitchen/living room.  I think it runs a good 5-6 hours on one fill up of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mirage does not come with a handy filling container, that would have been nice, but livable without it.  I don&#x27;t use tap water, just filtered water and make sure to dry it out when it runs empty.  The instructions that come with it are extremely basic.  I have been using oil blends from Edens Gardens, one of my favorites is Joy, which contains bergamot, geranium,  jasmine, lemon, mandarin, palmarosa, chamomile, rose,rosewood, sweet orange and ylang ylang.  Wow,, all that goodness in one inexpensive bottle.  They have so many other great blends and sell them on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this diffuser and really hope it lasts a long time, and that my issue with it turning on is just a quirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; **UPDATE** After less than 1 week of having it, its quirk has turned into a problem.  It won&#x27;t turn on...unless I continuously hold the wire tightly against the adapter when it is plugged in.  And to be honest, I don&#x27;t feel like doing that for 3 hours.  Plus the slightest movement and it turns off.  I think the unit itself is fine, the adapter is a piece of junk with loose wiring inside. GRRRR.  Looked for similar adapters in my house, but none with the same volts and output. Shame that something that should be easy to work ends up being another poorly made item, and not cheap at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Another UPDATE**  The company, Bombay Electronics did respond to emails about the adapter and promptly sent a new one in the mail. The wiring to the new one feels more secure, and the diffuser started up immediately without any issue or hesitation.  Thank you Bombay Electronics.  Rating upped to a 4 again.  I did also purchase a[[ASIN:B00GP9ZE10 Samyo 100ml Aromatherapy Essential Oil Purifier Diffuser Air Humidifier with 4 Timer Settings &amp; 6 Colors Changing Light]] for another area of the house and was pleased to see the adapters are the same.  I must say I do like the ease of use of the ZAQ Mirage better than the Samyo.  The Samyo seems to work fine, and it is cheaper, but I would keep the ZAQ one over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***May 2015*** The diffuser has worked perfectly since the new adaptor. It might  get used once or twice a week, and probably hasn&#x27;t even been cleaned properly, but it lights up and spews the delightful aromas every time I turn it on.  5 starsslightest movement and it turns off.

            <li> Really easy to operate and my apt has a lasting lavender fragrance when I use the lavender oil. So relaxing and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Just opened the box and set it up, so these are first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE: I chose the Dew after coveting the MUJI diffuser at their website, but even on sale with shipping MUJI&#x27;s small diffusler came close to $120. At under $50, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Dew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPEARANCE: The photo doesn&#x27;t do the Dew justice. In fact, the photo looks cheesy, but the unit itself, though lightweight, is attractively and simply designed. I put ten drops of essential oil in (the pamphlet suggests up to 5) and it&#x27;s scenting my room very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE: It&#x27;s about 8 inches across and about 4 inches tall. It has a nice sized footprint and is very stable. I didn&#x27;t want too large a unit and this takes up as much space as if I&#x27;d stretched my fingers out and traced around the tips to form a circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR: The unit I bought is pure white, and no color is evident until you turn it on. The color changing feature sounds tacky, but is really quite soothing with the shift in colors almost mesmerizing. Instead of staying on a single color for very long, they blend together and change so you get dozens of shades as the unit transitions from color to color. And the agitation of the water inside the unit provides an undulating, fluttery look to the lighting; it&#x27;s not a completely solid glow, it has a subtle flicker. I like the fact that you can push the button and freeze the Dew in a single color mode; with all the transitions, it gives you unlimited options to change the lighting to match your mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VAPOR: It&#x27;s very fine, and if you place your fingers right at the exit hole at the top, the steam comes out slightly warm, but two inches above it has no distinguishable temperature. The vapor is very fine and dissipates quickly -- it reminds me of those old &amp;#34;genie in a bottle&amp;#34; stories. This doesn&#x27;t really humidify, which I didn&#x27;t want -- I just wanted the aromatherapy benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOUND: There is a very slight noise when it runs -- a very mild hum that is not at all distracting, and the movement of the water creates occasional droplet sounds. It&#x27;s almost like white noise and I don&#x27;t imagine it would be a problem to fall asleep to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been running it for a solid hour and the water level seems to have barely budged, so I can&#x27;t say how long this will run until it runs out and shuts off, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and would highly recommend it. If it avoids the problems others have mentioned about not running after a while, I would say this is a fantastic buy.y mild hum that is not at all distracting, and the movement of the water creates occasional droplet sounds.

            <li> I really like this unit.  Easy to clean, looks nice and operates for 4 hours non-stop.</li>
            <li> This is a really good diffuser that looks very nice to.  You will get compliments on this diffuser if anyone sees it.  It also does a great job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this diffuser--although it does not put out a strong scent, it is easy to use and adds a nice light aroma when used with STRONG essential oils.  Not good with oils that are already diluted though... the effect is too weak.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is very quiet.  It works great.  The colors are very pretty and I like the fact that you can change it to one color or  none.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it turns off when done. It is exactly what I wanted. I am really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. You can choose the settings of either light color changing, light color staying, and no light. Scent carries through out the kitchen and living room. (My whole downstairs in townhouse). I love the color changing option. Quite lovely.</li>
            <li> Used it twice and it simply stopped working.  Amazon was nice enough to refund my money.  I bought my mom one too, and it seems that hers is working fine.</li>
            <li> I have had this diffuser for several weeks and i love it.  I have not problems with it except that it only lasts for a few hours but it does shut off automatically.</li>
            <li> I love these diffusers.  They are very simple to operate and they do a very good job diffusing the essential oils with distilled water.  I have purchased the home diffusers (several) through  that were the young brand.  They were difficult to use, and they never  worked that well or lasted very long.  And they were very expensive.  This one I just purchased  is my most favorite so far, and family loves them too.  Price is very good .</li>
            <li> Use it with my Doterra essential oils. Love this diffuser. Easily fills the room with the fragrance. Gives you a spa atmosphere. I use Serenity blend at night and Citrus Bliss during the day - and we use it almost everyday and it is going strong. Doesn&#x27;t get hot or ruin any surfaces - I often set it on top my wooden jewelry cabinet so my toddler can&#x27;t reach it. I haven&#x27;t tried too many other diffusers, but so far I feel I can highly recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works great. Mist, color changes and sound help an anxious teen relax and sleep well.</li>
            <li> Really nice diffuser!  I have had absolutely no problems with this and it does a wonderful job diffusing essential oils.  I love that it shuts off when it is empty!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works perfectly and so easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Works just as described and the colored lights are very relaxing to watch.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one that the on button broke.  I am going to another diffuser.</li>
            <li> AND it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise, as other commentors have here as well, that if using in the bedroom, set where you can’t see and use the no-color option. It does still emit a light, but not so bad that you can’t sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sits low, so tipping is not at all a problem, as with other taller ones on this website (although I also bought a much taller one, which works just a well, with no issues of tipping...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love it, and would buy again. I think the price is slightly too much, but otherwise, love it.</li>
            <li> We love this diffuser! The color changing is nice but not too bright - makes for a nice nightlight in our sons room. It last for several hours and is silent! It&#x27;s a modern design would make it a neat addition to any room. I wish I had another for our room - we might have to steal it once in awhile.</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser. Its very easy to use and has a  nice design.  The changing colors are very soothing.</li>
            <li> Works well, it&#x27;s quiet, and the lights aren&#x27;t too bright.  I&#x27;ve only had this diffuser a few days but I&#x27;ve used it at least twice per day.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.  I would definitely recommend this diffuser to anyone looking for an affordable purchase.</li>
            <li> Use this almost every day and have had many comments from visitors as to how nice my house smells.  What i like about it is that it shuts itself off when it runs out of water.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it very much since I got it, but the few times I have it has worked very well. The primary reason I bought it was increased humidity when I sit at the computer and I like the fact that it puts out a soft, quiet diffusion. It does not last for 8 hours like I read in an earlier review, but it lasts around 4 hours for me. And it shuts off automatically. I like that. I also like that it has a low profile and a small footprint.</li>
            <li> I give this a 5-star rating.  Not only is it efficient, it is also a nice decorative piece for my home.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  It is now a part of our family time in the evenings and on weekends.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the first of its kind that I&#x27;ve bought.  Some time ago I decided that burning candles in one&#x27;s home is not a healthy practice and, until, now I was unsure about an alternative.  Together with the excellent brand of Essential Oil that I&#x27;m using in the infuser, I am thrilled with my purchase.  Excellent design, easy to use, and does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the diffuser, it is very quiet, leaves a mild smell in the room, water will last about 3 to 3 1/2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy customer.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome mister. I would recommend it everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!  Is affordable and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift for my mother in law as I already have one for myself and I LOVE it. I have tried other diffusers and this one just seems to work great. Scent lingers through the whole room and it is easy to clean and easy to use. Highly recommend. If I decide to buy another diffuser for my home, I will definitely be buying another Zap Dew LiteMist.</li>
            <li> Looks cool. Piece of poop breaks within a month.</li>
            <li> Received the diffuser in a timely manner, but stopped working after one week. The &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button did not work.&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser will no operate because the button remains depressed and will not start.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser exceeded all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to use: I mean, really really easy to use. Fill up the little measuring cup with water, dump it in. Add a few drops of essential oil or a blend, press the button, and vapor immediately begins to float from the spout and dispenses into the room quickly and silently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to clean: Dump out any leftover water, wipe any remaining oil residue out with a tissue or a towel. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Soothing: The diffuser has three options for the lights, rotating through a few different muted colors, holding on one color of your choice, or no lights at all. You can cycle through these by pushing the one and only button on the device, and the fourth click will turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Works great as a nontoxic way to put a nice scent in the air (without the smoky residue candles can leave on the ceiling) and also has wonderful health benefits. Choose oils according to the effects you are going for. I love citrus and lemon scents when I need a mood lift, and it is lovely to disperse eucalyptus/peppermint oil in the bedroom when my kids have a chest cold. Since it doesn&#x27;t heat the oil all the benefits remain, and I don&#x27;t have to worry if my kids touch it. It does not get hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a wonderful little diffuser. My only problem is finding the ideal place to put it. If I put it in the middle of the kitchen island I have to deal with the cord, but if we put it under the cabinet the vapors don&#x27;t escape into the room as well. That&#x27;s really a minor issue though, and I&#x27;m super happy with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.  It does everything it says it does.  If you have cats, please research how oils affect them.  I found a lot of information saying that oils aren&#x27;t good for cats.  For that very reason, I must (sadly) gift the diffusor to my sister.  Otherwise, I would have bought another one for upstairs.</li>
            <li> have tried 3 different oil scents &amp; have added up to 20 drops (3-5 recommended) and still the scent isn&#x27;t noticed.  bust!</li>
            <li> This splendid thing has made me a devout diffuserist. By my bedside, it has helped with my allergies and maintained my sensualist identity. I thought the cats would freak out, but they don&#x27;t care. I like that it turns itself off. Use distilled water! To clean away yesterday&#x27;s scent, wipe out with a paper towel lightly dampened with vinegar, followed by one dampened with water or tears.  Resist parsimony and get high quality essential oils. I find DoTerra overrated, though. Amazon has some good deals on Edens Garden, and even if though they don&#x27;t understand apostrophes, I highly recommend their Clarey Sage, Basil, Clementine, and Chamomile.</li>
            <li> Love the colors at night.  Works really well</li>
            <li> Does the job, could be better looking but still less ugly than most of its kind !!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my diffuser! Perfection and I love the colors options and if you don&#x27;t want it to bright you can press the power buttons again and turns Navy blue. Love it</li>
            <li> Really like this diffuser, it&#x27;s quiet, has lighting options and is easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> Only thing is I wish it stayed on longer. BUT great product overall and we are very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love it . It&#x27;s a great room diffuser at a good price.</li>
            <li> Love it! Aromatherapy changes everything! I bought the NOW pyramid shaped one as well. They both work well, but the ZAQ is so cool looking.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. I especially like that it turns itself off. So I can fill it and forget it!!!</li>
            <li> Cool and sleek looking, quitet, perfect amount of steam, lots of light variations to choose from.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> i love it! I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I liked this at first and it worked well,but the machine broke after about 3 months of daily use. It just won&#x27;t turn on. I will be buying another diffuser but from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised! Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! It as a pretty shape and the different lights are a nice touch. It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do and provides great aromatherapy for any home.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.  It sends out a light mist into the air which does not condense on surfaces.  The oil diffuser effectively diffuses the essential oil/water solution in the air.  It creates a soothing atmosphere whether you allow the lights to switch or press the switch to keep a solid light.</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil diffuser! Before I bought this, I had another brand of diffuser, which lasted about 6 months before it stopped working. My feeling is, because of the build-up that can happen from use over time, the machine will last much longer if distilled water is used in it. Very happy with my purchase! Bought this recently as a birthday gift for a good friend.</li>
            <li> Like other people have said, it is bright! A little black duct tape helped. I needed something to run for 12 hours and this one was a good option for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Makes my bedroom smell great.</li>
            <li> I bought for someone else and until now there are no complains! Looks good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  I posted in another comment the set of oils I bought for her also. She has used it a lot.  It puts out quite a nice vapor.  Uses distilled water so you do not get a lime mineral build up or white dust.  Thank you to &#x27;W.T. Hoffman&#x27; reviewer for great tips and reviews and help in oil selection. Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> This diffuser holds a good amount of water, on average a &amp;#34;full tank&amp;#34; would last six hours. The vapor starts immediately when you turn it on. The design is simple, lightweight, and effective. I also did not notice any hardwater buildup as opposed to the model my  roommate has (mileage may vary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The blue &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; indicator light is very bright, and is disrupting to use while trying to get to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 STAR: I have to give a 1 star review— this diffusuer worked for less than one month. And for fewer than 20 uses. It now flashes but does not activate.</li>
            <li> It works well enough.</li>
            <li> This does a great job of spreading the aroma in my bedroom. Looks perfect too!</li>
            <li> Returned bc the light was too bright</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to essential oils, and I love this diffuser!  It changes color, but has a setting that lets you freeze it on a certain color if you like.  Other reviews have complained about a noise, but I haven&#x27;t noticed this with the diffuser.  It also automatically shuts off when the blend runs out, and I really like that feature.  Overall a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> it died, only after use for about 4 months...very expensive for such short period...loved it while it worked.  I had no indication it was dying just stopped working ... changed outlets to no avail...just quit like it was not getting any power.  I now put my oils in a pot of water on my wood stove, not gonna spend my hard earned money on this junk!</li>
            <li> Awesome diffuser ! Love it.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the diffuser.  Easy to use</li>
            <li> I bought the diffuser about 9 months ago and I have been using 5 days a week since then with no issue to report. I use it in my office. It lasts about 4 hours. I clean it up and dry it well about once a month with water.</li>
            <li> Well designed. Well-made for the price. Lets off a strong stream of steam for a long time before running out and fills my room with sent nicely.</li>
            <li> Good product! Very easy to use and looks special!</li>
            <li> This is my second ZAQ Dew LiteMist diffuser.  One for home, one for office.  I run it pretty much 24X7 and have no problems.  Puts a lite mist in the air with whatever EO I add to it.  The color changes of the light are fun as well.  My 4 year old grand daughter calls it my rainbow volcano!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been studying and using aromatherapy products for about 20 years now (I&#x27;m dating myself). I currently have at least 20 different essential oils in rotation in my house for various natural medical needs, cleaning needs, and and plain old I-want-to-smell-something-good needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser intrigued me immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve mostly used it with eucalyptus (for bronchitis that lingered) and peppermint (for the smell and for headache relief). I like that it&#x27;s quiet, and the glow of the light is soft and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the oils (don&#x27;t forget to add distilled water like I almost forgot to) easily permeates the room when the door is closed. Obviously it&#x27;s not powerful to diffuse the scent over very large areas, but when I leave my bedroom door open I can smell the scent as I walk down the hall toward my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I think it might be a tad overpriced (hence the 4 stars), but other people may feel that the price is exactly right. Still a good value, but with a lower price it would be a better value to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: 06/10/15 We still enjoy this diffuser. It&#x27;s still going strong, and works as well as it did when I first opened it. The kids turn it on as soon as they walk in the door. We now keep it in the living room and it&#x27;s a nice smell to anyone entering our apartment.</li>
            <li> I really love this little oil diffuser! It&#x27;s easy to use. I especially like Lavender scent at night. I also love the automatIc shut off feature.</li>
            <li> This is my first essential oil diffuser and I&#x27;m thrilled with it. Super easy to clean. Just wipe it out. I use distilled water in this since I have hard water. I have had numerous compliments on the design. I love watching the colors change, I find it so relaxing. And the BEST part is it starts working instantly! I can smell my essential oils within seconds of turning it on, so cool! It&#x27;s so incredibly fast, I want to understand how it works! haha. I currently have a blend of peppermint, orange and grapefruit in there and it&#x27;s very invigorating, and super potent! Next I&#x27;ll put less peppermint. I only put in three drops and I&#x27;m sitting 13+ feet away and my eyes are tingling from the peppermint, which is crazy! And awesome! My expensive essential oils go a long way with this and that makes me SUPER happy. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thank you for everything! Good price&amp; happy transaction !</li>
            <li> I am so, so happy with my purchase.  It is all that it is advertised to be and more.  I just can&#x27;t expound any more.  It is graceful looking, sleek and elegant.  A work of art, as well as a health benefit.</li>
            <li> Works great....all that was promised.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!! It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Could have done a lot better than this....light broke almost immediately....and has small capacity..n</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser - however after 4 weeks of occasional use it stopped working. I attempted troubleshooting with suggestions from ZAQ&#x27;a website to no avail. Many other reviewers have mentioned this issue, I wish I had paid attention and ordered a different brand.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife, only used it about 5 times and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I really like my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love this item bought another one! better then I excepted!!</li>
            <li> Easy to operate. However, I just wished it produced a lot more vapor.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser, it puts out just enough mist to scent a small area. When my little ones are sick I put it in their room with 3 to 4 different oils in it and they sleep well, and wake up feeling much better. Not designed for large areas but I mostly needed it for sick babies.</li>
            <li> This is actually really nice.  Now I understand all the good reviews. Nice to keep by a desk with some lavender oil.</li>
            <li> Best Defuser I have used.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I use it daily for several hours each day and it works well. Very easy to use and clean. My kids love the color changes.</li>
            <li> Really good looking, yet subtle. Works just as it should. If you are looking for a diffuser I would totally recommend this one. We looked at many different options but this one stood out. We are so pleased we chose it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE my ZAQ Diffuser! I took a Saturday and researched all the different diffusers out there and finally settled with the ZAQ after seeing how many were purchased and how many &amp;#34;5 STAR&amp;#34; reviews it had! It has completely exceeded my expectation! Love how it changes colors, love how it fills my entire room with my special oils scents. It seems to run for over 2 hours! It will shut off by itself when the water runs low which is a great tool to have! I have been referring this to everyone I know!! I HIGHLY suggest this diffuser! I&#x27;m buying another one to take to work!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Works as expected.</li>
            <li> It was okay while it worked, but, unfortunately, that was only for six weeks.  Even while it worked I thought it should have done a better job at dispensing the oil into the air - it just didn&#x27;t seem powerful enough.  $50 for six weeks of use is not a good trade off.    Update: The company has sent me a replacement unit that is working well so far.  I will increase my rating further if it proves longer lasting than the first.</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy some more of these for gifts.  Everyone, including me loves it.</li>
            <li> Just okay.  It&#x27;s cute and I love the color changes and the auto shut off but it didn&#x27;t seem to diffuse the oils throughout the room.  I had this in my kitchen on the table and entering the kitchen I could barely smell it until I got closer to the table which was literally only 5 feet away.  I have a smaller kitchen so this definitely should have filled the air.  I think this will work well in a bedroom where you can shut the door but don&#x27;t expect much in a more open area.  The manual says 3-5 drops of oil.  Forget that unless you are diffusing in a port-o-potty sized room!  That&#x27;s what I started with and I couldn&#x27;t smell the oils until I was about 2 feet away.  I put in about 10-12 drops to get it to actually go further into the air and it did but still didn&#x27;t fill the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my office, where I diffuse peppermint oil for mental focus. It is classy looking and works great. My only complaint is I wish the reservoir held 8 hours worth of water. I fill it every morning, but have to refill it at least one more time before the work day is over.  Also, I find the colored lights tacky, but that&#x27;s okay, because you can select just a clear light, which is what I do.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. It works wonderfully and is small so it doesn&#x27;t take much space. I use it in my kids rooms but I might get another one for my room.</li>
            <li> I like it, have two, and bought some for family members.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Goes for a few hours&lt;br /&gt;Puts out great aroma from oils&lt;br /&gt;Compact&lt;br /&gt;Can set colors, have them change, or off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Makes a constant sound sort of like a fish tank but more high pitch.  This is not noticeable during the day but at night it bothers me.  If you like fans, white noise, etc you will probably like this.</li>
            <li> has worked great so far! have it in my babes room. my only complaint would be the light doesn&#x27;t dim enough. but otherwise, it is quiet, and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Great product, all the features you expect from a product like this and more. Very effective, easy to use and excellent design. Does exactly what the label says. Very Fast shipping. Very happy customer, Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite Amazon purchase of the year. I used to burn incense a lot because I enjoy the exotic and complex smells until I began learning about its harmful side effects. That&#x27;s when I discovered the wonderful world of essential oils and diffusers. I use this one every day and have an ever-expanding collection of essential oils. My guests are commenting on how wonderful my place smells and I am happy that I can enjoy the fragrances without harming my health, but instead improving it.</li>
            <li> Works great and is very calming. We LOVE it.</li>
            <li> The shape and design is wonderful. I call it my flying saucer mister. It works great. I recommend it to anyone. Worth the money, it&#x27;s small and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is my first essential oil diffuser so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but I have been using this at least every night since I bought it about a month ago. I love this diffuser, it&#x27;s easy to operate, easy to clean, and shuts off automatically which I appreciate since I&#x27;m usually asleep when it runs out of water. The colors of the light are nice too. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 4 months ago. initially it was working fine, my wife was happy with it.  but now it does not work no more. this should be called disposable zaq dew litemist aromatherapy. if you are looking to buy a diffuser look somewhere else. this thing does not last for too long.</li>
            <li> Works great! Simple to use and exactly what I was looking for. Great value! I like the option to turn the colored lights on or off.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, hasn&#x27;t given me any problems in several months of daily use.</li>
            <li> very nice diffuser for the price has my kids huddled around it smelling all the oil awesomeness think my daughter will use it as a nightlight tonight I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s so easy to use, the mist is beautiful abd I can use a variety of aromatherapy oils. The light is soothing almost a dimmed nightlight. Affordable and small.</li>
            <li> I love it, the color of the unit is relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also choose to turn the soft, muted colors on (as pictured) and they change every few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this at home and can see how it would be a very nice item to place in an office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions were clear and simple. I do have one concern and hope that the manufacturer might address this in a comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is plastic. However, anyone working with essential oils knows how potent these condensed natural products are. So you would never store an essential oil in anything but glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most natural plant oils can actually eat away at rubber and plastic. I&#x27;ve had droppers for herbal oils get softened by the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m not sure how this could affect the life of this beautiful product, as the water and oil sit in a plastic container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m delighted, love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have for aromatherapy lovers. The size of this diffuser makes it perfect to have on a nightstand. I always place this next to my bed at night and add a few drops of a sleep oil blend. I do recommend using distilled water only to prevent minerals and other particles in tap and bottled water from clogging the system over time. Another nice feature about this diffuser is that you can choose how the light system works, including the following options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 1st press of the power button turns the unit on and changes through the colors&lt;br /&gt;* 2nd press pauses the unit on the current color&lt;br /&gt;* 3rd press turns the light off&lt;br /&gt;* 4th press turns the unit off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the water runs out, the unit will automatically turn off. The cool thing about this product is that it also functions as a mini humidifier. In the winter, this comes in handy to add moisture back to small rooms. If you like using essential oils around your home, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful diffuser, I love the shape and the light that you can turn on or off at your pleasure. Very stable shape, will not fall over I use it at work on my desk, and my desk at sometimes of the day is covered with work. I love the fact that it has such a low profile shape.</li>
            <li> Good working diffuser! Bought mine about nine months ago and it&#x27;s still going strong! A coworker of mine spent twice as much on her &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; brand diffuser and hers just recently broke.</li>
            <li> Already bought 6 of them. Perfect gift for friends and family. Works great!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I wanted to use it at night and it&#x27;s too bright even with the colorful lights turned off.  There still is an internal light glowing.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was as described.  I would buy from this seller again..  Works well.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. Beat my expectations in every way. The colors are brighter and the aromas better.</li>
            <li> Simple and Effective! I bought this for a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it. It is easy to use and easy to clean. The color changing is very soothing and the aroma is wonderful for a bedroom or other smaller room. If you put a more strongly scented oil in it, it will scent a larger space but it will be quite powerful in the room it is used in. It has an auto shut-off when the water is empty which is a nice feature. Even though it is plastic it doesn&#x27;t look cheap and we are very pleased with this product and with this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was right compared to some of the more expensive ones on the market. It is easy to clean, I love the sleek design and I use it almost everyday. The colors are soothing and I like that it doesn&#x27;t get hot so it&#x27;s safe around my 3 year old. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not only did the unit not work, it wasn&#x27;t even what I ordered! Instead of receiving the brand of item I expected, I received some cheap knockoff that that I could have purchased at other retailers for almost half the price. Not happy! Will not purchase from Downunder again.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. So easy to use and peaceful.</li>
            <li> Works well!  Love it.  No problems with it automatically shutting off after the water is gone!  Love that the colors change!</li>
            <li> Love my diffuser and yes it every day!</li>
            <li> I received this item on October 10th and it completely stopped working on October 13th. I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times.</li>
            <li> No issues. Wish the chamber was bigger to last longer, and the motor was more quiet but otherwise just fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and reliably does the job!  I have it in my cats&#x27; bedroom. :) It keeps things fresh in there.</li>
            <li> Love this and it runs almost every day in my kitchen.</li>
            <li> Silent, sleek and beautiful!</li>
            <li> This is a sweet little diffuser! Not too big, and the lighting options are fun and add evening, hygge-style ambiance in the living room where I have it set up. It does an excellent job of diffusing throughout the room (which isn&#x27;t small). I have primarily used with doTerra Wild Orange essential oil but also with Nature&#x27;s Sunshine Eucalyptus, and it worked equally well with each, so I feel like it will also work well with any other essential oil. The only things that could improve it  would be if it had a slightly larger water holding capacity, and if it was battery operated. Then it would be about perfect.</li>
            <li> I love it! It works wonderfully with my essentail oils! THANKS for the excellent service and reasonable price. I have recommended it to other friends.</li>
            <li> It took me no time to have the diffuser set up and running. It&#x27;s really quiet and looks nice sitting on my night stand.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser; it puts out a good stream of mist and the changing colors are enjoyable!  I have been using&lt;br /&gt;different essential oils in the diffuser and it makes my living room smell great!!!!  I live in Arizona so the extra humidity&lt;br /&gt;in the air is most welcome this winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser, runs for 4-6 hours on a fill, and is great with essential oils.  It can change lights automatically for color or you can select single color.  Nice quality, works great, I would recommend for the price!</li>
            <li> Purchased this item as a gift for my wife.  This unit is dependable, quiet, and puts out subtle mist that scents the air with oil fragrence used in conjunction with water.  The unit will run for several hours and then simply shut off when empty.  Overall this was a good purchase at a fair price and the design allows it to be placed anywhere.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very easy to use , my entire room smells delightful. Very affordable, and love the light changing colors.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was easy to use, quiet and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser is all three.  We love using it at night in our room with different relaxing and therapeutic oils.</li>
            <li> thanks from squareprint.com</li>
            <li> I purchased the ZAQ Dew LiteMist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser based on reviews. So far I really like it. The fine mist it puts out is just enough, especially when the air is dry.  I recently started to get into essential oils and thought this would be a great way to add scent into my home.  I also use EO for concentration or relaxing, etc. This diffuser is my favorite way to dispense the oils. The lights are bright and kind of fun. One feature I love is that it turns off automatically when it&#x27;s empty.  Maybe the worse part is that it&#x27;s kind of flimsy plastic, so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last. I hope a long time.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!  I use it everyday.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residual on the table.  The lighting is soft &amp; pretty.  Just wish it could hold more water do it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Just received my diffuser in the mail today. Easy set up and works like a charm so far. Can&#x27;t wait to use more oils with it. Oh, and the shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> I use this diffuser in my den.  It easily covers the area, and makes my living space smell great.  The changing colors are nice.  I may end up buying another one for the bedroom.  It works well and will diffuse for about 4 hours continuously.  It turns itself off when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and big but I have to keep a cloth under the unit and place it on a surface that can&#x27;t get wet because the steam flow is pretty strong and creates lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> The product description says that the light shuts off.  This is not true.  Even in the light off position there will be a bright blue light shining.  This is not a diffuser to use while trying to sleep!!!!!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 uses! Should have listened to the other 30+ reviews that reported that.</li>
            <li> LOVE!  I just got this for Christmas and I love how it makes my whole living room smell amazing.  It&#x27;s so easy to use; just take off the lid, and put in a small amount of water and 5 drops of oil.  Turn it on, and immediately you see the steam coming out.  I&#x27;m totally getting one for my office.  The colors are neat too, but really I don&#x27;t look at it that much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  I just saw it in use yesterday and I thought it looked great and it definatly put the scent throughout the room. I liked that it lit up and had the options to change colors.</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty diffuser ...we just love it and we already had another kind.  This one beats it though.</li>
            <li> I want something that radiates no light while I am trying to sleep. This does not have this option.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item!</li>
            <li> A bit big for our liking.</li>
            <li> It states it has a no light setting, but the blue on light is almost brighter than the other light. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this diffuser. It fills the entire house. Hopefully it will be durable for years to come.</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser.  So quiet and sends out the mist of essential oil just fine.  Kicks off after about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She started using it immediately that night and used it several nights in a row since she already had a cold and she used Eucalyptus aromatherapy oils in it that seemed to help her out quite a bit!  So far, we have been very happy with it.  It is a good size and she had no problems or complaints with setting it up and using it. The color-changing that it goes through has a nice soothing affect as well and I think contributes to a feeling of well-being!  I like the fact that it has an automatic safety shut-off system too!  I read quite a few reviews on different products prior to deciding on your product and this had a good rating by users, which ultimately helped me to decide on the purchase. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my diffuser. It really moves the aromatherapy oil around the room. I keep mine close to my bed so I can clear my chrakas at night. There&#x27;s another one a bit taller that I recently purchased and I love them both. Treat yourself to a mind cleansing. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I saw mixed reviews on this product but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I was seeking a way to better diffuse essential oils into my home. Well, this diffuser is not the answer. The mist that comes out of it is very fine and does have much of a humidifying effect. I could not smell my oil when I was a few feet away from the diffuser. I have a tea light burner that works much better. Returned because it did not give me the results I was going for.</li>
            <li> I like that the light lets you know it is on. Good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for a few months and I love it.  Bought one for my daughter and she&#x27;s very pleased with it too.</li>
            <li> Produce arrived timely, setup was simple.  The water capacity is much smaller than I anticipated.  However, the greater problem is it worked fine - the first time.  I tried refilling it and turning it on the next day, and it does nothing.  I tried everything I can think of to get it to work again to no avail.  I will be contacting the supplier for return, refund, exchange, whatever.  Not pleased with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter, and she had  raved about this product.  Works perfect, very attractive design.  Will be buying one for myself.</li>
            <li> Works very well - just wish the water/essential oil well was larger as it must be refilled every three hours.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this after extensive research into the different types. Easy to clean. Love the LED light choices. Automatic shutoff works great.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great! We use it everyday with Young LIving Essential Oils. It diffuses using water for about five hours and automatically shuts off when the water is gone. The shape is pleasing. I like that we can set the light to change colors or at night there is an indigo light that can be on by the bedside, which is not too bright. The scent fills the great room space and when I use at bedtime, it has helped me sleep better too. I will likely order another one soon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I love that it only takes 4-5 drop of my very expensive essential oil to fill a room with a wonderful fragrance. It operates very quietly and is easy to clean. One issue that I am sensitive to is the amount of light it gives out. We use this in our bedroom (with a lavender blend) and even in the &amp;#34;lights out&amp;#34; mode it glows too brightly for me. I alleviated this by spray painting the dome with a black spray paint and covering the button with a felt pad. The black dome actually looks very classy and the multi-color, when I choose to use the mode, still shows beautifully through the opening on top. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read many reviews on several diffusers before choosing this one, and I must say I am pleased in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it changes colour. I love how it is small and pretty. I love how it is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just what I wanted and I would have no qualms about recommending this to others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a proven fact, you feel better with pleasant smells in the air. Don&#x27;t believe me? Read any of the poets going on and on about alpine meadows and the ephemeral smells of nature carried on the breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the ZAQ Dew is so easy, a five-year-old could use it. I was surprised to note it didn&#x27;t come with any oils. A few drops of the oil mixed with water and you&#x27;ll have a great experience for at least a few hours. Five stars if it had come with a tester size of oil. Otherwise, excellent.</li>
            <li> I got this diffuser because I wanted to try to use something more natural for when we are sick.  I&#x27;ve been using the Vick&#x27;s plugins and they work just fine, but they are expensive and I don&#x27;t like that the plugin unit has a nightlight that is fairly bright.  Not to mention after being plugged in for several hours the unit is sometimes hot to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw this diffuser I thought this could be the answer I was looking for.  When I took it out of the packaging, which I have to say was very wasteful (but pretty) I was surprised at how cheap it felt.  Especially since the list price is close to $100.  There didn&#x27;t seem to be much to it, and I was really disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with any trial essential oils.  I was super excited to give it a try, and then couldn&#x27;t because I didn&#x27;t have any oils on hand.  It took me a few weeks before I remembered to buy them and by that point my excitement about trying it had lessened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, once I did try it it worked like a charm.  I love that the lighting is very soft.  The unit is fairly quiet when running, and shuts off when it runs out.  I like that.  One of the downsides is that it doesn&#x27;t have the capacity to run all night.  I wish I would have known that before buying it because most of the time when I&#x27;ve used it has been at night when we have colds to help breathe easier.  Overall I&#x27;m fairly happy with the diffuser.  Yes, it could be improved upon, and I&#x27;m certainly glad that Amazon has it 40% of the list price.  I would get it again, but I do recommend that you buy essential oils as soon as you order it so that when it arrives at your door you are ready to go :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  My unit doesn&#x27;t look like the one pictured for this product.  I don&#x27;t know if the model I have is newer or older.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter for functionality, but if you are buying it because of the look as well as for what it does you may get something different than pictured.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and bought it to use lavender to help me sleep and it works great but I am a light sleeper and it is too noisy for me to use while trying to sleep.  No problem, I just use it up until I go to sleep but if I were to want to use it for a cold or allergies where it would need to be on all night I could not do it unless I was really drugged out!&lt;br /&gt;I like the light settings and the ability of turning this feature off if you do not want it.  Over all it does what it is suppose to do .</li>
            <li> Really love this little unit. It puts out a good amount of moisture and works great! I gave mine to my friend to try and she wanted to keep it, so now I will be ordering a second one. The added colorful lights make it even more fun! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks and love it. I put a few drops of peppermint and eucalyptus essential oil in it and it keeps my allergies at bay all night.</li>
            <li> Only have had it a week but love it so far</li>
            <li> Does anyone know how long the cord is? I want it for my office,so I want to make sure the cord is long enough for it to sit on my desk.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!  Very easy to operate! The mist lasts for several hours and the fragrance seems to spread throughout a fairly large room. The changing colors are a great feature - very soft and soothing colors.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great! Small, sleek, and fun change of colors. I really enjoy using it almost everyday. My favorite scent is lemongrass</li>
            <li> I purchased a different oil diffuser through DoTerra and it consumed so much oil but this can go HOURS with a few (6) drops of oil.  I&#x27;m so happy I returned the other model, which was twice as much.  Also, thanks for the sale!  Great deal.</li>
            <li> I have another diffuser from a well known oil company and it doesn&#x27;t come close to this my ZAQ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love having several settings to choose from but more than that I like the way the mist exits the diffuser.  Not overpowering and no wet surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the box it comes in as a stand on my bedside table and it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a second one for my daughter-in-law and she LOVES her diffuser also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!  Will recommend to all my oily friends!</li>
            <li> The diffuser works well, just as advertised. The only caution I have is to use the essential oils sparingly, sometimes 1 drop is plenty - experiment. I appreciate being able to scent the air naturally.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is wonderful, I have been a fan of essential oils for the past twelve years, you can change the feel of your space with just a few drops of warm desert vanilla or balsam fir or pine, this is small and intimate enough for a night stand, this will not take up more space than necessary and it glows the prettiest soft color.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful little essential oil diffuser, capable of scenting any room with your favorite oil and adding much needed moisture to dry air. It&#x27;s sleek, about six inches in diameter, silent, and has several settings: you can have gentle lights changing colors, or set it to one color or opt for no lights. It holds 80 ml of water and runs about 4-5 hours then shuts itself out.  I love the mesmerizing lights at night, in the dark. Those, along with a few drops of cinnamon or lavender oil at bedtime and I find falling asleep to be so much easier than it&#x27;s ever been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why this pricier diffuser over a squirt from a can of Glade or Febreeze? Those give me headaches. I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to non-natural colognes and perfumes but happily used essential oils for decades, but usually with a candle warmer, and honestly, even that little bit of smoke bothers my sinuses.  I also use oils in those tiny Crock Pots, but those are rather messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser is exactly what I needed. The directions say tap water is fine, but I use distilled and wipe the diffuser clean between uses (vital if you use citrus oils!). I want this to last for many years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: there are no oils with the diffuser. If you, like me, tend to be sensitive to fragrances, order the basic scents like peppermint, lavender, cinnamon or citrus to start with. Even in natural oils, I find my sinuses don&#x27;t like overly flowery scents for long and they rebel at anything musky. While these oils don&#x27;t create the headaches, the scent, for me, is so associated with headaches that I avoid them.</li>
            <li> We are happy with the diffuser and enjoy using it often. Arrived on time, package wasn&#x27;t in too bad a condition and more importantly the product was just fine. Considering buying another for other rooms in the house. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought it on the recommendation from backdoor survival website and I am glad I did. I use tea tree in it during cold and flu season and lavender for a calming space. Love it</li>
            <li> Christmas present for sis, she loves.</li>
            <li> This aromatherapy diffuser definitely lasts at least four hours when used as directed. I use mine in a fairly large room, and the scent of the essential oil can easily be smelled across the room; after the diffuser has been on for several hours, the scent fills the room and even lightly permeates the downstairs area of my house. The changing colors of the diffuser is soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this. So easy to use and works great! I use it almost every night with my lavender essential oil to help me sleep. The price is great and I think it works better than the more expensive Young Living one.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I wish the part that holds water/oil was removable, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works well, has an automatic shut off when it runs out of water and the color changing lights add a relaxing touch.  Very pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting into using essential oils for making my own cleaning and personal care products slowly over the past couple of years but I hadn&#x27;t really considered adding a misting diffuser to the mix. As a frequent migraine and insomnia sufferer I&#x27;ve found the ZAQ Dew LiteMist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser to be the perfect addition to an unexpected place, my home office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very quiet, has adjustable light settings (which makes me want one for both my bedroom and my preschooler&#x27;s), and manages to fill a 20&#x27;x12&#x27; space with a comfortable level of scent. The only things I&#x27;ve found that I dislike is how easy it can be tipped over and spilled (my cat and preschooler are quite interested in it and did this) and that while the light settings are nice, they make it a pain to simply shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it with Plantlife&#x27;s Study Buddy or Calm essential oil blends for an office space use like I&#x27;ve chosen.</li>
            <li> I own 5 diffusers. I like this one as it diffuses scents well for about 3 hours however the lighting is not very bright if you want the energy effects of the color.</li>
            <li> I bought this on November 12 it broke on January 20. I  would not recommend you purchase this product.  Cannot get on button to work.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these.  One for each of my boys.  They always want their bedrooms to smell nice, but commercial air fresheners seem to trigger their asthma.  These allow them to have great smelling bedrooms without synthetic chemicals or asthma problems.  They both work great.  We haven&#x27;t had any problems with them thus far.</li>
            <li> I have purchased more expensive diffusers,  but these are great.  It puts out a large amount of must and great worth the oils I have used.  The light is kind of bright - It has 3 settings for lights, but when you turn off the diffuser is still kind of bright. But I love it.</li>
            <li> Very bright light, even when it&#x27;s in the darkest setting.</li>
            <li> I chose a one star rating because the product failed in one week. After a week&#x27;s use the power would not go on. For the price of the diffuser I expected it to perform much better than its counterparts. I got a refund for the product but I would not buy the same kind again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars for one reason and that is the light. It has a modes of where the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. The issue is that the button has a light around it and it still stays on so it isn&#x27;t really a good diffuser for the bedroom, which is what I wanted it for. Other than that it works and looks great!</li>
            <li> I love that you can turn the light off and still use it.  I have another one that I can&#x27;t use in the bedroom at night because the light stays on.</li>
            <li> I love this oil diffuser!  No complaints. :-)  I love the color changing options.  If this one breaks I would definitely reorder it again.</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations. Love it! Turns on instantly and the oil creates a wonderful aroma throughout the house. Better than burning wax candles or artificial/chemical devices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but when in use, it seems like the &#x27;mist&#x27; only stays right around the diffuser.  If I&#x27;m more than 3 feet away from it, I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on. Is this normal?</li>
            <li> A lot smaller then I thought. It&#x27;s nice claim colors and auto turns off if you have it during the night</li>
            <li> This product seemed a little overpriced and had maybe one sour review when I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It works great and looks nice. I have it sitting right next to my bed. I add water and lavender essential oil and sleep like a baby. I give this product a thumbs up!</li>
            <li> The ZAQ Dew LiteMist Aromatherapy EO Diffuser is really the only diffuser I wanted!  I think it&#x27;s attractive, super easy to use, and who doesn&#x27;t like the fun changing lights (optional if you don&#x27;t).  I LOVE MINE!!!  ps - I even accidently dropped mine on the hard tile floor once and it survived just fine (but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend making a habit of it). :)</li>
            <li> Diffuses oils very well and is very simple to use.  Turns off automatically after about 4-5 hours.  Great for one room use.  I liked it so much I bought another one!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s sleek and modern. Does a great job of diffusing and filling the room with scent. It diffuses for a good amount or time too. So easy to use. Only complaint is why do they al have to light up? At night I don&#x27;t want to see any lights when  I&#x27;m trying to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> The best oil diffuser. Bought one for myself in the UK where I live, liked it so much I ordered this for my son on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com for my son who lives in California. Definitely a winner.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this as a gift for a friend. My daughter has one and I am at her house a lot and this is used every day all day. Love this diffuser. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Really love this diffuser. My first time use one but it works well and I love the changing light colors. They are soothing.</li>
            <li> Runs continuously for about 3.5 hours and shuts off automatically. We use this product in our baby&#x27;s room at night. The lights are nice colors and not too bright, but bright enough that I can check on the baby at night without having to turn on other lights.</li>
            <li> This is the first cool diffuser that I have tried and I am really enjoying it.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  I have it in my bathroom and turn it on when I take a bath or in the morning when I get ready for work.  I like the colors and the way it looks and the mist is very soothing.</li>
            <li> This oil diffuser is awesome! I have used it every day since I have taken it out of the box. It is my first diffuser. I put lavender oil and petitgrain mandarin essential oils in to help me sleep at night. I use eucalyptus and peppermint oil to clear my sinuses. I keep it on my night stand and it is just the right size. Just a drop of rose geranium fills my room with the beautiful scent. I just rinse it out with water and wipe it out with a tissue and it is ready for some new oil. I took it with me when I traveled. My husband calls it my smudge machine. I also use blood orange oil without worries that it will ruin the diffuser. It shuts off on it&#x27;s own when the oil and water mix runs out. The fun part is the lights that change color. It also has the option to turn the colors off and just has a mellow blue glow. And it is cute and sophisticated looking. I only use therapeutic grade essential oils in this. I&#x27;m going to go fill her up now!</li>
            <li> I moved from an office where I could burn candles (and use a candle-powered diffuser), to one where I could not.  After some research, I bought the LiteMist.  I love it as it requires only a drop of essential oil to perfume a small room for an extended period of time. (The downside is that one has to be careful, as it is easy to drop in too much oil, and create an overwhelming scent.) the diffuser is not in the least drippy or damp - it sits next to my printer, and the micro mist has yet to warp the paper. In addition, the color changing light is soothing and interesting.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by this cute little diffuser.  Very easy to use/clean, just wish the wonderful scent would last longer!  I highly recommend this product for small room freshening.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the length of time this unit runs; unlike other reviewers, mine will run for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, it&#x27;s cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; setting *is* still lit up, and while this poses no problem for me, it may for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint about this product is the dispersal of oils. I f I am in the room with it, I cannot even tell, by scent, that it&#x27;s on. This depends upon the oils used, but generally speaking, I don&#x27;t even smell the oils unless I am right over the unit. If I leave the room, closing the door behind me, then re-enter some time later, I can faintly smell the oils I&#x27;ve been diffusing. But I think most of us, &amp; certainly, I, want to be able to get the scent of our oils circulating well throughout them room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Room size is moderate. It&#x27;s an older home, &amp; review is based on use in the Master Bedroom of the home. It&#x27;s worthless in the Living Area, as the space is just too large. I kept it only because of the hassle of returns, &amp; the fact that it does a bit better in a much smaller room.</li>
            <li> I got this around christmas last year and been using it on an almost daily basis. It&#x27;s small so it&#x27;s not a regular humidifier. It works well as a diffuser. I bought some plant naturals oils here on amazon and use it for this along with something i bought from the body shop.&lt;br /&gt;It serves as night light somewhat, it&#x27;s compact, does it&#x27;s job. No complaints so far. Would be nice if it were bigger but I think that&#x27;ll defeat it&#x27;s purpose. This will work well as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous diffuser.  The design is sleek and it&#x27;s not too big or too small.  I&#x27;ve used it almost every night for about 3 weeks and have had no problems so far.  If I fill it up to the line and use my doTERRA or KIS oils, each use lasts 4 hours. I have lots of oils that I use with different warmers but this diffuser intensifies the oils without being overwhelming.  Plus it&#x27;s just cool to look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a need to replace the top (I damaged it myself) and contacted the company to see if they sold replacements.  They responded right away and sent me a new top at no charge.  Fantastic service!  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this diffuser!  It is easy to use.  It functions great.  We use it everyday and have not had any issues with it.  I am going to buy a couple of more for our home.</li>
            <li> This has been a great diffuser for all my favorite oils.  I do wish I had spent a little more money and purchased a bigger diffuser but for a small room this will do.  It lasts for at least 8 hours which is perfect to run at night.</li>
            <li> I had three of them. Two lasted 5 months. One is still working. Think they really should have lasted at least a year because they are not inexpensive.</li>
            <li> works great and look nice,</li>
            <li> It works very well. I&#x27;d happily recommend it and the seller.</li>
            <li> easily movable, quiet for the most part and works really great. you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have a spa and use it all day long! Love it</li>
            <li> Works great. Just wish there was a setting without the lights.</li>
            <li> I have used this diffuser for about a week now. I absolutely love and recommend it. It looks pretty cool but has a clean look that doesn&#x27;t interfere with decor (which I was worried about) and instead of being tacky, the color changing is actually pretty neat. Works well and I am happy with my purchase. We have pretty hard water where I live so I&#x27;ve been using distilled to avoid a mineral build-up, just in case. I&#x27;ve been using DoTerra essential oils in it.</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser overall.  I&#x27;ve had it for 5 months and it still works great.  It fills up a small room with the fragrance easily, but in a large room is a bit of a waste if you are not right next to it. My main issue is with the light.  I picked this one specifically because it had a &amp;#34;no light&amp;#34; mode so I could use it on my nightstand at night.  This mode still casts a large amount of blue light (which is particularly annoying since blue is an energizing color).  It actually works best at night if I hold it on the red light, rather than turn the light &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wanted a diffuser, but I was frozen with indecision.  There are so many brands to choose from and many varying opinions in regard to how well they work.  My sister recommended a ZAQ, so I chose this one and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I filled the reservoir to the fill line, added a few drops of essential oil, pressed the on button and instantly a mist started coming out of the top.  I have it in a large bedroom and it gave the entire room a pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt; If you press the button once to turn it on it goes through the different light colors in rotation.  Press it once again at a color you like and it will remain on that color.  Press again and the light goes off (although the button remains lighted so you can see where to turn it off).  One final press of the button turns the unit off completely.  Once the reservoir is empty (after several hours of run time)  it will turn itself off.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item, very relaxing and easy to use. I just wish the cord was nicer looking and plugged in, in a different location. Great customer service though.</li>
            <li> No more to say than &amp;#34;I love it,&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s easy to use and my chosen scents are wonderful.  Thank you for your product.</li>
            <li> i love this thing!! i have used it every day since i have gotten it. disburses the oils nicely throughout a large room. my kids are all begging for one in their rooms now! would definitely purchase this again</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars, but it does not dim 100% for use at night. It dims to a very dark blue, but it still glows. Works well and looks good so we put it in the living room and not the bedroom as intended.</li>
            <li> Love this product....i plan to order another. It&#x27;s very simple to use and very pretty when changing colors.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!!! It is small but puts outs great aroma . Love the light feature and very quiet! Definitely would recommend! And buy again !!</li>
            <li> Worked exactly like it promised, have had zero problems. Very easy to clean and use, will buy another for my downstairs area.</li>
            <li> This works very nicely.  Probably best for a smaller room or have two for large rooms.</li>
            <li> We use this diffuser nearly every day! It works well, and is a perfect size for our living room. I like the changing colors and the auto shut-off!</li>
            <li> This is quiet and works very well.  We like to use this for eucalyptus oil in the cold/flu season and other oils throughout the year.</li>
            <li> This is a great defuser. It a lite mist and really does the job of releasing your essential oil into the air.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it almost every day. Not very sturdy but it works out well and looks pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I received my diffuser really fast, I&#x27;m impressed!  I love my diffuser and it works perfectly in our bedroom! I used it for my favorite essential oils and enjoying the fragrance and health benefits from them. It also compliment as a night light, the different lights changes as you turn it on and you also have 3 settings to choose from. Very quiet, easy to clean and to use which is a plus!  Perfect device, and my husband loves it as well.  Yes, I recommend this! :)</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.  I diffuse everyday, all day, and have used various diffusers.  This is so easy to assemble and operate.  Looks nice, diffuses well for one room.  I would definitely purchase this item again and buy as gifts for family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> should be a little more heavy or at least have a base so you can install it inside the base in order for the unit to be more steady and firm.  I use it often for several weeks and had no problem because I make sure I wash it after each use.  I use distilled water only.</li>
            <li> A great little diffuser.  Sometimes it will run all through the night and into part of the morning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this diffuser!!!  It changes colors if you want or you can select just one color or none; Whatever your preference is. This diffuser is ready to go as soon as you take it out of the box. Just add the water and essential oil drops of your choice. The more drops you add, the stronger the smell so be careful. A little goes a long way and some scents are better in small doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took mine to work and people were impressed with the look and how well it worked. I use lemon EO and my office smelled so fresh! Surprisingly, a couple male co-workers liked it and were interested in getting one. For their wives, of course! LOL!!!</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I bought one for work and another for home. Quick shipping and works very well. Plus, it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li> Works well and looks pretty.</li>
            <li> We bought this diffuser 6+ months ago and have been 100% pleased with it. We live in a very open concept home and I usually leave the diffuser on the kitchen counter (which is at the center of my home) and the entire main part of our home fills with the smell of whatever I&#x27;ve got in there.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on here tonight buying a 2nd one because when our kids are sick at the same time we&#x27;d like a diffuser for each room.&lt;br /&gt;Its very easy to use; pretty much remove the top, fill water to the line, drop in a few drops of oils and plug it in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t had one issues with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I diffuse doTerra essential oils through it. It functions beautifully, and has the about to turn itself off when it is finished. It runs upward to 10 hours a day. It is also beautiful to look at. Highly recommended for aromatherapy!</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying the diffuser.  It is lightweight, turns off automatically and makes my house smell awesome.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean up, and the kids like the spaceship look of it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a satisfied customer.  It has to be the best of it&#x27;s kind out there. I am extremely happy with it.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, very light weight and can be placed almost anywhere. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Awesom! Works great and easy!  Perfect size and great light effects!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Would buy again! :)</li>
            <li> Great diffuser! I only fill it halfway to the fill line with water, which allows me to use less oil and get more potent output.</li>
            <li> The diffusing part of this works great, but I got it to mainly use at night and on the setting where the light is suppose to shut off, it is a bright blue light. I can&#x27;t sleep in a room that isn&#x27;t dark, so that is a huge bummer, because I really like the look of the diffuser. I contacted customer service for a refund. I am going to try out Smiley Daisy instead.</li>
            <li> I like the design and it works well.  However, even when the light function is turned off it is very bright at night.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a friend of mine has one also, but she does not have hers on all the time. It does work well, fills a small room with the aroma you add of the oil, BUT don&#x27;t know about adding moisture to the room, I bought it for the scent...the thing they don&#x27;t tell you, and I would have given it less stars, but because it does what they say I can&#x27;t...is the water lasts about 2 hours and then it shuts off automatically when the water is gone, meaning the scent stops also.  Unless you want to keep filling the water reservoir every couple hours to have continuous scent in your room, this is a pretty expensive scent maker, the electric Glade plug ins do almost the same job, but cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> Bought one before this and it was a total did for 2 days.  I use this one non stop, wish it out out more humidity but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> We have used this diffuser in our bedroom every night for the last 8 months with essential oils. No issues with it. We notice that it diffuses for about 4-6 hours. I like the fine mist--doesn&#x27;t cause whatever it is sitting on to become damp or wet. I like the colored lights and especially being able to set the diffuser to one color. It works well for us and I would buy another of this brand diffuser.</li>
            <li> It works as it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s awesome that you can choose the very color you want! It doesn&#x27;t disperse the scent as much as I would like (I have it in the bedroom)... but it also really depends on the oil you are using and how long you have it turned on. You can turn the light &#x27;off&#x27; but really, there still is quite a bit of light given off. This doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if it&#x27;s a factor for you ,keep that in mind!&lt;br /&gt;So basically I took a star away for the light not actually being able to be turned off, and the scent not being as dispersed as I would like. I would like to have given this 4.5 stars, but we&#x27;ll stick to 4!:-)</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these several months ago and use them daily.  They work beautifully.  I love that they actually diffuse the scent really well, I like that it will change colors and you have an option stay on one color or turn the light off.  On the negative side, even when the lights are off, you can still plainly see it because the power button is lit brightly. If you are like me and have to have your room pitch black to sleep, you won&#x27;t be able to diffuse this in your room at night - it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband at all but I can&#x27;t stand to have ANY light when I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to fill and clean. Just lift the top off and fill it w water then the oil. When it&#x27;s done it will shut of automatically which is a huge plus then just lift the top and wipe it out. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 2 story house with an open floor plan. I have one on my kitchen counter bc it is most centrally located. Depending on the oil I diffuse, I can typically smell it throughout the bottom floor except the master bedroom. I bought the second one for the upstairs but I generally move it all over the house! I will probably order 1 or 2 more just to have a permanent spot in the kid&#x27;s rooms for a nighttime diffuser/nightlight.</li>
            <li> This item no longer works after only a few months of use. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> So far this has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Soothing, works well and colors are fun.</li>
            <li> Using it for few months now and it&#x27;s working great.  It turns off by itself when runs out of the water/oil mixture. So go to sleep comfortable.</li>
            <li> This diffuser stopped working after only 2 days. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Thank you! I love it. It lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I wish it emitted the scents more strongly. I feel like I have to use a lot of oil. But it is very nice a peaceful. I use it Everytime before I go to bed,</li>
            <li> Best diffuser I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I love this! Very user friendly - plug and play. works for hours. Very happy with this purchase, and would buy again for family or friends without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Love this, works great! No complaints, easy to use. I don&#x27;t use the color setting as I think it&#x27;s pretty cheesy, but it&#x27;s there if my toddler wants to watch the colors change, so that&#x27;s nice. Nice modern design that compliments our home decor.  I&#x27;ll order another for our bedroom!</li>
            <li> I will compare this ZAQ diffuser with the Essential Oil Diffuser by Deneve, since I ordered both of them and spent quite a bit of time reviewing all the different diffusers offered on Amazon.  I&#x27;m very happy with both diffusers, but there are some differences.  These two had the best ratio of 5-star reviews to 1-star reviews.    Both the ZAQ and Deneve diffusers have the same size water compartment.  I haven&#x27;t timed how long they last on one fill, but since the ZAQ emits a greater volume of vapor per second, I would assume that it would last a shorter time between fills.  The ZAQ is a little larger and does take up quite a bit of space on the table.  The Deneve is also larger than I expected but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.    The ZAQ diffuser emits a louder whirring sound than the Deneve, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the bedroom.  And even though you turn off the light, it still puts off a noticeable blue glow, which is okay if you want a nightlight. It also emits a larger amount of vapor per second, so it&#x27;s better for a larger room.  But you wouldn&#x27;t want to put it on nice furniture without some type of cloth beneath it because the vapor sometimes finds it&#x27;s way to the table and leaves a damp ring around it.    I use the Deneve in my bedroom because it doesn&#x27;t leave any vapor around the base on my nice table, and when you click it to the no-light setting, it emits no light at all.  It does put out a smaller stream of vapor, but in a smaller room it&#x27;s okay.  And it emits only a very light gurgling sound, which I find soothing.    I&#x27;ve had both diffusers for about two weeks and both are working perfectly.</li>
            <li> Purchased two of these for essential oil diffusion.  Extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser, however the no color part is not true.  It dims to a light shade of blue which lights up my whole room, not to mention the on button which is sooo bright.  I would love it more if it would be dark while I sleep.  If light doesn&#x27;t bother you while you sleep then it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser received as a Christmas gift 2014. BUT after 6 months it stopped working. My daughter has the same diffuser and her diffuser also stopped working for no apparant reason. We always used purchased distilled water. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser. My husband and I love it!  The sleek European design is very pretty.  I read the instructions, set it up, plugged it in and turned it on.  The fragrant oil I am using immediately began to mist lightly into the room.  The various colors you can select are easy on the eyes and add a soothing ambiance.  The color choices are gorgeous.  I am exceedingly pleased by this feature and that the machine begins to work right away.  There is an ever so slight \\&quot;tapping\\&quot; type noise while the machine is running but I don&#x27;t find it takes away from the experience at all nor is it bothersome in any way.  If anything it helps me go to sleep.  I am seriously considering buying one of the other designs for our kitchen.  They are so cute!  I only hope this ZAQ Dew LiteMist continues to work as beautifully as it has from day one.  I take very good care of my things and this is important when you spend $50 on an item like this.  If you want something to last, you have to do your part.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Luv this!! I can select the color that I like OR allow it to change colors automatically.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It&#x27;s nice to be able to have my house scented with NATURAL essential oils of my choosing (scents that aren&#x27;t cancer-causing or are hormone disrupting, like all chemical/artificial scents on the market). I just put regular ol&#x27; tap water in the reservoir, four drops of some PURE essential oils of my choice (ones that don&#x27;t have carrier oils in it &#x27;cause that will clog the machine), and then I just turn it on! You can turn the Dew LiteMist on, leave for the day and come home to a wonderfully, naturally scented home. And there are no worries about leaving it on because it automatically shuts off as soon as it runs out of liquid to vaporize. LOVE this, product, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s sort of a modern shape... almost like a white Hershey&#x27;s Kiss on your table, haha. If you have modern decor, this will fit right in, but if you have traditional / vintage decor in your house, like I do, it might stand out a bit. But this didn&#x27;t stop me from buying it, per the other great reviews. I usually just hide it behind my desk clock when company comes or put it in a &amp;#34;less traffic&amp;#34; area. As for the colors, my kids (ages 4 and 2) really like to watch the vapor come out of the &amp;#34;rainbow mister&amp;#34;. ^_^ There is only one button on the device, which turns it on and off, etc. The first time you press it, it starts vaporizing the water and scent immediately and colors change after a couple of seconds. The second time you press the button, it stays on the current color. Press it again, the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, but you have a soft blue glow from the button. Personally, I just keep the color off, which is a great feature to have if you don&#x27;t want to draw attention to the device. If you&#x27;re gonna have this in a bedroom at night, it could be a good night-light. Even with the light off, it still gives that soft blue light from the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button, so it&#x27;s not completely dark when you turn the light &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  All-in-all, very good product, wonderful, naturally scented home... I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> We love this diffuser and we are thinking of buying another.  Great product and delivery!</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet, does make a dripping noise.  Even when running on the &amp;#34;light-off&amp;#34; setting, there is still a rather bright blue LED indicator that shines.  Disperses the aroma quickly.  I usually do 4-5 drops and fill with distilled water to the line and it runs for at least 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that it states not to run citrus oils in it, but I have done so and have not hit any problems yet.  I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser - the colors are fun and the auto shut off puts my mind at ease.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift. Unwrapped it. Plugged it in. It didn&#x27;t work! Cheaply made. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works great just wish there was a no light, mist only settling.</li>
            <li> So, I have a mixed review. I ordered this and was very excited when it arrived, set it up per the instructions,  plugged it in, and..nothing. I couldn&#x27;t get it to work no matter what I did.I had to call Amazon and return it. However, my parents saw that I had put it on my wish list (which I hsd forgotten) so I received the same thing for Christmas and it has worked wonderfully for a month. I use it every day and love it.Maybe I just got a lemon the first time. Will be curious to see the longevity of this one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold much water compared to other diffusers. The deneve is better</li>
            <li> Worked beautifully. We’ve used it every day since receiving it. It’s miraculous how this thing works. It puts a beautiful smell all over the room almost instantly. And the plume of superfine mist it puts out is lovely to behold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the lights-off mode was actually lights-off, though. The blue power LED stays on, making lights-off mode really just blue mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, 1 month later, after consistent use, the power button no longer works at all. When we plug the diffuser in, the LEDs are already turned on (not normal behavior), but the power button won’t cycle modes—it won&#x27;t even turn the diffuser off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, although the LEDs are lit, the water doesn’t bubble and no plume of mist appears. Nor does the internal fan run. The LEDs stay lit—the power button won’t turn the device off—and nothing else happens. In fact, even the LEDs have begun to flicker and dim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the ceramic disc, but that wasn&#x27;t the problem. The power button simply doesn&#x27;t work any longer. It appears as though power is getting as far as the LEDs, but not further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote info@bombayelectronics.com for a replacement under their 1-year warranty, and I suppose I will see how that goes. Otherwise I guess I&#x27;ll have to contact Amazon.</li>
            <li> Absolutley love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this in my office and get a lot of compliments. Like that it turns off when it gets low on water and like the color options.</li>
            <li> Works amazing and longer running than expected. The changing lights are SO soothing! LOVE and bought some as gifts!</li>
            <li> We use this every day!  It&#x27;s awesome and a great value</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, quite literally as it changes colors while filling our entire living and kitchen areas with aroma. My mum loved this so much she bought herself one so I can take mine to my dorm.</li>
            <li> Like others have stated, the thing just stops working!  I have had this a little over a month - of course just outside the return window, it stops.  DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Worked great but on/off button stopped working after about 6 weeks of use.  Called Amazon and received a new one.  Excellent customer service</li>
            <li> This diffuser is relatively compact and it&#x27;s easy to use.  For us, it lasted about 8 months of continual use and careful washing.  I am now looking to replace with another, more reliable, unit and am willing to pay a little more for a diffuser this time.  If you use once or twice a week, this unit has a pleasant appearance and will work.  If, like us, you use a diffuser more often, be aware that this one will not last a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome !! Working better than expectation.</li>
