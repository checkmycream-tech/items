            <li>I love the mirror!</li>
            <li>Love this mirror!</li>
            <li>Easy to mount, great magnification, nice quality materials.</li>
            <li>They make an accordion arm that is polish and looks amazing and then stick a plastic mirror on it.  </li>
            <li>Nice item.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and get in our way.</li>
            <li>Nice mirror.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very versatile and is perfect for using in conjunction with another mirror to do my hair.</li>
            <li>Really nice mirror.</li>
            <li>It is a nice mirror, but not what I thought I was going to get</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>For $25 it&#x27;s kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li>It swings out of the way nice and compactly.  </li>
            <li>I liked this one</li>
            <li>, They were nice, suggested my mirror might be defective and encouraged me to return it for a replacement.</li>
            <li>Arm extends a nice distance</li>
            <li>It is definately something I would recommend and plan on getting one for myself when I get my own place.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>Will be nice to use to put makeup on and use both hands.</li>
            <li>I use a curling iron every day &amp; also trim my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Was nice quality.</li>
            <li>Since I cut and color my own hair, it is an invaulable tool to have.  </li>
            <li>and It is what every woman needs who wants to look there best.</li>
            <li>As a retired hair stylist, I do my own hair, and along with the help of this mirror I save lots of money that I would otherwise be spending at a hair salon each month.  </li>
            <li>, makes PERFECT sense, the round mirrors don&#x27;t so I am very happy I bought this one!&lt;br /&gt;by</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it weren&#x27;t for that.</li>
            <li>This is so nice.</li>
            <li>This one is a nice size and stayed in place.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice reach if you can&#x27;t put it close to you.</li>
            <li>It feels sturdy and folds nicely against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li>My husband is in a wheelchair &amp; this handy mirror works well for him to shave &amp; wash up.</li>
            <li>I am just so excited about this mirror!!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this mirror extends nicely would be great if it were a little more rigid , but it serves the purpose well and the magnified side is great for looking up close.</li>
            <li>Great for assisting with a close shave and clean up.</li>
            <li>wife likes it, easy to install, and seems like good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>magnification is perfect, anything more would be too much.</li>
            <li>It is a good quality mirror and it was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>It is quality, easy to mount and looks good too.</li>
            <li>It loosens up very easily.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to install; however, we didn&#x27;t use the mounting screws it came with.</li>
            <li>Having dual mirror with magnification is a plus..  and very easy to install.</li>
            <li>All hardware is included, and very easy to install.</li>
            <li>Very easy installation if you can operate a screwdriver.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good to have a mirror that can be pulled out close to my handsome face for a close, clean shave!  </li>
            <li>Love it because its always handy and folds and doesn&#x27;t take a lot&lt;</li>
            <li>If you have too far to lean to see what you&#x27;re doing while shaving in the bathroom, this product is perfect.  </li>
            <li>For makeup application or shaving, this is a really good, hands free mirror.  </li>
            <li>Along with it being able to contour out of the way it is always handy at a reach to help with my make-up</li>
            <li>so far, everything about this product is perfect....</li>
            <li>really pleased with the quality of this product, quick shipping &amp; great customer service.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on wall!</li>
            <li>Great mirror for my teens bedroom, long extension, good quality, fair price.</li>
            <li>However this one gives good magnification for putting in contacts or make up or whatever more detailed operation</li>
            <li>I figured with all the opening and closing it would need something more durable to not pull out of the wall very easily.</li>
            <li>This was very easy to install, I love the versatality of this unit, it is</li>
            <li>The extension arm seems to be sturdy and maintains a fairly even level when extended at full length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very important when using a mirror for make up application which was my reason for the purchase.  </li>
            <li>looks very cheap.</li>
            <li>The accordion is nice and strong.</li>
            <li>Super fast ship  Awesome product</li>
            <li>Very good quality and clear mirror.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use that side, so it&#x27;s OK for me.</li>
            <li>I love the mirrors.</li>
            <li>The point of buying an adjustable mirror is to be able to adjust it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will serve the purpose well.</li>
            <li>Looks like I will have to spend $100 more for a quality mirror...</li>
            <li>and I just wasn&#x27;t sure about the shape and how it would look on the wall.  </li>
            <li>It extends 30 inches and is able to adjust and pivot away from the wall at an angle.</li>
            <li>I would be sure to mount on stud - I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>It looks stylish and doesn&#x27;t distrack from our decor.  </li>
            <li>The top bushing on the slider doesn&#x27;t stay in, but it doesn&#x27;t effect the operation of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I was able to install it without any problems.</li>
            <li>The materials used for the construction of the mirror could be better, but it passes.  </li>
            <li>This does have one side regular and one side magnified--it is perfect.</li>
            <li>charged more for shipping too.</li>
            <li>sincerely, sarg</li>
            <li>I needed a wall mirror that would extend about 20 inches from the wall, and this does that and more.</li>
            <li>A chrome surround would have looked a lot better.</li>
            <li>I was able to return it.</li>
            <li>That worked out OK.  </li>
            <li>I was able to give myself a haircut.  </li>
            <li>We have had it a couple months and are glad we ordered it.</li>
            <li>This looks much better</li>
            <li>I love this mirror...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I made it without this thing :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will continue to.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror for my wife and she is perfectly satisfied with its characteristics.</li>
            <li>Had one just like it for many years.</li>
            <li>It has exceeded my expectations and have bought more of the brand.  </li>
            <li>i love this.</li>
            <li>one more break</li>
            <li>Thx :)</li>
            <li>and they love it.</li>
            <li>I love it too,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want something sitting on the counter, and this folds back on the wall, so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I should have done more research.</li>

            <li>Or, if it had to be plastic, perhaps a light gray.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great 2-sided accordion mirror that swings out and away from the wall by about 2 feet.  </li>
            <li>There were problems mounting the mirror because of some cheap construction.  </li>
            <li>Cheap price for a cheap item.  </li>
            <li>Smooth reflection</li>
            <li>Looks cheap 2.</li>

            <li>See your fabulous face as NEVER before.great shaving helper.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>It is great for when you need to see the back of your hair while straightening or curling yor hair.</li>
            <li>This mirrior is great to have hanging next to my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a rectangular accordion mirror and this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for viewing the back of your head.  </li>
            <li>(fortunately I had one of these in my tool box, if not, yet another trip to the hardware store).</li>
            <li>For the price think this mirror is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Also, the scant instructions do not provide any information on what size drill bit to use to fit the mollies.  </li>
            <li>So great on my bathroom wall placed so I can use it to see the back of</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>

            <li>I have used it daily since then and I love it more each time I use it!</li>
            <li>So nice to be able to see the back of my hair and style</li>
            <li>The white is not horrible, but it does detract from an otherwise nice design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, great price I needed to replace my old one that was gold and chipping.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy and the mirror is quite a bit larger than most in this category.  </li>
            <li>These mirrors are hard to find, so I was thrilled that they were available!!!  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased &amp; think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>If you put it in the right height for yourself, it is great for seeing the back of your head for styling hair also.</li>
            <li>Just not quite true to color.  </li>
            <li>The good things about this are its overall design and useability, the size and quality of the mirrors including the choice of magnification on the magnifier side, and the quality and sturdiness and finish of the mounting bracket and articulated arm.    </li>
            <li>I was impressed by the size and shape of the mirror, however, the instructions for putting it together and installing it were quite confusing.</li>
            <li>It is well made and for the price is a true bargain.</li>
            <li>It really assist me to style my hair and be able to view from all angels.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this mirror, because it stretches up to 30 in length which is very convenient for me.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done, it folds up nicely against the wall, completely out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this mirror, it makes applying my makeup at the bathroom vanity much easier.</li>
            <li>Thanks, love it.</li>
            <li>its full extended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise good enough.</li>
            <li>good quality especially for the price I paid for it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend! :-)</li>
            <li>It stretches the full length as described and</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure how much 5x was.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased and the price was right!</li>
            <li>Super glue seems to be holding it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try Super Glue and see if that works.</li>
            <li>I learned an important fact about this mirror that anyone who decides to purchase this needs to be aware of.</li>
            <li>I had it screwed into a stud &amp; it seems pretty secure.  </li>
            <li>It extends real far and helps me trim the back of my neck with my new clippers just perfectly, so the mirror does its job as needed.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a great example of half a work...</li>
            <li>It is easy to mount to the wall and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Assembly to the wall was easy and it&#x27;s very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The material used in making the mirror and extension arm is very sturdy, much better class than alot of mirrors I have looked at,at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I certainly think the price is fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering hot gluing them on!  </li>
            <li>was exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>It has about twice the reach of most retractable mirrors especially in this price range which makes it easy to see fully around your head.</li>
            <li>Many mirrors out there that are less expensive but if you are going to mount it on the wall, best to get a good one.</li>
            <li>The flat side is great and the concave (zoom) side is very clear and doesn&#x27;t give me any eye strain.</li>
            <li>What a nice addition to our bathroom vanity &amp; medicine cabinets, the viewing capacity is great and the magnification on the other side of mirror is nice too, and the sissors allow the mirror to come out far enough to see the back of your head easily, we are going to buy some for our children too.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and this makes it possible to see all angles.</li>
            <li>Mirror looks nice the only issue i had with this was when i was adjusting the mirror</li>
            <li>I really like the way this mirror extends to a good length from the wall, much further than some I have tried.</li>
            <li>looks nice, sturdy and has big size mirror to look at&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use mine to see the back of my head since I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Mag&amp;#34; side is powerful yet not overly distorted.</li>
            <li>This product takes about 5 minutes to install, and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Let me say this, I am still using my old one, that alone should tell anyone this is a top notch product</li>
            <li>It reflects light properly, for sure.  </li>
            <li>and I can move the mirror far enough to get in good light.</li>
            <li>like the mirror, and it is useful.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone...love it, it stretches so much farther than any other mirror and the reverse magnifying mirror is great for close up</li>
            <li>Other than that mirror works good to give yourself a self haircut.</li>
            <li>And, the right price too.</li>
            <li>The 4x magnifier is just right for my vision.</li>
            <li>&amp; I was right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent buy and recommend this Price is Right product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Magnification is just right.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was right on time.  </li>
            <li>You can get it from one of the major home supply stores but it was more than $10 cheaper on Amazon and the home supply store</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funky and fun looking in my bathroom and serves my purpose well and was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It replaced an old one made of plastic, and this one is all metal and much better made and will last us for many years.</li>
            <li>Its pretty solid on the wall and was very easy to install, recommend a cordless powerdrill and drill some pre holes</li>
            <li>This means just about every angle is available, which is important for someone like me who cuts his hair and needs the ability to see the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>It is also a square shape rather than round like most, which enables you to have a better view.  </li>
            <li>Heavy enough that it must be installed into  structural wood or good strong &amp;#34;molly&#x27;s&amp;#34;...or whatever those things are called!  </li>
            <li>price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>That was a bummer, but I fixed it as well, and once I mounted the mirror, it&#x27;s been working fine.  </li>
            <li>Same as the original except for the lack of nylon bearings on the post causing it to swing too freely towards the lowest point.</li>
            <li>Had one of these mirrors for approximately 20 years so know it is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>hard time seeing when have to remove my glasses, this works great.</li>
            <li>Great price for a hard to find item</li>
            <li>It certainly would not withstand rough handling, but provided it&#x27;s securely anchored (I recommend screwing it into a wall stud if you plan on extending it more than 16 inches)</li>
            <li>Love the design but the mirror falls off regularly...</li>
            <li>I was glad to see they still made the same one.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife needed.</li>
            <li>I am pleased enough with this, and do not regret purchasing it, not having found anything preferable.</li>
            <li>It actually looks much better in person than the picture shows.  </li>
            <li>This mirror was exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li>I needed something to be able to see the back of my hair so that I could use both hands to style it.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what it said.</li>
            <li>I like this one even better because it extends out further</li>
            <li>I can see the back of my hair lots better now.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well</li>
            <li>Pretty crappy quality control; for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work for a different application.</li>
            <li>pretty dang sturdy too</li>
            <li>but I hung it incorrectly the first time.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed to be able to see back of hair while fixing it.</li>
            <li>w/an option for a higher magnification.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t use the ones provided, my experience with screw anchors indicates these most likely won&#x27;t hold the weight with the mirror extended for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>others have stated, it would have been nice if the mirror had a different frame instead of the cheap plastic white one that is provided.  </li>
            <li>I am now able to cut and color my hair while viewing from all sides at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I looked for this exact mirror in stores but could not find it</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This mirror does exactly what I need.</li>

            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>got exactly what I needed and what I needed it for - to look up my nose at the nose hairs</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>If larger I would be able to see the back of my hair after styling. : )</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted..............</li>
            <li>Know this in advance, I oiled it and it loosened pretty well.  </li>
            <li>sturdy, doesn&#x27;t sag when extended, smooth action.</li>
            <li>it works good, it is heavy duty and is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>It goes together easily &amp; just make sure that you attach it to a wall correctly, because it is somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li>right where you need it, I really like it</li>
            <li>Right away one of the rivets fell out, and when it is pushed against the wall it looks straight</li>
            <li>The mirror itself was wobbly because I wasn&#x27;t able to secure the swivel frame tightly to the extension.  </li>
            <li>4.5 stars is the most accurate rating, but I&#x27;ll round up to 5.</li>
            <li>The package did arrive on-time, and all of the parts were included, but once it was installed, I extended the mirror and noticed that even though the mirror was installed on the wall straight, the accordian style arm is torqued &amp; the further you extend it from the wall, the more the extension torques.</li>
            <li>the positive side, there aren&#x27;t a lot of choices for this style of mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirror allows me to see the back and sides very easily adjusts up and down and tilts couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better</li>
            <li>This one seems to be a bit more sturdy so I am hoping it lasts just as long.</li>
            <li>The rectrangular mirror is good and big, you can see the whole back of your head.</li>
            <li>High quality, priced right product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular mirror because it extends further than most others.  </li>
            <li>I love the large size of the mirror and the long extension arm.</li>
            <li>This was easy to mount and worked fine for a few months, but now the rivets on the accordion are breaking off and it&#x27;s drooping downward.</li>
            <li>I bought one for my old small apartment and it worked great.</li>
            <li>It is easy to see the back of your hair.</li>
            <li>It is a great mirror, but (1) the screws for the sheetrock anchors are too small in diameter and after the anchors just pushed thru into the sheetrock on install; I had to get some professional anchors at the hardware store; and (2) you need a jeweler&#x27;s screwdriver to tighten the set screw that secures the mirror to the swivel - not mentioned in the description</li>
            <li>My husband put it up (which was an easy process because it only has (2) screws!.</li>
            <li>Daily use now for a couple of months and the metal accordion piece is still going strong with no problems to date.</li>
            <li>Magnification side is strong enough to make</li>
            <li>The first time, she was able to put it back together without damage, the 2nd time - she was not so lucky.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times I re-attached them, it stayed loose.  </li>
            <li>It took a little more effort to screw the mirror onto the rod, as mine did not seem to screw down as far as it should, but it still works great.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it as tight as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>The mirror isn&#x27;t secure because the end knobs that hold the mirror in place are NOT designed to hold anything in place securely: they do NOT snap in place to hold the mirror tightly.</li>
            <li>Expected more for the money, how hard is it to make anything good these days?</li>
            <li>Makes blow drying and styling my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>The rectagular mirror is a plus because you can see you whole face.  </li>
            <li>so much that I ended up getting two.  </li>
            <li>If you really pull it out to the max, it will extend 32 inches.</li>
            <li>We really like the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Just have to be gentle with pulling it out from the wall.  </li>
            <li>After ordering this product for $71.00 I noted same mirror available from Home  Depot for $24.00.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon..</li>
            <li>I mounted it so it is available in the bathroom and extends into the shower with the door partially open.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really keep it from unscrewing.</li>
            <li>Very durable extension</li>
            <li>This mirror allows me to see the back and sides of my head  - hands free.</li>
            <li>I bought the 30&amp;#34; extension to get as much length</li>
            <li>bought a cheaper one before, not remember the brand, very flimsy and unstable&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>Looks like you have a really cheap crooked mirror on your wall.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy</li>
            <li>The chrome is very shiny, and the mirror serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She hasn&#x27;t said much about it since, but she was tickled to get it, at the time.&lt;br /&gt;Compared</li>
            <li>Very well constructed.  </li>
            <li>It mounts with some very sturdy frame work and works about as well as you could expect.</li>
            <li>The whole thing seemed to work without it, though, so I installed it</li>
            <li>, it lasted me twelve years and the only wish would be a stronger magnification available.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for shaving,</li>
            <li>and I was ready to go in under 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Solid, &amp;#34;heavy weight&amp;#34;, smooth operation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been gentle on it (as has my wife)</li>
            <li>Really like the size and expandability, but the thing keeps falling apart.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast..</li>
            <li>real perception of quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks Jerdon , for making this basic beauty tool still available</li>
            <li>When you pull the accordion out and flip the mirror, you can see the back of your hair, hands free.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and the mirror is smooth and big</li>
            <li>I know the description said it was white and silver, but it has cheap looking plastic around the mirror.</li>
            <li>It makes my life so much easier on getting dressed in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t installed but seems very well made.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this one to work out.</li>
            <li>If I installed it to make it straight, the mirror would lean to one side.  </li>
            <li>Product is made very well and the size of the mirror is what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Very well made</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice heavy duty mirror.  </li>
            <li>nice heavy metal.</li>
            <li>For several years, we moved a lot, or were next to homeless, so I would have had no place to put it, but now I am stable again and thrilled to have it.</li>
            <li>Nice but heavy.</li>
            <li>This item is a high quality product that was purchased at a very reasonable price like so many other items I have bought using Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>White trim makes it look really nice with the white framed main mirrors in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes it better than her other.</li>
            <li>The other thing that was just OK was the method of attaching the U shaped metal bracket to the vertical rod at the mirror end of the arm.</li>
            <li>It is light, flexible, and folds flat to the wall.  </li>
            <li>Old one wore out, new one much improved and should last many years.</li>
            <li>The expansion is very stiff, but otherwise the mirror is a great size and perfect for seeing the back of your hair for styling or cutting.</li>
            <li>Really nice for doing french braids on long hair</li>
            <li>took it off and turned around and now works better but plastic on peg not right.</li>
            <li>this nice square mirror just perfect,very helpful, i can fix my hair behind ,i just love this double side mirror !</li>
            <li>If your looking for a nice sturdy extension mirror, that is not cheap of flimsy, then this is it!</li>
            <li>Bought this item as it was exactly like the old one, which needed replacing.</li>
            <li>You have to be really carefull to make sure the nut stays tight.</li>
            <li>The mirror was easy to mount and the frame is tight and well made for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I really depended on it and thank goodness now I can get a new one.</li>
            <li>I installed is as vertically level as possible, but the mirror seems to naturally lean to the right, which makes it swing right rather than hold the spot</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that it appears to be an OK mirror, if it costs $10 less than what I paid.</li>
            <li>Now, I can swing the mirror to the right and see the back of my head in the large mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Construction is decent.</li>
            <li>If I were able to secure an inexpensive replacement for the broken mirror</li>
            <li>Be sure you use the screw inserts to make it solid in the wall and drill into the stud if possible.</li>
            <li>It appears to be a decent mirror.  </li>
            <li>The magnification works well too for the times when my daughter or daughter-in-love are visiting and my main makeup mirror is in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When done, it quickly pushes back to the home position up against the wall</li>
            <li>Large enough to see everything, easy to pull out and push back.  </li>
            <li>But it works as expected, looks decent for the money &amp; lays nice &amp; flat up against the wall.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The installation is straight-forward: Driving the mounting screws into a stud is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend this to anyone needing an affordable wall-mounted shave or makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was hoping when I bought this that it would be of a high quality and</li>
            <li>It has a nice magnifying mirror on one side and the other is a regular</li>
            <li>One thing that was just OK was the quality of the plastic frame around the glass including its little trunions or pegs by which the metal bracket holds it.</li>
            <li>I like the way it looks , sturdy, so far very durable</li>
            <li>The mirror was fantastic, just as expected.</li>
            <li>it worth my time and effort to send it back</li>
            <li>it should survive normal use.</li>
            <li>I love it because I can view the back of my head while using both hands to put up my long hair.</li>
            <li>The magnifying side is powerful enough that I can see without my glasses.</li>
            <li>extra work was worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I have a 5x round mirror that is definitely more magnification than this one.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaint and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I love the extra long extension that this wall mount mirror has.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough and it&#x27;s so pretty and also professional looking!</li>
            <li>Feels nice and solid and you can move it up, down, left, right and pull it out from the wall</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to install...</li>
            <li>It swings out to just the right length so that I can see the back of my hair from all angles and because it&#x27;s hands-free I can adjust whatever stray hair strands need adjusting without losing the focus.</li>
            <li>and check your mirror to make sure it is staying tight!</li>
            <li>This is the piece that goes between the metal rod and the metal bracket allowing the two to slide smoothly against each other.</li>
            <li>For the money, this actually turned out to be quite a nice little mirror.</li>
            <li>so we got a new one.  </li>
            <li>A set screw was not threaded, had to drill and tap in a new one, keeps the mirror from coming off.  </li>
            <li>If it cost less, I&#x27;d easily give it three or four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only wish is that the white frame could also be available in chrome.</li>
            <li>The mirror is sturdy when pulled out to the maximum length and compact enough to fit on the opposite wall from my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li>Thought we would need to remove the mirror going down the road but handles the bumps fine</li>
            <li>It was such a good and small investment!</li>
            <li>The mirror adjusts quite nicely too, and originally when I tilted it up towards my face it would tilt back down a little, but I easily adjusted that by bending the side arms in slightly.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and the service was very fast and it was packed very carefully.</li>
            <li>I did have to send the first one back because it arrived in 1,000 pieces!</li>
            <li>I moved and forget to get the old one off the wall!  </li>
            <li>Seems to be pretty solid and stays where I put it.  </li>
            <li>I am NOT at all disappointed I used the sinkers and screws that came with it and mounted it to the doorframe where it will work best for me</li>
            <li>This mirror has a nice long extension and sags just a little at when it&#x27;s all the way out.</li>
            <li>There are very few accordion mirrors, and most of  them are magnified on both sides.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even have to replace the wall bracket since I could just plug the new one in the old bracket.</li>
            <li>I do wish that one with a bit less magnification were available.</li>
            <li>Be sure that the knurled knob is all the way down before final tightening and &amp;#34;locking&amp;#34;(by set screw) of the mirror to the rod.</li>
            <li>mirror is a nice, large size (much nicer than the small round</li>
            <li>I needed one with a longer extension in my new house and this was the only one I found at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It was kind of stiff at first, but after some use it has loosened up a little</li>
            <li>It is large enough to use.  </li>
            <li>the large square mirror is plenty big.</li>
            <li>Its fairly large and the extension comes out far enough</li>
            <li>And since it was so loose, the mirror was never in the right spot -</li>
            <li>Very high quality and last forever!</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair (what little is left of it) and this mirror in conjunction with a regular wall mirror allows me to do that again.</li>
            <li>so I really searched hard and read so many reviews about various ones.  </li>
            <li>Mirrors are clear.</li>
            <li>Classy product.  </li>
            <li>Very well constructed, solid.</li>
            <li>wow,     </li>
            <li>how well the chrome finish will hold up in a humid bathroom, but so far it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mirror is actually sturdy and is very functional.</li>
            <li>Because of the way I am, I fixed the rivet from my parts collection</li>
            <li>Everything needed was in the packaging, which arrived early.</li>
            <li>you are going to attach it directly to the wall, either find a stud or purchase sturdier screw anchors.</li>
            <li>Package arrived early.  </li>
            <li>so he fixed it and hung it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old lady</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror, especially the magnifying side.  </li>
            <li>Cheap mount and heavy mirror do not make for a quality product.</li>
            <li>when i stand straight they only show up to my neck xD  </li>
            <li>while on amazon i saw the mirror,i have one that is 33years old</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier to curl the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>Not something that can be fixed without re-riveting it.</li>
            <li>My husband complained about mounting it on a wall in our bathroom but uses it MORE than I do.  </li>
            <li>The rivet falls off before I even pull it completely out of a package.  </li>
            <li>Is now a year old and still looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery and packaging was satisfactory and I found the rectangle mirror was better then a traditional round mirror.</li>
            <li>Very well-made and heavy duty structure for easy care and long life.</li>
            <li>In other words, regardless of how far you have the mirror extended, the entire length of the top of the arm stays parallel to the wall bracket (as it should) but the bottom portion of the arm &amp;#34;leans&amp;#34; to the right causing the entire mirror to hang crooked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mounted to the side wall, I can easily stretch this mirror to where I usually stand</li>
            <li>I like the wide frame more viewing space then the normal round mirrors.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased a round mirror at Lowes, but it broke,</li>
            <li>It telescopes out to you, and the magnification side makes it simple and easy to clearly see all those small hairs you might normally miss on your face--especially if you use an electric razor like I do.  </li>
            <li>I have tried holding the vertical rod in pliers padded with paper while tightening the bracket onto the rod, and then tightening that setscrew with its tiny hex key until I thought I&#x27;d strip the key out of it, but it still works loose pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Unless it is extended all the way out the mirror is crooked, so by the time you fold it all the way back to wall ( when not using) it is super crooked.</li>
            <li>This mirror is big, most I looked at were kinda small.  </li>
            <li>(Granted, with my face a little distortion is not a bad thing....)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; so the suggested height was too high.  </li>
            <li>It extends far enough and is large enough to see things.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t loose the little plastic collar.</li>
            <li>Major design flaw!</li>
            <li>We had a slight amount of trouble with the drywall screws they gave us and in the end we had to go buy our own.</li>
            <li>The Fatal Flaw of this product is those cheap weak plastic nipples on the left and right side of the mirror which are meant to anchor it in the bracket.</li>
            <li>Now I try to remember to pivot the mirror only in the tightening direction, turning it almost a full turn to adjust it the other way, and if I can find the Locktite I will try that.    </li>
            <li>Mirror works great and looks as advertised,  only complaint was that the screws to install were missing from the box.</li>
            <li>The mirror was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The shaft has to turn with the mirror and is pretty tight when new.</li>
            <li>The mirror is fine, not strong enough for how I want to use it.</li>
            <li>This second purchase is to give our guests the same convenience as I have when getting ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>Extention at least 50% greater than similar products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other magnifying mirrors, and this is the first one that provides a non-distorted view.</li>
            <li>But this mirror is exactly what we needed and expected!</li>
            <li>I can tilt it to catch either the natural light from the window or the artificial light from above depending upon the time of day I am using it.  </li>
            <li>Love it, now to get my other half to put it on the wall!</li>
            <li>Finally, I thought to wrap a piece of dental floss tightly a few times under one of the white plastic acorn nuts, and now it works fine.  </li>
            <li>searched high and low and finally found it on amazon</li>
            <li>We recently did a complete makeover of the wife&#x27;s bathroom</li>
            <li>Flimsy short soft plastic bolts &amp; nuts</li>
            <li>much lighter that expected but will do the job.</li>
            <li>This is my second mirror -- the old one lasted for years and years.  </li>
            <li>Setting this up behind her in motel bathrooms she is always able to handle her every styling need.</li>
            <li>Maybe my face was too fat for the other mirror, I&#x27;m not sure : )</li>
            <li>So far this mirror is very cleverly made and has few faults,I would buy again.</li>
            <li>I loved this mirror - past tense because after twelve years it&#x27;s time to replace it.</li>
            <li>There was still an annoying wobble but the mirror all in all worked well facing &amp; extending fairly close to my large well-lighted master bath mirror.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the negatives concern you other than to be ready to do some &amp;#34;tweaking&amp;#34; with this product when you get it.  </li>
            <li>Mostly sturdy and well constructed but the little plastic knob that held the mirror popped off after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>One nice feature is it mounts with a narrow bracket that fits the small space next to my mirror (photo).  </li>
            <li>Now if I pull the mirror out from the wall as far as I would like, the whole thing droops at the point with the missing grommet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then it would probably cost more and the price was one of the selling points for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached to a wooden door frame behind the bathroom door and there was plenty of room for door to close.</li>
            <li>I was able to install it easily, the problem I&#x27;m having is it \\&quot;drifts\\&quot; towards the back wall when I have it pulled out, which is annoying.</li>
            <li>The mirror very easily can be twisted off and dropped.</li>
            <li>Also the white caps that hold the mirror fall off because they are not tight enough.</li>
            <li>It easily extends 23 inches from the wall without having to tug very hard.</li>
            <li>No more bending down to use a mirror &amp; being able to see the back of her head is a bonus.</li>
            <li>The large square mirror that swivels to a magnifying mirror on the other side is big enough for any purpose.  </li>
            <li>so it can be really cranked down.</li>
            <li>Glad to see they included a small tightening screw where the mirror attaches to the post to ensure it doesn&#x27;t loosen and fall off after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Other mirrors available are usually round, you almost always need to stand back a little in order to see your whole face, or your both eyes when your applying eye make up.  </li>
            <li>The accordion part looked a little flimsy from the start, so I&#x27;ve tried to avoid extending and retracting it much, but its still breaking.</li>
            <li>Good mirror, bad craftsmanship.</li>

            <li> Really nice mirror.</li>
            <li> It is a nice mirror, but not what I thought I was going to get</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> Thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> For $25 it&#x27;s kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li> It swings out of the way nice and compactly.  </li>
            <li> I liked this one</li>
            <li> , They were nice, suggested my mirror might be defective and encouraged me to return it for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Arm extends a nice distance</li>
            <li> It is definately something I would recommend and plan on getting one for myself when I get my own place.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> Will be nice to use to put makeup on and use both hands.</li>
            <li> I use a curling iron every day &amp; also trim my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Was nice quality.</li>
            <li> Since I cut and color my own hair, it is an invaulable tool to have.  </li>
            <li> and It is what every woman needs who wants to look there best.</li>
            <li> As a retired hair stylist, I do my own hair, and along with the help of this mirror I save lots of money that I would otherwise be spending at a hair salon each month.  </li>
            <li> , makes PERFECT sense, the round mirrors don&#x27;t so I am very happy I bought this one!&lt;br /&gt;by</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it weren&#x27;t for that.</li>
            <li> This is so nice.</li>
            <li> This one is a nice size and stayed in place.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice reach if you can&#x27;t put it close to you.</li>
            <li> It feels sturdy and folds nicely against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> My husband is in a wheelchair &amp; this handy mirror works well for him to shave &amp; wash up.</li>
            <li> I am just so excited about this mirror!!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this mirror extends nicely would be great if it were a little more rigid , but it serves the purpose well and the magnified side is great for looking up close.</li>
            <li> Great for assisting with a close shave and clean up.</li>
            <li> wife likes it, easy to install, and seems like good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> magnification is perfect, anything more would be too much.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality mirror and it was easy to install.  </li>
            <li> It is quality, easy to mount and looks good too.</li>
            <li> It loosens up very easily.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to install; however, we didn&#x27;t use the mounting screws it came with.</li>
            <li> Having dual mirror with magnification is a plus..  and very easy to install.</li>
            <li> All hardware is included, and very easy to install.</li>
            <li> Very easy installation if you can operate a screwdriver.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s good to have a mirror that can be pulled out close to my handsome face for a close, clean shave!  </li>
            <li> Love it because its always handy and folds and doesn&#x27;t take a lot&lt;</li>
            <li> If you have too far to lean to see what you&#x27;re doing while shaving in the bathroom, this product is perfect.  </li>
            <li> For makeup application or shaving, this is a really good, hands free mirror.  </li>
            <li> Along with it being able to contour out of the way it is always handy at a reach to help with my make-up</li>
            <li> so far, everything about this product is perfect....</li>
            <li> really pleased with the quality of this product, quick shipping &amp; great customer service.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on wall!</li>
            <li> Great mirror for my teens bedroom, long extension, good quality, fair price.</li>
            <li> However this one gives good magnification for putting in contacts or make up or whatever more detailed operation</li>
            <li> I figured with all the opening and closing it would need something more durable to not pull out of the wall very easily.</li>
            <li> This was very easy to install, I love the versatality of this unit, it is</li>
            <li> The extension arm seems to be sturdy and maintains a fairly even level when extended at full length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very important when using a mirror for make up application which was my reason for the purchase.  </li>
            <li> looks very cheap.</li>
            <li> The accordion is nice and strong.</li>
            <li> Super fast ship  Awesome product</li>
            <li> Very good quality and clear mirror.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use that side, so it&#x27;s OK for me.</li>
            <li> I love the mirrors.</li>
            <li> The point of buying an adjustable mirror is to be able to adjust it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will serve the purpose well.</li>
            <li> Looks like I will have to spend $100 more for a quality mirror...</li>
            <li> and I just wasn&#x27;t sure about the shape and how it would look on the wall.  </li>
            <li> It extends 30 inches and is able to adjust and pivot away from the wall at an angle.</li>
            <li> I would be sure to mount on stud - I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li> It looks stylish and doesn&#x27;t distrack from our decor.  </li>
            <li> The top bushing on the slider doesn&#x27;t stay in, but it doesn&#x27;t effect the operation of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I was able to install it without any problems.</li>
            <li> The materials used for the construction of the mirror could be better, but it passes.  </li>
            <li> This does have one side regular and one side magnified--it is perfect.</li>
            <li> charged more for shipping too.</li>
            <li> sincerely, sarg</li>
            <li> I needed a wall mirror that would extend about 20 inches from the wall, and this does that and more.</li>
            <li> A chrome surround would have looked a lot better.</li>
            <li> I was able to return it.</li>
            <li> That worked out OK.  </li>
            <li> I was able to give myself a haircut.  </li>
            <li> We have had it a couple months and are glad we ordered it.</li>
            <li> This looks much better</li>
            <li> I love this mirror...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I made it without this thing :)</li>

            <li> I should have done more research.</li>
            <li> My wife thinks this mirror is wonderful for combing the back of her hair and also for applying make-up.</li>

            <li> I would advise not buying this mirror and instead finding a more sturdy, metal-constructed mirror.</li>
            <li> And I do a much better job.</li>
            <li> Exspect to be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be more pleased .</li>

            <li> extends out 27 inches, retracts easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Returned to Amazon for a replacement, which was fine....</li>

            <li> Both mirrors a free of any distortion or imperfections.</li>
            <li> Or, if it had to be plastic, perhaps a light gray.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great 2-sided accordion mirror that swings out and away from the wall by about 2 feet.  </li>
            <li> There were problems mounting the mirror because of some cheap construction.  </li>
            <li> Cheap price for a cheap item.  </li>
            <li> Smooth reflection</li>
            <li> Looks cheap 2.</li>
            <li> Use to dye hair roots and allows vision of the back of head - great product.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1st one for myself [and my wife, who never uses it].&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much</li>
            <li> See your fabulous face as NEVER before.great shaving helper.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> It is great for when you need to see the back of your hair while straightening or curling yor hair.</li>
            <li> This mirrior is great to have hanging next to my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a rectangular accordion mirror and this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for viewing the back of your head.  </li>
            <li> (fortunately I had one of these in my tool box, if not, yet another trip to the hardware store).</li>
            <li> For the price think this mirror is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> It looks nice and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Also, the scant instructions do not provide any information on what size drill bit to use to fit the mollies.  </li>
            <li> So great on my bathroom wall placed so I can use it to see the back of</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Easily installs, and full extension.</li>
            <li> Very useful for makeup and shaving.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described, and even more well made than I had envisioned.</li>
            <li> Bought this because Jerdon is a respected name in mirrors, was not disappointed .</li>
            <li> It was exactly as shown in the picture....is better</li>
            <li> I have used it daily since then and I love it more each time I use it!</li>
            <li> So nice to be able to see the back of my hair and style</li>
            <li> The white is not horrible, but it does detract from an otherwise nice design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, great price I needed to replace my old one that was gold and chipping.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy and the mirror is quite a bit larger than most in this category.  </li>
            <li> These mirrors are hard to find, so I was thrilled that they were available!!!  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased &amp; think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> If you put it in the right height for yourself, it is great for seeing the back of your head for styling hair also.</li>
            <li> Just not quite true to color.  </li>
            <li> The good things about this are its overall design and useability, the size and quality of the mirrors including the choice of magnification on the magnifier side, and the quality and sturdiness and finish of the mounting bracket and articulated arm.    </li>
            <li> I was impressed by the size and shape of the mirror, however, the instructions for putting it together and installing it were quite confusing.</li>
            <li> It is well made and for the price is a true bargain.</li>
            <li> It really assist me to style my hair and be able to view from all angels.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this mirror, because it stretches up to 30 in length which is very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done, it folds up nicely against the wall, completely out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, it makes applying my makeup at the bathroom vanity much easier.</li>
            <li> Thanks, love it.</li>
            <li> its full extended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise good enough.</li>
            <li> good quality especially for the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend! :-)</li>
            <li> It stretches the full length as described and</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure how much 5x was.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Super glue seems to be holding it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try Super Glue and see if that works.</li>
            <li> I learned an important fact about this mirror that anyone who decides to purchase this needs to be aware of.</li>
            <li> I had it screwed into a stud &amp; it seems pretty secure.  </li>
            <li> It extends real far and helps me trim the back of my neck with my new clippers just perfectly, so the mirror does its job as needed.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a great example of half a work...</li>
            <li> It is easy to mount to the wall and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Assembly to the wall was easy and it&#x27;s very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The material used in making the mirror and extension arm is very sturdy, much better class than alot of mirrors I have looked at,at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I certainly think the price is fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering hot gluing them on!  </li>
            <li> was exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> It has about twice the reach of most retractable mirrors especially in this price range which makes it easy to see fully around your head.</li>
            <li> Many mirrors out there that are less expensive but if you are going to mount it on the wall, best to get a good one.</li>
            <li> The flat side is great and the concave (zoom) side is very clear and doesn&#x27;t give me any eye strain.</li>
            <li> What a nice addition to our bathroom vanity &amp; medicine cabinets, the viewing capacity is great and the magnification on the other side of mirror is nice too, and the sissors allow the mirror to come out far enough to see the back of your head easily, we are going to buy some for our children too.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and this makes it possible to see all angles.</li>
            <li> Mirror looks nice the only issue i had with this was when i was adjusting the mirror</li>
            <li> I really like the way this mirror extends to a good length from the wall, much further than some I have tried.</li>
            <li> looks nice, sturdy and has big size mirror to look at&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use mine to see the back of my head since I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Mag&amp;#34; side is powerful yet not overly distorted.</li>
            <li> This product takes about 5 minutes to install, and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Let me say this, I am still using my old one, that alone should tell anyone this is a top notch product</li>
            <li> It reflects light properly, for sure.  </li>
            <li> and I can move the mirror far enough to get in good light.</li>
            <li> like the mirror, and it is useful.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone...love it, it stretches so much farther than any other mirror and the reverse magnifying mirror is great for close up</li>
            <li> Other than that mirror works good to give yourself a self haircut.</li>
            <li> And, the right price too.</li>
            <li> The 4x magnifier is just right for my vision.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent buy and recommend this Price is Right product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> Magnification is just right.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was right on time.  </li>
            <li> You can get it from one of the major home supply stores but it was more than $10 cheaper on Amazon and the home supply store</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funky and fun looking in my bathroom and serves my purpose well and was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It replaced an old one made of plastic, and this one is all metal and much better made and will last us for many years.</li>
            <li> Its pretty solid on the wall and was very easy to install, recommend a cordless powerdrill and drill some pre holes</li>
            <li> This means just about every angle is available, which is important for someone like me who cuts his hair and needs the ability to see the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> It is also a square shape rather than round like most, which enables you to have a better view.  </li>
            <li> Heavy enough that it must be installed into  structural wood or good strong &amp;#34;molly&#x27;s&amp;#34;...or whatever those things are called!  </li>
            <li> price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> That was a bummer, but I fixed it as well, and once I mounted the mirror, it&#x27;s been working fine.  </li>
            <li> Same as the original except for the lack of nylon bearings on the post causing it to swing too freely towards the lowest point.</li>
            <li> Had one of these mirrors for approximately 20 years so know it is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> hard time seeing when have to remove my glasses, this works great.</li>
            <li> Great price for a hard to find item</li>
            <li> It certainly would not withstand rough handling, but provided it&#x27;s securely anchored (I recommend screwing it into a wall stud if you plan on extending it more than 16 inches)</li>
            <li> Love the design but the mirror falls off regularly...</li>
            <li> I was glad to see they still made the same one.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife needed.</li>
            <li> I am pleased enough with this, and do not regret purchasing it, not having found anything preferable.</li>
            <li> It actually looks much better in person than the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> I needed something to be able to see the back of my hair so that I could use both hands to style it.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what it said.</li>
            <li> I like this one even better because it extends out further</li>
            <li> I can see the back of my hair lots better now.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well</li>
            <li> Pretty crappy quality control; for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work for a different application.</li>
            <li> pretty dang sturdy too</li>
            <li> but I hung it incorrectly the first time.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed to be able to see back of hair while fixing it.</li>
            <li> w/an option for a higher magnification.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t use the ones provided, my experience with screw anchors indicates these most likely won&#x27;t hold the weight with the mirror extended for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> others have stated, it would have been nice if the mirror had a different frame instead of the cheap plastic white one that is provided.  </li>
            <li> I am now able to cut and color my hair while viewing from all sides at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I looked for this exact mirror in stores but could not find it</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This mirror does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I am able to see and straighten the hair on the back of my head with ease now.</li>

            <li> Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> got exactly what I needed and what I needed it for - to look up my nose at the nose hairs</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> If larger I would be able to see the back of my hair after styling. : )</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted..............</li>
            <li> Know this in advance, I oiled it and it loosened pretty well.  </li>
            <li> sturdy, doesn&#x27;t sag when extended, smooth action.</li>
            <li> it works good, it is heavy duty and is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> It goes together easily &amp; just make sure that you attach it to a wall correctly, because it is somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li> right where you need it, I really like it</li>
            <li> Right away one of the rivets fell out, and when it is pushed against the wall it looks straight</li>
            <li> The mirror itself was wobbly because I wasn&#x27;t able to secure the swivel frame tightly to the extension.  </li>
            <li> 4.5 stars is the most accurate rating, but I&#x27;ll round up to 5.</li>
            <li> The package did arrive on-time, and all of the parts were included, but once it was installed, I extended the mirror and noticed that even though the mirror was installed on the wall straight, the accordian style arm is torqued &amp; the further you extend it from the wall, the more the extension torques.</li>
            <li> the positive side, there aren&#x27;t a lot of choices for this style of mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror allows me to see the back and sides very easily adjusts up and down and tilts couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better</li>
            <li> This one seems to be a bit more sturdy so I am hoping it lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> The rectrangular mirror is good and big, you can see the whole back of your head.</li>
            <li> High quality, priced right product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular mirror because it extends further than most others.  </li>
            <li> I love the large size of the mirror and the long extension arm.</li>
            <li> This was easy to mount and worked fine for a few months, but now the rivets on the accordion are breaking off and it&#x27;s drooping downward.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my old small apartment and it worked great.</li>
            <li> It is easy to see the back of your hair.</li>
            <li> It is a great mirror, but (1) the screws for the sheetrock anchors are too small in diameter and after the anchors just pushed thru into the sheetrock on install; I had to get some professional anchors at the hardware store; and (2) you need a jeweler&#x27;s screwdriver to tighten the set screw that secures the mirror to the swivel - not mentioned in the description</li>
            <li> My husband put it up (which was an easy process because it only has (2) screws!.</li>
            <li> Daily use now for a couple of months and the metal accordion piece is still going strong with no problems to date.</li>
            <li> Magnification side is strong enough to make</li>
            <li> The first time, she was able to put it back together without damage, the 2nd time - she was not so lucky.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many times I re-attached them, it stayed loose.  </li>
            <li> It took a little more effort to screw the mirror onto the rod, as mine did not seem to screw down as far as it should, but it still works great.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it as tight as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> The mirror isn&#x27;t secure because the end knobs that hold the mirror in place are NOT designed to hold anything in place securely: they do NOT snap in place to hold the mirror tightly.</li>
            <li> Expected more for the money, how hard is it to make anything good these days?</li>
            <li> Makes blow drying and styling my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> The rectagular mirror is a plus because you can see you whole face.  </li>
            <li> so much that I ended up getting two.  </li>
            <li> If you really pull it out to the max, it will extend 32 inches.</li>
            <li> We really like the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Just have to be gentle with pulling it out from the wall.  </li>
            <li> After ordering this product for $71.00 I noted same mirror available from Home  Depot for $24.00.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon..</li>
            <li> I mounted it so it is available in the bathroom and extends into the shower with the door partially open.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really keep it from unscrewing.</li>
            <li> Very durable extension</li>
            <li> This mirror allows me to see the back and sides of my head  - hands free.</li>
            <li> I bought the 30&amp;#34; extension to get as much length</li>
            <li> bought a cheaper one before, not remember the brand, very flimsy and unstable&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> Looks like you have a really cheap crooked mirror on your wall.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy</li>
            <li> The chrome is very shiny, and the mirror serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She hasn&#x27;t said much about it since, but she was tickled to get it, at the time.&lt;br /&gt;Compared</li>
            <li> Very well constructed.  </li>
            <li> It mounts with some very sturdy frame work and works about as well as you could expect.</li>
            <li> The whole thing seemed to work without it, though, so I installed it</li>
            <li> , it lasted me twelve years and the only wish would be a stronger magnification available.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for shaving,</li>
            <li> and I was ready to go in under 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Solid, &amp;#34;heavy weight&amp;#34;, smooth operation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been gentle on it (as has my wife)</li>
            <li> Really like the size and expandability, but the thing keeps falling apart.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast..</li>
            <li> real perception of quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks Jerdon , for making this basic beauty tool still available</li>
            <li> When you pull the accordion out and flip the mirror, you can see the back of your hair, hands free.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> and the mirror is smooth and big</li>
            <li> I know the description said it was white and silver, but it has cheap looking plastic around the mirror.</li>
            <li> It makes my life so much easier on getting dressed in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t installed but seems very well made.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this one to work out.</li>
            <li> If I installed it to make it straight, the mirror would lean to one side.  </li>
            <li> Product is made very well and the size of the mirror is what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Very well made</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice heavy duty mirror.  </li>
            <li> nice heavy metal.</li>
            <li> For several years, we moved a lot, or were next to homeless, so I would have had no place to put it, but now I am stable again and thrilled to have it.</li>
            <li> Nice but heavy.</li>
            <li> This item is a high quality product that was purchased at a very reasonable price like so many other items I have bought using Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> White trim makes it look really nice with the white framed main mirrors in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it better than her other.</li>
            <li> The other thing that was just OK was the method of attaching the U shaped metal bracket to the vertical rod at the mirror end of the arm.</li>
            <li> It is light, flexible, and folds flat to the wall.  </li>
            <li> Old one wore out, new one much improved and should last many years.</li>
            <li> The expansion is very stiff, but otherwise the mirror is a great size and perfect for seeing the back of your hair for styling or cutting.</li>
            <li> Really nice for doing french braids on long hair</li>
            <li> took it off and turned around and now works better but plastic on peg not right.</li>
            <li> this nice square mirror just perfect,very helpful, i can fix my hair behind ,i just love this double side mirror !</li>
            <li> If your looking for a nice sturdy extension mirror, that is not cheap of flimsy, then this is it!</li>
            <li> Bought this item as it was exactly like the old one, which needed replacing.</li>
            <li> You have to be really carefull to make sure the nut stays tight.</li>
            <li> The mirror was easy to mount and the frame is tight and well made for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I really depended on it and thank goodness now I can get a new one.</li>
            <li> I installed is as vertically level as possible, but the mirror seems to naturally lean to the right, which makes it swing right rather than hold the spot</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that it appears to be an OK mirror, if it costs $10 less than what I paid.</li>
            <li> Now, I can swing the mirror to the right and see the back of my head in the large mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Construction is decent.</li>
            <li> If I were able to secure an inexpensive replacement for the broken mirror</li>
            <li> Be sure you use the screw inserts to make it solid in the wall and drill into the stud if possible.</li>
            <li> It appears to be a decent mirror.  </li>
            <li> The magnification works well too for the times when my daughter or daughter-in-love are visiting and my main makeup mirror is in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When done, it quickly pushes back to the home position up against the wall</li>
            <li> Large enough to see everything, easy to pull out and push back.  </li>
            <li> But it works as expected, looks decent for the money &amp; lays nice &amp; flat up against the wall.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The installation is straight-forward: Driving the mounting screws into a stud is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend this to anyone needing an affordable wall-mounted shave or makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was hoping when I bought this that it would be of a high quality and</li>
            <li> It has a nice magnifying mirror on one side and the other is a regular</li>
            <li> One thing that was just OK was the quality of the plastic frame around the glass including its little trunions or pegs by which the metal bracket holds it.</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks , sturdy, so far very durable</li>
            <li> The mirror was fantastic, just as expected.</li>
            <li> it worth my time and effort to send it back</li>
            <li> it should survive normal use.</li>
            <li> I love it because I can view the back of my head while using both hands to put up my long hair.</li>
            <li> The magnifying side is powerful enough that I can see without my glasses.</li>
            <li> extra work was worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I have a 5x round mirror that is definitely more magnification than this one.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaint and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the extra long extension that this wall mount mirror has.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough and it&#x27;s so pretty and also professional looking!</li>
            <li> Feels nice and solid and you can move it up, down, left, right and pull it out from the wall</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to install...</li>
            <li> It swings out to just the right length so that I can see the back of my hair from all angles and because it&#x27;s hands-free I can adjust whatever stray hair strands need adjusting without losing the focus.</li>
            <li> and check your mirror to make sure it is staying tight!</li>
            <li> This is the piece that goes between the metal rod and the metal bracket allowing the two to slide smoothly against each other.</li>
            <li> For the money, this actually turned out to be quite a nice little mirror.</li>
            <li> so we got a new one.  </li>
            <li> A set screw was not threaded, had to drill and tap in a new one, keeps the mirror from coming off.  </li>
            <li> If it cost less, I&#x27;d easily give it three or four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the white frame could also be available in chrome.</li>
            <li> The mirror is sturdy when pulled out to the maximum length and compact enough to fit on the opposite wall from my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> Thought we would need to remove the mirror going down the road but handles the bumps fine</li>
            <li> It was such a good and small investment!</li>
            <li> The mirror adjusts quite nicely too, and originally when I tilted it up towards my face it would tilt back down a little, but I easily adjusted that by bending the side arms in slightly.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and the service was very fast and it was packed very carefully.</li>
            <li> I did have to send the first one back because it arrived in 1,000 pieces!</li>
            <li> I moved and forget to get the old one off the wall!  </li>
            <li> Seems to be pretty solid and stays where I put it.  </li>
            <li> I am NOT at all disappointed I used the sinkers and screws that came with it and mounted it to the doorframe where it will work best for me</li>
            <li> This mirror has a nice long extension and sags just a little at when it&#x27;s all the way out.</li>
            <li> There are very few accordion mirrors, and most of  them are magnified on both sides.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even have to replace the wall bracket since I could just plug the new one in the old bracket.</li>
            <li> I do wish that one with a bit less magnification were available.</li>
            <li> Be sure that the knurled knob is all the way down before final tightening and &amp;#34;locking&amp;#34;(by set screw) of the mirror to the rod.</li>
            <li> mirror is a nice, large size (much nicer than the small round</li>
            <li> I needed one with a longer extension in my new house and this was the only one I found at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It was kind of stiff at first, but after some use it has loosened up a little</li>
            <li> It is large enough to use.  </li>
            <li> the large square mirror is plenty big.</li>
            <li> Its fairly large and the extension comes out far enough</li>
            <li> And since it was so loose, the mirror was never in the right spot -</li>
            <li> Very high quality and last forever!</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair (what little is left of it) and this mirror in conjunction with a regular wall mirror allows me to do that again.</li>
            <li> so I really searched hard and read so many reviews about various ones.  </li>
            <li> Mirrors are clear.</li>
            <li> Classy product.  </li>
            <li> Very well constructed, solid.</li>
            <li> wow,     </li>
            <li> how well the chrome finish will hold up in a humid bathroom, but so far it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mirror is actually sturdy and is very functional.</li>
            <li> Because of the way I am, I fixed the rivet from my parts collection</li>
            <li> Everything needed was in the packaging, which arrived early.</li>
            <li> you are going to attach it directly to the wall, either find a stud or purchase sturdier screw anchors.</li>
            <li> Package arrived early.  </li>
            <li> so he fixed it and hung it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old lady</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror, especially the magnifying side.  </li>
            <li> Cheap mount and heavy mirror do not make for a quality product.</li>
            <li> when i stand straight they only show up to my neck xD  </li>
            <li> while on amazon i saw the mirror,i have one that is 33years old</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier to curl the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> Not something that can be fixed without re-riveting it.</li>
            <li> My husband complained about mounting it on a wall in our bathroom but uses it MORE than I do.  </li>
            <li> The rivet falls off before I even pull it completely out of a package.  </li>
            <li> Is now a year old and still looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivery and packaging was satisfactory and I found the rectangle mirror was better then a traditional round mirror.</li>
            <li> Very well-made and heavy duty structure for easy care and long life.</li>
            <li> In other words, regardless of how far you have the mirror extended, the entire length of the top of the arm stays parallel to the wall bracket (as it should) but the bottom portion of the arm &amp;#34;leans&amp;#34; to the right causing the entire mirror to hang crooked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mounted to the side wall, I can easily stretch this mirror to where I usually stand</li>
            <li> I like the wide frame more viewing space then the normal round mirrors.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased a round mirror at Lowes, but it broke,</li>
            <li> It telescopes out to you, and the magnification side makes it simple and easy to clearly see all those small hairs you might normally miss on your face--especially if you use an electric razor like I do.  </li>
            <li> I have tried holding the vertical rod in pliers padded with paper while tightening the bracket onto the rod, and then tightening that setscrew with its tiny hex key until I thought I&#x27;d strip the key out of it, but it still works loose pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Unless it is extended all the way out the mirror is crooked, so by the time you fold it all the way back to wall ( when not using) it is super crooked.</li>
            <li> This mirror is big, most I looked at were kinda small.  </li>
            <li> (Granted, with my face a little distortion is not a bad thing....)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; so the suggested height was too high.  </li>
            <li> It extends far enough and is large enough to see things.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t loose the little plastic collar.</li>
            <li> Major design flaw!</li>
            <li> We had a slight amount of trouble with the drywall screws they gave us and in the end we had to go buy our own.</li>
            <li> The Fatal Flaw of this product is those cheap weak plastic nipples on the left and right side of the mirror which are meant to anchor it in the bracket.</li>
            <li> Now I try to remember to pivot the mirror only in the tightening direction, turning it almost a full turn to adjust it the other way, and if I can find the Locktite I will try that.    </li>
            <li> Mirror works great and looks as advertised,  only complaint was that the screws to install were missing from the box.</li>
            <li> The mirror was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The shaft has to turn with the mirror and is pretty tight when new.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine, not strong enough for how I want to use it.</li>
            <li> This second purchase is to give our guests the same convenience as I have when getting ready for the day.  </li>
            <li> Extention at least 50% greater than similar products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other magnifying mirrors, and this is the first one that provides a non-distorted view.</li>
            <li> But this mirror is exactly what we needed and expected!</li>
            <li> I can tilt it to catch either the natural light from the window or the artificial light from above depending upon the time of day I am using it.  </li>
            <li> Love it, now to get my other half to put it on the wall!</li>
            <li> Finally, I thought to wrap a piece of dental floss tightly a few times under one of the white plastic acorn nuts, and now it works fine.  </li>
            <li> searched high and low and finally found it on amazon</li>
            <li> We recently did a complete makeover of the wife&#x27;s bathroom</li>
            <li> Flimsy short soft plastic bolts &amp; nuts</li>
            <li> much lighter that expected but will do the job.</li>
            <li> This is my second mirror -- the old one lasted for years and years.  </li>
            <li> Setting this up behind her in motel bathrooms she is always able to handle her every styling need.</li>
            <li> Maybe my face was too fat for the other mirror, I&#x27;m not sure : )</li>
            <li> So far this mirror is very cleverly made and has few faults,I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I loved this mirror - past tense because after twelve years it&#x27;s time to replace it.</li>
            <li> There was still an annoying wobble but the mirror all in all worked well facing &amp; extending fairly close to my large well-lighted master bath mirror.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the negatives concern you other than to be ready to do some &amp;#34;tweaking&amp;#34; with this product when you get it.  </li>
            <li> Mostly sturdy and well constructed but the little plastic knob that held the mirror popped off after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> One nice feature is it mounts with a narrow bracket that fits the small space next to my mirror (photo).  </li>
            <li> Now if I pull the mirror out from the wall as far as I would like, the whole thing droops at the point with the missing grommet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then it would probably cost more and the price was one of the selling points for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached to a wooden door frame behind the bathroom door and there was plenty of room for door to close.</li>
            <li> I was able to install it easily, the problem I&#x27;m having is it \\&quot;drifts\\&quot; towards the back wall when I have it pulled out, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> The mirror very easily can be twisted off and dropped.</li>
            <li> Also the white caps that hold the mirror fall off because they are not tight enough.</li>
            <li> It easily extends 23 inches from the wall without having to tug very hard.</li>
            <li> No more bending down to use a mirror &amp; being able to see the back of her head is a bonus.</li>
            <li> The large square mirror that swivels to a magnifying mirror on the other side is big enough for any purpose.  </li>
            <li> so it can be really cranked down.</li>
            <li> Glad to see they included a small tightening screw where the mirror attaches to the post to ensure it doesn&#x27;t loosen and fall off after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Other mirrors available are usually round, you almost always need to stand back a little in order to see your whole face, or your both eyes when your applying eye make up.  </li>
            <li> The accordion part looked a little flimsy from the start, so I&#x27;ve tried to avoid extending and retracting it much, but its still breaking.</li>
            <li> Good mirror, bad craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> The scissor is a bit tight and takes some patience to push closed if you open it to the full length, but I&#x27;d prefer that over the opposite (too loose).</li>
            <li> could use maybe a rubber grommet or something to keep it somewhat tight so that it stays steady and still.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, at a particular age, we just can&#x27;t see all those little imperfections in our  makeup or that stray facial hair!  </li>
            <li> that is long enough without having to bend over the sink, big enough to see my entire face and sturdy enough to withstand constant usage...</li>
            <li> The arm is very stiff and this unit mirror is a bit small, but it works and I couldn&#x27;t find anything better</li>
            <li> All the other mirrors with extendable arms just didn&#x27;t come that far from the wall.  </li>
            <li> Ah dont wanna go on to far and feel like a paid shill like the majority of the these other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The mirror then swings back and lays flat against the wall out of the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have a flat spot at the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> It has held up very well over the past several months I&#x27;ve had it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few that has this length of extension at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> cause the screws are a little longer then normal things guessing cause of the weight it has to support when</li>
            <li> /&gt;With only a few minor caveats, this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Plus, the long arm allows you to apply makeup without straining your back.      </li>
            <li> and  think it will last a long time</li>
            <li> It extends quite long, it swivels and has a regular and magnifier side.</li>
            <li> Wall mount swivels vertically which lets mirror lie flat against wall.  </li>
            <li> My wife having long hair that she puts up herself asked for an extra wall mount mirror so that she could see her hair on all sides.  </li>
            <li> It folds flat against the wall.</li>
            <li> One thing to note about this mirror that is not clear from the picture is that the mirror frame (the part holding the mirror) is actually white plastic, not chrome-plated metal.  </li>
            <li> The unit exactly matches the one that was made several years ago but became broken by house guests that were not careful...</li>
            <li> I love this mirror because it allows me to see the back of my head when styling, cutting, and coloring my hair.  </li>
            <li> Mine came all the way loose, and when I pushed the mirror back against the wall, the mirror went sailing across the floor and the magnifying side broke.</li>
            <li> I have some grey hair and when I color it</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long it takes until rust appears; bathrooms are after all rather humid.</li>
            <li> as I could get thinking it could never extend that long</li>
            <li> I doubt the hollow wall fasteners will stand up to constant use in the fully extended postion.</li>
            <li> It is a minor annoyance, but an annoyance, nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It extends far enough for me to actually stand in front of it and see the back of my head in the larger mirror behind me.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that you need to tighten the ring that holds the mirror frequently especially if you flip the mirror a lot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of driving me crazy to the point where I want to take it down.</li>
            <li> This replaces an earlier version of the same product that we had for years and it lives up to our previous experience.  </li>
            <li> My last one from another company sagged down after a short time and came loose wouldn&#x27;t stay in place...</li>
            <li> Along the center pivot point line, I had a rivet come loose and fall out, which rendered the entire thing unusable.  </li>
            <li> The screw that holds the mirror onto the stem has come loose a few times, but I think I&#x27;ve fixed that now.</li>
            <li> mirror&#x27;s frame is very cheap looking: ugly white plastic.</li>
            <li> One side is regular; the other magnifies 4.5 times.</li>
            <li> And of course the other side is standard reflection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the corresponding grommet on the other side of that hole fell out a while later.  </li>
            <li> I have another wall mirror and needed another mirror so that I could see the other side of my hair in the back.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, the scissor action of the extension is very tight.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll never live without one again.</li>
            <li> We purchased for my aunt as a Christmas gift who has has a stroke and has limited use of one hand.</li>
            <li> This takes away from the look, however, if you are looking for rectangular shape there are not many price conscious options</li>
            <li> The arm sticking down from the mirror itself sometimes binds a bit and the clear &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; &amp;#34;washer guides&amp;#34; (sorry for all the quotes, but I don&#x27;t know their real names!)</li>
            <li> I tried to reattach it but it was too loose to stay in place.</li>
            <li> Could not remove or tighten set screw so mirror stays loose on rod.</li>
            <li> Her old one got shaky from years of daily use</li>
            <li> When I opened the inner box, two plastic &amp;#34;grommets&amp;#34; fell out (almost went down the bathroom sink drain).</li>
            <li> I finally narrowed it down to three.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the small plastic caps on each side of the plastic mirror frame that hold the frame to the swivel bracket pop off at the lightest touch, causing the mirror to detach from the rest of the assembly, and making the entire contraption anything but adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy, and the metal part of the assembly is sturdy and well-made.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is that while the accordion action is very tight, the swivel action on the bracket is not.  </li>
            <li> Bought this item for my dad because he was getting cramps in his back when shaving, and the small circular accordion mirror didn&#x27;t give him enough space to see himself!  </li>
            <li> Other than that minor thing</li>
            <li> one has to keep screwing it tight daily...</li>
            <li> I have a tight space and this mirror fits and lets me see the back of my hair when I want to.</li>
            <li> My tub is located behind me when I look into the large mirror over my vanity.</li>
            <li> but as soon as it is pulled out the mirror is crooked, not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Like others who have responded, I wish the white plastic around the mirror was a little nicer.</li>
            <li> It could be a little bit larger</li>
            <li> Also, the mirror ended up being a little crooked.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad they cut corners by using cheap plastic for the mirror frame and critical attachment</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the mirror &#x27;unscrews&#x27; and then wobbles if you have two people using it at different angles side to side</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Was packaged very well, no way it could have broken.  </li>
            <li> Also there was some hardware missing (SCREWS) which were CRUCIAL.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: all measurements listed are taken from the wall to the center post that holds the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have encountered no fogging issues, as I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> YOu can tell it will rust after a couple of years in the bathroom and be careful you don&#x27;t routinely turn it counter clockwise</li>
            <li> Yes, I did carefully search all the packing material.  </li>
            <li> I use this for wet shaving, and move it out of the way between passes, and the mirror always needed readjustment.  </li>
            <li> Was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works well, well enough that i wanted to waste my lunch time at work writing this review</li>
            <li> This was a gift to an elderly grandfather who was having trouble seeing his face in the standard wall mirror, making shaving, etc.</li>
            <li> not as expected .</li>
            <li> and I carefully pulled it out of the box,  </li>
            <li> Not a big discrepancy, but not accurate either.  </li>
            <li> Used to have one at our old house and left it behind.</li>
            <li> but it was only stiff from newness.  </li>
            <li> But 3 in a row with something wrong tells me none of them are going to work right.</li>
            <li> I glued it on with general purpose pipe cement, which seems to be holding, but I was surprised how small the pegs are and how weak the method of retaining the covers appeared.</li>
            <li> scissor style extension mechanism is better in the aesthetics department, but it&#x27;s stiff and unpleasant to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough that it fits over the towel rack, and it&#x27;s convenient to flip over to the magnified side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Complaints are few and minor.</li>
            <li> I padded &amp; secured the other mirror.  </li>
            <li> the back of my head -- no more \\&quot;holes\\&quot; in the hairdo.</li>
            <li> so well I bought another one for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> Like the magnifying  option and the swivel angles are endless</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s now 3 months shy of 4 years and these mirrors are still doing pretty well.</li>
            <li> Extremely helpful to have this mounted in conjunction with medicine cabinet mirror</li>
            <li> I can turn it around and it has a magnifying mirror on the other side for closer inspections.</li>
            <li> This one does and I very wide.</li>
            <li> They have little acorn-nut-shaped covers pressed over them to keep the pegs from popping out of the metal bracket, but one of these covers was loose in the box when I received it.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, one of the little metal grommets that go at the interstices of the accordion-type metal pieces was loose in the package.  </li>
            <li> I returned it and bought a different mirror with metal screw anchors, because I had purchased had two of this deficient version and both had the same problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected, just a little flimsy, which may diminish it&#x27;s life span.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little wobbly and I feel like I have to be really careful with it</li>
            <li> The mirror housing is plastic and is a dull white color.</li>
            <li> so this is a hard mirror for me to use because it&#x27;s crooked.  </li>
            <li> The arm&#x27;s 30-inch extension capability is rather helpful when the distance to the wall on the side of the sink is longer than average.</li>
            <li> The white plastic framing others complained about doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, however, I waited too long to install it, past the point when I could return it.  </li>
            <li> holy crap did these go up in price, ah nehow glad i got it when i got it.  </li>
            <li> It will work its way loose, but never works its way tight!  </li>
            <li> The mirror is wobbly and not very secure.</li>
            <li> so mirrior can slide up and down for hight ajustment  </li>
            <li> and it was upside down.  </li>
            <li> Wish it would also move down</li>
            <li> farther then any other mirror I found for the money!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit wide angle - and not on the magnification side!  </li>
            <li> Use drywall screws into a stud because of sturdy accordion and a steak knife blade for mirror stem set screw slot less than a slotted screwdriver.</li>
            <li> Previous one held up for over 13 yrs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly OCD</li>
            <li> There is no way to repair or glue together a small piece of plastic that broke in half, so now the whole thing is completely useless.</li>
            <li> , my only complaint is that the small screw that attaches the mirror to seems a little flimsy</li>
            <li> It has a little set screw</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll need to take a little care when extending and retracting the mirror.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little pricey, so I knocked a star off, but works as it should.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> and I had to get a little advice on how to do the plastic part of the screw, but the rest of the mounting and putting together</li>
            <li> I used some that were a little heavier</li>
            <li> There is one aspect that I don&#x27;t care for, like the little plastic thumb screws on the sides, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> These pegs look pretty small and I am afraid they will break.</li>
            <li> It makes styling and cutting my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> My husband used a couple of toggle bolts to install, since it seemed too heavy for the included screws, and we&#x27;ve had no problem with it.  </li>
            <li> Well constructed and heavy construction.  </li>
            <li> Then one day it just fell apart and broke and is unable to be fixed.</li>
            <li> (I did however stick on a 10x round in a corner--plenty of room).</li>
            <li> Just wish it came with a round mirror.</li>
            <li> One rivet in the expanding arm was missing and the set screw was no where to be found.  </li>
            <li> It was frustrating trying to see the back and sides of my head, while holding up a mirror.</li>
            <li> It seems like the mirror loosens, but I just twist it around a few times every so often and it feels like it tightens up.</li>
            <li> Nothing missing or falling apart.  </li>
            <li> Fell apart a few days after mounting.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because I was tired of leaning across the sink to get closer to the big mirror while I shave.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any trouble with things loosening.  </li>
            <li> Returned did not fit where I needed it to go.</li>
            <li> I screw mine on a side wall so that it extends behind me as I&#x27;m standing in front of my larger bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday...</li>
            <li> I had to up size a couple of times to get it to where I could tap in the mollies without destroying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little stiff extension arm but can be lubricated.</li>
            <li> The extender is a little stiff</li>
            <li> The wall mount and accordion structure seems very sturdy, but the rivets (as I call them) that hold the accordion together are a vulnerable point of failure.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the setscrew anchoring the mirror to the shaft requires a very small screwdriver bit.</li>
            <li> IT MOVES WHERE IT&#x27;S NEEDED WITH VERY LITTLE TROUBLE.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months, the little knobs that hold the mirror onto the bracket kept coming off, and so did the mirror!  </li>
            <li> IT WAS MISSING A CAP FOR ONE SIDE OF MIRROR, WAS TO HARD TO PULL OUT IF IT WAS HANGING ON A WALL OF SHEETROCK.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what all else...</li>
            <li> usually it&#x27;s small and around,what make it even smaller,but</li>
            <li> There is a small set screw to tighten the side-to-side movement, but no adjustment for pivoting on the horizontal axis.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the package a small plastic bushing fell out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the 4x has been replaced by the 5x or if the 4x was a typo?  </li>
            <li> sorry, but I definitely cannot recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> No more leaning over to get close to the wall mirror or holding a hand mirror.</li>
            <li> A small problem is that mirror wangling from side to side</li>
            <li> I was not confident in its durability.</li>
            <li> The price was almost unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> USUALLY I AM NOT PLEASED WITH THINGS</li>
            <li> A small bolt and threaded end system on the mirror bracket would solve the problem.</li>
            <li> However I am not able to use in bathroom because of the way the cabinets and walls are designed.</li>
            <li> I had one of these just like it from Ikea and it got broken in our move down south.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to shave with your reading glasses on</li>
            <li> Hard  to pull forward</li>
            <li> Shooting across the bathroom, hard to find.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so hard to pull out.</li>
            <li> hard for him to do.  </li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;m keeping it and putting it to use, albeit with a level of care and attention that shouldn&#x27;t be necessary, I&#x27;ll grudgingly give it two stars.</li>
            <li> One of the rivets holding the &amp;#34;accordion&amp;#34; arm together fell out within minutes of mounting it to the wall, so I looked closer at the reviews and saw where this is a common problem.</li>
            <li> Been using the mirror for about 3 months, at least 2X a day.  </li>
            <li> so this makes cutting the back of my head a breeze!</li>
            <li> Wife had been looking for one that extended at least 20 inches from wall.</li>
            <li> It is a flimsy affair, and is too delicate to handle long-term use with confidence.  </li>
            <li> The problems I found aren&#x27;t the sort of thing for which one could request repair or replacement, because they are really design issues, and these two weaknesses are annoying.</li>
            <li> After a few months of poor shaving, I went to Amazon and solved the problem.</li>
            <li> While it worked I would give it 5 stars, but the fact that it fell apart for no apparent reason was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Then, when I opened the plastic bags, a very small chrome &amp;#34;nut&amp;#34; fell out.</li>
            <li> I can lay down in bed and do crosswords puzzles WHILE still watching tv behind me!</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t get knocked down and broken!</li>
            <li> Even with the correct sized bit it&#x27;s difficult to get tight.</li>
            <li> Amazon made it a little difficult to order but the product is all that I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> They put it in a box without any bubble wrap around it, dumb.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I took it out of the box, one of the riveted pivot &amp;#34;screws&amp;#34; was broken, so I used a small nut and bolt to substitute.  </li>
            <li> (it does come with small anchors if you can&#x27;t mount to the stud), screwed in the two screws at the base, mounted the mirror to the other end and tightened everything up</li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s square rather than round - easier for me to use when cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great quality.  </li>
            <li> It seems quite thin.</li>
            <li> Came to me broken.</li>
            <li> I got this to mount beside the medicine cabinet so I can have a mirror behind my head to simplify trimming the hair on my neck.</li>
            <li> I ended up doing all kinds of contortions to try to see what was going on behind me.  </li>

            <li> Love the design but the mirror falls off regularly...one has to keep screwing it tight daily...</li>
            <li> Nice item. I&#x27;ve had this mounted for around 10 months now with no issues.  My wife likes the functionality.</li>
            <li> Great mirror! Makes blow drying and styling my hair so much easier. You have to be really carefull to make sure the nut stays tight. It loosens up very easily. Mine came all the way loose, and when I pushed the mirror back against the wall, the mirror went sailing across the floor and the magnifying side broke. I don&#x27;t use that side, so it&#x27;s OK for me. I learned an important fact about this mirror that anyone who decides to purchase this needs to be aware of.</li>
            <li> The Amazon description says 4 1/2x magnification - the box, and the sticker on the mirror, both say 5x magnification.  Not a big discrepancy, but not accurate either.  The real disappointment is with the slightly green/gray hue of the reflection.  Just not quite true to color.  Very important when using a mirror for make up application which was my reason for the purchase.  I returned it because of this shortcoming.  I would not recommend this mirror to a friend.</li>
            <li> It replaced an old one made of plastic, and this one is all metal and much better made and will last us for many years.</li>
            <li> As I am writing this...my husband is cleaning up hundreds of pieces of mirror. He put it up correctly and the mirror was so flimsy that it fell off of the holder on to the floor. I would like for the seller to contact me about a refund. The hundreds of pieces of mirror now in the trash. He moved the holder so now there are two holes in the wall. Please respond.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just what I needed and easy to assemble.  I bought one just like this and it lasted for 10 years.  I was glad to see they still made the same one.  This one seems to be a bit more sturdy so I am hoping it lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife needed.</li>
            <li> Her old one got shaky from years of daily use so we got a new one.  Didn&#x27;t even have to replace the wall bracket since I could just plug the new one in the old bracket.</li>
            <li> The product came in perfect condition. I love the mirrors. They are a good size and the magnification is sufficient for me. It was very easy to install; however, we didn&#x27;t use the mounting screws it came with. We purchased inexpensive drywall screws for mounting heavier objects (up to 65 lbs a piece and used 2). I figured with all the opening and closing it would need something more durable to not pull out of the wall very easily. Another solution would be to mount it to a stud.</li>
            <li> The point of buying an adjustable mirror is to be able to adjust it. Unfortunately, the small plastic caps on each side of the plastic mirror frame that hold the frame to the swivel bracket pop off at the lightest touch, causing the mirror to detach from the rest of the assembly, and making the entire contraption anything but adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy, and the metal part of the assembly is sturdy and well-made. It&#x27;s too bad they cut corners by using cheap plastic for the mirror frame and critical attachment points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were it worth my time and effort to send it back, I&#x27;d only give it one star. But since I&#x27;m keeping it and putting it to use, albeit with a level of care and attention that shouldn&#x27;t be necessary, I&#x27;ll grudgingly give it two stars.</li>
            <li> gave to daughter she loves it</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter, she loves it. No more bending down to use a mirror &amp; being able to see the back of her head is a bonus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice heavy duty mirror.  Thankyou.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars if I could have mounted it in the shower, but it isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li> We recently did a complete makeover of the wife&#x27;s bathroom and she wanted an extension mirror. None were avalible locally or even at the home centers, for the price we got this one on Amazon. It must be right, because she is happy!</li>
            <li> My tub is located behind me when I look into the large mirror over my vanity. I placed this extension mirror on the wall to the left of my tub. Now, I can swing the mirror to the right and see the back of my head in the large mirror. The mirror then swings back and lays flat against the wall out of the way. It&#x27;s small enough that it fits over the towel rack, and it&#x27;s convenient to flip over to the magnified side.</li>
            <li> Good mirror. extends out 27 inches, retracts easily and smoothly. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The mirror is exacatly as advertised and was delivered quickly and in perfect shape.  The Perfect Online Transaction.</li>
            <li> Love it! Really big, can do makeup and tweeze brows a lot faster👄</li>
            <li> This mirror works great for me.</li>
            <li> I like rear mirror a lot. I have some grey hair and when I color it I&#x27;d sometimes miss the back!  It was diffficult to mount to wall, but it&#x27;s up now, and I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> Mirror arrived a day or two ahead of the projected delivery date.  Was packaged very well, no way it could have broken.  More than happy with the transaction, I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s in the market.</li>
            <li> GREAT for applying my make up</li>
            <li> I was looking for a wall mount make up mirror that is long enough without having to bend over the sink, big enough to see my entire face and sturdy enough to withstand constant usage...and I found this mirror!  I love it!  The rectagular mirror is a plus because you can see you whole face.  Other mirrors available are usually round, you almost always need to stand back a little in order to see your whole face, or your both eyes when your applying eye make up.  But with this one, you don&#x27;t need to do that.  Plus, the long arm allows you to apply makeup without straining your back.      The only down side is that you need to tighten the ring that holds the mirror frequently especially if you flip the mirror a lot.  But other than that, this thing is perfect!</li>
            <li> High quality, priced right product.</li>
            <li> It was a gift.  I&#x27;m sure it will serve the purpose well.</li>
            <li> wife likes it, easy to install, and seems like good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses it for the back of her hair and I&#x27;m not sure what all else...hey, I don&#x27;t care, she&#x27;s happy. lol.</li>
            <li> One of the rivets holding the &amp;#34;accordion&amp;#34; arm together fell out within minutes of mounting it to the wall, so I looked closer at the reviews and saw where this is a common problem. This mirror is utter junk and I am returning it to Amazon as defective. Looks like I will have to spend $100 more for a quality mirror...</li>
            <li> The good things about this are its overall design and useability, the size and quality of the mirrors including the choice of magnification on the magnifier side, and the quality and sturdiness and finish of the mounting bracket and articulated arm.    One thing that was just OK was the quality of the plastic frame around the glass including its little trunions or pegs by which the metal bracket holds it. These pegs look pretty small and I am afraid they will break. They have little acorn-nut-shaped covers pressed over them to keep the pegs from popping out of the metal bracket, but one of these covers was loose in the box when I received it. I glued it on with general purpose pipe cement, which seems to be holding, but I was surprised how small the pegs are and how weak the method of retaining the covers appeared. I also regret that it didn&#x27;t occur to me to shim the one cover outward a tiny bit before gluing it, because now it has no intentional clearance and might be susceptable to prying off by the bracket arm.    The other thing that was just OK was the method of attaching the U shaped metal bracket to the vertical rod at the mirror end of the arm. It is screwed on, and has a tiny setscrew to lock it. I have tried holding the vertical rod in pliers padded with paper while tightening the bracket onto the rod, and then tightening that setscrew with its tiny hex key until I thought I&#x27;d strip the key out of it, but it still works loose pretty quickly. Now I try to remember to pivot the mirror only in the tightening direction, turning it almost a full turn to adjust it the other way, and if I can find the Locktite I will try that.    I am pleased enough with this, and do not regret purchasing it, not having found anything preferable. I certainly think the price is fine. The problems I found aren&#x27;t the sort of thing for which one could request repair or replacement, because they are really design issues, and these two weaknesses are annoying.</li>
            <li> I had asked for a magnifying mirror like this for Christmas.  My husband ordered this one and I just wasn&#x27;t sure about the shape and how it would look on the wall.  It actually looks much better in person than the picture shows.  The magnification is great and no blurry.</li>
            <li> Im very lucky to find this item on amazon....usually it&#x27;s small and around,what make it even smaller,but this nice square mirror just perfect,very helpful, i can fix my hair behind ,i just love this double side mirror !</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror. I like to sit on a stool when I apply make-up and the arm on this mirror allows me to do so. It extends 30 inches and is able to adjust and pivot away from the wall at an angle. I would be sure to mount on stud - I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the size and shape of the mirror, however, the instructions for putting it together and installing it were quite confusing. Also there was some hardware missing (SCREWS) which were CRUCIAL. After a big search, my fiance&#x27; found some that would work. All in all, it is quite attractive and you can&#x27;t beat the quality or the price. I like it</li>
            <li> This two sided extendable mirror is just what we needed! Great for assisting with a close shave and clean up. Retracts and extends easily. Mount for mirror seems a bit flimsy but it works well. Have used for several months now without a problem. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  I don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.  Very solid. Mirrors are clear. And, the right price too.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and style! I like the swivel and the adjustment in the extendable arm, it lets you put the mirror right where you need it, I really like it and  think it will last a long time</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality mirror. I don&#x27;t know how or why I lived without one of these. Now I&#x27;ll never live without one again.</li>
            <li> Classy product.  Smooth.</li>
            <li> Good quality mirror and hardware.&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is perfect, anything more would be too much.</li>
            <li> We have been using one for years, and bought this one for a second bathroom.  We bought another as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Been using the mirror for about 3 months, at least 2X a day.  We bought it because it extended out the furthest of any of the mirrors we were looking at.  My husband used a couple of toggle bolts to install, since it seemed too heavy for the included screws, and we&#x27;ve had no problem with it.  It does what you would expect, pulls out so that you don&#x27;t have to lean over to see your face.  It looks stylish and doesn&#x27;t distrack from our decor.  Well constructed and heavy construction.  The top bushing on the slider doesn&#x27;t stay in, but it doesn&#x27;t effect the operation of the mirror.  I would recommend this mirror, even at though it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> From start to finish this was a pleasant experience. The item was exactly as described, and even more well made than I had envisioned. I was able to install it without any problems. There is a front mirror that reflects the image in actual size, and on the back side, there is a mirror that magnifies the image to 4.5 times actual size. Both mirrors a free of any distortion or imperfections. The expandable arm moves effortlessly and doesn&#x27;t shake when fully extended. This item is a high quality product that was purchased at a very reasonable price like so many other items I have bought using Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Its a well built and looks great. My wife loves it and i love the way it was so easy to install and the way it looks on the wall adds sone character. Was worried it would be cgeap and flimsy and an eyesore. To my relief its not and my wife loves it . Great deal. Very well constructed, solid.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone...love it, it stretches so much farther than any other mirror and the reverse magnifying mirror is great for close up</li>
            <li> Swivels and swings and stretches to any position you need. The only improvement I could see them making to the product is putting a clip or magnet on the edge so it would stay put when flush with the door. Mine has a tendency to swing out on it&#x27;s own and get in our way.</li>
            <li> Right away one of the rivets fell out, and when it is pushed against the wall it looks straight but as soon as it is pulled out the mirror is crooked, not worth the money!</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it to be.  So nice to be able to see the back of my hair and style it \\&quot;hands-free.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Nice mirror.  Works perfectly for me because I use it in conjunction with my bathroom cabinet mirror so I can cut the back of my hair.  The materials used for the construction of the mirror could be better, but it passes.  That is why I gave only 4 stars.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is just great.  The only problem I had was attaching the mirror to the wall extention.  I couldn&#x27;t get it as tight as I would have liked.  But the clarity of the mirror is great.</li>
            <li> This mirror works great. There are very few accordion mirrors, and most of  them are magnified on both sides.  In order to look at the mirror into another mirror (let&#x27;s say to see the back of your hair while styling it) you need a regular mirror.  This does have one side regular and one side magnified--it is perfect.</li>
            <li> This mirror seems to be a substantial, quality product.  It&#x27;s hard to shave with your reading glasses on so it&#x27;s good to have a mirror that can be pulled out close to my handsome face for a close, clean shave!  Amazon made it a little difficult to order but the product is all that I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  The 4x magnifier is just right for my vision. I can tilt it to catch either the natural light from the window or the artificial light from above depending upon the time of day I am using it.  It swings out to just the right length so that I can see the back of my hair from all angles and because it&#x27;s hands-free I can adjust whatever stray hair strands need adjusting without losing the focus.</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I was looking for...so much that I ended up getting two.  It is easy to mount to the wall and very sturdy. You can get it from one of the major home supply stores but it was more than $10 cheaper on Amazon and the home supply store charged more for shipping too.</li>
            <li> wow,     What a nice addition to our bathroom vanity &amp; medicine cabinets, the viewing capacity is great and the magnification on the other side of mirror is nice too, and the sissors allow the mirror to come out far enough to see the back of your head easily, we are going to buy some for our children too.  sincerely, sarg</li>
            <li> Great mirror for my teens bedroom, long extension, good quality, fair price. Like the square versus the standard circle mirror. Many mirrors out there that are less expensive but if you are going to mount it on the wall, best to get a good one. This is it.</li>
            <li> I needed a wall mirror that would extend about 20 inches from the wall, and this does that and more. It easily extends 23 inches from the wall without having to tug very hard. If you really pull it out to the max, it will extend 32 inches. That&#x27;s not recommended since it puts a lot of strain on the scissor links, but it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully retracted it extends 5.25 inches from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: all measurements listed are taken from the wall to the center post that holds the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the clarity of the mirror. One side is regular; the other magnifies 4.5 times. I&#x27;ve tried other magnifying mirrors, and this is the first one that provides a non-distorted view. (Granted, with my face a little distortion is not a bad thing....) Like that it&#x27;s square rather than round - easier for me to use when cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction is decent. It certainly would not withstand rough handling, but provided it&#x27;s securely anchored (I recommend screwing it into a wall stud if you plan on extending it more than 16 inches) it should survive normal use. I can&#x27;t say as of yet how well the chrome finish will hold up in a humid bathroom, but so far it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaints are few and minor. The mirror housing is plastic and is a dull white color. A chrome surround would have looked a lot better. Or, if it had to be plastic, perhaps a light gray. The white is not horrible, but it does detract from an otherwise nice design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retaining nut for the mirror support arm can loosen when the mirror is rotated. I put in a lock washer and that has worked great. It&#x27;s something the manufacturer should include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only a few minor caveats, this is highly recommended. 4.5 stars is the most accurate rating, but I&#x27;ll round up to 5.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these and as soon as I got it one of the rivets fell out. I was able to return it. I ordered another and it had a rivet out and had not even been taken out of the box. I contacted them and let them know. They immediately sent me another one. I opened the box and as I was taking it out of the box and packaging 3 rivets came out. I would not recommend this item. One time can be a mistake...But 3 in a row with something wrong tells me none of them are going to work right.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great 2-sided accordion mirror that swings out and away from the wall by about 2 feet.  The wall mount and accordion structure seems very sturdy, but the rivets (as I call them) that hold the accordion together are a vulnerable point of failure.  Along the center pivot point line, I had a rivet come loose and fall out, which rendered the entire thing unusable.  Imagine taking the screw out of a pair of scissors.  I used a drop of Loctite on it, so it&#x27;s not going anywhere now.  Other than that minor thing, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> 5x is not enough.  Gotta have 8 to 10x.  And I am in my 40&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t wear glasses yet, so maybe that means I&#x27;ll need 10x+ in the later years.</li>
            <li> There were problems mounting the mirror because of some cheap construction.  Flimsy short soft plastic bolts &amp; nuts holding the mirror frame to the swivel frame required that I reinforce with superglue without interfering with the swing of the mirror.  That worked out OK.  The mirror itself was wobbly because I wasn&#x27;t able to secure the swivel frame tightly to the extension.  In trying I dropped the mirror smashing the 5x magnification side.  I padded &amp; secured the other mirror.  There was still an annoying wobble but the mirror all in all worked well facing &amp; extending fairly close to my large well-lighted master bath mirror.  I was able to give myself a haircut.  I considered ordering a replacement but the price has gone up about 50% since June.  If I were able to secure an inexpensive replacement for the broken mirror I&#x27;d probably rate this at 4 stars.  Anyway with the setup I have magnification doesn&#x27;t seem to be a necessity.</li>
            <li> I am SO HAPPY with this mirror.  I needed something to be able to see the back of my hair so that I could use both hands to style it.  This is the PERFECT mirror!  All the other mirrors with extendable arms just didn&#x27;t come that far from the wall.  This one does the trick!  And, the magnification on the reverse side is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is a nice, large size (much nicer than the small round ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to see what the back of your head looks like, this is definitely the mirror for you.</li>
            <li> Got this for our rv. Works like a charm. Have not had any issues. Thought we would need to remove the mirror going down the road but handles the bumps fine</li>
            <li> We really like the mirror.  It gives you the extra help you need shaving.  I would recommend this mirror to anyone wanting the extra magnification.  The product holds up great.  Just have to be gentle with pulling it out from the wall.  We have had it a couple months and are glad we ordered it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, great price I needed to replace my old one that was gold and chipping.  This looks much better</li>
            <li> This mirror is great! The rectrangular mirror is good and big, you can see the whole back of your head. The magnifying side is great for doing eyes and putting in contacts. The accordion is nice and strong.</li>
            <li> This mirror is actually sturdy and is very functional. It is well made and for the price is a true bargain. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror...I just got my hair cut short, and this mirror has made it possible for me to maintain my the back of my haircut myself...I don&#x27;t know how I made it without this thing :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful mirror! It&#x27;s very versatile and is perfect for using in conjunction with another mirror to do my hair. The close-up side is good for putting on certain make-ups as well. It has held up very well over the past several months I&#x27;ve had it and it is good quality because I use it all the time. Mirror still works great and I&#x27;m sure it will continue to.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it said. it works good, it is heavy duty and is a pleasure to use. I cut my own hair and this makes it possible to see all angles. It extends quite long, it swivels and has a regular and magnifier side. I love it. Be sure you use the screw inserts to make it solid in the wall and drill into the stud if possible.</li>
            <li> After ordering this product for $71.00 I noted same mirror available from Home  Depot for $24.00.  Upon accepted return of mirror to Amazon source for a $13.00  UPS fee I was charged a 20% return fee along with the sending shipping cost.  Total credit for returned item $51.00. Cost lose to me was about $33.00.  Never  again.  Understand shipping, but never saw restocking cost noted anywere and what a markup for this item.    Monty Sontag</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  It is a good quality mirror and it was easy to install.  Delivery and packaging was satisfactory and I found the rectangle mirror was better then a traditional round mirror.</li>
            <li> I had a mirror almost like this one,I broke it so I started looking for another one.I like this one even better because it extends out further and that&#x27;s good.I can see the back of my hair lots better now.I will share this with my daughters and friends.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks Amazon..&lt;br /&gt; Linda Norton</li>
            <li> Super fast ship  Awesome product</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this mirror extends nicely would be great if it were a little more rigid , but it serves the purpose well and the magnified side is great for looking up close.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror for my wife and she is perfectly satisfied with its characteristics. Would have given it five stars except for the mounting hardware that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two screws and two plastic anchors. Since the required location didn&#x27;t line up with a stud, I had to mount the mirror on drywall. Drilled two holes, poked in the plastic anchors, and when I started turning the screws, the anchors also turned in the drywall. Tried a couple of screw-in anchors I had on hand and they didn&#x27;t work either. Finally went to the hardware store and picked up a couple of toggle bolts which did the trick.</li>
            <li> Had one just like it for many years. So glad I found an exact replacement!</li>
            <li> Its a bargain for the price and no rust problems.  I mounted it so it is available in the bathroom and extends into the shower with the door partially open.  It has exceeded my expectations and have bought more of the brand.  I have encountered no fogging issues, as I would have expected.  It simply works</li>
            <li> i love this. mounted it on the side wall and can now see the back of my head/body. very cool. not the sturdiest of mirrors but great for the price.</li>
            <li> good price, great product but would like if there was availability of replacement parts as our mirror fell and broke! Otherwise we liked it ALOT!</li>
            <li> I loved everything about it until the plastic tip to adjust the mirror broke, we superglued it, it broke again, one more break and it is being returned</li>
            <li> Cheap price for a cheap item.  I won&#x27;t be hanging this in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Works Great,  wife happy now.</li>
            <li> Good price as listed.</li>
            <li> I like the size if the mirror, allows for a bigger view.  Installation was easy.  Extension of the mirror is great as it allows me to position it over the sink. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and the price was great.</li>
            <li> looks very cheap.I did not like</li>
            <li> This mirror worked great for over a year. Then one day it just fell apart and broke and is unable to be fixed. While it worked I would give it 5 stars, but the fact that it fell apart for no apparent reason was disappointing.</li>
            <li> The expansion is very stiff, but otherwise the mirror is a great size and perfect for seeing the back of your hair for styling or cutting.</li>
            <li> My mom likes stuff like this but it&#x27;s not great quality.  YOu can tell it will rust after a couple of years in the bathroom and be careful you don&#x27;t routinely turn it counter clockwise or it will fall off.  It has a little set screw but it doesn&#x27;t really keep it from unscrewing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected, just a little flimsy, which may diminish it&#x27;s life span.</li>
            <li> Great quality mirror and expandable arm but they didn&#x27;t do a good job designing the mirror mount to the arm. The mirror very easily can be twisted off and dropped. It&#x27;s a design flaw that should be easy for them to fix.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy and the mirror is quite a bit larger than most in this category.  Very good purchase!</li>
            <li> Really nice mirror. Very useful for makeup and shaving. Very durable extension</li>
            <li> This is my third mirror. I bought one for my old small apartment and it worked great. Now I have moved into a larger home with 3 bathrooms and I have one in each of them. I like the wide frame more viewing space then the normal round mirrors. It&#x27;s a keeper</li>
            <li> This mirror is just what I was looking for.  I can lay down in bed and do crosswords puzzles WHILE still watching tv behind me!</li>
            <li> disappointed, didn&#x27;t realize something that was meant to go on a wall didn&#x27;t even come with the proper tools to hang it with.</li>
            <li> exellent  one idea to consider bigger mounting bracket so mirrior can slide up and down for hight ajustment  put the quality is very good</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this purposely for its compact, retractible design. It works pretty well, my only complaint is that the small screw that attaches the mirror to seems a little flimsy so you&#x27;ll need to take a little care when extending and retracting the mirror. It extends real far and helps me trim the back of my neck with my new clippers just perfectly, so the mirror does its job as needed.</li>
            <li> This mirror was a great help when I used to cut my own hair with a Flowbee.   I&#x27;ve used it for several years and I found it to well constructed - especially for the low price of $20.  If you want an accordion reversable 1X/4X wall mount mirror, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one from Jerdon.</li>
            <li> Teriffic item!  Makes it so easy to see  the back of my head -- no more \\&quot;holes\\&quot; in the hairdo.</li>
            <li> This mirror is all I was looking for (I did however stick on a 10x round in a corner--plenty of room). The screw that holds the mirror onto the stem has come loose a few times, but I think I&#x27;ve fixed that now.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> Nice quality all around!  I cut my hair so this makes cutting the back of my head a breeze!</li>
            <li> The 30&amp;#34; extension is the best.  Just wish it came with a round mirror.</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy to install and good quality plus great price. I def recommend it to anyone thinking about buying it. Thx :)</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for coloring, styling or checking out both side and rear views of your hair-do... or applying makeup, plucking brows etc., etc.</li>
            <li> This is excellent to have in your bathroom when fixing your hair, when you pull it out from the wall you are able to use both hands to touch up and style your hair or putting on your make up.</li>
            <li> Mirror looks nice the only issue i had with this was when i was adjusting the mirror a bolt came out. I had to repair it. Other than that mirror works good to give yourself a self haircut. thats what I use it for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughters, sixteen and seventeen, bathroom and they love it. I love it too, the use it every day</li>
            <li> I really like the way this mirror extends to a good length from the wall, much further than some I have tried. I&#x27;ve used mine for 3 months and today the mirror just fell off the post it sits on and broke all over the floor. I think extending the arm in and out loosens the mirror so beware of this and check your mirror to make sure it is staying tight!</li>
            <li> I just received mine today and mounted it on the wall in the bathroom.  It appears to be a decent mirror.  The bracket mechanism works well.  One thing to note about this mirror that is not clear from the picture is that the mirror frame (the part holding the mirror) is actually white plastic, not chrome-plated metal.  The entire bracket is chrome-plated metal, but the mirror frame itself is white plastic.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful.  It really assist me to style my hair and be able to view from all angels.</li>
            <li> This the only one I have found that extends out over 18 inches.  It is large enough to use.  The magnifier doesn&#x27;t distort.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for the price, I made the mistake of buying 2 cheaper ones and they came with no mounting screws. This mirror is great quality and comes wtih mounting screws and covers for the screws.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. My first one broke after 20 years, so I was very glad to find the product and reorder it. Don&#x27;t want something sitting on the counter, and this folds back on the wall, so it&#x27;s perfect. Has a regular side and a magnifying side and can be tilted at any angle. A great product.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package I noticed that some of the chrome came off of the wall mount revealing the copper metal underneath.  Also the white caps that hold the mirror fall off because they are not tight enough. Pretty crappy quality control; for the price. Returned to Amazon for a replacement, which was fine....so I&#x27;m giving it two starts instead of one</li>
            <li> For the $28 delivered, it&#x27;s quite a versatile device. The two magnifications, none (1x) and  five times make this mirror very handy. My wife likes it, for she can see her scalp from the rear using the 1x magnification . I like it for close shaving and nose hair trimming using the 5x magnification. The arm&#x27;s 30-inch extension capability is rather helpful when the distance to the wall on the side of the sink is longer than average. The installation is straight-forward: Driving the mounting screws into a stud is highly recommended. The attached figure shows an a  close-up view for assembling the mirror to the adjustable extension arm. The mirror and its nut appear on the left. Assemble the rod and its components as shown. Make sure you don&#x27;t loose the little plastic collar. Use the knurled nut to tighten the assembly.  Of some concern is the chrome-plating. It seems quite thin. Let&#x27;s see how long it takes until rust appears; bathrooms are after all rather humid.</li>
            <li> It is a nice mirror, but not what I thought I was going to get, It&#x27;s a bit flimsy... I&#x27;m sure it would work for a different application.I should have done more research.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and clear mirror. No bubbles or blurriness amd pretty dang sturdy too</li>
            <li> My wife thinks this mirror is wonderful for combing the back of her hair and also for applying make-up. I would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> One rivet in the expanding arm was missing and the set screw was no where to be found.  Yes, I did carefully search all the packing material.  Because of the way I am, I fixed the rivet from my parts collection and I found a set screw that worked.  Otherwise I love it.  Good size and the magnifying mirror is just right.  JJM</li>
            <li> I love the large size of the mirror and the long extension arm. It makes styling and cutting my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> Love this! My husband put it on the wall in the bathroom and it works great. I don&#x27;t have to put on readers to track my progress when I put on makeup. It is great.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Feels nice and solid and you can move it up, down, left, right and pull it out from the wall farther then any other mirror I found for the money!  Easy to install on wall.  It took a little more effort to screw the mirror onto the rod, as mine did not seem to screw down as far as it should, but it still works great.</li>
            <li> I love it because I can view the back of my head while using both hands to put up my long hair.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this product.  Wife had been looking for one that extended at least 20 inches from wall. This one does and I very wide. Perfect</li>
            <li> This is a well made mirror.  It is easy to position.  One nice feature is it mounts with a narrow bracket that fits the small space next to my mirror (photo).  The mirror does tend to move about on it&#x27;s axes a bit.  There is a small set screw to tighten the side-to-side movement, but no adjustment for pivoting on the horizontal axis.  I use this for wet shaving, and move it out of the way between passes, and the mirror always needed readjustment.  Finally, I thought to wrap a piece of dental floss tightly a few times under one of the white plastic acorn nuts, and now it works fine.  (photo).  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it. It was frustrating trying to see the back and sides of my head, while holding up a mirror. My &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; eyes couldn&#x27;t see well enough . This mirror allows me to see the back and sides of my head  - hands free. Arm expands and mirror tilts, which are a big help, since I am 5&#x27; tall. The magnifying side is powerful enough that I can see without my glasses.</li>
            <li> Was made better than I excepted and works perfect. I did have to send the first one back because it arrived in 1,000 pieces! They put it in a box without any bubble wrap around it, dumb.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package a small plastic bushing fell out. This is the piece that goes between the metal rod and the metal bracket allowing the two to slide smoothly against each other. I tried to reattach it but it was too loose to stay in place. Immediately placed back in box and sent back for refund.</li>
            <li> Great but I hung it incorrectly the first time.  Read the directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly disappointed in this mirror. The package did arrive on-time, and all of the parts were included, but once it was installed, I extended the mirror and noticed that even though the mirror was installed on the wall straight, the accordian style arm is torqued &amp; the further you extend it from the wall, the more the extension torques. In other words, regardless of how far you have the mirror extended, the entire length of the top of the arm stays parallel to the wall bracket (as it should) but the bottom portion of the arm &amp;#34;leans&amp;#34; to the right causing the entire mirror to hang crooked.</li>
            <li> Came to me broken. Worthless to me I sent it back immediately only to have to pay the return shipping.</li>
            <li> Sturdy accordion frame, that smooth travels easily, but not to height flexible, about 4&amp;#34; when extended. Smooth reflection good sized  dual mirror does not lose position angle. Use drywall screws into a stud because of sturdy accordion and a steak knife blade for mirror stem set screw slot less than a slotted screwdriver. KUDOS from the wife on this one.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to be able to see back of hair while fixing it.</li>
            <li> The mirror worked out fine. The white plastic framing others complained about doesn&#x27;t bother me. Everything needed was in the packaging, which arrived early. I had it screwed into a stud &amp; it seems pretty secure.  I bought the 30&amp;#34; extension to get as much length as I could get thinking it could never extend that long &amp; I was right. It pulls out to about 23-24&amp;#34;.  Thus the 4 stars.  Don&#x27;t advertise 30&amp;#34; when there is no way for 30&amp;#34;.  But it works as expected, looks decent for the money &amp; lays nice &amp; flat up against the wall. AND it saves me having to constantly lean over the sink to get closer to the mirror. The 5 magnification works out ok but would have preferred that the 30&amp;#34; come w/an option for a higher magnification. It seems like the mirror loosens, but I just twist it around a few times every so often and it feels like it tightens up. Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased &amp; think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Just love it.  Thank you for your product</li>
            <li> Easily installs, and full extension. One mirror side is magnifier. You&#x27;ll see more flaws using the magnifier than you can imagine. (Easy flip over for access to both mirrors. I mounted it face height for me.</li>
            <li> For $25 it&#x27;s kind of flimsy. We bought one for $7 at ikea and it&#x27;s more durable!</li>
            <li> Mirror quality is great, hardware not so much.  A set screw was not threaded, had to drill and tap in a new one, keeps the mirror from coming off.  The rest was great.  The gate works great and the wall bracket is very stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra work was worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks , sturdy, so far very durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to look at my rear view&lt;br /&gt;I bought a cheaper one before, not remember the brand, very flimsy and unstable&lt;br /&gt;This looks nice, sturdy and has big size mirror to look at&lt;br /&gt;As I say, I like the quality of the product and the way it looks.&lt;br /&gt;The product is above my expectation.</li>
            <li> Was what I expected.  Like others who have responded, I wish the white plastic around the mirror was a little nicer.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work. 1. Looks cheap 2. Unless it is extended all the way out the mirror is crooked, so by the time you fold it all the way back to wall ( when not using) it is super crooked. Looks like you have a really cheap crooked mirror on your wall. 3. This item regular price at Menards is $10 cheaper. I have been finding that a lot, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought a moen shower head at menards for 49.00 same item on amazon is over $200????? Check it out. Moen halo.</li>
            <li> This mirror does just what I need.  I have a tight space and this mirror fits and lets me see the back of my hair when I want to.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again for gifts I was very pleased with the quality;</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this.</li>
            <li> love it love it love it.  Mounted it on the side wall by my big bathroom mirror.  Now I can curl my hair on the back of my head and see what I&#x27;m doing without stopping.  This mirror is big, most I looked at were kinda small.  Before I would curl, stop, grab the hand mirror, look, curl, get the mirror again.  Took forever.  Not anymore, this mirror is big so you see everything.  Why didn&#x27;t I get this sooner???</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my wife, she loves it.  Well made and stays in position when extended.  It should be mounted on wood or over a wooden stub under the drywall.  I doubt the hollow wall fasteners will stand up to constant use in the fully extended postion.</li>
            <li> Was not as described.  This was NOT a 1x and 5x.  Best it could have been as a 1x and 2x.</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Received this mirror on time and it was in good condition. Nothing missing or falling apart.  Glad to see they included a small tightening screw where the mirror attaches to the post to ensure it doesn&#x27;t loosen and fall off after a few uses.  The extension arm seems to be sturdy and maintains a fairly even level when extended at full length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to attach it directly to the wall, either find a stud or purchase sturdier screw anchors. While I didn&#x27;t use the ones provided, my experience with screw anchors indicates these most likely won&#x27;t hold the weight with the mirror extended for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, it would have been nice if the mirror had a different frame instead of the cheap plastic white one that is provided.  But then it would probably cost more and the price was one of the selling points for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached to a wooden door frame behind the bathroom door and there was plenty of room for door to close. I am now able to cut and color my hair while viewing from all sides at the same time.  The magnification works well too for the times when my daughter or daughter-in-love are visiting and my main makeup mirror is in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent buy and recommend this Price is Right product.</li>
            <li> there is nothing wrong with the mirrors but I didn&#x27;t realize that I did need stronger for my vision. But that is not the mirror&#x27;s fault!</li>
            <li> The Hind Sight Wall Mount MIrror works great. It is easy to see the back of your hair. It is very sturdy</li>
            <li> IT WAS MISSING A CAP FOR ONE SIDE OF MIRROR, WAS TO HARD TO PULL OUT IF IT WAS HANGING ON A WALL OF SHEETROCK.  WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this mirror, because it stretches up to 30 in length which is very convenient for me. The chrome is very shiny, and the mirror serves its purpose well. I wish it had a more expensive look though...</li>
            <li> Love my makeup mirror.  Package arrived early.  I bought 2 at different times.  would buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Love this! It is Awesome!</li>
            <li> Good mirror, bad craftsmanship. One of the pins in the arm has already fallen out. The mirror is wobbly and not very secure. Expected more for the money, how hard is it to make anything good these days?</li>
            <li> This was easy to install, and it reaches a pretty good distance.  When I ordered this the description said it was 4x but now it says 5x.  I&#x27;m not sure if the 4x has been replaced by the 5x or if the 4x was a typo?  I have a 5x round mirror that is definitely more magnification than this one.  However this one gives good magnification for putting in contacts or make up or whatever more detailed operation you may need it for.  It swings out of the way nice and compactly.  The only complaint I have is that the mirror &#x27;unscrews&#x27; and then wobbles if you have two people using it at different angles side to side so it gets turned.  It will work its way loose, but never works its way tight!  Spinning the mirror will tighten it back up again.  It is a minor annoyance, but an annoyance, nonetheless.</li>
            <li> The mirror was easy to mount and the frame is tight and well made for a very reasonable price.  Just make sure to tighten the set screw on the mirror mount threads.  I also used a blue thread locker (locktite). The shaft has to turn with the mirror and is pretty tight when new.</li>
            <li> Je suis tr&amp;egrave;s satisfaite de ce miroir. Il est tr&amp;egrave;s  pratique et prend peu de place lorsque on le replie&lt;br /&gt; sa place. merci.</li>
            <li> hard time seeing when have to remove my glasses, this works great. Anjd helps me see how my hair looks in back.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little pricey, so I knocked a star off, but works as it should. You can extend the mirror and it will stay in place.</li>
            <li> very nice unit. it works well. does exactlywhat it was supposed to do.  would definitely recommend it to anyone else</li>
            <li> This was just what I wanted, this was for my husband, I already had two for me.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a great example of half a work...They make an accordion arm that is polish and looks amazing and then stick a plastic mirror on it.  Must be union workers.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this.  Use to dye hair roots and allows vision of the back of head - great product.</li>
            <li> When I opened the inner box, two plastic &amp;#34;grommets&amp;#34; fell out (almost went down the bathroom sink drain). Then, when I opened the plastic bags, a very small chrome &amp;#34;nut&amp;#34; fell out. This was from the extension piece of the arm. I have pushed this back in again but it is not obvious to me (yet) whether it will stay there or not. The item may have to be returned for another one. I will see whether it lasts.I have had one of these same items before and did not have any problems.</li>
            <li> This is second two sided mirror I bought.... Love it because its always handy and folds and doesn&#x27;t take a lot&lt;br /&gt;of room... Having dual mirror with magnification is a plus..  and very easy to install.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I can see the back of my head to color it.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1st one for myself [and my wife, who never uses it].&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I bought this one for my mom, who had one similar, but lost it in a fire, back in &#x27;02.&lt;br /&gt;She hasn&#x27;t said much about it since, but she was tickled to get it, at the time.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to most of the prices I&#x27;ve seen, this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed.  Wall mount swivels vertically which lets mirror lie flat against wall.  Mirror swivels too of course.  Heavy enough that it must be installed into  structural wood or good strong &amp;#34;molly&#x27;s&amp;#34;...or whatever those things are called!  Mirror is labeled 5x magnification?  Haven&#x27;t hung it yet but very pleased.</li>
            <li> I already had one of these mirrors (which was a gift) in one bathroom but wanted another for my summer home. I looked for this exact mirror in stores but could not find it so I looked on Amazon and found it immediately. Although it&#x27;s a little pricey it is perfect. The large square mirror that swivels to a magnifying mirror on the other side is big enough for any purpose.  I use mine to see the back of my head since I cut my own hair. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I needed. My dad asked me for one after he saw mine. He likes his too.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my dad because he was getting cramps in his back when shaving, and the small circular accordion mirror didn&#x27;t give him enough space to see himself!  He loves the size of the mirror.  Assembly to the wall was easy and it&#x27;s very sturdy.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> So far this mirror is very cleverly made and has few faults,I would buy again.</li>
            <li> See your fabulous face as NEVER before.great shaving helper.</li>
            <li> use 5x side when shaving. can bring close for shaving then can be pushed back to the wall and out of the way.</li>
            <li> I liked this one so well I bought another one for my other bathroom. The &amp;#34;Mag&amp;#34; side is powerful yet not overly distorted. And of course the other side is standard reflection. It mounts with some very sturdy frame work and works about as well as you could expect.</li>
            <li> My husband opened this and pulled the mirror to extend and it pulled apart before putting it up. I didnt want to attempt a return so he fixed it and hung it. Its working and holding up but it does not stay in place no matter how level you hand it. It seems like it just turns too easily could use maybe a rubber grommet or something to keep it somewhat tight so that it stays steady and still. Great mirror though, nice and clear.</li>
            <li> Needed a mirror that was compact and yet had swivel and extension capabilities.  This fit the bill.  Very happy with quality as well.</li>
            <li> It came with no instructions, but logic worked well enough.  I&#x27;m an old lady and I had to get a little advice on how to do the plastic part of the screw, but the rest of the mounting and putting together I did by myself.</li>
            <li> my wife is very pleased</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror, especially the magnifying side.  It was just what I was looking for so I could shave without wearing my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, however, I waited too long to install it, past the point when I could return it.  When I opened the package, one of the little metal grommets that go at the interstices of the accordion-type metal pieces was loose in the package.  The whole thing seemed to work without it, though, so I installed it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the corresponding grommet on the other side of that hole fell out a while later.  Now if I pull the mirror out from the wall as far as I would like, the whole thing droops at the point with the missing grommet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry, but I definitely cannot recommend this product.  If it hadn&#x27;t had the quality-control issue, I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> Awesome in all ways. Easy to put up.</li>
            <li> The Fatal Flaw of this product is those cheap weak plastic nipples on the left and right side of the mirror which are meant to anchor it in the bracket. They slip off and the mirror falls. I called Jerdon who seems to dominate thus type of mirror business, They were nice, suggested my mirror might be defective and encouraged me to return it for a replacement. I returned it and bought a different mirror with metal screw anchors, because I had purchased had two of this deficient version and both had the same problem. They should discontinue this model or get their manufacturer to switch to metal anchors.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror - looks great on my wall and extends far enough to get really close and make sure i have applied my makeup perfectly before I dash out of the house! I was apprehensive about ordering a mirror online in case it arrived broken along with 7 years bad luck but this arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> This product takes about 5 minutes to install, and is worth every penny.  If you have too far to lean to see what you&#x27;re doing while shaving in the bathroom, this product is perfect.  It telescopes out to you, and the magnification side makes it simple and easy to clearly see all those small hairs you might normally miss on your face--especially if you use an electric razor like I do.  When you&#x27;re done, it folds up nicely against the wall, completely out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second mirror of this type...I moved and forget to get the old one off the wall!  After a few months of poor shaving, I went to Amazon and solved the problem.</li>
            <li> just what grandma wanted.</li>
            <li> Easily mounted and works well, as described</li>
            <li> The mirror is great - expands out and allows me to put on makeup w/out leaning over the sink!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, it makes applying my makeup at the bathroom vanity much easier. No more leaning over to get close to the wall mirror or holding a hand mirror. Saves time and my back! My only problem with it is that I have to tighten the mirror occasionally.</li>
            <li> It helps me to do my hair especially the back.  I vacation alot and not everyplace has a good mirror  so this one travels with me.</li>
            <li> Fell apart a few days after mounting. Cheap mount and heavy mirror do not make for a quality product. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> really pleased with the quality of this product, quick shipping &amp; great customer service.  Really nice for doing french braids on long hair</li>
            <li> I got this to mount beside the medicine cabinet so I can have a mirror behind my head to simplify trimming the hair on my neck. This mirror is perfectly sized and mounted in moments. The scissor is a bit tight and takes some patience to push closed if you open it to the full length, but I&#x27;d prefer that over the opposite (too loose). The flat side is great and the concave (zoom) side is very clear and doesn&#x27;t give me any eye strain.</li>
            <li> I loved this mirror - past tense because after twelve years it&#x27;s time to replace it. That&#x27;s right, it lasted me twelve years and the only wish would be a stronger magnification available.  I really depended on it and thank goodness now I can get a new one. It was sturdy, not at all ugly, and I loved the range of motion.  This time I&#x27;m getting one for both bathrooms.</li>
            <li> This mirror does exactly what I need. I am able to see and straighten the hair on the back of my head with ease now. The magnified side makes it easy to apply makeup. Thanks, love it.</li>
            <li> holy crap did these go up in price, ah nehow glad i got it when i got it.  It works very well for shaving, the mirrors i have in my bathroom are a tad to low, im guessing the people that lived here before were very short cause when i stand straight they only show up to my neck xD  Well with this mounted mirror i can actually shave without straining my neck.  Its fairly large and the extension comes out far enough so i dont have to bend over and stress myself out. Its pretty solid on the wall and was very easy to install, recommend a cordless powerdrill and drill some pre holes cause the screws are a little longer then normal things guessing cause of the weight it has to support when its full extended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well, well enough that i wanted to waste my lunch time at work writing this review cause i think it deserves it. Will buy another one when the price comes back to reality. Ah dont wanna go on to far and feel like a paid shill like the majority of the these other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  For makeup application or shaving, this is a really good, hands free mirror.  Let&#x27;s face it, at a particular age, we just can&#x27;t see all those little imperfections in our  makeup or that stray facial hair!  This will remedy that situation.</li>
            <li> Good design and idea. A small problem is that mirror wangling from side to side</li>
            <li> OK - I&#x27;ve demoted my review to 2 stars.  After a couple of months, the little knobs that hold the mirror onto the bracket kept coming off, and so did the mirror!  No matter how many times I re-attached them, it stayed loose.  And since it was so loose, the mirror was never in the right spot - I ended up doing all kinds of contortions to try to see what was going on behind me.  Finally gave up in frustration and pulled it off the wall.  This is a waste of money.  Cheaply made, poor quality.</li>
            <li> Hard  to pull forward and it was upside down.  When pulling it forward  went up instead of down.&lt;br /&gt;I took it off and turned around and now works better but plastic on peg not right.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, I mounted it on the wall and so have two hands free when I do my hair. I can even see the back while I am styling it.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  The only one I could find in this rectangular size.  It has a nice magnifying mirror on one side and the other is a regular mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 27, 2014:  After having this mirror for a while, one annoying consideration is the plastic caps that keep the mirror on the frame pop off.  Shooting across the bathroom, hard to find.  I&#x27;m considering hot gluing them on!  Still love the mirror though.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these mirrors.  She loved the first one we bought, so we bough another.  Chrome finish is excellent and the extension of this mirror is very long.  All hardware is included, and very easy to install.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because I was tired of leaning across the sink to get closer to the big mirror while I shave.  This was one of the smarted purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mounted to the side wall, I can easily stretch this mirror to where I usually stand and I have the option of using the regular or magnified mirror.  When done, it quickly pushes back to the home position up against the wall and I don&#x27;t feel like my back is sore from leaning forward for the last several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To install, I found the stud in the wall (it does come with small anchors if you can&#x27;t mount to the stud), screwed in the two screws at the base, mounted the mirror to the other end and tightened everything up and I was ready to go in under 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this to anyone needing an affordable wall-mounted shave or makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> Love this. Arm extends a nice distance</li>
            <li> A birthday gift for my mother in law, she loves it!</li>
            <li> This item was for my duaghter so she can do her hair. It is great for when you need to see the back of your hair while straightening or curling yor hair. It&#x27;s a must in our bathrooms.</li>
            <li> The quality is very good. Solid, &amp;#34;heavy weight&amp;#34;, smooth operation. Be sure that the knurled knob is all the way down before final tightening and &amp;#34;locking&amp;#34;(by set screw) of the mirror to the rod.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted.  great quality. a little stiff extension arm but can be lubricated.</li>
            <li> It extends far enough and is large enough to see things.</li>
            <li> This mirrior is great to have hanging next to my bathroom mirror.  Along with it being able to contour out of the way it is always handy at a reach to help with my make-up</li>
            <li> Not too happy with this.  The mirror doesn&#x27;t stay stable so it flips around while you are trying to see the back of your head. Wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown the box out- I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! use it in my bathroom for make up-- mounts to the wall and has the accordion arm to move it closer for make up application and farther for storage. cleans up easily and isn&#x27;t in the way</li>
            <li> Wish it would also move down</li>
            <li> This is a good mirror, and I am using.  Unfortunately, when I took it out of the box, one of the riveted pivot &amp;#34;screws&amp;#34; was broken, so I used a small nut and bolt to substitute.  While I was working on it, another pivot &amp;#34;screw&amp;#34; broke as well.  That was a bummer, but I fixed it as well, and once I mounted the mirror, it&#x27;s been working fine.  The arm sticking down from the mirror itself sometimes binds a bit and the clear &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; &amp;#34;washer guides&amp;#34; (sorry for all the quotes, but I don&#x27;t know their real names!) sometimes don&#x27;t stay where they should.  Don&#x27;t let the negatives concern you other than to be ready to do some &amp;#34;tweaking&amp;#34; with this product when you get it.  I like it!</li>
            <li> I had to wait several days to get it installed but that&#x27;s o.k  This won&#x27;t get knocked down and broken!</li>
            <li> Very Pleased. Thanks for making this available. I will recommend this to others and tell them where I found it.</li>
            <li> Bought this because Jerdon is a respected name in mirrors, was not disappointed . Like the magnifying  option and the swivel angles are endless</li>
            <li> This item arrived exactly as described and performs perfectly!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to install and built very well. Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> It was kind of stiff at first, but after some use it has loosened up a little so it&#x27;s not so hard to pull out.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair (what little is left of it) and this mirror in conjunction with a regular wall mirror allows me to do that again. I used one of these for years and lost it in a move a year or so ago. Now I can see the back of my head again.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this.  I wanted a rectangular accordion mirror and this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy installation. I did NOT use the included anchors.  I used some that were a little heavier duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Mirror has a plastic frame surrounding it.  This takes away from the look, however, if you are looking for rectangular shape there are not many price conscious options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Daily use now for a couple of months and the metal accordion piece is still going strong with no problems to date.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the wall mirrow.  When it was extended it came apart at the end. A change need to be made so that doesn&#x27;t happen.  I actually when out and purchase a different wall mirrow and installed it.</li>
            <li> My wife having long hair that she puts up herself asked for an extra wall mount mirror so that she could see her hair on all sides.  The extension mirror was perfect for the job.  As we travel quite a bit I dismounted another of these mirrors from the extinsion arm and mounted it on a music stand shaft and tripod.  Setting this up behind her in motel bathrooms she is always able to handle her every styling need.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that my parents purchased over 20 years ago. We purchased for my aunt as a Christmas gift who has has a stroke and has limited use of one hand. Great for viewing the back of your head.  It is definately something I would recommend and plan on getting one for myself when I get my own place.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Mirror rotates 360 degrees and you get rotation on both sides of the accordion.  This means just about every angle is available, which is important for someone like me who cuts his hair and needs the ability to see the back of my head.  Installation took around 20 minutes from the time I got the package to the time it was done.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great and just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Great item for people who can&#x27;t see far away in the mirror, like me.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair. The mirror allows me to see the back and sides very easily adjusts up and down and tilts couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better</li>
            <li> Had one of these mirrors for approximately 20 years so know it is a very good product.  Use it every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little wobbly and I feel like I have to be really careful with it or it will fall off the wall.</li>
            <li> I had one of these just like it from Ikea and it got broken in our move down south. I&#x27;ve looked and looked for one and I&#x27;m so happy I found this one! More $ than IKEA, but they would not shop.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT!  I CAN NOW CHECK THE BACK OF MY HAIR ANYTIME.  IT MOVES WHERE IT&#x27;S NEEDED WITH VERY LITTLE TROUBLE.  THIS WAS NEEDED WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.  ;-)</li>
            <li> These are great for seeing the back of your head and being able to trim your hair.  I have had one for years and years&lt;br /&gt;so they are a good investment.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> much lighter that expected but will do the job.</li>
            <li> easy to install, good construction, exactly as described in ad.&lt;br /&gt;shipping was very prompt. price was very reasonable. would get another for future bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Easy to put on wall!</li>
            <li> Needed this for a very specific place and it fit perfectly, was easy enough to install, and is working great.</li>
            <li> One of this mirror&#x27;s first reviewers, if not \\&quot;the\\&quot; first, said \\&quot;Partly very nice, partly just OK.\\&quot; That&#x27;s a perfect description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, there aren&#x27;t a lot of choices for this style of mirror. If it cost less, I&#x27;d easily give it three or four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror&#x27;s frame is very cheap looking: ugly white plastic. It also doesn&#x27;t stay in position without moving. Likewise, there&#x27;s a screw for tightening the mirror onto its threaded post. The screw doesn&#x27;t do its job. By the way, you&#x27;ll need a jeweler&#x27;s screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissor style extension mechanism is better in the aesthetics department, but it&#x27;s stiff and unpleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Mirror works great and looks as advertised,  only complaint was that the screws to install were missing from the box. Overall very pleased and the price was right!</li>
            <li> I use my mirror daily.  It is light, flexible, and folds flat to the wall.  This second purchase is to give our guests the same convenience as I have when getting ready for the day.  My only wish is that the white frame could also be available in chrome.</li>
            <li> I have had to spend additional money twice to keep fixing this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> For the money, this actually turned out to be quite a nice little mirror. There is one aspect that I don&#x27;t care for, like the little plastic thumb screws on the sides, but that&#x27;s about it. It went up onto the wall just fine and the scissor extension is great... it actually comes out and away from the wall quite a bit. The mirror adjusts quite nicely too, and originally when I tilted it up towards my face it would tilt back down a little, but I easily adjusted that by bending the side arms in slightly. Now the mirror is more snug and when I tilt it up it stays there perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I purchased this mirror is because it is rectangular in size. I had originally purchased a round mirror at Lowes, but it broke, so I wanted something larger for shaving. The fact that it is rectangular actually makes it seem quite a bit larger, and I have no difficulties seeing my face now. Maybe my face was too fat for the other mirror, I&#x27;m not sure : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s now 3 months shy of 4 years and these mirrors are still doing pretty well. The plastic is coming apart a little bit, but it&#x27;s not too bad. I&#x27;ve been gentle on it (as has my wife) and I think they will last even longer.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Used to have one at our old house and left it behind. BOY, did I MISS this! So convenient when fixing the back of your hair. Previous one held up for over 13 yrs (and counting)...so I don&#x27;t think this one will be any different. Well made mirror. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, it really works for me for make-up application! The quality is great!</li>
            <li> I can actually see the back of my head with this mounted across from my bathroom mirror. It is so easy to move around into position. Folds nicely back out of the way when not in use.</li>
            <li> Really like the size and expandability, but the thing keeps falling apart.  I now have it held together with wire.  I would have given it 5 stars if it would stay together and not fall apart.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.  Easy to install and use.  This replaces an earlier version of the same product that we had for years and it lives up to our previous experience.  Every hotel room needs one of these!</li>
            <li> This mirror fell apart while taking it out of the box.  I returned it the same day I received it.</li>
            <li> Just what the wife needed.  Easy to install and it works great.  I have no complaint and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It is a great mirror, but (1) the screws for the sheetrock anchors are too small in diameter and after the anchors just pushed thru into the sheetrock on install; I had to get some professional anchors at the hardware store; and (2) you need a jeweler&#x27;s screwdriver to tighten the set screw that secures the mirror to the swivel - not mentioned in the description (fortunately I had one of these in my tool box, if not, yet another trip to the hardware store).</li>
            <li> Purchased for a shaving mirror for my husband. Easy to assemble and hang. 1-2-3- done. Wall mount is well made-heavy chrome.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I had one before that I used without the extender and it worked well so when we moved I bought another.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to install.  The extender is a little stiff but I expect it will loosen up over time.</li>
            <li> Have gotten many of these for Birthday Gifts.  Everyone has one now.  Jerdon&#x27;s are the best.  They come out further from the wall, and the mirror is bigger.  Short arms on the others don&#x27;t work as well when looking at back of your head.</li>
            <li> I love the extra long extension that this wall mount mirror has.  I would have preferred a metal frame around the mirror instead of plastic.  Also, the wall screws that came with this mirror were worthless and my husband had to get ones that were stronger.</li>
            <li> Love it, now to get my other half to put it on the wall! Will be nice to use to put makeup on and use both hands.</li>
            <li> Love the mirror..Delivery was fast..product was great.  I have another wall mirror and needed another mirror so that I could see the other side of my hair in the back.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two - the screw that holds the mirror to the swivel unscrews and if you don&#x27;t check it every time you use it, its going to fall off an break.</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  Large enough to see everything, easy to pull out and push back.  Magnification is just right.  I did hang mine lower than they suggested by about 8 inches.  I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; so the suggested height was too high.  Hung it where the middle of the mirror is just below eye level.  For me, this works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with things loosening.  Seems to be pretty solid and stays where I put it.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to an elderly grandfather who was having trouble seeing his face in the standard wall mirror, making shaving, etc. hard for him to do.  We installed this for him and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed. Magnification side is strong enough to make shaving or make-up application easy. Good extension length. Installation was easy.</li>
            <li> while on amazon i saw the mirror,i have one that is 33years old and i did not think they still made them, soon as i saw the mirror i ordered it. Let me say this, I am still using my old one, that alone should tell anyone this is a top notch product .anyone looking for amount mirror look no further, this is the best.</li>
            <li> Kinda flimsy.  Mirror moves while I try to view the back of my hair.  Otherwise good enough.</li>
            <li> Would not know what to do if I didn&#x27;t have this mirror.......I use a curling iron every day &amp; also trim my own hair.  This mirror purchase is a back-up for one that I have in my bathroom for many years.  I also got one for my daughter...she uses it daily &amp; loves it also.  It&#x27;s not hard to install...two screws....done!</li>
            <li> not as expected . surrounded by plastic .</li>
            <li> nice heavy metal. real perception of quality</li>
            <li> was exactly what I wanted!  looks great! works great</li>
            <li> It works great. Wish I had ordered this a long time ago. Makes it so much easier to curl the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> Well, what can you say about a mirror?  It reflects light properly, for sure.  I am concerned about the hinge assembly, though.  It is a flimsy affair, and is too delicate to handle long-term use with confidence.  I returned it.  I suppose if you do not intend to grab it, use it, and put it back regularly you might not have an issue.  I was not confident in its durability.</li>
            <li> Returned did not fit where I needed it to go. Was nice quality. Great price for a hard to find item</li>
            <li> got exactly what I needed and what I needed it for - to look up my nose at the nose hairs</li>
            <li> This was easy to mount and worked fine for a few months, but now the rivets on the accordion are breaking off and it&#x27;s drooping downward. The accordion part looked a little flimsy from the start, so I&#x27;ve tried to avoid extending and retracting it much, but its still breaking. Probably better to spend more $$ and get something sturdier.</li>
            <li> Just opened it for festivus, and one of the rivets holding together the extension arm fell out. Not something that can be fixed without re-riveting it. And making the entire arm useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to contact Jerdon for warranty, will see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that it appears to be an OK mirror, if it costs $10 less than what I paid.</li>
            <li> Had one of these years ago and left it when I moved.  I screw mine on a side wall so that it extends behind me as I&#x27;m standing in front of my larger bathroom mirror.  That way I can style the back of my hair without constantly picking up a hand mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Jerdon , for making this basic beauty tool still available</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years and years, until it finally fell apart.  Loved it.  Since I cut and color my own hair, it is an invaulable tool to have.  For several years, we moved a lot, or were next to homeless, so I would have had no place to put it, but now I am stable again and thrilled to have it. Thank you! Thank you! Thank You!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted. It does what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, easy install, looks great and serves it&#x27;s purpose very well, if I wore makeup I would use it myself</li>
            <li> If you color your hair it saves you an expensive trip to the salon because you can see what you are doing.  You will not be disapointed.</li>
            <li> Works just like I want it to, especially to see the back of my head when combing my hair.  SAC</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this mirror, easy to install and good quality especially for the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday... It was exactly as shown in the picture....is better&lt;br /&gt;than the one I had before....so far, everything about this product is perfect....&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of anything more to say...except  &amp;#34; I Love It&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror as I need to sit and do my hair and makeup.  In my trailer the only mirror is above the sink.  Following installation it worked beautifully. No problem with the mirror pivot or the accordion extender.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular mirror because it extends further than most others.  It is also a square shape rather than round like most, which enables you to have a better view.  The mirror stays where you aim it and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It could be a little bit larger but overall I do like this mirror.  I attached it to a cabinet drawer in my bath room.  The only thing I would change about the mirror is the size.  If larger I would be able to see the back of my hair after styling. : )</li>
            <li> I saw a mirror just like this while on vacation last month.  The magnifying side of the mirror makes it so easy to see for makeup application, etc.  When you pull the accordion out and flip the mirror, you can see the back of your hair, hands free.  The price was almost unbelievable.  I ordered it online before we left the condo!</li>
            <li> The mirror is exactly the right size with a good amount of retractable extension for really good back-views. It was exactly what I was looking for and the service was very fast and it was packed very carefully.</li>
            <li> searched high and low and finally found it on amazon so thank you so much loving it greatly ! !</li>
            <li> I wanted a 5x mirror since that is what I was used to, and use it for makeup, flossing and contacts. I needed one with a longer extension in my new house and this was the only one I found at a reasonable price. I was able to install it easily, the problem I&#x27;m having is it \\&quot;drifts\\&quot; towards the back wall when I have it pulled out, which is annoying. I have to have it totally extended for it to hold its position, perhaps I didn&#x27;t install it perfectly level</li>
            <li> This mirror was a great find.  It has about twice the reach of most retractable mirrors especially in this price range which makes it easy to see fully around your head. Can shave, trim your hair, check out whatyour hair looks like from the back, and ladies can put on their make-up with ease. Very easy installation if you can operate a screwdriver.  The retractable arm moves freely and easily and it flattens out against the wall so it is out of the way when you don&#x27;t need it.  Very attractive also.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This mirror has a nice long extension and sags just a little at when it&#x27;s all the way out. My only complaint is that the setscrew anchoring the mirror to the shaft requires a very small screwdriver bit. Even with the correct sized bit it&#x27;s difficult to get tight. The screw should be changed to an Allen head or Torx head so it can be really cranked down.</li>
            <li> Mostly sturdy and well constructed but the little plastic knob that held the mirror popped off after a few weeks. Super glue seems to be holding it.</li>
            <li> I especially love the magnifier side!</li>
            <li> Extremely helpful to have this mounted in conjunction with medicine cabinet mirror so that I can see front &amp; back.  Magnifier works great.</li>
            <li> I got a similar mirror for $5 at ikea.</li>
            <li> Helps me with my make up and hair and It is what every woman needs who wants to look there best.</li>
            <li> The material used in making the mirror and extension arm is very sturdy, much better class than alot of mirrors I have looked at,at a much higher price. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> For the price think this mirror is FANTASTIC. White trim makes it look really nice with the white framed main mirrors in my bathroom. Love the pull out operation.</li>
            <li> This product is of excellent quality and had very fast shipping. Exactly what I wanted..............thanks</li>
            <li> As advertised and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror because it allows me to see the back of my head when styling, cutting, and coloring my hair.  As a retired hair stylist, I do my own hair, and along with the help of this mirror I save lots of money that I would otherwise be spending at a hair salon each month.  The mirror is sturdy when pulled out to the maximum length and compact enough to fit on the opposite wall from my bathroom mirror.  It was such a good and small investment!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that met my needs!  Great quality!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was hoping when I bought this that it would be of a high quality and I am NOT at all disappointed I used the sinkers and screws that came with it and mounted it to the doorframe where it will work best for me and I LOVE it! I got this mainly to be able to cut my own hair not JUST in the front of my head! lol and the mirror is smooth and big and I LOVE that its square so there is lots of room to see all around the side of what I am doing, makes PERFECT sense, the round mirrors don&#x27;t so I am very happy I bought this one!&lt;br /&gt;by the way its made I can tell this is a lifetime purchase, its not going to fall apart ANYTIME soon, great product!</li>
            <li> I love it! works great!</li>
            <li> The mirror was exactly what I expected. Installed easily. Good workmanship. It folds flat against the wall. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find the perfect mirror so I really searched hard and read so many reviews about various ones.  I finally narrowed it down to three.  After reading and looking over and over at those same three, I finally decided on this one.  When it arrived and I carefully pulled it out of the box,  I was so shocked! It was even bigger and more beautiful than it was in the picture! My husband put it up (which was an easy process because it only has (2) screws!. He called me in there and I just kept pulling it towards me and pushing it back. Also,kept twisting and turning it around, flipping it, and pushing it back! Basically,I just kept playing with it! I have used it daily since then and I love it more each time I use it! It&#x27;s large enough and it&#x27;s so pretty and also professional looking! This is the mirror you see in 5 star hotels! If you are searching for a mirror that is not only versatile but also economical,and beautiful then SEARCH NO MORE BECAUSE THIS IS THE MIRROR FOR YOU!!!  Can you tell. ..I LOVE THIS MIRROR!!!!  0:)</li>
            <li> WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT A MIRROR.  USUALLY I AM NOT PLEASED WITH THINGS I BUY ON THE INTERNET, BUT THIS WAS A GOOD ONE.</li>
            <li> I like it!  It&#x27;s funky and fun looking in my bathroom and serves my purpose well and was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My hair looks perfect every time now.  Before I got the mirror I&#x27;d have a flat spot at the back of my head.  I couldn&#x27;t hold a hair dryer, a brush and a mirror all at the same time.  This lets me see the back of my head.  I look like I just came from the salon every time!</li>
            <li> this is 1 of the best thing that ever bought help me cut my own hair it came in not damaged and I use it all the time on my hair</li>
            <li> I know the description said it was white and silver, but it has cheap looking plastic around the mirror. It would be nice if it weren&#x27;t for that.</li>
            <li> Set screw was cross threaded where mirror is tightened on rod. Could not remove or tighten set screw so mirror stays loose on rod.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother and she loves it.  It looks nice and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The mirror worked great for about 9 months, then the plastic pegs holding the mirror in place broke. There is no way to repair or glue together a small piece of plastic that broke in half, so now the whole thing is completely useless. I would advise not buying this mirror and instead finding a more sturdy, metal-constructed mirror.</li>
            <li> I use this mirror every day. It extends far enough for me to actually stand in front of it and see the back of my head in the larger mirror behind me. The magnification is fine and I can move the mirror far enough to get in good light. The only drawback is the somewhat flimsy post and connector that the  mirror attaches to. The mirror sometimes comes off and has to be reattached.</li>
            <li> Excellent product-well made, easy to install, fantastic magnification quality and long extension!</li>
            <li> If your looking for a nice sturdy extension mirror, that is not cheap of flimsy, then this is it! It goes together easily &amp; just make sure that you attach it to a wall correctly, because it is somewhat heavy. After that, pull it out whenever you need it and it fold up easily next to the wall out of the way. If you put it in the right height for yourself, it is great for seeing the back of your head for styling hair also. I would highly recommend! :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I wanted.  Now I can see the back of my hair.  Easy to install for my husband.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT...and a great value at the price.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again...</li>
            <li> easy to put up, thank you</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife, because our bathroom  is crowded and now we can both use a mirror. It is quality, easy to mount and looks good too.</li>
            <li> I am just so excited about this mirror!!  It was such a good price too!  It makes my life so much easier on getting dressed in the morning.  I extends out to the perfect length and brings the mirror to me.  I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> These mirrors are hard to find, so I was thrilled that they were available!!!  Very high quality and last forever!</li>
            <li> This was very easy to install, I love the versatality of this unit, it is just what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> My husband complained about mounting it on a wall in our bathroom but uses it MORE than I do.  I use it to touch up my gray roots!  $4.00 instead of $140.  And I do a much better job.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount, great magnification, nice quality materials.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This mirror is awesome! It stretches the full length as described and the large square mirror is plenty big. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine, not strong enough for how I want to use it. wasn&#x27;t sure how much 5x was.</li>
            <li> It meets all our requirements! I decided the plastic anchors sent would not stand up to repeated use! They could come out of the drywall so  I substituted a stronger one that screws into the drywall.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t installed but seems very well made. Exspect to be satisfied.</li>
            <li> frame of mirror fell apart out of box i would say the rest of it is good quality frame not so much</li>
            <li> Major design flaw! The bracket that holds the mirror in place is a faulty designed. The mirror isn&#x27;t secure because the end knobs that hold the mirror in place are NOT designed to hold anything in place securely: they do NOT snap in place to hold the mirror tightly. When you go to adjust the mirror it comes out of its bracket and could fall and break.  A small bolt and threaded end system on the mirror bracket would solve the problem. I&#x27;ll try Super Glue and see if that works. Not happy!</li>
            <li> I had another magnification mirror which I got rid of because the image was distorted.  This mirror is great and the image is clear.  I did spray the extension arm, when I got it, with a lubricant so it would extend smoother but it was only stiff from newness.  I love the mirror!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy easy to install for the price it was well worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality and price. Same as the original except for the lack of nylon bearings on the post causing it to swing too freely towards the lowest point.</li>
            <li> We had a slight amount of trouble with the drywall screws they gave us and in the end we had to go buy our own. But this mirror is exactly what we needed and expected! I would recommend this mirror to anyone and everyone needing a wall mounted mirror.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, the scissor action of the extension is very tight.  Know this in advance, I oiled it and it loosened pretty well.  Following the instructions, I used pliers to tightened the mirror to the post, which I can tell some people did not do (and they blame the mirror), and I also tightened the set screw, as it seems some may not have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that while the accordion action is very tight, the swivel action on the bracket is not.  I installed is as vertically level as possible, but the mirror seems to naturally lean to the right, which makes it swing right rather than hold the spot I want it in.  Since I installed it close to a wall, I just stuff a wad of paper towel by the bracket and it stays put.  Not attractive, though.  Also, the scant instructions do not provide any information on what size drill bit to use to fit the mollies.  I had to up size a couple of times to get it to where I could tap in the mollies without destroying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the mirror, and it is useful.  It&#x27;s one of the few that has this length of extension at a decent price.  Still, given the issues, I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be more pleased . thank you</li>
            <li> Works great just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Recieved the mirror within a week, well packed.  The mirror is attractive, the quality is good, and the price was great!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t put it up yet, but I like it otherwise.</li>
            <li> The rivet falls off before I even pull it completely out of a package.  Very disappointed.  Had to return because it is unusable.  Poor quality inspection.</li>
            <li> Very poor design. I assembled this following the instructions to a tee. It was obvious immediately that the stem for the mirror attachment was bent. Perhaps it was a return?  The next day I heard a crash when the mirror fell from the extension wand and the glass broke in my sink. Very disappointed. I really wanted this one to work out.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  I do wish that one with a bit less magnification were available.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and very useful for bathroom sink location. This is the second one I have installed in this house to help my wife and guests with their make up and hair. Very well-made and heavy duty structure for easy care and long life.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror! Extends easily. The only improvement would be ....if it were lighted.</li>
            <li> sturdy, doesn&#x27;t sag when extended, smooth action. Well worth the price. It would be perfect if mirror reflected me 10 years younger, sigh, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations</li>
            <li> Old one wore out, new one much improved and should last many years.</li>
            <li> Love it. Best product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Nice but heavy. Make sure you firmly secure it to the wall!</li>
            <li> This is so convenient in my bathroom. I can see the back of my hair as well. I can turn it around and it has a magnifying mirror on the other side for closer inspections.</li>
            <li> This is so nice. Very good quality. My last one from another company sagged down after a short time and came loose wouldn&#x27;t stay in place... just a pain. This one is a nice size and stayed in place. It also has a nice reach if you can&#x27;t put it close to you. Love it</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it better than her other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, just that it makes my face look fatter then it actually is.  It&#x27;s a little bit wide angle - and not on the magnification side!  Also, the mirror ended up being a little crooked.  I&#x27;m slightly OCD so this is a hard mirror for me to use because it&#x27;s crooked.  If I installed it to make it straight, the mirror would lean to one side.  If you just need a regular mirror, then it&#x27;s something you could probably look into.</li>
            <li> Product is made very well and the size of the mirror is what I have been looking for. However I am not able to use in bathroom because of the way the cabinets and walls are designed. I am keeping with hope to use else where.</li>
            <li> It works.  I wish it was better quality for the price that they are charging.  The Mirror is mounted on plastic.  The arm is very stiff and this unit mirror is a bit small, but it works and I couldn&#x27;t find anything better</li>
            <li> This is my second mirror -- the old one lasted for years and years.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the 5 pt magnification -- I would prefer 4 pt</li>
            <li> So great on my bathroom wall placed so I can use it to see the back of&lt;br /&gt;my head when I am coloring or styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Received this product as expected and I am very happy with the quality of the product.  I would definitely order another.</li>
            <li> This mirror is easy to install, the perfect size, and works like it should.  It feels sturdy and folds nicely against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as it was exactly like the old one, which needed replacing. My husband is in a wheelchair &amp; this handy mirror works well for him to shave &amp; wash up.</li>
            <li> The mirror was fantastic, just as expected. The magnification is just perfect.  I would recommend to everyone.  The shipping was right on time.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very well made and I use it every day. Is now a year old and still looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is what you need I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does what I wanted it to. Have had it for a long time. Years....</li>
            <li> Love this mirror .... this is our 2nd one!</li>
            <li> gift for my wife. she loves it</li>
            <li> Good product.  Extention at least 50% greater than similar products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Easy to install but the mirror portion is flimsy and crooked. It&#x27;s kind of driving me crazy to the point where I want to take it down. The mirror is not horizontal, and the arm that holds it up wiggles and jiggles a lot.</li>
            <li> The unit exactly matches the one that was made several years ago but became broken by house guests that were not careful...</li>
            <li> This mirror has a longer arm so it provides greater flexibility.</li>
            <li> Awesome for coloring and styling the back of your hair.</li>
            <li> In the 8 months my wife has had this - the mirror flew off twice.  The first time, she was able to put it back together without damage, the 2nd time - she was not so lucky.  The mirror broke into pieces.  This is no longer usable.  Very poor design.  Think twice before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Item arrived and while unpacking several of the rivets fell out.  I am going to keep the item but I will have to replace several of the rivets with something else in order to use this.</li>
