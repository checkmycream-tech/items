            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>

            <li>I have been using mi paste instead and it seems to be helping with the sensitivity better.</li>
            <li>You are supposed to use this 1 X a week, so I will give it 1 more try before I trash it.</li>

            <li>The taste is a strong mint taste, definitely NOT offensive in any way, but if you don&#x27;t like mint, then maybe this would not be the ideal product for</li>
            <li>There are easy to use instructions.</li>
            <li>make sure to much cotton or gauze between gums and trays--lots of drool!!</li>
            <li>The instructions that came with both the whitener and remineralizing gels were great and gave specific instructions on how to use.  </li>
            <li>I do not hate it.</li>

            <li>You do need trays, thin ones are the most comfortable or your invisalign braces because sleeping with it on works the best.</li>
            <li>only good thing I can say about this product is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>How made this, Thank You very very very much !&lt;</li>
            <li>I used this directly after and the spot on my gum felt better and was gone by the morning.</li>
            <li>These things gave me a brighter smile in just two applications.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>My teeth also don&#x27;t seem to darken as fast as I am a huge coffee drinker and prior to using this I needed to whiten a lot more often.</li>
            <li>However, I just had two permanent crowns put on my front two teeth and went through a power bleaching process and my teeth were becoming sensitive to hot/cold, so I needed to do something.  </li>
            <li>He uses it more than I do and they have never been this white.</li>
            <li>so we did use the top from the extra one we bought.</li>
            <li>I really like the Watts Power brand!</li>
            <li>The teeth whitening gel can cause some sensitivity in the teeth, and more likely the gums from chemical burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps in the whole tooth-whitening process.</li>
            <li>but I have been told that using the \\&quot;Teeth Trays by Watts Power White\\&quot; or crest whitening strips (after rubbing off their gel &amp; applying Watts&#x27;s product) can always work very well too.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The whitening and re-mineralization system work very well.</li>
            <li>It really works at reducing/removing gum and tooth pain.  </li>
            <li>This product is very watery.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps ease the stinging after using the whitener.  </li>
            <li>takes a while to get the desired shade but once there it does maintain extremely well, it just needs to taste better.</li>
            <li>It tastes like shit and because its so watery its very easy to accidentally swallow.</li>
            <li>this product does what is advertised, it is not hard to use and the directions are there.</li>
            <li>I received the product today and I recognized it right away as the same product my dentist uses.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, leaves no residue, no discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I have rather sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Helps my teeth not to be so sensitive</li>
            <li>, i keep forgetting.been busy</li>
            <li>and I see marked results.  </li>
            <li>I was wondering what this product could do for my teeth and mainly got it to back my teeth up after having bleached them.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This decent tasting gel actually reduces sensitivity quite a lot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the vivid blue color.</li>
            <li>It really seems to help, plus as a bonus, it also seems to enhance your tooth color if your enamel is slightly eroded from acidic foods/drinks.</li>

            <li> takes a while to get the desired shade but once there it does maintain extremely well, it just needs to taste better.</li>
            <li> I use this once weekly for sensitivity to cold drinks and food. Decreases my senstivity to none or minimal and my teeth appear pearly after use and between applications. My teeth also don&#x27;t seem to darken as fast as I am a huge coffee drinker and prior to using this I needed to whiten a lot more often. They tend to stay whiter longer so I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching my teeth for years but never knew that remineralizing after bleaching helped tooth enamel.  I recently purchased the Watts 22% bleaching (10ml size syringes) with these remineralizing gels.  The instructions that came with both the whitener and remineralizing gels were great and gave specific instructions on how to use.  My teeth have never felt better and healthier after bleaching.  I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps in the whole tooth-whitening process. I have rather sensitive teeth. I use this with Watts Power Pro 35% Teeth Whitening Gels. I think it really helps to keep the insane sensitivity that comes with whitening under control.   I use it after whitening for about 30 minutes. It really seems to help, plus as a bonus, it also seems to enhance your tooth color if your enamel is slightly eroded from acidic foods/drinks.</li>
            <li> Helps my teeth not to be so sensitive</li>
            <li> I use this after bleaching my teeth and actually helped me a lot with the sensitivity. I used it twice a week and worked great. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product \\&quot;Optimized FCP Weekly Treatment Formula - Anti-cavity plus Teeth Sensitivity / Remineralizing Gels by Watts Power White\\&quot; to strengthen my teeth. I am also using the \\&quot;Teeth Whitening kit\\&quot; so I am hoping it helps to repair any damage whitening might do. Years ago I had my teeth whitened professionally by a dentist and loved the results.     So far I am very pleased with these products after 6 weeks and feel good about recommending Watts&#x27;s products. I still use the tray made by my dentist but I have been told that using the \\&quot;Teeth Trays by Watts Power White\\&quot; or crest whitening strips (after rubbing off their gel &amp; applying Watts&#x27;s product) can always work very well too.</li>
            <li> not sure how i feel about this product</li>
            <li> After using the bleach to whiten I had some gum sensitivity and even a spot that was turning white because the bleach and gotten on them. I used this directly after and the spot on my gum felt better and was gone by the morning.</li>
            <li> I was wondering what this product could do for my teeth and mainly got it to back my teeth up after having bleached them.&lt;br /&gt;Well, this product is simply awesome. Days after the treatment my teeth feel supersmooth and if nothing could build up on/hang on to them at all (e.g. stains from coffee, tartar, etc). Also the gel did the job to soothen my teeth after the bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and will buy again!</li>
            <li> have not had the chance to try them yet, i keep forgetting.been busy and i guess its best to use in d eve.</li>
            <li> How made this, Thank You very very very much !&lt;br /&gt;It helping a lot to release pain.&lt;br /&gt;God solution if You need</li>
            <li> this product does what is advertised, it is not hard to use and the directions are there. I do not hate it.</li>
            <li> They work great. Was hesitant as I drink gallons of coffee everyday. These things gave me a brighter smile in just two applications.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Can&#x27;t believe how white my husband&#x27;s teeth are! He uses it more than I do and they have never been this white. The instructions are very easy and there is not any sensitivity issues for me like I had with the strips. I would buy an extra tray to play around with. We bought three trays and my husband just couldn&#x27;t get his top one to form right so we did use the top from the extra one we bought. I am going to start using it more but I just don&#x27;t think about it. You do have to devote 45 min to 1 hr to do it but the results are worth it. This is actually a product that does what it says!</li>
            <li> did no good at all teeth looked worse after using product using</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week for about 30 minutes each day. no sensitivity, but no results. i am going to leave it on for 45 minutes this next week to see if that helps. make sure to much cotton or gauze between gums and trays--lots of drool!!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before buying this and I have to say it works!  I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;ve only used it three times and I see marked results.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with the product. I followed the directions but applied it for a few nights consecutively to try to get the effect faster.  Then I tried increasing the time I left the product on.  I&#x27;ve used up the product already without any added relief.</li>
            <li> The whitening and re-mineralization system work very well. There are easy to use instructions. I have purchased the system several times.</li>
            <li> I bought this based upon other people&#x27;s reviews who said that the 30% strength Watts whitener worked well but could cause some sensitivity (which it did).  I had instant relief after using this product for less than half an hour.  Buy both.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about &amp;#34;the dentist&#x27;s little secret&amp;#34; a long time ago!  I have found they take the sensitivity of my teeth away even when not bleaching!  I&#x27;m not a Dentist, but spent enough time in &amp;#34;the chair&amp;#34; to pay off the student loans of multiple practitioner&#x27;s! You do need trays, thin ones are the most comfortable or your invisalign braces because sleeping with it on works the best.</li>
            <li> great to use along with a whitening treatment or for any reason that you are having tooth sensitivity.  you will need your own teeth trays, but if you are doing tooth whitening you can just use the trays that come with one of those kits.</li>
            <li> I had extreme sensitivity after removing braces and major oral surgery so I tried this product. I mat have been just overly sensitive but this stuff was uncomfortable and triggered my sensitivity both times I tried it. I have been using mi paste instead and it seems to be helping with the sensitivity better. You are supposed to use this 1 X a week, so I will give it 1 more try before I trash it.</li>
            <li> Great product for reducing sensitivity after whitening.  It really works at reducing/removing gum and tooth pain.  Great taste also. I really like the Watts Power brand!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with tooth sensitivity while I am whitening my teeth at home. I looked for a good remineralizing gel after using up the one my dentist gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This product is very watery. I put it inside my plastic custom made trays and put it over my teeth. Immediately, almost all of the gel went out of the tray and into my mouth! It also got into the back of my throat, and I had to rinse with water about 10 times to avoid accidentally swallowing any. Yuck! I expected it to be a viscous gel like the one I used from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The taste is disgusting. I can&#x27;t even describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I don&#x27;t like the vivid blue color. It is unnecessary. The gel I used from the dentist was clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say about this product is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It helped with tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be ordering it again. It tastes like shit and because its so watery its very easy to accidentally swallow. You do NOT want to ingest any of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product one star because the risk of accidentally ingesting it makes it dangerous.</li>
            <li> This is very similar to teeth whitening gel  I got from my dentist.  Just make sure (1) your teeth are dry before applying and (2) Wipe off an excess gel from your gum area.</li>
            <li> This decent tasting gel actually reduces sensitivity quite a lot. It&#x27;s fairly thick &amp; adherent, so you have to rinse well after use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this purchase after reading the reviews about the taste and consistency of this product. However, I just had two permanent crowns put on my front two teeth and went through a power bleaching process and my teeth were becoming sensitive to hot/cold, so I needed to do something.  I received the product today and I recognized it right away as the same product my dentist uses.  I used a small amount to test out the consistency and it was great, gel toothpaste like consistency.  The taste is a strong mint taste, definitely NOT offensive in any way, but if you don&#x27;t like mint, then maybe this would not be the ideal product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my front four teeth and it worked immediately. I felt immediate relief from the nerve pain I have been having. I am looking forward to using this and getting rid of this sensitivity once and for all.  A small amount seems to go a long way, so don&#x27;t gob it on.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  If I could return it I would.  I use a competitor&#x27;s brand and it works perfectly every time. It&#x27;s clear, leaves no residue, no discomfort.  I put these in the trays applied it and after no more than 30 seconds experienced stabbing tooth pain.  I immediately removed the trays, rinsed, brushed, and noticed that my teeth had a bluish hue.  Awful product won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> Theses are great. This is the second time I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been whitening my teeth for years and always have a problem with cold sensitivity right afterwards.  In researching, I found on an dentist web site that he offered a whitening service followed up with a treatment that stops the sensitivity caused by the whitening.  I called and asked the medication used in that treatment.  This is it.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be nothing more than Aim toothpaste squeezed into syringes.  It does nothing for teeth sensitivity that I have noticed.  My Sensodyne toothpaste does.  Stuck with a few syringes of blue goo now.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps ease the stinging after using the whitener.  Has a nice minty taste too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with Opalescence 35% whitening gel. The teeth whitening gel can cause some sensitivity in the teeth, and more likely the gums from chemical burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Watts Power FCP Formula really does come in handy. I use it both before and after Ive used the teeth whitening gel. The time where I dont use it beforehand, I can tell! My teeth do get sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommende getting this to help alleviate some of the pain, but its not mandatory. I myself, will continue to order this product.</li>
