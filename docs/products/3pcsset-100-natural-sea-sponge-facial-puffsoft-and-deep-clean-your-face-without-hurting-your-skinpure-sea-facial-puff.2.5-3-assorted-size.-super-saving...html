            <li>It is soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li>natural sea sponges are wonderful for makeup and cosmetic applications and or removal.  </li>
            <li>More like 1.5&amp;#34; rather than the 2.5&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34; on the listing.</li>
            <li>it needs more density for make up foundation.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>I love these sponges, (comes from Greece)..</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love using this sponge.</li>
            <li>Great quality and good personal service from the seller, which is often rare to see when ordering online.</li>
            <li>Soft, absorbent, just perfect for applying that particular makeup.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and so natural!</li>
            <li>I probably should have gotten all the same kind.  </li>
            <li>But they are pretty compact and clean really well.</li>
            <li>Whatever you use these sponges for, you&#x27;ll be getting the effect of a genuine natural sponge.  </li>
            <li>I feel naturally clean and fresh when using the Sea Sponge Facial Puff.</li>
            <li>I recently came across an old favorite (Max Factor Pancake makeup) but needed *the* sponge, and these are just right.  </li>
            <li>A little tougher than expected but still very good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often</li>
            <li>Very disapointed in the quality and size of this product.</li>
            <li>It was very misrepresented in it&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I thought the size was perfect and after getting the sponge wet, the softness was fine too, but after less than one month, I had to throw one away because it was breaking apart as I used it and leaving little sponge bits everywhere.</li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s only one retailer in the US carrying it, and super reasonable prices.)</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered was from a different seller.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is okay, but it is not soft enough for facial skin.</li>
            <li>Clear instructions on how to clean/sanitize sponges before and after use.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and luxuriant they felt on my face.  </li>
            <li>Soft on the skin and completely natural.</li>
            <li>I needed a new sea sponge to apply makeup (btw, I&#x27;m a female).  </li>
            <li>I had a facial and they used natural sea sponges.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough to use on my face along with my cleanser.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you would have expected they where packaged together and are soft when wet.</li>
            <li>Foolishly, I didn&#x27;t buy them there, thinking $16 was too much to spend on one little sponge.</li>
            <li>However, because it&#x27;s too soft after soak, it has very limited function of cleaning the face.</li>

            <li> (3.5\\&quot; to 5\\&quot;) and entirely too rough on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The sponge set were much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Pretty thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard when it&#x27;s dry and extremely soft when goes to the water.</li>
            <li> Out of the package they are dry and somewhat hard, but soaked in water they become pliable and naturally spongy.  </li>
            <li> but I didnt quite pay attention to the size, so they were a little smaller than I had wanted.</li>
            <li> The others are a little big for my jar.</li>
            <li> I ended up with rough, scaly skin after using this.</li>

            <li> I found these sponges to be very tiny and too small to use.</li>
            <li> Wet it a little and apply with the sponge.</li>
            <li> I believe the wool sponge is too coarse and hard for use on the body.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It is small in size which is what I needed.</li>
            <li> So I got these less expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find but hope amazon continues market them !</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t mold like artificial materials.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

            <li> These were tiny. More like 1.5&amp;#34; rather than the 2.5&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34; on the listing. I returned them.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these sponges and will order them again.</li>
            <li> i ordered this sponge as make up sponge for water foundation. it needs more density for make up foundation.&lt;br /&gt;my suggestion is show a density for each sponge. the size is too big too. need smaller size for make up.</li>
            <li> I needed a new sea sponge to apply makeup (btw, I&#x27;m a female).  You cannot find one in stores anymore.  The first one I ordered was from a different seller.  It was larger (3.5\\&quot; to 5\\&quot;) and entirely too rough on my skin.  Then I ordered these smaller sponges because the description stated it would not hurt my skin.  They are perfect.  For best results (i.e., most softness) keep the sponge very damp while using.  Fast shipping and excellent customer service from Eastern Cloud - will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> A little tougher than expected but still very good.</li>
            <li> This sponge is okay, but it is not soft enough for facial skin. I believe the wool sponge is too coarse and hard for use on the body.</li>
            <li> bought these but I didnt quite pay attention to the size, so they were a little smaller than I had wanted. But they are pretty compact and clean really well.</li>
            <li> I loves uses these sponges on my face!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty thin. I had to trim out a bunch of seedy gunk.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying makeup, foundation, etc. Wet it a little and apply with the sponge. These are the perfect size and shape as well as a great value compared to other ones listed online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to cut these into smaller sizes. They will last quite a while with rinsing.</li>
            <li> The sponge set were much smaller than I expected.  But otherwise they were fine.</li>
            <li> Too small total rip off</li>
            <li> These sponges arrived on time. Were a bit too big for what I wanted them for. Clear instructions on how to clean/sanitize sponges before and after use. Would totally buy them again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard when it&#x27;s dry and extremely soft when goes to the water. However, because it&#x27;s too soft after soak, it has very limited function of cleaning the face.</li>
            <li> I thought the size was perfect and after getting the sponge wet, the softness was fine too, but after less than one month, I had to throw one away because it was breaking apart as I used it and leaving little sponge bits everywhere. I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often so I have maybe used it 6 times. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I had a facial and they used natural sea sponges. Couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and luxuriant they felt on my face.  Foolishly, I didn&#x27;t buy them there, thinking $16 was too much to spend on one little sponge. So I got these less expensive ones. These almost feel like Brillo pads on your face, even after soaking. I ended up with rough, scaly skin after using this. So....I went back and bought the $16 one.  It is soft and wonderful. Maybe there is a nice soft one on amazon, but I&#x27;ll stay with the sure thing.</li>
            <li> I recently came across an old favorite (Max Factor Pancake makeup) but needed *the* sponge, and these are just right.  Soft, absorbent, just perfect for applying that particular makeup.  (tip: google max factor pancake instead of looking here on Amazon - there&#x27;s only one retailer in the US carrying it, and super reasonable prices.)</li>
            <li> Whatever you use these sponges for, you&#x27;ll be getting the effect of a genuine natural sponge.  Out of the package they are dry and somewhat hard, but soaked in water they become pliable and naturally spongy.  Perfect for cleaning your face or for garment spot cleaning.</li>
            <li> I found these sponges to be very tiny and too small to use. I tried to return them but the vendor never contacted me after I submitted my return request. I do not recommend this product or the vendor.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges, (comes from Greece).. Great quality and good personal service from the seller, which is often rare to see when ordering online. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I feel naturally clean and fresh when using the Sea Sponge Facial Puff. It&#x27;s amazing and so natural! Can&#x27;t go wrong especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed in the quality and size of this product. It was very misrepresented in it&#x27;s description. I would NEVER by from this company again.</li>
            <li> A good value. Soft on the skin and completely natural. Didn&#x27;t mold like artificial materials. Sea sponges are the best :)</li>
            <li> Great purchase! sponges have held up over time.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> recieved them in good order on time.  Exactly what you would have expected they where packaged together and are soft when wet.</li>
            <li> natural sea sponges are wonderful for makeup and cosmetic applications and or removal.  pls keep stocking.</li>
            <li> I love them.  I probably should have gotten all the same kind.  The others are a little big for my jar.</li>
            <li> These are the best for putting on makeup.  I have used this type of sponge for 50 years !!! Getting hard to find but hope amazon continues market them ! Thanks</li>
            <li> I love using this sponge. It is soft enough to use on my face along with my cleanser. It is small in size which is what I needed.</li>
