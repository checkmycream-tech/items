            <li>EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my airbrush aftermath use.</li>
            <li>use it to clean an airbrush machine</li>
            <li>If you are considering an airless sprayer you will need cleaning solution to clean it.</li>
            <li>I then use solution and a toothbrush to clean the nozzle</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t flush the machine good enough it can irritate the skin and may lead to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It works great worth every penny i spent on it</li>
            <li>Worth adding to your Temptu accessory growing collection.</li>
            <li>I expected it would be good quality coming from Temptu.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require much product to clean.</li>
            <li>It is much more smaller.  </li>
            <li>With their occasional sales, you would be better to wait and stock up.</li>
            <li>but I found on YouTube how to make your own and it will save me a lot of money that way but other than that this product works well thank you.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I saw a YouTube video that instructed to use a tiny drip of this on eyelids before applying shadow, and it REALLY WORKS!!!  </li>
            <li>It is 4 ounce in a transparent plastic bottle , it work well and clean nicely s/b foundation , not much to say about , it does do the work as expected</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a user friendly tool.</li>
            <li>Though the price is far higher from this seller than Temptu.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have an older style of airbrush but didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>It works excellant on cleaning your airbrush and doesn&#x27;t clog it up however I have found it gives the airbrush a a little boost in cleaning out well better than water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the airbrush makeup world, but I highly recommend this product for cleaning your air gun if you happen to be using silicon based products.</li>
            <li>Oily in the machine, and you have to rinse thoroughly before putting in new makeup</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t clear the clog in my tempts w this oil.</li>
            <li>I rinse the cup with water and then add about 1 teaspoon of solution and spray until the mist is clear.</li>
            <li>Because the makeup was so shoddy and wouldn&#x27;t go through the machine, I tried this product, and it didn&#x27;t clean out any of the makeup!</li>
            <li>A little expensive considering I run this through a few times but as far as how it works....works GREAT!</li>
            <li>and it cleans very fast with using only a small amount of product</li>

            <li> My son wanted this for his business as part of his airbrush kit. He likes it and using it regularly</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my airbrush aftermath use. Simply put, it works well and does,the job.  It is designed for Temptu products and may not clean other products as well, but used with Temptu makeup. It&#x27;s the ticket!  Though the price is far higher from this seller than Temptu. With their occasional sales, you would be better to wait and stock up.</li>
            <li> easy to use, seems effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five but I am not thrilled about the greasiness of the product but I know it&#x27;s probably necessary for what it does.</li>
