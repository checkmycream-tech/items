            <li>Product wise</li>
            <li>It is good for me.</li>
            <li>This is really really good.</li>
            <li>For something that says &amp;#34;Active&amp;#34; I thought it&#x27;d be good for me since I work out a lot.</li>
            <li>This is a good eyelid glue</li>
            <li>But works good.</li>
            <li>right now this is my best option.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I think it just didn&#x27;t work for me because of my own body&#x27;s reactions.</li>
            <li>And it is definitely worth to buy!!!</li>
            <li>:&amp;#34;)  Glue is very good also. ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy to putted it on with great glue, easy to design to eyes.</li>
            <li>It works very good, just need to make sure you use the stick to &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; the lines on your eyelids first.</li>
            <li>Easy to works!</li>
            <li>The first 3 hours it seems to work great</li>
            <li>I think I can honestly say I&#x27;ve used pretty much all of the EyeTalk items and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>Have tried a couple of times, but maybe I need more practice applying it.</li>
            <li>Before I ordered it , I looked through many comments.</li>
            <li>I even found many videos to learn how to put the glue on my eye.</li>
            <li>Been using a double eyelid glue for years and this is the best one in my opinion.</li>
            <li>There are better options out there.</li>
            <li>Best eye glue ever even thought it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>anyway i recommend this product if u r not like me, have more time to do make ups</li>
            <li>Made in Japan, so you know it is quite safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>but I would say after 8 hours apply more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite, never get water soluble eyelid glue because they won&#x27;t be as tolerant to anything that involves water.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It could have been better..</li>
            <li>That how I determine which part of the lid needs more glue to keep.</li>
            <li>I like the Eye Charms tape much better.  </li>
            <li>make my crease, add more glue, then make my crease deeper to make sure it would stay.</li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s why i need more.</li>
            <li>and after using it for a while my eyes are now more droopy.</li>
            <li>I guess my best advice would be to get double eyelid surgery by a qualified surgeon trained in this sort of stuff.</li>
            <li>Or better yet, go to South Korea to get the surgery done since the doctors</li>
            <li>Now I feel much better about how my eyes look.</li>
            <li>It will stick much better this way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used way better glues before</li>
            <li>After I put it on it sticks pretty good</li>
            <li>Easy to use but still need more practice.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed with how quickly the package was delivered (four days with standard shipping), and I was even more pleased with the product itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I just use my face wash), and most importantly, it&#x27;s undetectable.</li>
            <li>, the good thing about this glue is that it doesn&#x27;t show as much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really easy to put on and handle with</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>The glue is not as strong as I would want it to be.</li>
            <li>sure your eye lid is clean and free from lotion and oil.</li>
            <li>It works fine if you won&#x27;t apply makeup on it.</li>
            <li>Defiantly would recommend, way better than eyelid tape &amp; fast shipping too!:)</li>
            <li>Although it is light, but it can stick every well.</li>
            <li>This eye glue works very well and comes with a nice set of instructions as well.</li>
            <li>It definitely needs some type of makeup remover to get rid of it, which is great when you&#x27;re out.</li>
            <li>This one is super light-weight and the color turns to transparent very quickly after applied.</li>
            <li>I found out about eyelid glue through YouTube makeup tutorials and I love this product soooooo much!</li>
            <li>so sometimes I just smudge and clean it off at work and still have the crease.</li>
            <li>So far this is the best double eyelid glue I ever tried and have been using it for 2 years.</li>
            <li>so my word is just as good or even better than any other review.</li>
            <li>use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>At least she  look beautiful more than before with this.</li>
            <li>The product will naturally get kind of sticky and shiny from my oily skin</li>
            <li>i love it so much, its water proof so it wont fall off.</li>
            <li>This time I tried the blue one, it turned out as good as the one I bought before.</li>
            <li>It works well and can lasting for 6-8 hours, good for asia girls.</li>
            <li>The other review sounds great</li>
            <li>But once you figure it out and know where and how much glue to to put on and how much area you have to glue, you should be able to do it easily going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for an excellent double eyelid product.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this is an extraordinary product for us monolid girls.</li>
            <li>Super pricey for something I will not end up using</li>
            <li>If you use make up just make sure the crease has just the right amount of glue (too much and it clumps).</li>
            <li>Gives a fresh faced look and quick application.</li>
            <li>but I just wipe it off with my finger right quick and carry on.</li>
            <li>They are easier to use and look more natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I bought it for fun.</li>
            <li>And Most important point is dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty quick now.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>(just doesn&#x27;t fold right).</li>
            <li>and it lasts all day if I do it right.  </li>
            <li>So to remove this product, what I do is use face wash or a cotton swab with soap and it removes this product right of your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Lid glue helps me \\&quot;train\\&quot; and stabilize my one stubborn eye lid that just doesn&#x27;t want to fold right.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product as long as you keep your eyes open :P</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously this first attempt is aimed at getting the right application.</li>
            <li>The delivery was super fast and you get a lot for the price.</li>
            <li>I live in florida and it is easy to get sweaty but this thing can stay on whole day.</li>
            <li>The glue does leave a distinct line across the eyelid so someone who is looking very closely might notice it.</li>
            <li>From my \\&quot;collection\\&quot; of EyeTalk and tape, this is the first one I always grab to use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re doing your eyeshadow, put your eyeshadow on first and then apply the glue.</li>
            <li>, just really wished it was stronger!</li>
            <li>If I wanted to get revenge on someone while sleeping it would be quite funny if I used this on them..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>it works really well!</li>
            <li>Can be tricky to use at first</li>
            <li>but overall, okay product.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 1+ years; and I spilled a lot one time &gt; &amp;lt;.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I have way more confidence because of this eyelid glue.</li>
            <li>love (have purchased multiple times).</li>
            <li>When I use the glue, I pretty much just stick with eyeliner and a bit of shadow right at the lash line.</li>
            <li>I use the glue, I pretty much just stick with eyeliner and a bit of shadow right at the lash line.</li>
            <li>But seriously, this product is great</li>
            <li>The price is good for this amount of product you get; you only need very tiny amount of it each application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable, but it makes a huge difference in the size of the eyes.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product does not have a funny smell.</li>
            <li>To figure out just how much glue I need to apply and where, I first locate the crease I want to emphasize and put glue all along the crease.</li>
            <li>My wife bought it but didn&#x27;t use it that much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Very sticky, maybe too sticky.</li>
            <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t really know how to apply it correctly or what.</li>
            <li>It is very liquidly but has no holding power.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the pink version.</li>
            <li>but the solution was very watery</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do much else with the glue on and you don&#x27;t want to accidentally emphasize the fact that you are wearing lid glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do much else with the glue on and you don&#x27;t want to accidentally emphasize the fact that you are wearing lid glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care much for this brand.  </li>
            <li>but i really do like this product although i dont use it often at all since i dont need it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very liquidy and doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>This product was purchased to help raise, stick and hold my eyelid on one eye to make it more even with the other.</li>
            <li>because other eyelid glues had reviews of it not sticking so well after so many hours.</li>
            <li>works okay for my half covered lids</li>
            <li>I prefer the pink version far better.</li>
            <li>The glue dries quickly but give you enough time to position and lift according to your taste.</li>
            <li>This is very dry quickly!</li>
            <li>It might be that I have a bit more of a bulging eye, but when I slightly squint (forcefully or when Im smiling or laughing), I have a normal lid</li>
            <li>do not apply make up before the spot you are applying too or any product after,it will make the product then highly visible,and diluted.</li>
            <li>I was referred from a friend who spoke highly of this product.</li>
            <li>You should check it though a couple of times a day to make sure it&#x27;s still in place as sometimes the hold does lessen a little</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend this product and definitely think it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal as your lids produce oil and sweat throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I think this glue is useful for people who already have double eyelid and just want to make the crease deeper.</li>
            <li>and you should put two coats, letting the first one completely dry first.  </li>
            <li>(make sure the product is almost completely dry before making crease or it&#x27;ll make sticky resadue like dry false lash glur) and easy to take off :) would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with double eyelid glue.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wearing eye shadow, definitely put it on first then the glue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the small dental picks (Denteks) work better for me.</li>
            <li>glue is strong, but it&#x27;s not so strong that removing it is difficult</li>
            <li>I do it right after I wash and dry my face before I put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The glue dries clear and matte, and it doesn&#x27;t flake when I used the pic to shape my eyes.</li>
            <li>and it still remains clear.</li>
            <li>really helpful if you want to make your eyes brighter and bigger.</li>
            <li>Even though the product turns white sometimes when washing off, it does really well in rain.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and even stays pretty well through my evening workouts.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t really use it, but it comes with some english instructions, but still i might just suck at it.</li>
            <li>Especially for monolids like me it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I regret spending this much money on such a faulty product.</li>
            <li>I will use it for 3-5 days straight when the lid is acting up.</li>
            <li>I dont feel so conscious about my eyes.</li>
            <li>It took me a few days to become adjusted, but once I got the hang of it, this product lasted through my entire day to make me look much more awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I saw some people apply this product all over their lids, I am not sure if it is because they are monolids and don&#x27;t have any folds on their eyes or if that method makes the glue stay strong.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last as long as I would&#x27;ve liked and once the glue dried, I swear the dust around me at work would make the glue unstick from my eyelid.</li>
            <li>I noticed the first few times I used it, it worked really well</li>
            <li>but it only last five minutes, so basically don&#x27;t waste your money on something that is more water than glue.</li>
            <li>It will just need some time to re-train the eyelid to look like a normal double lid.</li>
            <li>It was pretty hard for me to put on at first, but after a while i got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long to me, absolutely didn&#x27;t last a whole day.</li>
            <li>Try not to forget to wash it off because i did that a few times and it made my eye super puffy for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The active eyetalk is not as strong as the pink counter part.</li>
            <li>after look of this product looks very natural and makes your eyes look rounder and open.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time the other day, and it didn&#x27;t even make it 4 hours into work.</li>
            <li>I used to use the original koji eyetalk and because it wasn&#x27;t water proof the littlest things like a splash or a little sweat would remove the glue and make my eye look deformed in public, so i switched over to this.</li>
            <li>Goes on white drys clear.</li>
            <li>Glue goes on white and dries clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this glue many times and have not experienced any irritation.</li>
            <li>This product is very professional on making your eyes bigger in multiple ways.</li>
            <li>You may have to try a few times to get it right.  </li>
            <li>it could look more natural, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Like I said my eye starts to crease naturally after the long wear</li>
            <li>it is less visible but sometimes does not last the whole day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the little tool that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>It probably is a good product but the seller I purchased it from was bad.</li>

            <li> anyway i recommend this product if u r not like me, have more time to do make ups</li>
            <li> Made in Japan, so you know it is quite safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> but I would say after 8 hours apply more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> and this is my favorite, never get water soluble eyelid glue because they won&#x27;t be as tolerant to anything that involves water.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It could have been better..</li>
            <li> That how I determine which part of the lid needs more glue to keep.</li>
            <li> I like the Eye Charms tape much better.  </li>
            <li> make my crease, add more glue, then make my crease deeper to make sure it would stay.</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s why i need more.</li>
            <li> and after using it for a while my eyes are now more droopy.</li>
            <li> I guess my best advice would be to get double eyelid surgery by a qualified surgeon trained in this sort of stuff.</li>
            <li> Or better yet, go to South Korea to get the surgery done since the doctors</li>
            <li> Now I feel much better about how my eyes look.</li>
            <li> It will stick much better this way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used way better glues before</li>
            <li> After I put it on it sticks pretty good</li>
            <li> Easy to use but still need more practice.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with how quickly the package was delivered (four days with standard shipping), and I was even more pleased with the product itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I just use my face wash), and most importantly, it&#x27;s undetectable.</li>
            <li> , the good thing about this glue is that it doesn&#x27;t show as much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really easy to put on and handle with</li>
            <li> Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> The glue is not as strong as I would want it to be.</li>
            <li> sure your eye lid is clean and free from lotion and oil.</li>
            <li> It works fine if you won&#x27;t apply makeup on it.</li>
            <li> Defiantly would recommend, way better than eyelid tape &amp; fast shipping too!:)</li>
            <li> Although it is light, but it can stick every well.</li>
            <li> This eye glue works very well and comes with a nice set of instructions as well.</li>
            <li> It definitely needs some type of makeup remover to get rid of it, which is great when you&#x27;re out.</li>
            <li> This one is super light-weight and the color turns to transparent very quickly after applied.</li>
            <li> I found out about eyelid glue through YouTube makeup tutorials and I love this product soooooo much!</li>
            <li> so sometimes I just smudge and clean it off at work and still have the crease.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best double eyelid glue I ever tried and have been using it for 2 years.</li>
            <li> so my word is just as good or even better than any other review.</li>
            <li> use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> At least she  look beautiful more than before with this.</li>
            <li> The product will naturally get kind of sticky and shiny from my oily skin</li>
            <li> i love it so much, its water proof so it wont fall off.</li>
            <li> This time I tried the blue one, it turned out as good as the one I bought before.</li>
            <li> It works well and can lasting for 6-8 hours, good for asia girls.</li>
            <li> The other review sounds great</li>
            <li> But once you figure it out and know where and how much glue to to put on and how much area you have to glue, you should be able to do it easily going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for an excellent double eyelid product.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, this is an extraordinary product for us monolid girls.</li>
            <li> Super pricey for something I will not end up using</li>
            <li> If you use make up just make sure the crease has just the right amount of glue (too much and it clumps).</li>
            <li> Gives a fresh faced look and quick application.</li>
            <li> but I just wipe it off with my finger right quick and carry on.</li>
            <li> They are easier to use and look more natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway I bought it for fun.</li>
            <li> And Most important point is dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty quick now.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> (just doesn&#x27;t fold right).</li>
            <li> and it lasts all day if I do it right.  </li>
            <li> So to remove this product, what I do is use face wash or a cotton swab with soap and it removes this product right of your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Lid glue helps me \\&quot;train\\&quot; and stabilize my one stubborn eye lid that just doesn&#x27;t want to fold right.</li>
            <li> Overall, good product as long as you keep your eyes open :P</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously this first attempt is aimed at getting the right application.</li>
            <li> The delivery was super fast and you get a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> I live in florida and it is easy to get sweaty but this thing can stay on whole day.</li>
            <li> The glue does leave a distinct line across the eyelid so someone who is looking very closely might notice it.</li>
            <li> From my \\&quot;collection\\&quot; of EyeTalk and tape, this is the first one I always grab to use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re doing your eyeshadow, put your eyeshadow on first and then apply the glue.</li>
            <li> , just really wished it was stronger!</li>
            <li> If I wanted to get revenge on someone while sleeping it would be quite funny if I used this on them..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> it works really well!</li>
            <li> Can be tricky to use at first</li>
            <li> but overall, okay product.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 1+ years; and I spilled a lot one time &gt; &amp;lt;.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I have way more confidence because of this eyelid glue.</li>
            <li> love (have purchased multiple times).</li>
            <li> When I use the glue, I pretty much just stick with eyeliner and a bit of shadow right at the lash line.</li>
            <li> I use the glue, I pretty much just stick with eyeliner and a bit of shadow right at the lash line.</li>
            <li> But seriously, this product is great</li>
            <li> The price is good for this amount of product you get; you only need very tiny amount of it each application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely noticeable, but it makes a huge difference in the size of the eyes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product does not have a funny smell.</li>
            <li> To figure out just how much glue I need to apply and where, I first locate the crease I want to emphasize and put glue all along the crease.</li>
            <li> My wife bought it but didn&#x27;t use it that much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Very sticky, maybe too sticky.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t really know how to apply it correctly or what.</li>
            <li> It is very liquidly but has no holding power.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the pink version.</li>
            <li> but the solution was very watery</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do much else with the glue on and you don&#x27;t want to accidentally emphasize the fact that you are wearing lid glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do much else with the glue on and you don&#x27;t want to accidentally emphasize the fact that you are wearing lid glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care much for this brand.  </li>
            <li> but i really do like this product although i dont use it often at all since i dont need it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very liquidy and doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased to help raise, stick and hold my eyelid on one eye to make it more even with the other.</li>
            <li> because other eyelid glues had reviews of it not sticking so well after so many hours.</li>
            <li> works okay for my half covered lids</li>
            <li> I prefer the pink version far better.</li>
            <li> The glue dries quickly but give you enough time to position and lift according to your taste.</li>
            <li> This is very dry quickly!</li>
            <li> It might be that I have a bit more of a bulging eye, but when I slightly squint (forcefully or when Im smiling or laughing), I have a normal lid</li>
            <li> do not apply make up before the spot you are applying too or any product after,it will make the product then highly visible,and diluted.</li>
            <li> I was referred from a friend who spoke highly of this product.</li>
            <li> You should check it though a couple of times a day to make sure it&#x27;s still in place as sometimes the hold does lessen a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend this product and definitely think it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal as your lids produce oil and sweat throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I think this glue is useful for people who already have double eyelid and just want to make the crease deeper.</li>
            <li> and you should put two coats, letting the first one completely dry first.  </li>
            <li> (make sure the product is almost completely dry before making crease or it&#x27;ll make sticky resadue like dry false lash glur) and easy to take off :) would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with double eyelid glue.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wearing eye shadow, definitely put it on first then the glue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the small dental picks (Denteks) work better for me.</li>
            <li> glue is strong, but it&#x27;s not so strong that removing it is difficult</li>
            <li> I do it right after I wash and dry my face before I put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The glue dries clear and matte, and it doesn&#x27;t flake when I used the pic to shape my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it still remains clear.</li>
            <li> really helpful if you want to make your eyes brighter and bigger.</li>
            <li> Even though the product turns white sometimes when washing off, it does really well in rain.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long and even stays pretty well through my evening workouts.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t really use it, but it comes with some english instructions, but still i might just suck at it.</li>
            <li> Especially for monolids like me it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I regret spending this much money on such a faulty product.</li>
            <li> I will use it for 3-5 days straight when the lid is acting up.</li>
            <li> I dont feel so conscious about my eyes.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to become adjusted, but once I got the hang of it, this product lasted through my entire day to make me look much more awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I saw some people apply this product all over their lids, I am not sure if it is because they are monolids and don&#x27;t have any folds on their eyes or if that method makes the glue stay strong.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as I would&#x27;ve liked and once the glue dried, I swear the dust around me at work would make the glue unstick from my eyelid.</li>
            <li> I noticed the first few times I used it, it worked really well</li>
            <li> but it only last five minutes, so basically don&#x27;t waste your money on something that is more water than glue.</li>
            <li> It will just need some time to re-train the eyelid to look like a normal double lid.</li>
            <li> It was pretty hard for me to put on at first, but after a while i got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long to me, absolutely didn&#x27;t last a whole day.</li>
            <li> Try not to forget to wash it off because i did that a few times and it made my eye super puffy for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The active eyetalk is not as strong as the pink counter part.</li>
            <li> after look of this product looks very natural and makes your eyes look rounder and open.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time the other day, and it didn&#x27;t even make it 4 hours into work.</li>
            <li> I used to use the original koji eyetalk and because it wasn&#x27;t water proof the littlest things like a splash or a little sweat would remove the glue and make my eye look deformed in public, so i switched over to this.</li>
            <li> Goes on white drys clear.</li>
            <li> Glue goes on white and dries clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this glue many times and have not experienced any irritation.</li>
            <li> This product is very professional on making your eyes bigger in multiple ways.</li>
            <li> You may have to try a few times to get it right.  </li>
            <li> it could look more natural, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Like I said my eye starts to crease naturally after the long wear</li>
            <li> it is less visible but sometimes does not last the whole day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the little tool that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> It probably is a good product but the seller I purchased it from was bad.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day for a whole year and it didn&#x27;t run out so just for being in a little bottle like this actually last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> At first it was really hard to use because I didn&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> you have oily lids, the glue won&#x27;t last as long on you.</li>
            <li> you have oily lids, the glue won&#x27;t last as long on you.</li>
            <li> However, there is a big caution when using this for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I do not naturally have a double eyelid</li>
            <li> but my eyes are large enough for me to do a small crease to look wide eyed and awake.</li>
            <li> Chinese instructions and limited illustrations.  </li>
            <li> No extra strips to insert in between your eye that would come loose and cause embarrasing moments.  </li>
            <li> That made my eyes very tired easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used eyelid tape for so long</li>
            <li> Holds for a long time.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist tole me that this stuff can permanently damage your eyelids (i.e. stretching, scarring, and even skin cell damage) if used long term.</li>
            <li> but it takes long to dry off.</li>
            <li> Ike other double eyelid/eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> After I used it, it do make double eyelid, but then it&#x27;s hard to close the eyes completely.</li>
            <li> and it make my eyelids sticky and make my eyes get dry easier.</li>
            <li> Wait for it to dry a bit</li>
            <li> sticky stuff keeps ur eyelid glued together.. and then ur eyeballs dry out cus</li>
            <li> After buying several eye lift glues (wasted lots of money)... I finally found the one that works!</li>
            <li> It started being like that in high school, but I only fully noticed how ugly it looked during my first year of college.</li>
            <li> However, it is somewhat not natural if somebody stares at your lids carefully.</li>
            <li> The lid will likely look ugly and messy since you are applying the glue in more than one step.</li>
            <li> This is not very sticky.</li>
            <li> So definitely try it a few times before going out of the house with it.</li>
            <li> I used to use the pink one.</li>
            <li> Maybe i need practice etc but really not working.</li>
            <li> u can&#x27;t blink all the way closed.</li>
            <li> Note that too much glue or folding in the wrong place keeps my eye from closing all the way when I blink and later down the line my eye feels dry.</li>
            <li> Even after removing it, my eye continues to crease due to the all day wear.</li>
            <li> have tried other eyelid glue</li>
            <li> usually due to change in hormone levels, sleep, puffiness, etc.</li>
            <li> putting it on, just wait a little while for it to dry and then fold your eyelid over.</li>
            <li> Pros: this one will last you at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> it does not really work for my eye, probably just can keep few mins .</li>
            <li> after days of weighing down my options I went with this one;</li>
            <li> but I do have one lid that&#x27;s uneven with the other</li>
            <li> Try not to get the product on the rim/ridge of the bottle because as it accumulates and dries, the bottle will be hard to open and it&#x27;s a waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> Will get less sticky as the day goes on</li>
            <li> It is not sticky enough and failed to make double eyelid as described.</li>
            <li> so there was no perspiration to mess with the adhesive.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thin on skin and water proof but not hard to be removed.</li>
            <li> You need to practice a little</li>
            <li> Once dried, I use the little fork that comes with the glue to push my eyelid to fold along the crease.</li>
            <li> Only use it when my eyes look tired, etc.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the glue should be applied everyday, just my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for my husband&#x27;s uneven eyelid</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelids</li>
            <li> Blink a few times to see how it feels with the glue on and where I decided to fold my lid.</li>
            <li> But, this stood up to the harsh shitty surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But as a chemical products, please don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> To wash it off I have to usually rub the skin surface a few times to get it off.</li>
            <li> It was even a little tricky to wash off with my makeup remover!</li>
            <li> For those, like myself, who are inexperienced in using this type of product this is really frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Plus, my double eyelids are also very thin (like EXO&#x27;s Sehuns), so it&#x27;s almost invisible when I put it</li>
            <li> but it is too sticky, I felt not very good when I blink my eyelids.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to not get all the sticky crumbs everywhere on eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was really slow gettin here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was something prolly to do with the slow post office to tell you the truth.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t thick</li>
            <li> Otherwise it looks messy!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past two years!</li>
            <li> I must say, this one is the worst one of several double eyelid maker.</li>
            <li> there are the world experts in this stuff (and also much less expensive over there),</li>
            <li> and if you are wearing eyeliner it can look a little weird.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is not the product itself not good</li>
            <li> This product not really good as what I hope.</li>
            <li> I sometimes wake up with a nasty lazy eye and think that the whole world is staring at it.</li>
            <li> You must wait until the glue becomes at least somewhat transparent to start poking it with a fork, if not, the glue will stick to the fork and the fold will be wrinkle and weird.</li>
            <li> : EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> You must apply the glue after eye makeup, otherwise the shadow on the glue will look shiny/ glue-y, basically, weird.</li>
            <li> the shipping is crazy.</li>
            <li> Did not work and was very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been very insecure about my eyes.</li>
            <li> I found that this aadhesive wasn&#x27;t sticky at all when it came to creasing my lid but that it was nearly impossible to remove from the part of the lid where it was applied.</li>
            <li> Sticky and impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> , i need to wash it again - not kidding :(.</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and purchased it but was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife bought it but didn&#x27;t use it that much. Not the best but work just fine. At least she  look beautiful more than before with this.</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with how quickly the package was delivered (four days with standard shipping), and I was even more pleased with the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;The glue is strong, but it&#x27;s not so strong that removing it is difficult (I just use my face wash), and most importantly, it&#x27;s undetectable. The glue dries clear and matte, and it doesn&#x27;t flake when I used the pic to shape my eyes. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for an excellent double eyelid product.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to become adjusted, but once I got the hang of it, this product lasted through my entire day to make me look much more awake and refreshed. It was even a little tricky to wash off with my makeup remover! Bottom line, this is an extraordinary product for us monolid girls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read great reviews for this brand but I guess my eyelids are too moist for it to work. The first 3 hours it seems to work great but then my eyelids start to sweat and the fold starts to come undone. I&#x27;ve used the tape in the past and it&#x27;s worked pretty well. I think it just didn&#x27;t work for me because of my own body&#x27;s reactions.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  Have tried a couple of times, but maybe I need more practice applying it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Only use it when my eyes look tired, etc.  I don&#x27;t think the glue should be applied everyday, just my opinion.  The delivery was super fast and you get a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased to help raise, stick and hold my eyelid on one eye to make it more even with the other. I found that this aadhesive wasn&#x27;t sticky at all when it came to creasing my lid but that it was nearly impossible to remove from the part of the lid where it was applied. They make no claims that this adhesive will suspend a lid with ptosis so I don&#x27;t falt the company. It just didn&#x27;t do the trick for me and what I needed.</li>
            <li> Did not work and was very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> It is truly a nice eye glue with great quality. Honestly, it is the best glue I have ever used! And it is definitely worth to buy!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Very sticky, maybe too sticky. Comes with prong. Goes on white drys clear.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with double eyelid glue. At first it was really hard to use because I didn&#x27;t know how to use it. Just watch tutorials on YouTube and you&#x27;ll get it. Product wise it&#x27;s really easy to put on and handle with (make sure the product is almost completely dry before making crease or it&#x27;ll make sticky resadue like dry false lash glur) and easy to take off :) would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year and I really love it! This product is very professional on making your eyes bigger in multiple ways. It&#x27;r really helpful if you want to make your eyes brighter and bigger.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the hang of it. I had to practice several times to get the crease just right. If you&#x27;re wearing eye shadow, definitely put it on first then the glue. The glue does leave a distinct line across the eyelid so someone who is looking very closely might notice it. I&#x27;ve used this glue many times and have not experienced any irritation. It&#x27;s very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have ptosis.I was looking for a way to hide it, but this does not help at all its so watery.After I put it on it sticks pretty good but it only last five minutes, so basically don&#x27;t waste your money on something that is more water than glue.</li>
            <li> It works fine if you won&#x27;t apply makeup on it. Otherwise it looks messy!! And I used it as a fake eyelash glue and it works OK.</li>
            <li> I tried it couple times, never works for me. Maybe I don&#x27;t really know how to apply it correctly or what. and it make my eyelids sticky and make my eyes get dry easier. it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> thank&#x27;s for your gift! that&#x27;s best eye tape i have ever used, easy to handle, nice shape! but i can find on the amazon . ...  i want buy that. :&amp;#34;)  Glue is very good also. ...</li>
            <li> The glue did not make my lids stick and it was hard to not get all the sticky crumbs everywhere on eye. Going to try tape instead. Super pricey for something I will not end up using</li>
            <li> Before I ordered it , I looked through many comments. I even found many videos to learn how to put the glue on my eye. but it is too sticky, I felt not very good when I blink my eyelids. That made my eyes very tired easily. it does not really work for my eye, probably just can keep few mins .</li>
            <li> I think I can honestly say I&#x27;ve used pretty much all of the EyeTalk items and this one works the best. From my \\&quot;collection\\&quot; of EyeTalk and tape, this is the first one I always grab to use. I wear it on one of my eye for 12 hours at work. To wash it off I have to usually rub the skin surface a few times to get it off. Sometimes it turns white and you can peel it off. Even after removing it, my eye continues to crease due to the all day wear. Even though the product turns white sometimes when washing off, it does really well in rain. I&#x27;ve found myself walking to the car in the rain after work and it still remains clear. The product will naturally get kind of sticky and shiny from my oily skin but I just wipe it off with my finger right quick and carry on. Like I said my eye starts to crease naturally after the long wear so sometimes I just smudge and clean it off at work and still have the crease. I have not tried this item with eyeshadow makeup. I&#x27;ve used this product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product does not have a funny smell. I&#x27;m using it for my husband&#x27;s uneven eyelid and it works! It will just need some time to re-train the eyelid to look like a normal double lid. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Been using a double eyelid glue for years and this is the best one in my opinion. It lasts all day long and even stays pretty well through my evening workouts. You should check it though a couple of times a day to make sure it&#x27;s still in place as sometimes the hold does lessen a little and if you are wearing eyeliner it can look a little weird. I like the plastic stick it comes with to help hold the eyelid while its gluing. If you&#x27;re in front of a fan, it will start drying within 10 seconds. Great product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who needs to do double eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one eye with double eyelid and another eye that&#x27;s almost a double eyelid (just doesn&#x27;t fold right). I bought this product about a week ago and it works perfectly for me. I put it on almost every morning when I wake up and it lasts all day if I do it right.  Plus, my double eyelids are also very thin (like EXO&#x27;s Sehuns), so it&#x27;s almost invisible when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product and definitely think it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Although it is light, but it can stick every well. It is good for me. Sometimes it is not the product itself not good but we donnot know how to use. I seggest you search some vedio and learn how to use it</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t really use it, but it comes with some english instructions, but still i might just suck at it.</li>
            <li> not working. I must say, this one is the worst one of several double eyelid maker.</li>
            <li> This is not very sticky. It is very liquidly but has no holding power. Skip it. There are better options out there.</li>
            <li> Easy to works! Easy to putted it on with great glue, easy to design to eyes.And Most important point is dry quickly. This is very dry quickly!</li>
            <li> This product not really good as what I hope. After I used it, it do make double eyelid, but then it&#x27;s hard to close the eyes completely.</li>
            <li> This is really really good. Best eye glue ever even thought it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used. Sghohcffvvv hggxsdhbv hg</li>
            <li> i love it so much, its water proof so it wont fall off. but it takes long to dry off. anyway i recommend this product if u r not like me, have more time to do make ups</li>
            <li> I love it! I have uneven eyelids and I&#x27;ve always been very insecure about my eyes. I found out about eyelid glue through YouTube makeup tutorials and I love this product soooooo much! Basically I apply it where I want the crease to be, then I use the tool to tuck the glue under the skin. It&#x27;s barely noticeable, but it makes a huge difference in the size of the eyes. I use this every day, even days when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Definitely buying another one. I like it overall</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have mono-lids but I do have one lid that&#x27;s uneven with the other and this helps to correct it.  You need to practice a little and you should put two coats, letting the first one completely dry first.  There are YouTube videos that demonstrate how to use this.  I don&#x27;t really use the little tool that comes with it.  I&#x27;ve found that the small dental picks (Denteks) work better for me.</li>
            <li> Pros: this one will last you at least 6 months. Work great for eyes that already have crease. Made in Japan, so you know it is quite safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: EXPENSIVE. the shipping is crazy. This one will not hold if your eyes has oil or water. When you weep your eyes, this product will come out.</li>
            <li> The active eyetalk is not as strong as the pink counter part. I prefer the pink version far better. For something that says &amp;#34;Active&amp;#34; I thought it&#x27;d be good for me since I work out a lot. Even when I don&#x27;t work out, it doesn&#x27;t stay on and is quite watery.</li>
            <li> great stuff,really works,however... do not apply make up before the spot you are applying too or any product after,it will make the product then highly visible,and diluted.</li>
            <li> This is a good eyelid glue but I give a 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t stick on your eyes all day as I thought.</li>
            <li> This eye glue works very well and comes with a nice set of instructions as well. I have been using this for the past two years!</li>
            <li> works okay for my half covered lids</li>
            <li> no instructions with package</li>
            <li> This one is super light-weight and the color turns to transparent very quickly after applied. The consistency is very thin on skin and water proof but not hard to be removed. leave no greasy at all. I like it better than the pink version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now so my word is just as good or even better than any other review. It is waterproof like they said, but only against humanity not against swimming in a pool or anything. it will last through the day but I would say after 8 hours apply more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re doing your eyeshadow, put your eyeshadow on first and then apply the glue. I use this product every day for a whole year and it didn&#x27;t run out so just for being in a little bottle like this actually last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The after look of this product looks very natural and makes your eyes look rounder and open. Especially for monolids like me it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other eyelid glue and this is my favorite, never get water soluble eyelid glue because they won&#x27;t be as tolerant to anything that involves water. So to remove this product, what I do is use face wash or a cotton swab with soap and it removes this product right of your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> worked as promised. love it</li>
            <li> It could have been better.. But nonetheless does the job, just really wished it was stronger!</li>
            <li> I was referred from a friend who spoke highly of this product. Yes, it was sticky. If I wanted to get revenge on someone while sleeping it would be quite funny if I used this on them.. however...that wasn&#x27;t why I ordered this. It didn&#x27;t last as long as I would&#x27;ve liked and once the glue dried, I swear the dust around me at work would make the glue unstick from my eyelid. I&#x27;ve used eyelid tape for so long and it&#x27;s never failed me. I &#x27;m going to stick to that! ;)</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time the other day, and it didn&#x27;t even make it 4 hours into work. I also should mention that I work at a desk job...so there was no perspiration to mess with the adhesive. I only bought this to replace one that I lost from another brand...and I regret spending this much money on such a faulty product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I used it to even out one of my eyelids.  The glue lasts all day and I used an oil based makeup remover to take it off at night.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if i got a defect but the solution was very watery so it didn&#x27;t stick at all. i would have to be apply multiple layers (up to 8 or 9) to get it sticky.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work at all. Wast of money. So disppointed</li>
            <li> Best glue I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes at all. Holds for a long time. Holds well. Lid glue helps me \\&quot;train\\&quot; and stabilize my one stubborn eye lid that just doesn&#x27;t want to fold right. I will use it for 3-5 days straight when the lid is acting up. Then I can stop until it acts up again--usually due to change in hormone levels, sleep, puffiness, etc. My two eyes look totally different and mismatched when the creasing is off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it takes some trial and error. To figure out just how much glue I need to apply and where, I first locate the crease I want to emphasize and put glue all along the crease. Glue goes on white and dries clear. Once dried, I use the little fork that comes with the glue to push my eyelid to fold along the crease. Then I step back to see how it looks. Blink a few times to see how it feels with the glue on and where I decided to fold my lid. Note that too much glue or folding in the wrong place keeps my eye from closing all the way when I blink and later down the line my eye feels dry. From there, lift the hooded lid and see how it is folding over. That how I determine which part of the lid needs more glue to keep. I just play with it until it is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this first attempt is aimed at getting the right application. It can take several attempts and multiple applications of the glue and unfolding and refolding the crease. The lid will likely look ugly and messy since you are applying the glue in more than one step. So definitely try it a few times before going out of the house with it. But once you figure it out and know where and how much glue to to put on and how much area you have to glue, you should be able to do it easily going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your eye lid is clean and free from lotion and oil. I do it right after I wash and dry my face before I put on moisturizer. I do it at night when I sleep as well as in the day time. It will limit/change your eye makeup routine a bit. When I use the glue, I pretty much just stick with eyeliner and a bit of shadow right at the lash line. Can&#x27;t do much else with the glue on and you don&#x27;t want to accidentally emphasize the fact that you are wearing lid glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily lids, the glue won&#x27;t last as long on you. And to remove the glue residue, you can use a make up remover.I use the glue, I pretty much just stick with eyeliner and a bit of shadow right at the lash line.

            <li> actually. its so so .i won&#x27;t use that again</li>
            <li> Sticky and impossible to remove. Save your money.</li>
            <li> it works really well!</li>
            <li> I like this product. The package has no English, but if you want to know how to use it, go on youtube. I saw some people apply this product all over their lids, I am not sure if it is because they are monolids and don&#x27;t have any folds on their eyes or if that method makes the glue stay strong. I have Asian hooded eyelids, so I just put the glue on the crease or on w.e I want my fold to be on. You must wait until the glue becomes at least somewhat transparent to start poking it with a fork, if not, the glue will stick to the fork and the fold will be wrinkle and weird. Overall, It does the trick of creating a double-eyelid. However, it is somewhat not natural if somebody stares at your lids carefully. They can see that it actually glues part of your lids together to create double-eye lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to apply 2-3 layers of glue on no makeup eyes, and 3-4 layers on makeup eyes to make the folds stay glued. You must apply the glue after eye makeup, otherwise the shadow on the glue will look shiny/ glue-y, basically, weird. If you take a nap during the day, most likely the glue will either pulls your lids up, which makes me feel weird like I cannot fully close my eyes or something, or the glue will fall off when you get up unless you applied tons of layers before. I think you can see the glue on the lid if you close your eyes as well. Overall, good product as long as you keep your eyes open :P</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care much for this brand.  I like the Eye Charms tape much better.  They are easier to use and look more natural.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over tape it is less visible but sometimes does not last the whole day. Can be tricky to use at first</li>
            <li> I used to use the original koji eyetalk and because it wasn&#x27;t water proof the littlest things like a splash or a little sweat would remove the glue and make my eye look deformed in public, so i switched over to this. It definitely needs some type of makeup remover to get rid of it, which is great when you&#x27;re out. I noticed the first few times I used it, it worked really well but after a while i noticed i had to put the glue on, make my crease, add more glue, then make my crease deeper to make sure it would stay. But I have mono lids or sagging eyelids so maybe that&#x27;s why i need more. but overall, okay product. it could look more natural, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t and after using it for a while my eyes are now more droopy. so i had to stop using it. use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of turning my eyelid into double eyelid. In the evening I&#x27;ll use the DUP eyelid tape and in the day I&#x27;ll use this one. Great product!</li>
            <li> Chinese instructions and limited illustrations.  For those, like myself, who are inexperienced in using this type of product this is really frustrating.  Hopefully You Tube will have a tutorial.</li>
            <li> Very strong glue!! And totally transparent. Easy to wash off. Will get less sticky as the day goes on but that&#x27;s normal as your lids produce oil and sweat throughout the day. So far this is the best double eyelid glue I ever tried and have been using it for 2 years. This is my second bottle. The first one lasted 1+ years; and I spilled a lot one time &gt; &amp;lt;. The price is good for this amount of product you get; you only need very tiny amount of it each application. TIP#1: Wait for it to dry a bit ~20sec and then use the included fork to shape the fold you want to create. TIP#2: Try not to get the product on the rim/ridge of the bottle because as it accumulates and dries, the bottle will be hard to open and it&#x27;s a waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> on the box it says waterproof but if i got oil or water on it it wont stay or maybe its just me but i really do like this product although i dont use it often at all since i dont need it but i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I used to use the pink one. This time I tried the blue one, it turned out as good as the one I bought before. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This eye glue definately works but there is a learning curve. It&#x27;s easier to use and longer lasting than tape but takes some practice. However, there is a big caution when using this for a long period of time. My dermatologist tole me that this stuff can permanently damage your eyelids (i.e. stretching, scarring, and even skin cell damage) if used long term. I guess my best advice would be to get double eyelid surgery by a qualified surgeon trained in this sort of stuff. Or better yet, go to South Korea to get the surgery done since the doctors there are the world experts in this stuff (and also much less expensive over there),</li>
            <li> After buying several eye lift glues (wasted lots of money)... I finally found the one that works! I&#x27;m re-ordering!  No extra strips to insert in between your eye that would come loose and cause embarrasing moments.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply.  I use it both with makeup and without.  If you use make up just make sure the crease has just the right amount of glue (too much and it clumps). The glue dries quickly but give you enough time to position and lift according to your taste. You may have to try a few times to get it right.  I&#x27;m pretty quick now. I have one droopy eye and aside from getting an eyelift for right now this is my best option.  No one has ever said anything.  I&#x27;ve asked my husband and he does not see the glue either, but it does lift the lid!.</li>
            <li> I have multiple eyelid creases and it irritates me. It started being like that in high school, but I only fully noticed how ugly it looked during my first year of college. It might be that I have a bit more of a bulging eye, but when I slightly squint (forcefully or when Im smiling or laughing), I have a normal lid and I like how it looks.&lt;br /&gt;I read about eyelid tape and glue and after days of weighing down my options I went with this one; the bit more expensive one because other eyelid glues had reviews of it not sticking so well after so many hours. I could go for 18+ hours and they still stick. Plus Ive been using this for over a month. Now I feel much better about how my eyes look. I dont feel so conscious about my eyes. Overall, I have way more confidence because of this eyelid glue.</li>
            <li> I sometimes wake up with a nasty lazy eye and think that the whole world is staring at it. I decided to purchase this based on the reviews and am thankful i did. It works great! It was pretty hard for me to put on at first, but after a while i got the hang of it. It stays on all day and i have oily skin. Like, i wash my face and 2 hours later, i need to wash it again - not kidding :(. But, this stood up to the harsh shitty surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When putting it on, just wait a little while for it to dry and then fold your eyelid over. It will stick much better this way. Try not to forget to wash it off because i did that a few times and it made my eye super puffy for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also have a japanese friend that used to use this while she was back in japan. With that said, you should be sold on it already. Made in Japan &#x3D; Great product. Made in China &#x3D; Beware of lead. I&#x27;m just kidding. But seriously, this product is great, Give it a go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was really slow gettin here. But works good. It&#x27;s was something prolly to do with the slow post office to tell you the truth.</li>
            <li> This product helped my eyelid to go back where it was. Suddenly I lose my double eyelid line every once in a while. But with this product, when that happens I know what to do to make it come back.</li>
            <li> The consistency was almost like water. It wasn&#x27;t thick Ike other double eyelid/eyelash glue. The other review sounds great so I went ahead and purchased it but was very disappointed. It probably is a good product but the seller I purchased it from was bad. And they also refuse to give me a refund. Do not buy from CP cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Maybe i need practice etc but really not working. It messes up with my eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I bought it for fun.</li>
            <li> It works well and can lasting for 6-8 hours, good for asia girls. But as a chemical products, please don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long to me, absolutely didn&#x27;t last a whole day.</li>
            <li> sticky stuff keeps ur eyelid glued together.. and then ur eyeballs dry out cus u can&#x27;t blink all the way closed. sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt depending how stubborn ur eyelids are that day. i stopped using it once i found the d.u.p. stickers.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but still need more practice.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to remove when use cleanser instead of just water.&lt;br /&gt;Also can be used after using eye cream.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky enough and failed to make double eyelid as described. Maybe it is the problem with my eyelids</li>
            <li> Gives a fresh faced look and quick application. I&#x27;m out and about without any eyemakeup today! I do not naturally have a double eyelid but my eyes are large enough for me to do a small crease to look wide eyed and awake.</li>
            <li> The glue is not as strong as I would want it to be. I have a double eyelid and a mono eyelid so I use glue/tape to make my eyes match. I&#x27;ve used way better glues before and I wouldn&#x27;t use this for my mono eyelid. It&#x27;s very liquidy and doesn&#x27;t really work well. It is sticky but it&#x27;s weak.&lt;br /&gt;However, the good thing about this glue is that it doesn&#x27;t show as much. I think this glue is useful for people who already have double eyelid and just want to make the crease deeper.</li>
            <li> It works very good, just need to make sure you use the stick to &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; the lines on your eyelids first. I live in florida and it is easy to get sweaty but this thing can stay on whole day.</li>
            <li> Defiantly would recommend, way better than eyelid tape &amp; fast shipping too!:)</li>
            <li> love (have purchased multiple times).</li>
