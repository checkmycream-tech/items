            <li>Perfect for Day/Night looks.</li>
            <li>Not the best..</li>
            <li>Very good for the price.</li>
            <li>Buen producto, good product !</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Great for my great granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>and it was great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about looking for more beauty books, because I was so impressed with the pigmentation.</li>
            <li>On the good side, the colors coordinate and blend well</li>
            <li>Provides a good selection of colors.</li>
            <li>There is a good variety.</li>
            <li>The packaging is also nice.</li>
            <li>The product goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but not the one shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>but the colors are nice</li>
            <li>The shades have a natural shimmer to them and blend flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more from you</li>
            <li>I typically love elf, but these aren&#x27;t as pigmented as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m impressed with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider buying more e.l.f.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the shimmery colors apply much better than the matte ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>How cute is that?</li>
            <li>I love most E.l.f. products.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing selection of nicely shaded shadows, with a bit of shine, but not too glittery for &#x27;mature&#x27; lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I based this review on a friend&#x27;s compact, that I had used a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>This is a good option to have a nice selection of colors in different shades.</li>
            <li>This fits the bill just fine.</li>
            <li>colors are darker than they look in the picture, so there are fewer light colors to use than I thought, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>Bought this product for a christMas gift to my 17 yr old daughter she loved it.</li>
            <li>Pretty satisfied with it based on the price.</li>
            <li>A good eye palette, just thought it&#x27;d be bigger.</li>
            <li>While it may not last the full day, it does stay on good for a 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, it has very natural tones of colors.</li>
            <li>The matte colors are VERY sheer and understated, but the shimmering colors are nice and opaque.</li>
            <li>It is a small book but the colors are great.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use ELF Products..</li>
            <li>Spipped fast.</li>
            <li>I ordered it, and the one I got has much darker colors.  </li>
            <li>bcuz i loved the colors from the photo, but i was afraid that its not the same in Real.. when i used it I looove the colors, its gives wonderful color with a little bit shining..</li>
            <li>The colors are kind of small..</li>
            <li>The colors I have used so far have been pretty quality.</li>
            <li>So elegant and at the same time, low priced!</li>
            <li>The colors are mostly neutrals and there are a few brighter colors.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Happy New Years</li>
            <li>Was completely intact upon arrival.</li>
            <li>book is small, easy to carry it to everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comparing to the pricing, this palette is great!&lt;br /&gt;The powder is creamy and soft, very easiy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are various, adding a lot of fun for everyday makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Colors barely stay on the brushes and eyelids.</li>

            <li> I would recommend this to someone who may not use eyeshadow everyday but likes to have options of colors for when they do ...such as nights out (lots of dark and shimmer colors included)</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of Sephora items but wanted something compact for travel that I could have out of makeup bag and not mind if it got left behind at a hotel.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I use it, but after trying to work with it a few times, I gave it to my niece to play dress up with!</li>

            <li> She loves it.  I will be getting more from you thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Years</li>
            <li> I typically love elf, but these aren&#x27;t as pigmented as you&#x27;d expect. I can&#x27;t even build up the color. I also find that a few are not just similar, but the same. On the good side, the colors coordinate and blend well and there&#x27;s a handful of mattes. The packaging is also nice. I wish I could say I use it, but after trying to work with it a few times, I gave it to my niece to play dress up with!</li>

            <li> Provides a good selection of colors. The only color I feel is missing is purple. The product goes on nicely. While it may not last the full day, it does stay on good for a 4-5 hours. I suggest using a primer to keep it on longer than that. This is a good option to have a nice selection of colors in different shades. I would recommend this to someone who may not use eyeshadow everyday but likes to have options of colors for when they do ...such as nights out (lots of dark and shimmer colors included)</li>
            <li> All these colors and none to wear.</li>
            <li> Great for my great granddaughter.  She loves it</li>

I don&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> it is what she wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift and it was great. It closes like a book...How cute is that?</li>

            <li> I love this palette, it has very natural tones of colors. I&#x27;m thinking about looking for more beauty books, because I was so impressed with the pigmentation. I basically pick two colors put it on my eyelid and call it a day, thank you elf !</li>
