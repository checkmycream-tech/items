            <li>I can&#x27;t get this product in the stores any more.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I have been using this deodorant for many years and love it because it does not stain my clothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like when they stop making the bra you&#x27;ve been buying forever, or the only shampoo that makes your hair perfect.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to locate this in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because Arm &amp; Hammer has discontinued the UltraMax Rollon.&lt;br /&gt;Arrid is ok; but I still miss the UltraMax.</li>
            <li>It works well, and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found another source for it.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Most of the antiperspirants are using aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex.</li>

            <li>awful!i had high hopes for this because of the great reviews</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Roll ons are hard to find in the store so it is great to be able to get them online at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Better get it here while still available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Arrid liquid roll-on for decades, and after every store I know of dropped the roll-ons in favor of the &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; and sprays, I was happily surprised to find Amazon had it, and at a great price.</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The product was deliverd on time &amp; everything worked fine.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>The mild fragrence is also appealing.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon making Arrid XX available.</li>
            <li>Having used just about every type of deodorant, I&#x27;ve finally found one I can happily recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is such a great product.</li>
            <li>Protection seems to be good thus far.  </li>
            <li>The Arrid formula is an old one, but is the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>First of all, this item was received about four days early, which was great.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Once it dries, though, you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li>Good stuff, only thing I can use.</li>
            <li>seems to be a good enough replacement</li>
            <li>The scent of the product is also quite mild, which I like very much since strong scents make me dizzy.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t sting and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>..sure beats the super sticky gel</li>
            <li>I super like it!easy to</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, quick to dry and most importantly, it works.  </li>
            <li>will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Thanks to her advice and Amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li>Most effective deodorant and have never experienced a better underarm dryness.</li>
            <li>Only kind of Deodorant my husband will use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a longtime user of the old Arm &amp; Hammer roll on and like many others have been in a state of despair since it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff,all that i expected.</li>
            <li>Glides on quickly and dries very fast.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very soft and it&#x27;s true that it can fit for women or men.</li>
            <li>The best part of this product is that it leaves no white residue on your clothes like other deodorants that I have used in the past,before finding Arrid.</li>
            <li>This brand seems to work best for me, without white residue, without rashes or the other reactions I sometimes get, without perfume.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it is a roll-on, I don&#x27;t use it if I need to get dressed right away.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using Ban Rollon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Arrid XX original scent for decades and it never fails me, never leaves residue on my clothes, and with my super sensitive, allergy-prone skin, never causes my to itch or develop hives, etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not stocked in the stores very much anymore.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old, and have been using since I was in High School, more than 40 years ago, and I still would recommend.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Thanks for stocking it online!</li>
            <li>i have tried many deodorants and this is the only wine that works for me.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd case purchased in as many years.  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much for making this available/</li>
            <li>bot this based on overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I started using this antiperspirant years ago, but it hasn&#x27;t been really easy to find recently.  </li>
            <li>MY wife was happy to get this; because it hard obtain where we live.</li>
            <li>The roll-on is very hard to find in stores, so it&#x27;s nice to have it available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Really have to work them to make the product work</li>
            <li>he is very picky.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for being there for us.</li>
            <li>but sometimes it leaves a cakey residue, so the liquid roll-on works very well with no residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and found it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>My brand was not on the shelf and Arrid XX was very inexpensive</li>
            <li>Yes, we had too much time on our hands that day before going to the gym.</li>
            <li>This works for my whole family.</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant for over 40 years, I like the Roll-On and really don&#x27;t want to change.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it on line.</li>
            <li>It is a liquid and dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I received this product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>The gel and solid versions of this product aren&#x27;t as effective and they are actually messier to use.  </li>
            <li>Arrid XX Roll-on works better than any other.  </li>
            <li>In fact, this formula seems to be pretty and only a couple swipes is more than enough to keep you stink free all day long.  </li>
            <li>Although I live in a large metropolitan area, I cannot find this product in any stores.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other!</li>
            <li>So not only am I a  happy camper, my dad who has been without his favorite roll-on for years, now has his favorite roll-on thanks to Amazon and his Amazon obsessed daughter on a hunt to eliminate smelly pits!!!</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for many years and all of a sudden it is not in any of our local grocery or drug stores, so I have no choice but to order online.  </li>
            <li>Can be kind of uncomfortable to apply until the roller ball gets moistened, though this can be somewhat avoided by giving it a light shake before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommened Arrid Roll-On.</li>
            <li>On line buying them by the dozen saves me gas, irritation, and is actually CHEAPER...the old guy wins again!</li>
            <li>Been using this for years, most stores not carring it anymore &amp; both my wife &amp; I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>The stores no longer seem to carry it, so as other have commented we bless Amazon&#x27;s heart for having it available.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to other deodorants that is why this one is so important to me.</li>
            <li>So, I searched on Amazon in an effort to try maybe a couple new deodorants and/or antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have to use Arrid Roll-on almost exclusively because it does not irritate my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is my new go to pit-juice.</li>
            <li>I only like this particular one -- not sticky and does the job!  </li>
            <li>Arrid XX keeps me dry and odor free all the live long day!</li>
            <li>After moving to the Minneapolis suburbs, it completely disappeared.    </li>
            <li>The cost of shipping wipes out the discounted price for the six-pack but at least it doesn&#x27;t cost me more to buy them on line than it used to at the store.</li>
            <li>Reliable like old faithful</li>
            <li>The local stores no longer handle it, thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant all my life (I&#x27;m 57 yrs old).</li>
            <li>Fragrance is a very subjective choice; as such every review has to be taken in with a pinch of salt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is the only deodorant I have found that really works all day.</li>
            <li>the ingredients and the % of aluminum oxide..read Alzheimer&#x27;s &#x3D;) are not exactly the same but close enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>So it was nice to order them in bulk quantity for the same (if not less) than I usually paid for them individually.</li>
            <li>Most of the stores have quit carrying this product, but it&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve used for the past 10-15 years.  </li>
            <li>Great product, hard to come by as the companies try to switch everyone to solids, which really don&#x27;t work and are extremely irritating.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It works, does not stain clothes, dries quickly and has little or no odor.</li>
            <li>For some reason, this product is no longer sold in any store in our area (Central New York).</li>
            <li>No other product even comes close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 71 years old and obviously have been using deodorant daily for a long time and this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a deodorant</li>
            <li>and this is the only anti-perspirant that offers him protection without causing skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>The scent is barely noticeable once it dries.  </li>
            <li>At the same time, it keeps me dry very well.  </li>
            <li>My daughter thought it was old fashioned until I had her try it on one underarm, using her extra strength very pricey product on the other one.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly, taking no more time than the gel products.</li>
            <li>Perhaps other deodorants also would do the trick but, thanks to Amazon, I can stick to the one I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>This is a product I had used all of my adult life and was not happy this product was no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s been getting hard to find as the more popular and heavily fragranced items take over.  </li>
            <li>It can leave a little white residue on clothing, and doesn&#x27;t smell all perfumy but if you want a non-irritating product that really  works, this is the one to buy.</li>

            <li> I have used this product more years than I can remember and if it weren&#x27;t for Amazon, I would not be able to purchase it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Arrid XX Roll-On for most of my life.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this product in the stores any more.  </li>
            <li> I have used the roll on for years and the stores don&#x27;t handle it any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for many years and love it because it does not stain my clothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like when they stop making the bra you&#x27;ve been buying forever, or the only shampoo that makes your hair perfect.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to locate this in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because Arm &amp; Hammer has discontinued the UltraMax Rollon.&lt;br /&gt;Arrid is ok; but I still miss the UltraMax.</li>
            <li> It works well, and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found another source for it.  </li>
            <li> Product works very well and the price is great.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants/antiperspirants over the years.  </li>
            <li> I love roll on</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Most of the antiperspirants are using aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex.</li>
            <li> Could have more scents, my favorite is powder, but I don&#x27;t see it between the options.</li>
            <li> I was able to order the product on line.</li>
            <li> I have used this Deodorant for about 20 years and it works for me.  :)</li>
            <li> maybe I should order more before it disappears</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li> More people need to endorse this product so it doesn&#x27;t end up in the deodorant graveyard.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> I Have Used Arrid XX for Many Years</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for 30 years and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> awful!i had high hopes for this because of the great reviews</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Roll ons are hard to find in the store so it is great to be able to get them online at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Better get it here while still available.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Arrid liquid roll-on for decades, and after every store I know of dropped the roll-ons in favor of the &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; and sprays, I was happily surprised to find Amazon had it, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The product was deliverd on time &amp; everything worked fine.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> The mild fragrence is also appealing.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Amazon making Arrid XX available.</li>
            <li> Having used just about every type of deodorant, I&#x27;ve finally found one I can happily recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is such a great product.</li>
            <li> Protection seems to be good thus far.  </li>
            <li> The Arrid formula is an old one, but is the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, this item was received about four days early, which was great.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Once it dries, though, you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, only thing I can use.</li>
            <li> seems to be a good enough replacement</li>
            <li> The scent of the product is also quite mild, which I like very much since strong scents make me dizzy.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t sting and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> ..sure beats the super sticky gel</li>
            <li> I super like it!easy to</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, quick to dry and most importantly, it works.  </li>
            <li> will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Thanks to her advice and Amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li> Most effective deodorant and have never experienced a better underarm dryness.</li>
            <li> Only kind of Deodorant my husband will use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of the old Arm &amp; Hammer roll on and like many others have been in a state of despair since it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff,all that i expected.</li>
            <li> Glides on quickly and dries very fast.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is very soft and it&#x27;s true that it can fit for women or men.</li>
            <li> The best part of this product is that it leaves no white residue on your clothes like other deodorants that I have used in the past,before finding Arrid.</li>
            <li> This brand seems to work best for me, without white residue, without rashes or the other reactions I sometimes get, without perfume.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is a roll-on, I don&#x27;t use it if I need to get dressed right away.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using Ban Rollon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arrid XX original scent for decades and it never fails me, never leaves residue on my clothes, and with my super sensitive, allergy-prone skin, never causes my to itch or develop hives, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not stocked in the stores very much anymore.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old, and have been using since I was in High School, more than 40 years ago, and I still would recommend.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Thanks for stocking it online!</li>
            <li> i have tried many deodorants and this is the only wine that works for me.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd case purchased in as many years.  </li>
            <li> Thanks very much for making this available/</li>
            <li> bot this based on overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I started using this antiperspirant years ago, but it hasn&#x27;t been really easy to find recently.  </li>
            <li> MY wife was happy to get this; because it hard obtain where we live.</li>
            <li> The roll-on is very hard to find in stores, so it&#x27;s nice to have it available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Really have to work them to make the product work</li>
            <li> he is very picky.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for being there for us.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it leaves a cakey residue, so the liquid roll-on works very well with no residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and found it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> My brand was not on the shelf and Arrid XX was very inexpensive</li>
            <li> Yes, we had too much time on our hands that day before going to the gym.</li>
            <li> This works for my whole family.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for over 40 years, I like the Roll-On and really don&#x27;t want to change.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having it on line.</li>
            <li> It is a liquid and dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> The gel and solid versions of this product aren&#x27;t as effective and they are actually messier to use.  </li>
            <li> Arrid XX Roll-on works better than any other.  </li>
            <li> In fact, this formula seems to be pretty and only a couple swipes is more than enough to keep you stink free all day long.  </li>
            <li> Although I live in a large metropolitan area, I cannot find this product in any stores.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any other!</li>
            <li> So not only am I a  happy camper, my dad who has been without his favorite roll-on for years, now has his favorite roll-on thanks to Amazon and his Amazon obsessed daughter on a hunt to eliminate smelly pits!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for many years and all of a sudden it is not in any of our local grocery or drug stores, so I have no choice but to order online.  </li>
            <li> Can be kind of uncomfortable to apply until the roller ball gets moistened, though this can be somewhat avoided by giving it a light shake before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommened Arrid Roll-On.</li>
            <li> On line buying them by the dozen saves me gas, irritation, and is actually CHEAPER...the old guy wins again!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, most stores not carring it anymore &amp; both my wife &amp; I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The stores no longer seem to carry it, so as other have commented we bless Amazon&#x27;s heart for having it available.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to other deodorants that is why this one is so important to me.</li>
            <li> So, I searched on Amazon in an effort to try maybe a couple new deodorants and/or antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have to use Arrid Roll-on almost exclusively because it does not irritate my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is my new go to pit-juice.</li>
            <li> I only like this particular one -- not sticky and does the job!  </li>
            <li> Arrid XX keeps me dry and odor free all the live long day!</li>
            <li> After moving to the Minneapolis suburbs, it completely disappeared.    </li>
            <li> The cost of shipping wipes out the discounted price for the six-pack but at least it doesn&#x27;t cost me more to buy them on line than it used to at the store.</li>
            <li> Reliable like old faithful</li>
            <li> The local stores no longer handle it, thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant all my life (I&#x27;m 57 yrs old).</li>
            <li> Fragrance is a very subjective choice; as such every review has to be taken in with a pinch of salt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is the only deodorant I have found that really works all day.</li>
            <li> the ingredients and the % of aluminum oxide..read Alzheimer&#x27;s &#x3D;) are not exactly the same but close enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> So it was nice to order them in bulk quantity for the same (if not less) than I usually paid for them individually.</li>
            <li> Most of the stores have quit carrying this product, but it&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve used for the past 10-15 years.  </li>
            <li> Great product, hard to come by as the companies try to switch everyone to solids, which really don&#x27;t work and are extremely irritating.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It works, does not stain clothes, dries quickly and has little or no odor.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this product is no longer sold in any store in our area (Central New York).</li>
            <li> No other product even comes close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old and obviously have been using deodorant daily for a long time and this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a deodorant</li>
            <li> and this is the only anti-perspirant that offers him protection without causing skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> The scent is barely noticeable once it dries.  </li>
            <li> At the same time, it keeps me dry very well.  </li>
            <li> My daughter thought it was old fashioned until I had her try it on one underarm, using her extra strength very pricey product on the other one.</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly, taking no more time than the gel products.</li>
            <li> Perhaps other deodorants also would do the trick but, thanks to Amazon, I can stick to the one I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> This is a product I had used all of my adult life and was not happy this product was no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s been getting hard to find as the more popular and heavily fragranced items take over.  </li>
            <li> It can leave a little white residue on clothing, and doesn&#x27;t smell all perfumy but if you want a non-irritating product that really  works, this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> for some reason now a days it so hard to find this exact one.  </li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> Last long and does its jobs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other deodorant, I wish it could be accessible locally, but it&#x27;s very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m retired and active but not nearly as active as I was for years</li>
            <li> You cannot find it in the local stores for some reason unknown to me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I stocked up for the long run.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that you need to let it dry because it goes on wet.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts, goes on clear and just plain works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a non-sticky deodorant and it keeps dry a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands with the same active ingredient but for whatever reason the results are not the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I have a reaction to the aluminum zirconium and that it doesn&#x27;t work to keep me dry.  </li>
            <li> you allow time for your armpits to dry after application, this product should not discolor the armpits on your shirts like gel and paste style deodorants can.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.</li>
            <li> i have to let it dry before wearing my top?also</li>
            <li> This works for me, I only wish it had less fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the reason why I can use this product because it does not seem to have alcohol (or much), or at the very least it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> hs been hard to find in local stores recently.</li>
            <li> This is the only product available that does not cause underarm bumps or painful rashes.  </li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to find in stores --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding the foll-on Arrid XX Antiperspirant Deodorant harder and harder to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Not either wet or sticky</li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> This is getting incredibly harder to find.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll apply it and lay down on my bed with my arms up to give it a couple minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> use it in preference to all other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried other brands but they either don&#x27;t work as well or they give me a rash.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t like any other deodorant; this is the one we like to use.</li>
            <li> Very few stores would have only 6 in stock (compared to the other products), and I would have to buy them all.    </li>
            <li> My fave deodorant hands down.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a mark on my cloths and never lets me down.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had been previously using Ban</li>
            <li> Ordered online because this product is not easily available on the shelves anymore.  </li>
            <li> I do have trouble finding this in stores however and have resorted to ordering it on line which adds a shipping fee.</li>
            <li> to find, not usually available in stores?</li>
            <li> Has a strong unpleasant&#x27;ish smell which gets worse when it mixes with sweat..</li>
            <li> I was not able to find Arrid Roll-On at the stores, so my daughter said order it on line</li>
            <li> I was going from grocery store to grocery store buying all they had (usually about 2 or 3 a store) until I had my years supply.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the roll-on is so darn hard to find, though.  </li>
            <li> These are increasingly hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in store</li>
            <li> And hard to find in this area.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> Hard to find - Hubby uses all the time</li>
            <li> Never a problem or complaint.</li>
            <li> after my 2nd child I began having crazy pit sweats!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a product with aluminum chlorhydrate anymore.  </li>
            <li> He also said I would have a tough time finding it in stores also because he hadn&#x27;t seen it in a while.</li>
            <li> Doc said it&#x27;s very common</li>
            <li> but alas, I&#x27;m still searching.</li>
            <li> The product kicks the clinical stuffs heiney like seriously!</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the sloppy gels or the stick.  </li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to find in stores these days.  </li>
            <li> Also, I used Amazon.com because I was unable to find Arrid XX roll-on anywhere else.</li>
            <li> fail within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Been using for over 35 years and unable to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Not as bad as BO but a weird non-fresh smell at the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was getting depressing not seeing this on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> Wider tips are impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to find on retail store shelves.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product when I got it.</li>
            <li> If you want submissions dont set stupid rules</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and would hate it if it was ever discontinued.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> seems like seconds again&lt;br /&gt;The ball in the tube just doesn&#x27;t seem to rotate . Really have to work them to make the product work</li>
            <li> I used a lot of roll on deodorant and this is the best. The fragrance is very soft and it&#x27;s true that it can fit for women or men. It&#x27;s a non-sticky deodorant and it keeps dry a long time. I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to find in stores these days.  Better get it here while still available.  Works great.  Been using for years.</li>
            <li> my husband only likes this deodorant.  he is very picky.  for some reason now a days it so hard to find this exact one.  i had the idea to check amazon and they had it.  we bought a bulk pack and he is very happy.</li>
            <li> For years I have been looking for a deodorant that would last. I have tried the OTC clinical deodorants, they worked but the cost was up there and they didn&#x27;t last that long and the scent also bothered me. My dad told me back in the day he use to use Arrid XX Deodorant Roll-on and he use to love it. He also said I would have a tough time finding it in stores also because he hadn&#x27;t seen it in a while. So being the Amazon junkie that I am, one day I decided to look for it and bam, I stumbled acrossed it and immediately put in my order. I was so happy when my packaged arrived. For the cost of 3 clinical tubes of deodorant, I have 6 bottles of Arrid XX! The product kicks the clinical stuffs heiney like seriously! So not only am I a  happy camper, my dad who has been without his favorite roll-on for years, now has his favorite roll-on thanks to Amazon and his Amazon obsessed daughter on a hunt to eliminate smelly pits!!! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other deodorant, I wish it could be accessible locally, but it&#x27;s very hard to find.  This is why I must buy it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have used for 30 years -- I only like this particular one -- not sticky and does the job!  It is getting harder and harder to find in stores -- so I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001O8NV94 Arrid Xx Anti-perspirant &amp; Deodorant Roll-on Regular 2.5 Oz (Pack of 6)]]    Can no longer find this at any grocery or department stores in the Minnesota Twin Cities area, and my family loves this deodorant. It dries quickly and lasts all day! We are thrilled to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Always protector me!!</li>
            <li> For whatever reason this is the only deodorant that works well for my body.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s been getting hard to find as the more popular and heavily fragranced items take over.  Thankfully I can still get it on Amazon.. and in a 6 pack!</li>
            <li> Good price and quick ship.</li>
            <li> I have used this product more years than I can remember and if it weren&#x27;t for Amazon, I would not be able to purchase it anymore.  It works better than any other!</li>
            <li> product came quickly, new items, no mailing charge, win win!  diff to find this product on the market anymore so this was a surprize</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that my husband uses and only the roll on.  I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Arrid XX Roll-On for most of my life. Arrid controls the underarm odor exceedingly well. The best part of this product is that it leaves no white residue on your clothes like other deodorants that I have used in the past,before finding Arrid. I was not able to find Arrid Roll-On at the stores, so my daughter said order it on line and I did. Thanks to her advice and Amazon for making it available. I highly recommened Arrid Roll-On.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this product in the stores any more.  I have used the roll on for years and the stores don&#x27;t handle it any more.</li>
            <li> I had read some article about how to prevent the armpits on your shirts from turning yellow and some of the folks said to use a deodorant without aluminum. One of the commentors under the article said they used Arrid XX and that had taken care of their problem. So, I searched on Amazon in an effort to try maybe a couple new deodorants and/or antiperspirants. I figured Arrid would probably have aluminum but I could not find a list of ingredients in the description, and no one in any reviews listed the ingredients. So, here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE INGREDIENT&lt;br /&gt;Aluminum Chlorohydrate.....16%....Antiperspirant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INACTIVE INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;Water, Steareth-2, Steareth-21, Dimethicone, Allantoin, Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle says \\&quot;Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a roll-on, I don&#x27;t use it if I need to get dressed right away. I&#x27;ll apply it and lay down on my bed with my arms up to give it a couple minutes to dry. Once it dries, though, you&#x27;re golden! This definitely keeps me the driest of any antiperspirant/deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried! That alone I&#x27;m sure would prevent any yellowing if you have that problem. Otherwise, use Oxyclean when you wash your clothes and that will take care of your problem as well!</li>
            <li> Yes husband only uses this brand</li>
            <li> It was getting depressing not seeing this on store shelves.  I tried several others, but looked for Arrid XX roll-on in every grocery or drug store that I walked through.  After moving to the Minneapolis suburbs, it completely disappeared.    This brand seems to work best for me, without white residue, without rashes or the other reactions I sometimes get, without perfume.  The roll-on delivery method is my fave...it doesn&#x27;t stink up the room and waste product like spray, plus that whole ozone/aerosol link.    I hope that I can continue to buy six packs the next time I run out.  One at home, one at girlfriend&#x27;s house, one in gym.</li>
            <li> All our local stores no longer carry this product for some reason and it was all we use. Finding these on the web was a blessing. The amount and the price was very fair. Thanks for being there for us.</li>
            <li> First of all, this item was received about four days early, which was great. I suffer from heat rashes in the creases of my skin, like the inside of my elbow or the backs of my knees or my underarms. Arrid XX is the only product I have found that keeps me from sweating in those areas where it is applied and keeps the rashes away as well. No other product even comes close. Also, I used Amazon.com because I was unable to find Arrid XX roll-on anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Everything as promised</li>
            <li> AArrid XX is the perfect deodorant. Easy to apply, quick to dry and most importantly, it works.  I have been using it for years and would hate it if it was ever discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for many years and love it because it does not stain my clothing. You cannot find it in the local stores for some reason unknown to me. Thanks for stocking it online!</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Amazon making Arrid XX available. I almost cried when I couldn&#x27;t find it at any stores anymore. I tried something else, and it sucked. It&#x27;s like when they stop making the bra you&#x27;ve been buying forever, or the only shampoo that makes your hair perfect. Arrid XX keeps me dry and odor free all the live long day! So, yay! The price is great, they ship it fast, and happiness abounds, for me and those around me, as they are not subjected to any underarm unpleasantness due to the fact that I use the best deodorant ever! Arrid XX, I love you!!!</li>
            <li> I started using this antiperspirant years ago, but it hasn&#x27;t been really easy to find recently.  Very few stores would have only 6 in stock (compared to the other products), and I would have to buy them all.    Thankfully, Amazon carries this specific product and I can order it by the box.    I&#x27;ve always had issues with skin irritation whenever I use antiperspirants that are alcohol-based.  This is the reason why I can use this product because it does not seem to have alcohol (or much), or at the very least it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  At the same time, it keeps me dry very well.  I apply it once in the morning and no perspiration or odor for the rest of the day.  The scent of the product is also quite mild, which I like very much since strong scents make me dizzy.  I tried the Arid XX solid but sometimes it leaves a cakey residue, so the liquid roll-on works very well with no residue.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this product is no longer sold in any store in our area (Central New York). I&#x27;ve used it for years and found it works very well for me. Perhaps other deodorants also would do the trick but, thanks to Amazon, I can stick to the one I&#x27;ve been using. The cost of shipping wipes out the discounted price for the six-pack but at least it doesn&#x27;t cost me more to buy them on line than it used to at the store.</li>
            <li> Glides on quickly and dries very fast.  Scent is neither overbearing nor obnoxious.  Protection seems to be good thus far.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have tried many kind do antiperspirant and none work as well as this one for me! I cannot find this product in roll on form in the stores anymore and am thankful I can get it thru Amazon</li>
            <li> The Arrid formula is an old one, but is the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used. The stores here have not carried it for years and when I find some, I stock up.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to locate this in stores anymore. My husband has very sensitive skin and this is the only anti-perspirant that offers him protection without causing skin irritation.  We were so relieved to have found it...will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> Only gave it a &#x27;1&#x27; because &#x27;0&#x27; was not an option. I&#x27;m 71 years old and obviously have been using deodorant daily for a long time and this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a deodorant fail within 24 hours. I&#x27;m retired and active but not nearly as active as I was for years so there&#x27;s no reason it shouldn&#x27;t have been effective. My brand was not on the shelf and Arrid XX was very inexpensive so I though I&#x27;d give it a try. Threw it away after a week. I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this deodorant because I have used it for years.  This is the deodorant that I am not allergic to.  I am grateful!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because Arm &amp; Hammer has discontinued the UltraMax Rollon.&lt;br /&gt;Arrid is ok; but I still miss the UltraMax. Right now I&#x27;m using Ban Rollon, I think I&#x27;ll continue with it for now.&lt;br /&gt;I just posted in Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Facebook page asking why they discontinued the UltraMax Rollon!!</li>
            <li> These are increasingly hard to find in stores.  So it was nice to order them in bulk quantity for the same (if not less) than I usually paid for them individually.</li>
            <li> This is the still the best antiperspirant on the market. It dries fairly quickly, taking no more time than the gel products. It can leave a little white residue on clothing, and doesn&#x27;t smell all perfumy but if you want a non-irritating product that really  works, this is the one to buy. My daughter thought it was old fashioned until I had her try it on one underarm, using her extra strength very pricey product on the other one. Yes, we had too much time on our hands that day before going to the gym. Even though she didn&#x27;t want to admit it, Arrid XX kept her drier. Plus, she had been getting a rash after shaving and it stopped when she switched to Arrid XX.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, most stores not carring it anymore &amp; both my wife &amp; I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It works the best out of all the deodorants on the market. I&#x27;ve used it since I was a teenager. I have tried others over the years and none ever worked as well.</li>
            <li> The product was deliverd on time &amp; everything worked fine. MY wife was happy to get this; because it hard obtain where we live.</li>
            <li> It is great to be able to order these on amazon.com.  Although I live in a large metropolitan area, I cannot find this product in any stores.  I have used this product for a long time.  It works, does not stain clothes, dries quickly and has little or no odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding the foll-on Arrid XX Antiperspirant Deodorant harder and harder to find in the stores. Is my preferred deodorant choice. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not stocked in the stores very much anymore. It&#x27;s nice to know you can still order it on-line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arrid XX original scent for decades and it never fails me, never leaves residue on my clothes, and with my super sensitive, allergy-prone skin, never causes my to itch or develop hives, etc. Great product, hard to come by as the companies try to switch everyone to solids, which really don&#x27;t work and are extremely irritating. Just give me my Arrid XX roll-on! Yeah for simplicity.</li>
            <li> Most of the stores have quit carrying this product, but it&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve used for the past 10-15 years.  It works well, and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found another source for it.  Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> everything as advertised</li>
            <li> Ordered online because this product is not easily available on the shelves anymore.  Excellent product have used it for years.  Roll-On XX is the best of the deodorants on the market, and the best of Arrid products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Arrid liquid roll-on for decades, and after every store I know of dropped the roll-ons in favor of the &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; and sprays, I was happily surprised to find Amazon had it, and at a great price. Sticks just feel too...well....sticky, and the sprays go all over the place.</li>
            <li> Reliable like old faithful</li>
            <li> This is the only product available that does not cause underarm bumps or painful rashes.  On- line is the place I can find it. Cannot stand the sloppy gels or the stick.  This works for my whole family.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for over 40 years, I like the Roll-On and really don&#x27;t want to change. I was going from grocery store to grocery store buying all they had (usually about 2 or 3 a store) until I had my years supply. On line buying them by the dozen saves me gas, irritation, and is actually CHEAPER...the old guy wins again!</li>
            <li> use it in preference to all other brands. Not either wet or sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word word word word word word word . If you want submissions dont set stupid rules</li>
            <li> Product works very well and the price is great.  Roll ons are hard to find in the store so it is great to be able to get them online at a great price.  The product is very good at keeping perspiration away.</li>
            <li> Only kind of Deodorant my husband will use.</li>
            <li> have used it all my life.  doesn&#x27;t sting and dries quickly.  hs been hard to find in local stores recently.</li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants/antiperspirants over the years.  Arrid XX Roll-on works better than any other.  The roll-on is very hard to find in stores, so it&#x27;s nice to have it available from Amazon.  The service is always good.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had been previously using Ban but my body seemed to get used to it and it didn&#x27;t work anymore. I love roll on so I decided to try this and I&#x27;m glad I did. My biggest problem is sweat and this deodorant works wonderfully. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a product with aluminum chlorhydrate anymore.  Most of the antiperspirants are using aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex. I&#x27;ve found that I have a reaction to the aluminum zirconium and that it doesn&#x27;t work to keep me dry.  I tried several different manufacturers and the result was always the same.  So I searched around and finally found Arid XX roll on.  It works perfectly for me. The scent is barely noticeable once it dries.  A bottle tends to last me several months.  That said, I&#x27;m still stocking up in case they discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Product met my expectations and arrived on time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not the first time I bought this...which should tell you something about whether I like it lOL.</li>
            <li> Really good. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Could have more scents, my favorite is powder, but I don&#x27;t see it between the options.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great price for the products!! I cannot find this Roll-on anywhere locally so, I now buy them here!!</li>
            <li> Only product I know that works well and doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> on time delivery, and was what I was looking for..</li>
            <li> Best antiperspirant.  Great delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product over 50 years.  The local stores no longer handle it, thanks to Amazon I was able to order the product on line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.  The stores no longer seem to carry it, so as other have commented we bless Amazon&#x27;s heart for having it available.  My fave deodorant hands down.</li>
            <li> This is a product I had used all of my adult life and was not happy this product was no longer available in stores.As a whim I looked on amazon and there it was I got six bottles I will not be without it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for many years and all of a sudden it is not in any of our local grocery or drug stores, so I have no choice but to order online.  I do not want to quit using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this Deodorant for about 20 years and it works for me.  :)</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 30 years -- continues to be excellent!</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for years.  It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing and works well.  I can no longer buy it at the drug store so it&#x27;s wonderful to be able to buy it on line.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i order this item. It last quite awhile since we are three that use it. Last long and does its jobs. Hard to find in store so have just stuck to ordering it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This works for me, I only wish it had less fragrance. I split the 6-pack with a friend who also uses it.</li>
            <li> Been using for over 35 years and unable to find in stores.  Most effective deodorant and have never experienced a better underarm dryness.</li>
            <li> Having used just about every type of deodorant, I&#x27;ve finally found one I can happily recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you allow time for your armpits to dry after application, this product should not discolor the armpits on your shirts like gel and paste style deodorants can.  Can be kind of uncomfortable to apply until the roller ball gets moistened, though this can be somewhat avoided by giving it a light shake before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Docked one star for not offering an &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; option.</li>
            <li> i have tried many deodorants and this is the only wine that works for me. It doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts, goes on clear and just plain works. Only drawback is that you need to let it dry because it goes on wet.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> Good stuff, only thing I can use.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do! No complaints.</li>
            <li> this is such a great product. You cannot find it in any stores and was so happy to find it online at Amazon. Ordered 6 to have a backup supply and am thinking..maybe I should order more before it disappears forever,..sure beats the super sticky gel they have replaced it with.</li>
            <li> I suggest the roll-on for women and the spray for men. The only thing we use in our house. This is getting incredibly harder to find. ARRID, please! you must keep this on the shelves! I beg you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 30 years.  It&#x27;s effective and has never stained my clothes.  The gel and solid versions of this product aren&#x27;t as effective and they are actually messier to use.  I&#x27;ve also tried other brands but they either don&#x27;t work as well or they give me a rash.  This product is no longer carried at most popular retail stores and pharmacies anymore, so I was very glad to found out that Amazon still carries it.  More people need to endorse this product so it doesn&#x27;t end up in the deodorant graveyard.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t like any other deodorant; this is the one we like to use. Thank you for your sending&lt;br /&gt;it to us.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant all my life (I&#x27;m 57 yrs old). Does not leave a mark on my cloths and never lets me down.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant I will use. I wish you could still get it in the grocery or drug stores. I have tried other brands with the same active ingredient but for whatever reason the results are not the same. Keeps me dry and doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.</li>
            <li> Excellent value.  I received it very quickly.  Not sure why the roll-on is so darn hard to find, though.  This is my 3rd case purchased in as many years.  Never a problem or complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of the old Arm &amp; Hammer roll on and like many others have been in a state of despair since it has been discontinued.  This Arrid roll on seems to be a good enough replacement and I believe it may even be the same or similar formula.  The manufacturer of both the A&amp;H and this Arrid are the same people and they&#x27;re both made in Canada...eh!  the ingredients and the % of aluminum oxide..read Alzheimer&#x27;s &#x3D;) are not exactly the same but close enough to do the job.  In fact, this formula seems to be pretty and only a couple swipes is more than enough to keep you stink free all day long.  So far, this is my new go to pit-juice.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is a very subjective choice; as such every review has to be taken in with a pinch of salt.&lt;br /&gt;I bot this based on overwhelmingly positive reviews. I was disappointed with the product when I got it. Has a strong unpleasant&#x27;ish smell which gets worse when it mixes with sweat.. Not as bad as BO but a weird non-fresh smell at the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning it.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for many, many years.  I like this container because the ball-tip is smaller and fits into my bonier armpit.  Wider tips are impossible to use.  I do have trouble finding this in stores however and have resorted to ordering it on line which adds a shipping fee.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It dries fast and it lasts for a long time.  Easy to put on as roll on are the best.</li>
            <li> No perfume smell, spray type has perfume.&lt;br /&gt;No allergic reaction&lt;br /&gt;Convienient.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find, not usually available in stores?</li>
            <li> I am allergic to other deodorants that is why this one is so important to me.Thanks for having it on line.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and great service by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for!</li>
            <li> Best price I could find.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, the roll-on style is to find in the stores; I&#x27;ve checked them all.  I&#x27;ve purchased our deodorant online for several years.</li>
            <li> I super like it!easy to use.do i have to let it dry before wearing my top?also,I like the scent cause it is so since I&#x27;m allergic to perfumes.</li>
            <li> I Have Used Arrid XX for Many Years and It Is the Best.  I am 54 years old, and have been using since I was in High School, more than 40 years ago, and I still would recommend.</li>
            <li> One of the best products i ever bought</li>
            <li> I have to use Arrid Roll-on almost exclusively because it does not irritate my very sensitive skin.  The mild fragrence is also appealing.</li>
            <li> For some reason here in Sacramento I cannot find this item. It is a liquid and dries extremely fast. It is the only deodorant I have found that really works all day.</li>
            <li> Good stuff,all that i expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! And hard to find in this area.  Nicely packaged too.  Thanks very much for making this available/</li>
            <li> Impossible to find on retail store shelves. My favorite. I stocked up for the long run.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a very timely manner. It is exactly as I expected it to be. Very good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for 30 years and LOVE it.  Hard to find so I grab it when I see it.  Leaves no marks on your clothing and does the job it was made for.</li>
            <li> Bagal alwayz smell frash wid dis.</li>
            <li> Hard to find - Hubby uses all the time</li>
            <li> Works great for the kids.</li>
            <li> after my 2nd child I began having crazy pit sweats! Doc said it&#x27;s very common but I&#x27;ve tried everything and no matter what I use I french the pits of my shirts. It&#x27;s awful!i had high hopes for this because of the great reviews but alas, I&#x27;m still searching.</li>
            <li> Men - Women - Every BODY can us it.  Very effective and at a very good price.</li>
