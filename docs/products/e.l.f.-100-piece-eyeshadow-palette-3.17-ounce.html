            <li>I really liked this!</li>
            <li>I will be honest and say that you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>It was awesome, so many colors to choose from and play with.</li>
            <li>they are awesome :)</li>
            <li>Love the colors and everything was perfect when I got it.</li>
            <li>It Is perfect for those who experiment with many colors.</li>
            <li>Not a horrible purchase, but not the best either.</li>
            <li>Good product, great price.</li>
            <li>The shipment came in good time and in great condition.</li>
            <li>Very good product love it</li>
            <li>The colors don&#x27;t show up as bright as i had hoped.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have all those bright pinks in it.  </li>
            <li>But a good buy.</li>
            <li>For the price, the quality is surprisingly good.</li>
            <li>Really good quality for the price</li>
            <li>With a good primer these shadows can do the job.</li>
            <li>I loved the bright colors and opened it as soon as I got home.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>however, still a good product for the occassional makeup wearer as myself.</li>
            <li>Really good.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium (touch of Olive to tan depending on whether or not I&#x27;m tan or if it&#x27;s summer), and these colors are perfect for those tones.</li>
            <li>This is the cheapest good makeup I have ever seen, I would suggest it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of E.L.F. products and I kept hearing good things about this, so I thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>but good</li>
            <li>i loved all the colors and would recommend this product to friends and family, and i will order this again.</li>
            <li>This might be a good item to buy in a store; but it does not survive shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise a wise pallet purchase.</li>
            <li>Get a good primer</li>
            <li>my sister said some of the colors were good but</li>
            <li>; good purchase</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m still putting it to good use..</li>
            <li>Good product, good price.</li>
            <li>The quality of this eyeshadow is good.</li>
            <li>But 99 out of 100 is still good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size, about the sheet of a piece of paper maybe.</li>
            <li>i loved this.</li>
            <li>good colors</li>
            <li>I have the coastal scent palette and this is just as good.</li>
            <li>Looks like a good combination of colors.  </li>
            <li>great skin tone scale as well as gray scale, which was a nice surprise</li>
            <li>so she loved it</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and</li>
            <li>since  bought it and its still good</li>
            <li>I did my utmost best to clean up using a makeup application brush along with cotton balls and alcohol.</li>
            <li>I still cannot get over how good they are and how many beautiful colors there are.</li>
            <li>and you can create so many beautiful looks.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 sets....was very pleased to see it was in good shape....</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, the colors are beautiful!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of e.l.f. products for their great value.</li>
            <li>I picked this up because I was looking for a cheap palette with really bright colors just for fun, and I&#x27;d looked here on Amazon but found this the best deal.</li>
            <li>Lots of variety and an amazing price.</li>
            <li>this palette was okay for them since the colors weren&#x27;t so bright.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product with huge assortment of colors to choose from</li>
            <li>There are a million gorgeous colors but more importantly, the consistency is great.</li>
            <li>and I also liked the color choices they had.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow set is great for what its worth but in order for it to look really good</li>
            <li>I am amusing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>A lot of my friends have been using Elf products and really liked the quality of it.  </li>
            <li>and I was kind of creeped out about buying no brand name eyeshadow over the internet.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my daughter, she liked them</li>
            <li>Nice quality of eyeshadow and lots of colors to play around with.  </li>
            <li>Is in a nice case for keeping.  </li>
            <li>Nice pallette.  </li>
            <li>I gave up after just a couple weeks and have ordered the Coastal Scents warm.  </li>
            <li>Colors are nice.  </li>
            <li>The colors are a mixture of matte and shimmery which is nice.</li>
            <li>I LOVE ELF GOOD QUALITY PRODUCTS AND AFORDABLE</li>
            <li>Nice sized pallot.  </li>
            <li>The shadows are very nice, I like the colours very much and the price is good for what you recieve.</li>
            <li>This palette is great, I love the shimmer and the flat colors perfect for work to date night.</li>
            <li>I do still love it though i wish that there were more bright colors than neutrals.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure you have really good brushes so you will be able to apply the eyeshadow fully onto your eye.</li>
            <li>It stays on good, and doesn&#x27;t rub off too easy.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and use top name brand for my customers, I really love ELF its inexpensive and a delivers a good product.</li>
            <li>It looseness from the palette very easily</li>
            <li>I am so enjoying this palette, the colors aren&#x27;t highly pigmented but it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>Aww well guess you cant win all the time.</li>
            <li>together, It&#x27;s a good cheap buy, but it takes awhile to get color payoff.</li>
            <li>But it is nice to be able to find it on here in case you can&#x27;t get out and have to order online.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors perform nicely, but most don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>honestly this palette is my favorite</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s so many colors to choose from, the browns and purples look really nice with</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I think it would be best to use this kit to save money experimenting with some new looks, before buying something better in the colors you like.</li>
            <li>I found a really great and informative review on you tube (...) which made me purchase it right away.</li>
            <li>The shadow went on smoothly and cleanly and looked beautiful.</li>

            <li>My favorite part is that some of the colors are matte and some are shimmery.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeshadow kit</li>
            <li>this item was for me because i love to match my eye shadow with my clothes and how the colors just set my clothes off</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Has many colors...</li>
            <li>So many colors for the price.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for going out and try a complementary color to my outfit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my eye makeup in my life, let alone one week.</li>
            <li>And of course your drug store brands(physicians formula, Revlon,  maybellene, etc) have better shimmer as well.</li>
            <li>and I love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li>I got what I paid for, for sure.</li>
            <li>Love all of the colors</li>
            <li>and she loved it, great price for 100 different colors!</li>
            <li>however the top could have been made better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this almost 3 years ago and still have tons more to use</li>
            <li>so if i were you i would spend a couple more bucks and go to bh cosmetics and get there 88 palette</li>
            <li>Maybe there is some product which does not have so many colours.</li>
            <li>Autumnish colors are more ky style anyway.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and i just love it</li>
            <li>I had heard of ELF and thought it would be an okay brand to purchase</li>
            <li>Most of the colors have lots of glitter in it, not the matt feeling</li>
            <li>The packaging was Perfect, they put the 6 different elf items I ordered together in a box</li>
            <li>I use my elf primer before applying the eye shadow which makes it look 10 times better.</li>
            <li>so I was glad when I opened the box to see everything was intact.</li>
            <li>even the next day at the diner was told my eye makeup still looks perfect!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I recieved an excellent customer service and would definitely buy something from them again.</li>
            <li>I have already contact them suggesting more protection when packaging this product.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>My point is if you don&#x27;t use a primer for this product,most likely it won&#x27;t work out for you. :D</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve really gotten some great use from this eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have too many shadows in it with a bunch of sparklies in it, and that it hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyelids or my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love E.L.F products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Probably a bit overwhelming</li>
            <li>So many colors , so many many colors.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have chose a better eyeliner palette</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>The colors were more irradescent then i would like.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for probably a lot longer than you&#x27;re supposed to keep makeup around, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will order more of these  palettes 😊</li>
            <li>love the product</li>
            <li>Hope u guys can think of an innovative ideas abt this issues..</li>
            <li>EVEN better is there are some that repeat twice</li>
            <li>I especially love the different highlight colors.</li>
            <li>But, I love this palette.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>just think they need to ship in better packaging.</li>
            <li>the colors are WAY bolder in person than advertised i love its bin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tend to use the eyeshadow applicants that most sets come with, so I put those aside.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>many, many looks from this palette.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The colors are really pretty when you put them on!!!</li>
            <li>Very rich and textured.</li>
            <li>and Happy New Year!</li>
            <li>Lots of great quality colors for a really decent price.</li>
            <li>great experience, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors don&#x27;t have great pigmentation, but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it, and most of the shadows are just fine.  </li>
            <li>ELF IS AN AMAZING BRAND YOUTUBE IS FULL OF TUTORIALS</li>
            <li>Pretty good value.</li>
            <li>This palette no only is in a beautiful selection, but it was also very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so many palettes, this is not something you can easily travel with</li>
            <li>Came the same as it looks in the picture, and most of the eyeshadows are incredibly pigmented.</li>
            <li>If you look at the review on you tube you can get a more elaborate and detailed look of this product (...).</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented, make sure you use a good primer before.</li>
            <li>Most of the browns are fine, along with the goldens.</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s a good buy; I like having a large palette, and it fits my day to day needs.</li>
            <li>The only problem with it is that the eyeshadow isn&#x27;t very good quality</li>
            <li>In light, you can see the reflective speckles, but after application, the powder comes off looking more satin like than shimmery, so if you&#x27;re a fan of pearl/satin textured shadows, this one&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li>Instead of carrying aroung a bunch of mini eyeshadows or different sets, you have every color of the rainbow, AND MORE  love it wouod recomend it to ANYONE great birthday presant also(;</li>
            <li>The colors work fabulously some more than others.  </li>
            <li>For a more detailed review watch this video:</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad purchase for the money, but not an awesome one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this is not the best quality eyeshadow out there, it is certainly not bottom of the barrel either.</li>
            <li>Got it way before it was due to arrive looks just like the picture and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>, I think it looks cool!).</li>
            <li>The blend mixes were easy too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>although it came very quick...</li>
            <li>and I ordered it 2 days ago, so the service was very quick.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I wouldve easily given 5 stars.</li>
            <li>To be honest,this eyeshadow is have to put and easy to fade.</li>
            <li>I got the case in perfect condition, and sampled some of the colors immediately and was shocked with the great quality!  </li>
            <li>Even with a primer, a good number of these colors lack decent pigmentation.</li>
            <li>The quality of the eyeshadows themselves is pretty good in that they are lighter but mostly true to what they look like in the case.</li>
            <li>but overall loved it honestly</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this palette for anyone, whether you like bright colors or not.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s even a good matte brown I will sometimes use in this palette for my brows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use any of these eyeshadows without applying eye primer, and I highly recommend using a makeup brush when applying.</li>
            <li>own 12 palettes, now including this one, from a variety of brands (some of them high-end like MAC, Tarte, Too Faced and BH), and I very much like this palette.</li>
            <li>otherwise good and arrived pretty quickly</li>
            <li>but if your the type that likes to make it look more natural and calm than this is great for you.</li>
            <li>A nice start-up brand when you are first experimenting with makeup.</li>
            <li>liked the mirror on the inside ;].&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only are the colors are beautiful</li>
            <li>While some of the colors are dull, some of them are BEAUTIFUL and bright and they all stay on all night.</li>
            <li>e.l.f had done me ok in the past, but the quality of the shadow in this set is marginal at best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>great colors, looks cute, stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>I would say they all are wearable colors and they offer a huge variety of options for creating looks.     </li>
            <li>outer 2 rows and the upper wells of the middle 4 rows are great for highlight colors, or even if you&#x27;re just looking for light coverage, while the bottom of the palette is good for the details, more accented looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The eye shadow goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>If you would like getting brand name make-up and products free check out the link below:https://www.listia.com</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I used my finger to swatch a color on my arm and immediately noticed how smooth and pigmented it was, even with my finger instead of a brush and without eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase for what its worth</li>
            <li>Compared to the price on the site and the price i got for it was cheap.</li>
            <li>My Niece love matching her eye shadow to her cloths and this product lets you have fun.</li>
            <li>There was powder EVERYWHERE and some of the really light colors still have remnants of this shattered gray in it.  </li>
            <li>I find if I take my cheapo pallets and use the lightest shimmer color I have and lightly sweep over what I used out of my e.l.f. pallet</li>
            <li>it would be for someone whose looking for more of a natural look, but i&#x27;m sure the purchase is for those who prefer that over a more smokey eye.. or a darker color blend.</li>
            <li>The price made it attractive, since I could get all of this for the same price as I could a set of JUST pinks.</li>
            <li>This plate is so cheap that you cannot even complain about its quality.</li>
            <li>But it is cheap, so just take it.</li>
            <li>i swore i would never bother with cheap eyeshadow again.</li>
            <li>you can really do amazing effects on your eyes with this, every girl should have this to get ready.</li>
            <li>A great way to try different colors without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li>They feel cheap and lack depth.</li>
            <li>They are smooth and stay on well.</li>
            <li>the product arrived in good condition and complete.</li>
            <li>The pigment is good, but soft, so if you want a lit of pigment you will have to put a lot on the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great variety of eye shadows for a great price, but you&#x27;ll probably never use half of them, and the shadows themselves don&#x27;t stick to my eyelids very well, usually requiring 2-4 applications for best results.</li>
            <li>This would also make a fantastic gift for just about any woman (younger or um...not so young, like me :) who enjoys using eyeshadow, because the variety of shades go from nice and natural/earthy to bright and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So elf products are sorta sketchy sometimes because with my experience with them they sort of just wipe off pretty easily, I love the cheap prices on their makeup though</li>
            <li>However, colors looked nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li>love elf always have, pretty cheap online</li>
            <li>Nice, vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re my new favorite brand!</li>
            <li>bright colors,really nice, soft, bought it for my daughter she loves it, will definatly purchase more in the future for friends and family</li>
            <li>There are a great blend of colors, I just wish they were more pigmented so that it pops on black skin.</li>
            <li>E.l.f. products have never disappointed me, and this palette was no exception.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth $10 in my opinion!</li>
            <li>i originally bought this because it had all the colours i wanted.</li>
            <li>When i first saw it on e.l.f&#x27;s website, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>She was really happy to get it... loves the colors she wants me to find more like it just different colors</li>
            <li>If this is purchased  for anyone under 20  who doesnt know the difference than more than likely they will love it!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are decent, but for $10 it&#x27;s a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to clean up when you receive your eyeshadows.     </li>
            <li>I wish there was more of a variety of bolder colors now that I&#x27;m straying from more natural tones</li>
            <li>I normally use MAC eyeshadows but wanted some fun &amp; funky colors for New Year&#x27;s and the quality was so good that after I applied it I wouldn&#x27;t have known it wasn&#x27;t MAC!  </li>
            <li>This eyeshadow palette includes many great colors that a very flattering on my fair complexing, without being too overpowering and making me look like a clown, which is very hard to find.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally get super funky with my eye shadow but when I do, like around Halloween, I need some kind of pallet for all of the colors.  </li>
            <li>i had to order new / different kind because this one the colors wasnt as bright on as they were in the kit.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great about the situation and sent me a free replacement without returning the other.</li>
            <li>I use this pallet for colorful looks and it works fine.</li>
            <li>My niece was super excited about it.</li>
            <li>While some of the eyeshadows are bright when you first apply, without eye primer, many do not stay on the skin for long.</li>
            <li>Bright colors and they last all day with a primer.</li>
            <li>Good variety of colors especially for the price.</li>
            <li>and have found only good things.</li>
            <li>I do have to use a base/primer to wear it so that the color can be true.</li>
            <li>I use it almost daily (with a good eyeshadow primer).</li>
            <li>Some of the colors broke up but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good makeup for someone just starting to experiment.</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>Product quality is good and would return to buy the product in a future.</li>
            <li>and the whole top snapped off.</li>
            <li>The shipper really needs to package this better though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the colors on that are more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>For $10 though it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It has a great variety of colors and, despite what other reviewers have said, I think it has plenty of pigment to it.  </li>
            <li>my wife was very excited with this eyeshadow palette until she realized that some colores were completely destroyed, I guess this was caused during packing or transport, but amazon or courier should take more care on packing this kind of items properly to avoid these inconveniences.</li>
            <li>I did use my usual MAC eyeshadow primer so that might have made it better but even just testing the colors on my hand they went on bright and smooth.  </li>
            <li>the selection of colors is very good, versatile, i dont need another pallette when i have this one handy, but the color are so faint</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t stay vibrant all day, which works for me, but i heard using eye primer makes it even better.</li>
            <li>Luckily, mine didn&#x27;t have any damage.</li>
            <li>Luckily my eyeshadows were still intact.</li>
            <li>and while I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t have the vibrant ability like</li>
            <li>Luckily I came across the e.l.f. brand, which I&#x27;ve known and used before</li>
            <li>I will most probably buy more e.l.f. products from amazon in the future</li>
            <li>Luckily it didn&#x27;t smash and get everywhere</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is a good deal and fun for experimenting with some different colored shadows on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a good amount of shadow for the price, worth buying for younger girls.</li>
            <li>Luckily its just for my daughter make up playtime.....</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Also the colours look the same in person as they do online simply stunning and elegant colours.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using some type of eye primer to make the colors stand out even more.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this palette so much!</li>
            <li>the colors that didnt get messed up are very pretty.</li>
            <li>likes the soft, warm and more natural look, this palette is for you!&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
            <li>Lots of very pretty colors.</li>
            <li>I used the palette today to create a brightish green smoky eye and they went on beautifully with zero fallout, even the sparkly ones, and lasted all day without creasing (with an eyeshadow primer).</li>
            <li>The colors look so good and they stay on long.</li>
            <li>All the colors were intact, the mirror was secure and it&#x27;s been able to take a bit of wear and tear from my general clumsiness.</li>
            <li>There are many variation of this product, but this one seemed like the best value out of all since it contained more colors compared to other five dollar ones that had only one third of these colors.</li>
            <li>I know the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t always the most vivid, but primer does help with that.</li>
            <li>, i have to aply many coats of color to make it look vivid.</li>
            <li>, they go from natural looking colors to more bold colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really into anything too bright and bold and based on the review</li>
            <li>The colors are great and they stay on well with little fallout.  </li>
            <li>The colors in this palette are very pretty, but if you are not using the right brushes or eye shadow primer (I use concealer), it will not show on your lids.</li>
            <li>Overall amazing quality</li>
            <li>so i have a lot of fun deciding which color to use that night.</li>
            <li>These shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented and you have to rub them in a lot and apply several coats to get a good shade</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find none of the eyeshadow broken when I recieved this item.  </li>
            <li>It is also fun to mix up the colors as well.</li>
            <li>Fun to play with, lots of colors.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the one I go straight for on a daily basis, for my work look, and it&#x27;s much more attractive looking in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m getting my moneys worth</li>
            <li>At $0.10 a shade, these aren&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in perfect condition and earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>The product is good overall, eyeshadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>This is really nice eye shadow for the low price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used E.L.F. brand before; I buy most of my makeup from the higher-end brands at Sephora (I&#x27;m not a snob, I just find that I get what I pay for with most makeup) and am an extreme makeup junkie, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much given how cheap it was.     </li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product because of the low price and how many colors I was getting.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>Amazon gave me a quick solution to the problem and refund my money, so I am not angry nor dissapointed at them.</li>
            <li>As long as you do that, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of colors to experiment.</li>
            <li>It is a all right Eyeshadow Palette</li>
            <li>The colors blend well together with the right brushes if you want to achieve that MAC look.</li>
            <li>Price was definitely right on this one.</li>
            <li>But, colors fade easily, are not vibrant, and the makeup itself is more powdery.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well and clean.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>I just need to reapply certain colors a couple times to give off the true color.</li>
            <li>Eye shadows are bright and vibrant ( the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice) and there is a variety of different colors (100 to be exact).</li>
            <li>I find that the El cheapo pallets from the dollar general have better shimmer than this.</li>
            <li>Long lasting color for a good price!</li>
            <li>i got this for my younger sister as a birthday present thinking it would be good since it&#x27;s e.l.f. brand and most of their products are decent for the price.</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t all super vibrant, but I don&#x27;t go for very colorful looks much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shadow wells are good sized, especially compared to some ofthe other brands of palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primer is a must, though most makeup fiends probably don&#x27;t dare apply shadow without some sort of primer anyway.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as all the other eyeshadow I have ever used, better than some actually.</li>
            <li>I know it was a cheap product, but the condition for it being new was unacceptable.</li>
            <li>The more neutral shades seem to have a different consistency, while the bright colors stick quickly, the neutrals tend to need a few layers before they&#x27;re truly visible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;again SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>The colors have great pigmentation on my skin tone although I am very pale.</li>
            <li>Some look a little different than you would expect from looking at it on the palette (the gold is more of a shiny orange on me - but that was a pleasant surprise</li>
            <li>I love shopping on Amazon, so when I saw my favorite brand E.L.F. products and was amazed at the price, however I was very dissatisfied with the delivery of the palette as 5 colors were completely crushed which really makes me upset since I can&#x27;t return the palette because I need those colors for my outfits this weekend.</li>
            <li>, I was able to actually apply the makeup, and it was very smooth and very solid in color.</li>
            <li>Because these colors aren&#x27;t as highly pigmented as say, MAC, they don&#x27;t last as long without primer and apply lighter, but this IS a $10 palette, so don&#x27;t expect MAC quality (though I do love this palette, more than the ultra vibrant MAC/BH palettes, but I&#x27;m more of a subtle-color girl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>a beginner in the world of makeup, and only being able to use my fingers (because I didn&#x27;t get my brushes in time for the event)</li>
            <li>Colors are not as pretty, frosty as I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>You definitely cant beat it for the price :)</li>
            <li>I hope my niece likes it just as much!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this on many different occasions.</li>
            <li>The colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li>When you first see it 100 colors for $10.00 who wouldnt buy it.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this brand.</li>
            <li>I was exactly what i ordered.  </li>
            <li>I bought this palette because I needed one with a wide range of colors, and I really liked the pinks (what I was looking for)</li>
            <li>There are palettes with better pigmentation in a similar price range.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;pay off\\&quot; or pigment is not deeply infused, so if you want to get the full color effect, you would need to lightly dampen with water on your eyeshadow applicator for it to appear richer.</li>
            <li>I love it, use it daily</li>
            <li>The shades are pretty on my skin.</li>
            <li>Will by more in the future....</li>
            <li>First of all I was expecting the package to arrive by September 27th or so, and I got it today</li>
            <li>With this set, you get most of your desired colors, for only $10.</li>
            <li>If you use brushes or sponge type applicators you&#x27;ll probably waste a good bit.</li>
            <li>The colors I have tried are all very vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>A couple of the darker cells broke and when i opened it shadow was everywhere, the lighter colors were covered in gray shadow, and the whole top was just gross.</li>
            <li>but i am a soft honey so that may be why then again it is elf but its still one nice pallate for only 10bucks</li>
            <li>Overall, this set was a good set to have instead of buying tons of various colors.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to get this palette; it was cheap and had a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Of course, not every one is just what I would ordinarily use, but this set is a great way to make new discoveries.</li>
            <li>overall, i&#x27;m still extremely pleased, for what you pay, you really get a lot of decent shadows!</li>
            <li>Some shadows, the matte I believe, aren&#x27;t very pigmented and pretty chalky.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette, and I can&#x27;t complain much!</li>
            <li>Colors stay all day long, Every color in here is my favorite.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d like to have some fun with new eyeshadow colors, this collection is one to choose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to note that this palette must be handled gently, because the eyeshadows to tend to break if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>so if you need touch-ups, you&#x27;ll be lugging around this large thing</li>
            <li>A large variety of colors</li>
            <li>You have to pay for shipping though unless you spend a certain amount ($25 or $35 depending).</li>
            <li>However, shipping made chunks of certain colors fall out of their palette and crumble all over the rest of the colors.</li>
            <li>Alright, well I gave this item 5 stars, though I did find one minor discrepancy: My friend bought the E.L.F. palette from Target during a promotional sale they held, and I loved it so much that I simply had to buy it.</li>
            <li>I think the pigment is just fine for my liking so overall</li>
            <li>There are enough colors here (and the shadows are good enough quality) for you to try out some new looks and see what you like, but they don&#x27;t hold up very well.</li>
            <li>This was an amazing deal and after reading some reviews I was a little weary</li>
            <li>First off, for the price, I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants a variety of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty dramatic when placed over an eye primer and it was a great buy for such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>This pack has a great color selection and will last for a few years.</li>
            <li>I really like this pallette.</li>
            <li>The shadow colors when applied on skin looked much lighter than when I saw them on the palette.</li>
            <li>thanks though</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain all that much.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I really like the variety of colors they have</li>
            <li>This will take time because in order for the colors to really come out</li>
            <li>this might not be for you, well it could work but it will take really longtime to do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for well over a year now, and I&#x27;d say 1/3 stay on really well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s a wide variety of matte-shimmery-glittery.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are very varied and dimensional.</li>
            <li>and it shipped so fast.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much use I get out of this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-it&#x27;s is very powdery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-there are shimmer and mattes in this pallet but the shimmer ones done have much shimmer to them.</li>
            <li>Two, the eyeshadow is very powdery.</li>
            <li>but i dont put much on</li>
            <li>Some people really like or really dislike.  </li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t really try it yet.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>So much eyeshadow that I dont know what to do with myself.</li>
            <li>It was packaged perfectly, not a broken shadow in the set.</li>
            <li>and it stays on very well.</li>
            <li>I thought for the price it wouldn&#x27;t be very opaque and it would wear off fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette and the sleek feel of it.</li>
            <li>Except, the actual eyeshadow was not as pigmented as I thought it would be and goes on somewhat light.</li>
            <li>When I got it in the mail and opened it up it was used and really dusty.look at the picture I took of it</li>
            <li>It was boxed very well.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My daughter got these for herself and she absolutely loves them too</li>
            <li>The powders don&#x27;t really stay that well on my eyes, even when I use a primer.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>so that makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>There are tons of awesome colors in this palette, however mine came with the case cracked and several of the colors had broken and powder was everywhere.</li>
            <li>For example, one of the golds is kind of weird, but I love how the silver and some of the pinks work.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this 4 stars is due to the blending capabilities being on the fair side.</li>
            <li>It was super apparent how it happened since there was no padding or bubble wrap in the packaging.</li>
            <li>I got this make-up set and many other sets and products free.(ex.</li>
            <li>In the end I cleaned up most excepting the white and my fingers were pretty stained with red.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the other palette on line though, but her palette had more matte colors than this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it came in the mail a couple of days after I ordered it I was excited to open it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more powdery than other eyeshadows, and thus doesn&#x27;t leave colors well.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see an eyeshadow palette with 100 colors for only $10!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it</li>
            <li>, having a teenage daughter who really likes to experiment with different shades, and who is young enough to be slightly more adventurous with it (but not too much, I&#x27;m kinda strict when it comes to makeup)</li>
            <li>but i love the fact you can use Milk pencil by NYX &amp; the colors would look very vibrant &amp; also you can use urban Decay primer &amp; it also do the say only it shimmers.</li>
            <li>A few of the browns are dissapointedly sheer, but hey, a couple extra swipes and your good(: Definitely reccomend this to those who go for the more daring, bold looks, but for those who like to keep it natural I&#x27;d go for a smaller pallette with more shades of browns, which ELF definitely has.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and lasts as long as I need so all around</li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s a nice looking palette for a small price.</li>
            <li>My makeup case is full of MAC and Benefit, but I do also have several ELF cosmetics in there, as well as their Elf studio brushes.</li>
            <li>I was also expecting the shadows to be dull when applied to skin, but I tested a few of the brighter shadows and they showed up perfectly without having to apply layers and layers!</li>
            <li>I really wanted her exact palette, but I couldn&#x27;t be positive that any of the colors were actually different, so I ordered this palette anyway.</li>
            <li>I really like my new eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>I love this palette and the colors I&#x27;ve tried so far, the colors hold well and doesn&#x27;t crease like other eyeshadows but the golden color (2nd column 3rd row) is very frail and creates a lot of powder even with the gentlest strokes of an applicator (luckily I don&#x27;t use that color much), all in all</li>
            <li>it came more or less intact</li>
            <li>however, because i have darker skin, the colours were not as vibrant as i wanted them to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if these colors will be just as vibrant on darker skinned girls.  </li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s still a decent amount of color there).  </li>
            <li>I was lucky in that it was only one</li>
            <li>Only thing to keep in mind if you&#x27;re using it for the same reason is that most of the colours have sparkles in them.</li>
            <li>It has vibrant colors</li>
            <li>This particular product I bought for my friend&#x27;s daughter who is learning to use make up.</li>
            <li>THE COLORS ARE VIBRANT.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this if you are unsure.</li>
            <li>Ever After High.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed that i could get such a huge variety of fun pretty colors in quality shadows for such a low price.</li>
            <li>but maybe it should be packaged a little better...  </li>
            <li>After cleaning up the palette a little it was okay.</li>
            <li>, i wish there was more makeup inside each little square</li>
            <li>My advice, spend a little more and go with another palette.  </li>
            <li>The colors look a little more muted than they do in the picture</li>
            <li>The brushes ARE a little flimsy, but i love it anyway.</li>
            <li>Most are shimmery but some are matte and a few have micro-glitter.</li>
            <li>Overall you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>i really love the colors provided in the pack but was upset to see that there was one palette missing when it arrived and there were colors popped out of where they were glued in.</li>
            <li>but it does take a few times to apply when you want a more deeper tone to your shadow, so some of the comments are correct</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun using different colors to liven up my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>some of the colors in here are sparkly and its really pretty plus you really get ALOT of different shades in this</li>
            <li>The colors are good but not great.</li>
            <li>i got it in time and it had everything in tact and nothing was broken, i loved it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to palettes or eyeshadow, I&#x27;d highly recommend this palette.</li>
            <li>The other colours are fine.</li>
            <li>I got lucky, most people have lots of broken shadow spots.</li>
            <li>I loved that this had a bunch of different colors I could play around with, so I ordered one, but immediately found out that something in the eye shadows cause an allergic reaction to me - eyelids puff up and get extremely itchy, eyes get all watery and red.</li>
            <li>really cheap product, lots of excess, when u apply it it tends to powder and bleed on other parts of your face, sometimes leaving smears.</li>
            <li>I adore playing around with new cosmetics, and e.l.f. 100</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an inexpensive way to play around with new colors.  </li>
            <li>I have used it to go out and to practice on new looks.</li>
            <li>but, I can live with that.</li>
            <li>I got compliments all night on my eyes on New Year&#x27;s and</li>
            <li>she also gota new brush set</li>
            <li>so I cant keep her out of the bathroom playing around with allher new makeup too.</li>
            <li>The only thing i dislike is that it doent fit in my make up drawer (which means i need to find a bigger drawer)</li>
            <li>I usually love ELF products for their cheap prices and quality products, but I am not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li>good to have only as secondary</li>
            <li>, you get way too much with only one stroke of the brush and doesn´t contain much pigment.</li>
            <li>In my case, only one color was cracked but packaging in general was neat and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>If you are interested use the link above.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I received my package 2 days later and was excited to open it.</li>
            <li>but if it was the same price as the other eyeshadow sets I would probably not be as satisfied.</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;ve seen an E.L.F. palette from a Target dealer, this isn&#x27;t the exact same palette, but it&#x27;s comparably close.</li>
            <li>there are only a couple of the colors that are pigmented i mostly only use the top four on the left side of the palette at a highlighter under my brow and the gold thats</li>
            <li>I love my 100 piece palette, so many different colors to use instead of paying over $60 for small things of eyeshadow from MAC or other places.</li>
            <li>Would have been perfect if the plastic hadn&#x27;t been cracked all over :(</li>
            <li>Just as good, same basic colors, just a few a shade or two darker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very large flat!</li>
            <li>so it kind of came all messy but other than that i really like the colors</li>
            <li>Some are too powdery (like a really light pink that was all over the packaging) and others are lacking that bold popping color (like the black).</li>
            <li>I would suggest getting it directly from the E.L.F. website because it is cheaper ($10) and if you get it on a sale, which happens often, you can get it for half price or get a free gift thrown in.</li>
            <li>The individual pans are quite large, with a lot of product.</li>
            <li>i would rather pay a little bit extra for a better product.</li>
            <li>but I fixed it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this for young girls, maybe for costume ideas.</li>
            <li>The shadows are very sheer, and some are very glittery to the point of looking like a craft store got dumped on my eyes.</li>
            <li>other than that the eyeshadow colors are very pretty, would reccomend.</li>
            <li>I recieved some of the eyeshadows completely destroyed and damaged.</li>
            <li>If you like wild colors then this may be for you.  </li>
            <li>The palette arrived on time and completely intact.</li>
            <li>this set does not contain yellow, which disappoints me, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it that much anyway.</li>
            <li>Most of the red pigment coloured pallets along with 2 green ones were shattered.</li>
            <li>Delivery was nice too, none was broken.  </li>
            <li>Okay first off when I recieved this product half of the colors where missing I guess from being moved around on the truck, idk but there was no bubble wrap around it to protect it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to people who like wearing vivid colors on the regular.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other people say it&#x27;s also available at target for about the same price.</li>
            <li>nothing special about this in fact the moisturing lipstick are a greasy mess too.</li>
            <li>Needles to say that it was a huge mess!</li>
            <li>But, this case is actually missing some major basics (e.g., light pinks, darker/more usable browns, purple, greens).  </li>
            <li>Eventhough I believe that they should include more blue colours on the palette or at least a basic blue (nice blues like ultramarine, cobalt or prussian are definitely missing).</li>
            <li>They are more so subtle</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t a vibrant as they seem in the picture, but still pigmented enough that you get the color</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m African American with a medium brown skin tone</li>
            <li>I found the eyeshadow to be easy to blend and create some lovely smokey eye looks, it helps to also use a base on the eye before applying the colors really pop.</li>
            <li>off!&lt;br /&gt;However, since it&#x27;s only $10, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>The colours are vibrant and it was packaged with such care.</li>
            <li>my green eyes and the greens/pinks/blues are fun for when I&#x27;m feeling a little eccentric. :)</li>
            <li>, 1/3 are good, bold colors but tend to crease, and 1/3 are difficult to apply due to low quality.</li>
            <li>My daughter likes to dress up in all kids of different characters, like Monster High and</li>
            <li>but amazon quickly sent me a replacement that was cover tightly in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother initiating a return for a single smashed eyeshadow, especially when it&#x27;s still useful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fortunate that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with anything broken or shattered, but I&#x27;ve always had positive experiences with Amazon &amp; I</li>
            <li>I like having such a large color pallette without having to buy 40 different products!</li>
            <li>They sent me a new one and in this one only 2 were empty...just don&#x27;t do it</li>
            <li>the colors are really vibrant, or apply dry for a more subtle look.</li>
            <li>I was worried about purchasing because so many people said their&#x27;s arrived with broken eyeshadows but all of mine were completely intact.</li>
            <li>nothing major).</li>
            <li>Overall it was worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>I bought this set mainly because it was only $10 for 100 different colors</li>
            <li>The packaging is flimsy and cheap, and this isn&#x27;t portable in the least bit.</li>
            <li>No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The colors that look pigmented, like the fuscia&#x27;s and purples barely show up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll barely touch with my brush and a TON of powder</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t worth returning and paying for shipping over one missing shade.</li>
            <li>There are very few light or highlight shades (except about 8 versions of yellow).  </li>
            <li>One of the eye shadows completely dissolved and was extremely hard to clean from the entire thing.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much else I need to say about it, It has every single color you could possibly want.</li>
            <li>Not single piece was messed up.</li>
            <li>The black is more of a grey and not as dark as you&#x27;d probably</li>
            <li>I spent 20 minutes applying it and was left with a light, bland color.</li>
            <li>But after I cleaned up the mess from all the dark eye shadows the palette was fine.</li>
            <li>As a cosplayer, I often need strange colors to complement my costumes, and I was able to use the green, blue, and pink shades for my costume</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore elf products the quality is no good hence the cheap prices.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to really dig into the color to get anything, and the payoff was never worth it.</li>
            <li>They are all pearlized slightly which I find makes blending so much easier.</li>
            <li>The one i got has no pink and purple at all and only one blue.</li>
            <li>Originally bought for the green eyeshadows for St. Patty&#x27;s Day but also for the bounty of other colors for costume nights or theme nights.</li>
            <li>All the colors are highly pigmented with a very wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li>It has a super wide variety, goes on evenly, stays on as long as my other eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Some will have color if I apply it three or four times, but by then it starts to look heavy and already crease-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this for a younger girl as cheap play make-up, but it&#x27;s not worth it for anyone else.</li>
            <li>The colors are not vibrant at all and far too powdery...</li>
            <li>Not great for all-day wear without a primer, but works fine for short-term wear and primed eyelids.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviewers mentioned broken pieces and one of my shadows came loose in shipping also.</li>
            <li>I only wonder why it is a bit much on here as I had previously purchased mine from Target for only ten dollars.</li>
            <li>They can go on somewhat soft but if you get the brush a little wet when applying it really bumps the color up quite a bit.</li>

            <li> I really liked this!</li>
            <li> I will be honest and say that you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> It was awesome, so many colors to choose from and play with.</li>
            <li> they are awesome :)</li>
            <li> Love the colors and everything was perfect when I got it.</li>
            <li> It Is perfect for those who experiment with many colors.</li>
            <li> Not a horrible purchase, but not the best either.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price.</li>
            <li> The shipment came in good time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Very good product love it</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t show up as bright as i had hoped.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have all those bright pinks in it.  </li>
            <li> But a good buy.</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality is surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> Really good quality for the price</li>
            <li> With a good primer these shadows can do the job.</li>
            <li> I loved the bright colors and opened it as soon as I got home.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> however, still a good product for the occassional makeup wearer as myself.</li>
            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium (touch of Olive to tan depending on whether or not I&#x27;m tan or if it&#x27;s summer), and these colors are perfect for those tones.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest good makeup I have ever seen, I would suggest it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of E.L.F. products and I kept hearing good things about this, so I thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> but good</li>
            <li> i loved all the colors and would recommend this product to friends and family, and i will order this again.</li>
            <li> This might be a good item to buy in a store; but it does not survive shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise a wise pallet purchase.</li>
            <li> Get a good primer</li>
            <li> my sister said some of the colors were good but</li>
            <li> ; good purchase</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m still putting it to good use..</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> The quality of this eyeshadow is good.</li>
            <li> But 99 out of 100 is still good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size, about the sheet of a piece of paper maybe.</li>
            <li> i loved this.</li>
            <li> good colors</li>
            <li> I have the coastal scent palette and this is just as good.</li>
            <li> Looks like a good combination of colors.  </li>
            <li> great skin tone scale as well as gray scale, which was a nice surprise</li>
            <li> so she loved it</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and</li>
            <li> since  bought it and its still good</li>
            <li> I did my utmost best to clean up using a makeup application brush along with cotton balls and alcohol.</li>
            <li> I still cannot get over how good they are and how many beautiful colors there are.</li>
            <li> and you can create so many beautiful looks.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 sets....was very pleased to see it was in good shape....</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li> All the colors are super perfect</li>
            <li> Great colors, high quality product, and a great deal!</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> some colors are great, some are more chalky and of a lower quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to every girl :) you could do some great Halloween makeup ideas with the funky colors too.</li>
            <li> it was cheap and beautiful this was a really good deal</li>
            <li> I think this would be an ideal palette since it&#x27;s cheap for a lot of colors.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of e.l.f. products for their great value.</li>
            <li> I picked this up because I was looking for a cheap palette with really bright colors just for fun, and I&#x27;d looked here on Amazon but found this the best deal.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety and an amazing price.</li>
            <li> this palette was okay for them since the colors weren&#x27;t so bright.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product with huge assortment of colors to choose from</li>
            <li> There are a million gorgeous colors but more importantly, the consistency is great.</li>
            <li> and I also liked the color choices they had.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow set is great for what its worth but in order for it to look really good</li>
            <li> I am amusing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> A lot of my friends have been using Elf products and really liked the quality of it.  </li>
            <li> and I was kind of creeped out about buying no brand name eyeshadow over the internet.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter, she liked them</li>
            <li> Nice quality of eyeshadow and lots of colors to play around with.  </li>
            <li> Is in a nice case for keeping.  </li>
            <li> Nice pallette.  </li>
            <li> I gave up after just a couple weeks and have ordered the Coastal Scents warm.  </li>
            <li> Colors are nice.  </li>
            <li> The colors are a mixture of matte and shimmery which is nice.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ELF GOOD QUALITY PRODUCTS AND AFORDABLE</li>
            <li> Nice sized pallot.  </li>
            <li> The shadows are very nice, I like the colours very much and the price is good for what you recieve.</li>
            <li> This palette is great, I love the shimmer and the flat colors perfect for work to date night.</li>
            <li> I do still love it though i wish that there were more bright colors than neutrals.  </li>
            <li> Also make sure you have really good brushes so you will be able to apply the eyeshadow fully onto your eye.</li>
            <li> It stays on good, and doesn&#x27;t rub off too easy.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and use top name brand for my customers, I really love ELF its inexpensive and a delivers a good product.</li>
            <li> It looseness from the palette very easily</li>
            <li> I am so enjoying this palette, the colors aren&#x27;t highly pigmented but it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Aww well guess you cant win all the time.</li>
            <li> together, It&#x27;s a good cheap buy, but it takes awhile to get color payoff.</li>
            <li> But it is nice to be able to find it on here in case you can&#x27;t get out and have to order online.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors perform nicely, but most don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> honestly this palette is my favorite</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s so many colors to choose from, the browns and purples look really nice with</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I think it would be best to use this kit to save money experimenting with some new looks, before buying something better in the colors you like.</li>
            <li> I found a really great and informative review on you tube (...) which made me purchase it right away.</li>
            <li> The shadow went on smoothly and cleanly and looked beautiful.</li>
            <li> That was the first great thing.</li>

            <li> AND THEY HAVE THEIR WEB SITE FULL OF GREAT PRODUCTS ENJOY</li>
            <li> I love elf cosmetics very much!!!</li>
            <li> I give only four because the quality isn&#x27;t very great.</li>
            <li> I like to expierement with different colors and this palette is perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow</li>

            <li> you are looking for something to add a bit more pop to your eyes, this palette is for you.</li>
            <li> many colors to choose from</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from, and I like to go out</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t expect MAC quality make-up, you&#x27;ll be very happy with this palette, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> plus I don&#x27;t wear many colors except browns tans golds and purples</li>
            <li> The color selection is great on this pallette but to really bring out the color and pigments it takes some time.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and textures.  </li>
            <li> I love the brand and all of the colors in the palette</li>
            <li> A plus is that the same palette also has matte colors, so there&#x27;s something for every one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors are perfectly pigmented for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow platte is such a great product of e.l.f!</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> I have so many choices.</li>
            <li> I love the shimmer in all the colors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that some of the colors are matte and some are shimmery.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow kit</li>
            <li> this item was for me because i love to match my eye shadow with my clothes and how the colors just set my clothes off</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Has many colors...</li>
            <li> So many colors for the price.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for going out and try a complementary color to my outfit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my eye makeup in my life, let alone one week.</li>
            <li> And of course your drug store brands(physicians formula, Revlon,  maybellene, etc) have better shimmer as well.</li>
            <li> and I love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for, for sure.</li>
            <li> Love all of the colors</li>
            <li> and she loved it, great price for 100 different colors!</li>
            <li> however the top could have been made better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this almost 3 years ago and still have tons more to use</li>
            <li> so if i were you i would spend a couple more bucks and go to bh cosmetics and get there 88 palette</li>
            <li> Maybe there is some product which does not have so many colours.</li>
            <li> Autumnish colors are more ky style anyway.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and i just love it</li>
            <li> I had heard of ELF and thought it would be an okay brand to purchase</li>
            <li> Most of the colors have lots of glitter in it, not the matt feeling</li>
            <li> The packaging was Perfect, they put the 6 different elf items I ordered together in a box</li>
            <li> I use my elf primer before applying the eye shadow which makes it look 10 times better.</li>
            <li> so I was glad when I opened the box to see everything was intact.</li>
            <li> even the next day at the diner was told my eye makeup still looks perfect!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I recieved an excellent customer service and would definitely buy something from them again.</li>
            <li> I have already contact them suggesting more protection when packaging this product.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> My point is if you don&#x27;t use a primer for this product,most likely it won&#x27;t work out for you. :D</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve really gotten some great use from this eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have too many shadows in it with a bunch of sparklies in it, and that it hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyelids or my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love E.L.F products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Probably a bit overwhelming</li>
            <li> So many colors , so many many colors.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have chose a better eyeliner palette</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> The colors were more irradescent then i would like.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for probably a lot longer than you&#x27;re supposed to keep makeup around, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I will order more of these  palettes 😊</li>
            <li> love the product</li>
            <li> Hope u guys can think of an innovative ideas abt this issues..</li>
            <li> EVEN better is there are some that repeat twice</li>
            <li> I especially love the different highlight colors.</li>
            <li> But, I love this palette.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> just think they need to ship in better packaging.</li>
            <li> the colors are WAY bolder in person than advertised i love its bin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to use the eyeshadow applicants that most sets come with, so I put those aside.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> many, many looks from this palette.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> The colors are really pretty when you put them on!!!</li>
            <li> Very rich and textured.</li>
            <li> and Happy New Year!</li>
            <li> Lots of great quality colors for a really decent price.</li>
            <li> great experience, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors don&#x27;t have great pigmentation, but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it, and most of the shadows are just fine.  </li>
            <li> ELF IS AN AMAZING BRAND YOUTUBE IS FULL OF TUTORIALS</li>
            <li> Pretty good value.</li>
            <li> This palette no only is in a beautiful selection, but it was also very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so many palettes, this is not something you can easily travel with</li>
            <li> Came the same as it looks in the picture, and most of the eyeshadows are incredibly pigmented.</li>
            <li> If you look at the review on you tube you can get a more elaborate and detailed look of this product (...).</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented, make sure you use a good primer before.</li>
            <li> Most of the browns are fine, along with the goldens.</li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s a good buy; I like having a large palette, and it fits my day to day needs.</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is that the eyeshadow isn&#x27;t very good quality</li>
            <li> In light, you can see the reflective speckles, but after application, the powder comes off looking more satin like than shimmery, so if you&#x27;re a fan of pearl/satin textured shadows, this one&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> Instead of carrying aroung a bunch of mini eyeshadows or different sets, you have every color of the rainbow, AND MORE  love it wouod recomend it to ANYONE great birthday presant also(;</li>
            <li> The colors work fabulously some more than others.  </li>
            <li> For a more detailed review watch this video:</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad purchase for the money, but not an awesome one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this is not the best quality eyeshadow out there, it is certainly not bottom of the barrel either.</li>
            <li> Got it way before it was due to arrive looks just like the picture and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> , I think it looks cool!).</li>
            <li> The blend mixes were easy too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> although it came very quick...</li>
            <li> and I ordered it 2 days ago, so the service was very quick.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I wouldve easily given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> To be honest,this eyeshadow is have to put and easy to fade.</li>
            <li> I got the case in perfect condition, and sampled some of the colors immediately and was shocked with the great quality!  </li>
            <li> Even with a primer, a good number of these colors lack decent pigmentation.</li>
            <li> The quality of the eyeshadows themselves is pretty good in that they are lighter but mostly true to what they look like in the case.</li>
            <li> but overall loved it honestly</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this palette for anyone, whether you like bright colors or not.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s even a good matte brown I will sometimes use in this palette for my brows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use any of these eyeshadows without applying eye primer, and I highly recommend using a makeup brush when applying.</li>
            <li> own 12 palettes, now including this one, from a variety of brands (some of them high-end like MAC, Tarte, Too Faced and BH), and I very much like this palette.</li>
            <li> otherwise good and arrived pretty quickly</li>
            <li> but if your the type that likes to make it look more natural and calm than this is great for you.</li>
            <li> A nice start-up brand when you are first experimenting with makeup.</li>
            <li> liked the mirror on the inside ;].&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only are the colors are beautiful</li>
            <li> While some of the colors are dull, some of them are BEAUTIFUL and bright and they all stay on all night.</li>
            <li> e.l.f had done me ok in the past, but the quality of the shadow in this set is marginal at best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> great colors, looks cute, stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I would say they all are wearable colors and they offer a huge variety of options for creating looks.     </li>
            <li> outer 2 rows and the upper wells of the middle 4 rows are great for highlight colors, or even if you&#x27;re just looking for light coverage, while the bottom of the palette is good for the details, more accented looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The eye shadow goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> If you would like getting brand name make-up and products free check out the link below:https://www.listia.com</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I used my finger to swatch a color on my arm and immediately noticed how smooth and pigmented it was, even with my finger instead of a brush and without eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase for what its worth</li>
            <li> Compared to the price on the site and the price i got for it was cheap.</li>
            <li> My Niece love matching her eye shadow to her cloths and this product lets you have fun.</li>
            <li> There was powder EVERYWHERE and some of the really light colors still have remnants of this shattered gray in it.  </li>
            <li> I find if I take my cheapo pallets and use the lightest shimmer color I have and lightly sweep over what I used out of my e.l.f. pallet</li>
            <li> it would be for someone whose looking for more of a natural look, but i&#x27;m sure the purchase is for those who prefer that over a more smokey eye.. or a darker color blend.</li>
            <li> The price made it attractive, since I could get all of this for the same price as I could a set of JUST pinks.</li>
            <li> This plate is so cheap that you cannot even complain about its quality.</li>
            <li> But it is cheap, so just take it.</li>
            <li> i swore i would never bother with cheap eyeshadow again.</li>
            <li> you can really do amazing effects on your eyes with this, every girl should have this to get ready.</li>
            <li> A great way to try different colors without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> They feel cheap and lack depth.</li>
            <li> They are smooth and stay on well.</li>
            <li> the product arrived in good condition and complete.</li>
            <li> The pigment is good, but soft, so if you want a lit of pigment you will have to put a lot on the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great variety of eye shadows for a great price, but you&#x27;ll probably never use half of them, and the shadows themselves don&#x27;t stick to my eyelids very well, usually requiring 2-4 applications for best results.</li>
            <li> This would also make a fantastic gift for just about any woman (younger or um...not so young, like me :) who enjoys using eyeshadow, because the variety of shades go from nice and natural/earthy to bright and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So elf products are sorta sketchy sometimes because with my experience with them they sort of just wipe off pretty easily, I love the cheap prices on their makeup though</li>
            <li> However, colors looked nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> love elf always have, pretty cheap online</li>
            <li> Nice, vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re my new favorite brand!</li>
            <li> bright colors,really nice, soft, bought it for my daughter she loves it, will definatly purchase more in the future for friends and family</li>
            <li> There are a great blend of colors, I just wish they were more pigmented so that it pops on black skin.</li>
            <li> E.l.f. products have never disappointed me, and this palette was no exception.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth $10 in my opinion!</li>
            <li> i originally bought this because it had all the colours i wanted.</li>
            <li> When i first saw it on e.l.f&#x27;s website, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> She was really happy to get it... loves the colors she wants me to find more like it just different colors</li>
            <li> If this is purchased  for anyone under 20  who doesnt know the difference than more than likely they will love it!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are decent, but for $10 it&#x27;s a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to clean up when you receive your eyeshadows.     </li>
            <li> I wish there was more of a variety of bolder colors now that I&#x27;m straying from more natural tones</li>
            <li> I normally use MAC eyeshadows but wanted some fun &amp; funky colors for New Year&#x27;s and the quality was so good that after I applied it I wouldn&#x27;t have known it wasn&#x27;t MAC!  </li>
            <li> This eyeshadow palette includes many great colors that a very flattering on my fair complexing, without being too overpowering and making me look like a clown, which is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally get super funky with my eye shadow but when I do, like around Halloween, I need some kind of pallet for all of the colors.  </li>
            <li> i had to order new / different kind because this one the colors wasnt as bright on as they were in the kit.</li>
            <li> Amazon was great about the situation and sent me a free replacement without returning the other.</li>
            <li> I use this pallet for colorful looks and it works fine.</li>
            <li> My niece was super excited about it.</li>
            <li> While some of the eyeshadows are bright when you first apply, without eye primer, many do not stay on the skin for long.</li>
            <li> Bright colors and they last all day with a primer.</li>
            <li> Good variety of colors especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and have found only good things.</li>
            <li> I do have to use a base/primer to wear it so that the color can be true.</li>
            <li> I use it almost daily (with a good eyeshadow primer).</li>
            <li> Some of the colors broke up but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good makeup for someone just starting to experiment.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough.</li>
            <li> Product quality is good and would return to buy the product in a future.</li>
            <li> and the whole top snapped off.</li>
            <li> The shipper really needs to package this better though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the colors on that are more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> For $10 though it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It has a great variety of colors and, despite what other reviewers have said, I think it has plenty of pigment to it.  </li>
            <li> my wife was very excited with this eyeshadow palette until she realized that some colores were completely destroyed, I guess this was caused during packing or transport, but amazon or courier should take more care on packing this kind of items properly to avoid these inconveniences.</li>
            <li> I did use my usual MAC eyeshadow primer so that might have made it better but even just testing the colors on my hand they went on bright and smooth.  </li>
            <li> the selection of colors is very good, versatile, i dont need another pallette when i have this one handy, but the color are so faint</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t stay vibrant all day, which works for me, but i heard using eye primer makes it even better.</li>
            <li> Luckily, mine didn&#x27;t have any damage.</li>
            <li> Luckily my eyeshadows were still intact.</li>
            <li> and while I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t have the vibrant ability like</li>
            <li> Luckily I came across the e.l.f. brand, which I&#x27;ve known and used before</li>
            <li> I will most probably buy more e.l.f. products from amazon in the future</li>
            <li> Luckily it didn&#x27;t smash and get everywhere</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is a good deal and fun for experimenting with some different colored shadows on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a good amount of shadow for the price, worth buying for younger girls.</li>
            <li> Luckily its just for my daughter make up playtime.....</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Also the colours look the same in person as they do online simply stunning and elegant colours.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using some type of eye primer to make the colors stand out even more.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this palette so much!</li>
            <li> the colors that didnt get messed up are very pretty.</li>
            <li> likes the soft, warm and more natural look, this palette is for you!&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
            <li> Lots of very pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I used the palette today to create a brightish green smoky eye and they went on beautifully with zero fallout, even the sparkly ones, and lasted all day without creasing (with an eyeshadow primer).</li>
            <li> The colors look so good and they stay on long.</li>
            <li> All the colors were intact, the mirror was secure and it&#x27;s been able to take a bit of wear and tear from my general clumsiness.</li>
            <li> There are many variation of this product, but this one seemed like the best value out of all since it contained more colors compared to other five dollar ones that had only one third of these colors.</li>
            <li> I know the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t always the most vivid, but primer does help with that.</li>
            <li> , i have to aply many coats of color to make it look vivid.</li>
            <li> , they go from natural looking colors to more bold colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really into anything too bright and bold and based on the review</li>
            <li> The colors are great and they stay on well with little fallout.  </li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are very pretty, but if you are not using the right brushes or eye shadow primer (I use concealer), it will not show on your lids.</li>
            <li> Overall amazing quality</li>
            <li> so i have a lot of fun deciding which color to use that night.</li>
            <li> These shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented and you have to rub them in a lot and apply several coats to get a good shade</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find none of the eyeshadow broken when I recieved this item.  </li>
            <li> It is also fun to mix up the colors as well.</li>
            <li> Fun to play with, lots of colors.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the one I go straight for on a daily basis, for my work look, and it&#x27;s much more attractive looking in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m getting my moneys worth</li>
            <li> At $0.10 a shade, these aren&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in perfect condition and earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The product is good overall, eyeshadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> This is really nice eye shadow for the low price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used E.L.F. brand before; I buy most of my makeup from the higher-end brands at Sephora (I&#x27;m not a snob, I just find that I get what I pay for with most makeup) and am an extreme makeup junkie, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much given how cheap it was.     </li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product because of the low price and how many colors I was getting.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> Amazon gave me a quick solution to the problem and refund my money, so I am not angry nor dissapointed at them.</li>
            <li> As long as you do that, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of colors to experiment.</li>
            <li> It is a all right Eyeshadow Palette</li>
            <li> The colors blend well together with the right brushes if you want to achieve that MAC look.</li>
            <li> Price was definitely right on this one.</li>
            <li> But, colors fade easily, are not vibrant, and the makeup itself is more powdery.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well and clean.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I just need to reapply certain colors a couple times to give off the true color.</li>
            <li> Eye shadows are bright and vibrant ( the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice) and there is a variety of different colors (100 to be exact).</li>
            <li> I find that the El cheapo pallets from the dollar general have better shimmer than this.</li>
            <li> Long lasting color for a good price!</li>
            <li> i got this for my younger sister as a birthday present thinking it would be good since it&#x27;s e.l.f. brand and most of their products are decent for the price.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t all super vibrant, but I don&#x27;t go for very colorful looks much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shadow wells are good sized, especially compared to some ofthe other brands of palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primer is a must, though most makeup fiends probably don&#x27;t dare apply shadow without some sort of primer anyway.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as all the other eyeshadow I have ever used, better than some actually.</li>
            <li> I know it was a cheap product, but the condition for it being new was unacceptable.</li>
            <li> The more neutral shades seem to have a different consistency, while the bright colors stick quickly, the neutrals tend to need a few layers before they&#x27;re truly visible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;again SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> The colors have great pigmentation on my skin tone although I am very pale.</li>
            <li> Some look a little different than you would expect from looking at it on the palette (the gold is more of a shiny orange on me - but that was a pleasant surprise</li>
            <li> I love shopping on Amazon, so when I saw my favorite brand E.L.F. products and was amazed at the price, however I was very dissatisfied with the delivery of the palette as 5 colors were completely crushed which really makes me upset since I can&#x27;t return the palette because I need those colors for my outfits this weekend.</li>
            <li> , I was able to actually apply the makeup, and it was very smooth and very solid in color.</li>
            <li> Because these colors aren&#x27;t as highly pigmented as say, MAC, they don&#x27;t last as long without primer and apply lighter, but this IS a $10 palette, so don&#x27;t expect MAC quality (though I do love this palette, more than the ultra vibrant MAC/BH palettes, but I&#x27;m more of a subtle-color girl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> a beginner in the world of makeup, and only being able to use my fingers (because I didn&#x27;t get my brushes in time for the event)</li>
            <li> Colors are not as pretty, frosty as I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> You definitely cant beat it for the price :)</li>
            <li> I hope my niece likes it just as much!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this on many different occasions.</li>
            <li> The colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li> When you first see it 100 colors for $10.00 who wouldnt buy it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this brand.</li>
            <li> I was exactly what i ordered.  </li>
            <li> I bought this palette because I needed one with a wide range of colors, and I really liked the pinks (what I was looking for)</li>
            <li> There are palettes with better pigmentation in a similar price range.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;pay off\\&quot; or pigment is not deeply infused, so if you want to get the full color effect, you would need to lightly dampen with water on your eyeshadow applicator for it to appear richer.</li>
            <li> I love it, use it daily</li>
            <li> The shades are pretty on my skin.</li>
            <li> Will by more in the future....</li>
            <li> First of all I was expecting the package to arrive by September 27th or so, and I got it today</li>
            <li> With this set, you get most of your desired colors, for only $10.</li>
            <li> If you use brushes or sponge type applicators you&#x27;ll probably waste a good bit.</li>
            <li> The colors I have tried are all very vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> A couple of the darker cells broke and when i opened it shadow was everywhere, the lighter colors were covered in gray shadow, and the whole top was just gross.</li>
            <li> but i am a soft honey so that may be why then again it is elf but its still one nice pallate for only 10bucks</li>
            <li> Overall, this set was a good set to have instead of buying tons of various colors.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get this palette; it was cheap and had a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Of course, not every one is just what I would ordinarily use, but this set is a great way to make new discoveries.</li>
            <li> overall, i&#x27;m still extremely pleased, for what you pay, you really get a lot of decent shadows!</li>
            <li> Some shadows, the matte I believe, aren&#x27;t very pigmented and pretty chalky.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette, and I can&#x27;t complain much!</li>
            <li> Colors stay all day long, Every color in here is my favorite.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d like to have some fun with new eyeshadow colors, this collection is one to choose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to note that this palette must be handled gently, because the eyeshadows to tend to break if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> so if you need touch-ups, you&#x27;ll be lugging around this large thing</li>
            <li> A large variety of colors</li>
            <li> You have to pay for shipping though unless you spend a certain amount ($25 or $35 depending).</li>
            <li> However, shipping made chunks of certain colors fall out of their palette and crumble all over the rest of the colors.</li>
            <li> Alright, well I gave this item 5 stars, though I did find one minor discrepancy: My friend bought the E.L.F. palette from Target during a promotional sale they held, and I loved it so much that I simply had to buy it.</li>
            <li> I think the pigment is just fine for my liking so overall</li>
            <li> There are enough colors here (and the shadows are good enough quality) for you to try out some new looks and see what you like, but they don&#x27;t hold up very well.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing deal and after reading some reviews I was a little weary</li>
            <li> First off, for the price, I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants a variety of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty dramatic when placed over an eye primer and it was a great buy for such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> This pack has a great color selection and will last for a few years.</li>
            <li> I really like this pallette.</li>
            <li> The shadow colors when applied on skin looked much lighter than when I saw them on the palette.</li>
            <li> thanks though</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really complain all that much.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I really like the variety of colors they have</li>
            <li> This will take time because in order for the colors to really come out</li>
            <li> this might not be for you, well it could work but it will take really longtime to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for well over a year now, and I&#x27;d say 1/3 stay on really well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s a wide variety of matte-shimmery-glittery.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are very varied and dimensional.</li>
            <li> and it shipped so fast.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much use I get out of this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-it&#x27;s is very powdery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-there are shimmer and mattes in this pallet but the shimmer ones done have much shimmer to them.</li>
            <li> Two, the eyeshadow is very powdery.</li>
            <li> but i dont put much on</li>
            <li> Some people really like or really dislike.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t really try it yet.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> So much eyeshadow that I dont know what to do with myself.</li>
            <li> It was packaged perfectly, not a broken shadow in the set.</li>
            <li> and it stays on very well.</li>
            <li> I thought for the price it wouldn&#x27;t be very opaque and it would wear off fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette and the sleek feel of it.</li>
            <li> Except, the actual eyeshadow was not as pigmented as I thought it would be and goes on somewhat light.</li>
            <li> When I got it in the mail and opened it up it was used and really dusty.look at the picture I took of it</li>
            <li> It was boxed very well.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> My daughter got these for herself and she absolutely loves them too</li>
            <li> The powders don&#x27;t really stay that well on my eyes, even when I use a primer.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> so that makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> There are tons of awesome colors in this palette, however mine came with the case cracked and several of the colors had broken and powder was everywhere.</li>
            <li> For example, one of the golds is kind of weird, but I love how the silver and some of the pinks work.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars is due to the blending capabilities being on the fair side.</li>
            <li> It was super apparent how it happened since there was no padding or bubble wrap in the packaging.</li>
            <li> I got this make-up set and many other sets and products free.(ex.</li>
            <li> In the end I cleaned up most excepting the white and my fingers were pretty stained with red.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the other palette on line though, but her palette had more matte colors than this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it came in the mail a couple of days after I ordered it I was excited to open it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more powdery than other eyeshadows, and thus doesn&#x27;t leave colors well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see an eyeshadow palette with 100 colors for only $10!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it</li>
            <li> , having a teenage daughter who really likes to experiment with different shades, and who is young enough to be slightly more adventurous with it (but not too much, I&#x27;m kinda strict when it comes to makeup)</li>
            <li> but i love the fact you can use Milk pencil by NYX &amp; the colors would look very vibrant &amp; also you can use urban Decay primer &amp; it also do the say only it shimmers.</li>
            <li> A few of the browns are dissapointedly sheer, but hey, a couple extra swipes and your good(: Definitely reccomend this to those who go for the more daring, bold looks, but for those who like to keep it natural I&#x27;d go for a smaller pallette with more shades of browns, which ELF definitely has.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and lasts as long as I need so all around</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s a nice looking palette for a small price.</li>
            <li> My makeup case is full of MAC and Benefit, but I do also have several ELF cosmetics in there, as well as their Elf studio brushes.</li>
            <li> I was also expecting the shadows to be dull when applied to skin, but I tested a few of the brighter shadows and they showed up perfectly without having to apply layers and layers!</li>
            <li> I really wanted her exact palette, but I couldn&#x27;t be positive that any of the colors were actually different, so I ordered this palette anyway.</li>
            <li> I really like my new eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> I love this palette and the colors I&#x27;ve tried so far, the colors hold well and doesn&#x27;t crease like other eyeshadows but the golden color (2nd column 3rd row) is very frail and creates a lot of powder even with the gentlest strokes of an applicator (luckily I don&#x27;t use that color much), all in all</li>
            <li> it came more or less intact</li>
            <li> however, because i have darker skin, the colours were not as vibrant as i wanted them to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if these colors will be just as vibrant on darker skinned girls.  </li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s still a decent amount of color there).  </li>
            <li> I was lucky in that it was only one</li>
            <li> Only thing to keep in mind if you&#x27;re using it for the same reason is that most of the colours have sparkles in them.</li>
            <li> It has vibrant colors</li>
            <li> This particular product I bought for my friend&#x27;s daughter who is learning to use make up.</li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE VIBRANT.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this if you are unsure.</li>
            <li> Ever After High.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that i could get such a huge variety of fun pretty colors in quality shadows for such a low price.</li>
            <li> but maybe it should be packaged a little better...  </li>
            <li> After cleaning up the palette a little it was okay.</li>
            <li> , i wish there was more makeup inside each little square</li>
            <li> My advice, spend a little more and go with another palette.  </li>
            <li> The colors look a little more muted than they do in the picture</li>
            <li> The brushes ARE a little flimsy, but i love it anyway.</li>
            <li> Most are shimmery but some are matte and a few have micro-glitter.</li>
            <li> Overall you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> i really love the colors provided in the pack but was upset to see that there was one palette missing when it arrived and there were colors popped out of where they were glued in.</li>
            <li> but it does take a few times to apply when you want a more deeper tone to your shadow, so some of the comments are correct</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun using different colors to liven up my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> some of the colors in here are sparkly and its really pretty plus you really get ALOT of different shades in this</li>
            <li> The colors are good but not great.</li>
            <li> i got it in time and it had everything in tact and nothing was broken, i loved it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to palettes or eyeshadow, I&#x27;d highly recommend this palette.</li>
            <li> The other colours are fine.</li>
            <li> I got lucky, most people have lots of broken shadow spots.</li>
            <li> I loved that this had a bunch of different colors I could play around with, so I ordered one, but immediately found out that something in the eye shadows cause an allergic reaction to me - eyelids puff up and get extremely itchy, eyes get all watery and red.</li>
            <li> really cheap product, lots of excess, when u apply it it tends to powder and bleed on other parts of your face, sometimes leaving smears.</li>
            <li> I adore playing around with new cosmetics, and e.l.f. 100</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive way to play around with new colors.  </li>
            <li> I have used it to go out and to practice on new looks.</li>
            <li> but, I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I got compliments all night on my eyes on New Year&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> she also gota new brush set</li>
            <li> so I cant keep her out of the bathroom playing around with allher new makeup too.</li>
            <li> The only thing i dislike is that it doent fit in my make up drawer (which means i need to find a bigger drawer)</li>
            <li> I usually love ELF products for their cheap prices and quality products, but I am not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> good to have only as secondary</li>
            <li> , you get way too much with only one stroke of the brush and doesn´t contain much pigment.</li>
            <li> In my case, only one color was cracked but packaging in general was neat and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> If you are interested use the link above.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I received my package 2 days later and was excited to open it.</li>
            <li> but if it was the same price as the other eyeshadow sets I would probably not be as satisfied.</li>
            <li> , if you&#x27;ve seen an E.L.F. palette from a Target dealer, this isn&#x27;t the exact same palette, but it&#x27;s comparably close.</li>
            <li> there are only a couple of the colors that are pigmented i mostly only use the top four on the left side of the palette at a highlighter under my brow and the gold thats</li>
            <li> I love my 100 piece palette, so many different colors to use instead of paying over $60 for small things of eyeshadow from MAC or other places.</li>
            <li> Would have been perfect if the plastic hadn&#x27;t been cracked all over :(</li>
            <li> Just as good, same basic colors, just a few a shade or two darker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very large flat!</li>
            <li> so it kind of came all messy but other than that i really like the colors</li>
            <li> Some are too powdery (like a really light pink that was all over the packaging) and others are lacking that bold popping color (like the black).</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting it directly from the E.L.F. website because it is cheaper ($10) and if you get it on a sale, which happens often, you can get it for half price or get a free gift thrown in.</li>
            <li> The individual pans are quite large, with a lot of product.</li>
            <li> i would rather pay a little bit extra for a better product.</li>
            <li> but I fixed it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for young girls, maybe for costume ideas.</li>
            <li> The shadows are very sheer, and some are very glittery to the point of looking like a craft store got dumped on my eyes.</li>
            <li> other than that the eyeshadow colors are very pretty, would reccomend.</li>
            <li> I recieved some of the eyeshadows completely destroyed and damaged.</li>
            <li> If you like wild colors then this may be for you.  </li>
            <li> The palette arrived on time and completely intact.</li>
            <li> this set does not contain yellow, which disappoints me, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it that much anyway.</li>
            <li> Most of the red pigment coloured pallets along with 2 green ones were shattered.</li>
            <li> Delivery was nice too, none was broken.  </li>
            <li> Okay first off when I recieved this product half of the colors where missing I guess from being moved around on the truck, idk but there was no bubble wrap around it to protect it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to people who like wearing vivid colors on the regular.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other people say it&#x27;s also available at target for about the same price.</li>
            <li> nothing special about this in fact the moisturing lipstick are a greasy mess too.</li>
            <li> Needles to say that it was a huge mess!</li>
            <li> But, this case is actually missing some major basics (e.g., light pinks, darker/more usable browns, purple, greens).  </li>
            <li> Eventhough I believe that they should include more blue colours on the palette or at least a basic blue (nice blues like ultramarine, cobalt or prussian are definitely missing).</li>
            <li> They are more so subtle</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t a vibrant as they seem in the picture, but still pigmented enough that you get the color</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m African American with a medium brown skin tone</li>
            <li> I found the eyeshadow to be easy to blend and create some lovely smokey eye looks, it helps to also use a base on the eye before applying the colors really pop.</li>
            <li> off!&lt;br /&gt;However, since it&#x27;s only $10, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> The colours are vibrant and it was packaged with such care.</li>
            <li> my green eyes and the greens/pinks/blues are fun for when I&#x27;m feeling a little eccentric. :)</li>
            <li> , 1/3 are good, bold colors but tend to crease, and 1/3 are difficult to apply due to low quality.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes to dress up in all kids of different characters, like Monster High and</li>
            <li> but amazon quickly sent me a replacement that was cover tightly in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother initiating a return for a single smashed eyeshadow, especially when it&#x27;s still useful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with anything broken or shattered, but I&#x27;ve always had positive experiences with Amazon &amp; I</li>
            <li> I like having such a large color pallette without having to buy 40 different products!</li>
            <li> They sent me a new one and in this one only 2 were empty...just don&#x27;t do it</li>
            <li> the colors are really vibrant, or apply dry for a more subtle look.</li>
            <li> I was worried about purchasing because so many people said their&#x27;s arrived with broken eyeshadows but all of mine were completely intact.</li>
            <li> nothing major).</li>
            <li> Overall it was worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> I bought this set mainly because it was only $10 for 100 different colors</li>
            <li> The packaging is flimsy and cheap, and this isn&#x27;t portable in the least bit.</li>
            <li> No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The colors that look pigmented, like the fuscia&#x27;s and purples barely show up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll barely touch with my brush and a TON of powder</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t worth returning and paying for shipping over one missing shade.</li>
            <li> There are very few light or highlight shades (except about 8 versions of yellow).  </li>
            <li> One of the eye shadows completely dissolved and was extremely hard to clean from the entire thing.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much else I need to say about it, It has every single color you could possibly want.</li>
            <li> Not single piece was messed up.</li>
            <li> The black is more of a grey and not as dark as you&#x27;d probably</li>
            <li> I spent 20 minutes applying it and was left with a light, bland color.</li>
            <li> But after I cleaned up the mess from all the dark eye shadows the palette was fine.</li>
            <li> As a cosplayer, I often need strange colors to complement my costumes, and I was able to use the green, blue, and pink shades for my costume</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore elf products the quality is no good hence the cheap prices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to really dig into the color to get anything, and the payoff was never worth it.</li>
            <li> They are all pearlized slightly which I find makes blending so much easier.</li>
            <li> The one i got has no pink and purple at all and only one blue.</li>
            <li> Originally bought for the green eyeshadows for St. Patty&#x27;s Day but also for the bounty of other colors for costume nights or theme nights.</li>
            <li> All the colors are highly pigmented with a very wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> It has a super wide variety, goes on evenly, stays on as long as my other eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Some will have color if I apply it three or four times, but by then it starts to look heavy and already crease-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this for a younger girl as cheap play make-up, but it&#x27;s not worth it for anyone else.</li>
            <li> The colors are not vibrant at all and far too powdery...</li>
            <li> Not great for all-day wear without a primer, but works fine for short-term wear and primed eyelids.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviewers mentioned broken pieces and one of my shadows came loose in shipping also.</li>
            <li> I only wonder why it is a bit much on here as I had previously purchased mine from Target for only ten dollars.</li>
            <li> They can go on somewhat soft but if you get the brush a little wet when applying it really bumps the color up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I took off one star is because some (not all) of the colors are drier and less pigmented than others, while some are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> but it did not give me nearly the same effects as I had with other products.     </li>
            <li> , when it arrived, it arrived smashed , two palettes were completely all over the place, it was a total mess just trying to open it.</li>
            <li> It boasts a wide range of colors and hues, so you can play around with the various colors to see what works for you and what doesn&#x27;t before you move on to a more expensive palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t do that, however, because I do like the more subtle shades of eyeshadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super pigmented, but that is fixed by first putting on NYX Jumbo eye pencil in Milk, or another with base.</li>
            <li> Last long!</li>
            <li> Last long!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this at amazon but at target, I did not liked it so much it is not pigmented enough.</li>
            <li> Although it came quickly it was all broken up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the little brush-thingies that come with it because they are really flimsy, but I just use ones from other palettes.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that some of the eyeshadows seem loose and chalky.</li>
            <li> Several of the eyeshadows had loosened and where loose inside the palette when I received it.</li>
            <li> But I cleaned it up and glued the loose colors back on the palette and gave it too</li>
            <li> They are also very low pigment so they are not vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> So I researched other reviews and saw they were mixed before I actually purchased this palette.</li>
            <li> ,bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> i have to be careful how i open and close it now.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as lush and micronized as ud, but they do the job well.</li>
            <li> However the picture shows that there are different shades of pink and purple.</li>
            <li> All of the pink shades come out looking red.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than was expected for 100 piece.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely need a primer with these, not a whole lot of coverage or stay power.</li>
            <li> this was as a result of poor packaging right?</li>
            <li> When received it has a broken powder which made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> had no problems mentioned by other reviewers as to packaging and such.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve wanted this palette for soooooo long!</li>
            <li> They also mixed in with the other colors.</li>
            <li> With a primer and patience when applying, some of these eyeshadows can be mistaken for a much more expensive brand!</li>
            <li> I wont be buying eye shadows for a long time!</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that 6 of the shadows were busted and completely spilled out during&lt;br /&gt;the shipping process.</li>
            <li> All the dark brown and black powder completely covered all the brighter colors.</li>
            <li> I have used all sort of make up - from one end of the spectrum to the other, both cheap and expensive and everything in between.</li>
            <li> If your the kind of girl/women that likes to make your eyeshadow real flashy</li>
            <li> I use a dampened finger tip(middle finger for lighter touch) and I don&#x27;t see the loose powder every where&lt;</li>
            <li> So be prepared to maybe loose some of the shadows if the seller doesn&#x27;t change the shipping issues.</li>
            <li> Turns out, a few of the colors actually are a bit different from the other palette; maybe  just a shade or 2 darker.</li>
            <li> eye shadow does not even last a half hour on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use these small mirrors anyway, so I was okay with it, but when I tried the colors on my skin, I was once again - disappointed.     </li>
            <li> It was a total mess.</li>
            <li> They were deflated which could of caused such a mess with the palette.</li>
            <li> but every time I use it, its a big mess but</li>
            <li> I pressed it back on, it stayed little bit but fell off again.</li>
            <li> wide selection of colors makes blending a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> My money was well spent</li>
            <li> So when I opened up I saw 2 colors were empty and messed up on all over the pallet.</li>
            <li> so I figured this product would be as i expected.</li>
            <li> The item was as i expected</li>
            <li> The box itself was crushed and when I took it out</li>
            <li> I got this because of the wide range of colours.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something I use everyday but there is enough variety to</li>
            <li> Only used a few times.</li>
            <li> It was not what i expected.</li>
            <li> some are empty .</li>
            <li> Be careful opening.</li>
            <li> if I use a white base underneath, too many of these colors just don&#x27;t show up well.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, The color doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> The container that holds the make up was broken and one full eye-shaddow was missing, and bits were missing out of others.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors aren&#x27;t too bad if your going for a natural look, the darker/heavier shades arent bad either; however, you will definitely need a really good primer/base for these colors to show and stay on.</li>
            <li> It was a mess everything was broken even the box i was really looking forward to it&lt;</li>
            <li> I tried applying pink and beige all over my eyelid and tried applying dark brown on the crease on my eye</li>
            <li> I have continued to swatch the other colors</li>
            <li> Had read other reviews and saw that after receiving their packages the pallets were shattered.</li>
            <li> There are other eye shadow pallets here at amazon to choose from.</li>
            <li> When I got the item I found some other makeup power covering the eyeshadow and the packaging, I also saw some of the colors chipped.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell one color from the other,  </li>
            <li> was an issue with some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> Other colors I have to practically attack with my brush to get anything</li>
            <li> I have read in other customer reviews that some of the shadows have survived shipping, some have not.</li>
            <li> But I wont be ordering any type of shadow from Amazon, since they down package it carefully.</li>
            <li> (it especially effected the area of the eyelid in direct contact with the eyeshadow), so I will unfortunately have to throw this out.</li>
            <li> The ELF palette was as nearly wrapped and secured as the other palette and alot of the shadows were broken and all over the place.</li>
            <li> However due to the poor packaging one of the colors in the pallet was completely knocked out and dusted.  </li>
            <li> It works well for the price, it&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> Cameras haven&#x27;t really seemed to pick them up, but it&#x27;s still something to be wary about.</li>
            <li> I knew these were a long shot, but I usually like ELF products.</li>
            <li> Make sure you put eye primer on before because the eyeshadow needs a base to grasp onto.</li>
            <li> When it arrived one eyeshadow spot was missing, it had broke during shipping and crushed and was all over the place.</li>
            <li> Product arrived covered in the dust of broken eyeshadows, and it is completely unusable.</li>
            <li> but the difference is that one is matted and the other has glamorous glitter!</li>
            <li> Im in beauty school, so its endless possibilities with this palette!</li>
            <li> was pay hundreds for a crazy name when I&#x27;ll rightly be passing this thing onto my grandkids for all I&#x27;ll use it.  </li>
            <li> Which means it can get messy due to the looseness of the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Now my wife&#x27;s palette has four colors missing due to this.</li>
            <li> maybe the black as a eyeliner</li>
            <li> i.e. the black and some of the brighter colors).</li>
            <li> i always expect nothing less from ELF.</li>
            <li> When I received the package in the mail and opened it, it was a mess.</li>
            <li> But when I opened it, it was eyeshadow EVERY where it was a mess.</li>
            <li> Opened the lid and it was just a mess of eyeshadow everywhere.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER when I received my shipment, some of the shadows were broken up and had mixed in with other colors.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion save your money and go to the store to buy u less you want half of your eyeshadow colors missing.</li>
            <li> One of the greens is almost half missing.</li>
            <li> If you want it to come out dark don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> So I dug a little deeper</li>
            <li> All those colors for so little?  </li>
            <li> I pulled it out of the box and all it had for cushioning was a little plastic air bubble.  </li>
            <li> my little</li>
            <li> The colors do not pop, they are boring nothing vibrant or pretty about these colors.</li>
            <li> Only one color was broken when I received mine in the mail</li>
            <li> You can go from sassy everyday, to life of the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also when I opened the box some of the colors were missing.</li>
            <li> some were missing.</li>
            <li> Makeup got all over my hands when I took it out of its package and at least 6 shadows were empty.</li>
            <li> A bit messy once item was received however</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I just ordered this palette a few hours ago.</li>
            <li> I use this product for everyday make up....</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that a couple of the colors were broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> comes off, which can be messy.  </li>
            <li> It did come with the one of the colors completely missing and all over the place</li>
            <li> I put water on a brush and have used a few of the wilder colors as eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Everyday looks .</li>
            <li> I had a few colors pop out of the pallet</li>
            <li> Mine arrived in 2 days half of them were gone with the pieces of them everywhere !</li>
            <li> the colors are NOT strong at all and unless you feel like pressing them on your eyelid for 30 minutes for some color payoff I recommend not buying this.</li>
            <li> I agree that some of the colors are a little dull, but if you add a little bit of water to the eyeshadow it helps alot.</li>
            <li> At least four colors are completely missing, and two are mostly missing.  </li>
            <li> When the eyeshadow arrived, some of the colors had broken apart and scattered into the other colors, leaving a mess.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, was very excited to receive this item</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Mine came without any damage to the palettes nor the small mirror inside</li>
            <li> Sad to say the same thing happened to me.</li>
            <li> Lots of eye shadow, small price.</li>
            <li> When I got this item i was not pleased.</li>
            <li> In all I was not pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Usually I use mineral make-up</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> The colors are in squares that are somewhat small.</li>
            <li> Small set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to tell from the palette what the color is actually going to look like on the eye.  </li>
            <li> Not able to use the color at all.  </li>
            <li> The mirror does come off, but its small anyway, but I don&#x27;t tend to use those mirrors either.</li>
            <li> The other colours were so messed up with the broken pallets they all looked like one colour.</li>
            <li> even with a primer this shadow did not show up, im pale and not even the purples showed up on my skin!</li>
            <li> But then again I have very pale skin.</li>
            <li> The palette was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap, and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> Also it came wrapped tightly in 2 layers of bubble wrap and nothing was broken which I read</li>
            <li> Colors a bit dull compared to the picture.  </li>
            <li> But it does stay on in fact it was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> the colors are dull on skin</li>
            <li> Normally I only wear browns or the like, do to having predominantly green eyes, BUT I have found with a little bit of a base cover</li>
            <li> The outside of the box was covered with eyeshadow,so when I touched the box my hands were dirty.</li>
            <li> Even with my Mac and Sephora brushes, I have to go over my lid at least 3 - 4 times to achieve the color that I want.</li>
            <li> I do normally like e.l.f. products, but I was disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> Not very happy...</li>
            <li> palette is a mix of matte and shimmer colors, but when I say &#x27;shimmer&#x27; I mean shimmer not sparkle.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was expecting at least a few of the shadows to be broken, but I opened the package and all the shadows were in tact!</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering throwing it away because I thought it was beyond salvation.</li>
            <li> I don´t recommend if you´re thinking of using this seriously.</li>
            <li> IS NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eyeshadows are not specially good.</li>
            <li> I also think that the eyeshadow is not good quality.  </li>
            <li> Imagine me as a nurse going to work with red fingers :-(  </li>
            <li> So needless to say I have a hard time finding colors that work with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get any sort of coverage - I had to apply 2-3 times to get what I was looking for, and the shadow itself is difficult to even get on the brush - I almost had to scrape it with a fingernail to get the color to even appear on the brush.   </li>
            <li> Bath and body works, Victoria secret,  Beyoncé, Taylor swift, Disney, coach, make-up, tablets, phones)</li>
            <li> about 7 of the colors are broken...</li>
            <li> There was one broken eyeshadow</li>
            <li> mine was also shipped well-protected and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> It arrived poorly packaged and some of the eye shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> Came to me dusty and damaged.</li>
            <li> The palette came and not one shadow was broken thank God</li>
            <li> looks like some folks have problems with colors being broken on arrival</li>
            <li> Some of it was broken</li>
            <li> None of them were broken or anything.</li>
            <li> i got it all dusty and two colors broken like they dropped it or something</li>
            <li> that I didn&#x27;t with my Victoria&#x27;s Secret palettes.</li>
            <li> and there was like 8 shadows that was all broken into pieces.</li>
            <li> All broken and looked used.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> If you wet the applicator and use a base coat</li>
            <li> It arrived completely dirty and dusty from all the broken up makeup palettes.  </li>
            <li> i was a little disappointed of the purchase...</li>
            <li> The actually palette came in horrible quality.</li>
            <li> The lighter colors are difficult -- they lack pigmentation and don&#x27;t want to get on any of my brushes.</li>
            <li> but i have the same palette from elf and it is horrible</li>
            <li> Useless when it comes shattered and crumbled.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about the eyeshadows it that you need a base before you put the colors</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail, almost 10 of my shadows were broken!</li>
            <li> None of them we broken!</li>
            <li> I think it was absolutely ridiculous !!</li>
            <li> They are impossible to pick up, even with a primer (Urban Decay Primer Potion) and the fallout is quite terrible.</li>
            <li> I must say that the bubble protectors in the package that it was sent with were really disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It arrived so dirty .</li>
            <li> you will be sad &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I decided to try some Elf make-up myself, and I have to say it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in that a majority of the colors are shimmery when it was described to be a matte palette.</li>
            <li> The colors in the palette are not the ones that I ordered. :(</li>
            <li> Just I feel it will all be used up after  3-4 applications of each shade :(</li>
            <li> I use a base</li>
            <li> so that being said i don&#x27;t hate my choice</li>
            <li> but this palette works wonders for my base colors ^_^</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow lasts all day on my skin when I use a base.</li>
            <li> 10 bucks for all that eyeshadow really isn&#x27;t a bad deal at all!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I found the mirror inside fell off from the cover and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this project.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> To make matters worst</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible pigmentation!</li>
            <li> This is the worst eyeshadow I have ever used!</li>
            <li> The pigment is awful in almost every color and it does not blend well!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I give only four because the quality isn&#x27;t very great. Feels like you have to apply with finger to actually get the color to stay.</li>
            <li> Came the same as it looks in the picture, and most of the eyeshadows are incredibly pigmented. The blues especially. A few of the browns are dissapointedly sheer, but hey, a couple extra swipes and your good(: Definitely reccomend this to those who go for the more daring, bold looks, but for those who like to keep it natural I&#x27;d go for a smaller pallette with more shades of browns, which ELF definitely has. Hope this helped(:</li>
            <li> I really like this pallette. It has majority of the colors that you need. The only thing i dislike is that it doent fit in my make up drawer (which means i need to find a bigger drawer) lol but not taking away in stars for that. This palette is for all make up lovers. I like to expierement with different colors and this palette is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye shadow kit ever. It has every color you can ever need. The eye shadow goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow it works great for blending colors together and there are a lot of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, the colors are beautiful! This product allow me to creat master pieces on my eyes! I can match everything with all the colors. Last long!</li>
            <li> For 10 bucks, this is a steal. I&#x27;m a huge fan of e.l.f. products for their great value. E.l.f. products have never disappointed me, and this palette was no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wide selection of colors makes blending a no-brainer. As a cosplayer, I often need strange colors to complement my costumes, and I was able to use the green, blue, and pink shades for my costume makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems mentioned by other reviewers as to packaging and such. My palette arrived in perfect condition. I would 100% recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This palette is great, I love the shimmer and the flat colors perfect for work to date night. the colors are very bright and pretty!</li>
            <li> Just as pictured. Makeup came perfectly packed, no cracks or damage to the cakes. And the colors are super bright!</li>
            <li> Arrived intact.  Colors a bit dull compared to the picture.  But a good buy.</li>
            <li> ELF IS AN AMAZING BRAND YOUTUBE IS FULL OF TUTORIALS AND YOU CAN FIND THE FAVORITES FROM MAKEUP ARTIST IS AN AFFORTABLE BRAN WALMART, TARGET AND THEY HAVE THEIR WEB SITE FULL OF GREAT PRODUCTS ENJOY BUT DONT BUY IT HERE IS NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> I adore playing around with new cosmetics, and e.l.f. 100 Piece Eyeshadow Palette provides an amazing opportunity to experiment! The shades are a mixture of matte and shimmer. Of course, not every one is just what I would ordinarily use, but this set is a great way to make new discoveries. For the price, the quality is surprisingly good. I would definitely compare e.l.f to the regular drug-store brands that I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like to have some fun with new eyeshadow colors, this collection is one to choose.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.  It&#x27;s an inexpensive way to play around with new colors.  Some of the colors don&#x27;t have great pigmentation, but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it, and most of the shadows are just fine.  When I first got it I opened it up and just drooled over all the color choices, and didn&#x27;t know where to start lol.</li>

You will not be disappointed! I love this site and I have got alot of things free!!worth checking out!!</li>
            <li> This palette no only is in a beautiful selection, but it was also very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a beginner in the world of makeup, and only being able to use my fingers (because I didn&#x27;t get my brushes in time for the event), I was able to actually apply the makeup, and it was very smooth and very solid in color. The blend mixes were easy too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to add a bit more pop to your eyes, this palette is for you. I would definitely order one again!</li>
            <li> Really good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Very glad I ordered it! Colors are very nice. I don&#x27;t use primer So it doesn&#x27;t stay vibrant all day, which works for me, but i heard using eye primer makes it even better. Great variety of colors. In my case, only one color was cracked but packaging in general was neat and arrived quickly. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Mine came without any damage to the palettes nor the small mirror inside&lt;br /&gt;-so many colors to choose from&lt;br /&gt;-affordable&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the colors do not stay unless you use a primer&lt;br /&gt;-with so many palettes, this is not something you can easily travel with so if you need touch-ups, you&#x27;ll be lugging around this large thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a makeup newbie like myself, this was a great way to experiment with what colors work and what doesn&#x27;t. I had read reviews about others having shipping damage, but bought it anyway because of the price. Luckily, mine didn&#x27;t have any damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for eye shadow palette for a while and found this product at Target. There are many variation of this product, but this one seemed like the best value out of all since it contained more colors compared to other five dollar ones that had only one third of these colors. I paid same price at Target plus tax.     When I opened the box, I found the mirror inside fell off from the cover and was very disappointed. I pressed it back on, it stayed little bit but fell off again. I don&#x27;t normally use these small mirrors anyway, so I was okay with it, but when I tried the colors on my skin, I was once again - disappointed.     The shadow colors when applied on skin looked much lighter than when I saw them on the palette. I had to put them multiple times to get the colors that I want. I tried applying pink and beige all over my eyelid and tried applying dark brown on the crease on my eye but it did not give me nearly the same effects as I had with other products.     I am thinking about returning this product and trying the Coastal Scents or Shany ones.</li>
            <li> Colors are not as pretty, frosty as I was looking for.  But it does stay on in fact it was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The description was perfect for this product and there were a great variety of colors to choose from.  Packaged very well and clean.</li>
            <li> When I received the package in the mail and opened it, it was a mess. The palette was covered in eyeshadow powder. All the dark brown and black powder completely covered all the brighter colors. It was a total mess. But after I cleaned up the mess from all the dark eye shadows the palette was fine.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these eyeshadows. There are so many colors to choose from, and I like to go out alot so i have a lot of fun deciding which color to use that night. I agree that some of the colors are a little dull, but if you add a little bit of water to the eyeshadow it helps alot. While some of the colors are dull, some of them are BEAUTIFUL and bright and they all stay on all night. You definitely cant beat it for the price :)</li>
            <li> I bought the eye shadow pallets for Christmas gifts and they were perfect! Great quality and quantity. Good variety of colors especially for the price. I would definatly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are decent, but for $10 it&#x27;s a pretty good value. Some shadows, the matte I believe, aren&#x27;t very pigmented and pretty chalky. With a good primer these shadows can do the job.</li>
            <li> I really liked this! I hope my niece likes it just as much! I am giving it to her for Christmas! I may order more! Thank you! Merry Chirstmas to you!  and Happy New Year! God Bless!</li>
            <li> although it came very quick...about 7 of the colors are broken...i don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s fault it is...but maybe it should be packaged a little better...  thanks though</li>
            <li> Eye shadows are bright and vibrant ( the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice) and there is a variety of different colors (100 to be exact). I received my package in a timely matter ( 4 days after ordered).  My money was well spent and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just received my palette in the mail today and it&#x27;s wonderful! All the colors are super perfect and I&#x27;ve wanted this palette for soooooo long!</li>
            <li> I almost exclusively use e.l.f. products and have always been happy with them. I know the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t always the most vivid, but primer does help with that. If you don&#x27;t expect MAC quality make-up, you&#x27;ll be very happy with this palette, especially for the price. I&#x27;m fortunate that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with anything broken or shattered, but I&#x27;ve always had positive experiences with Amazon &amp; I expect they&#x27;d handle the issue well.</li>
            <li> These shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented and you have to rub them in a lot and apply several coats to get a good shade plus I don&#x27;t wear many colors except browns tans golds and purples but I don&#x27;t like any of those in the pallet I never use it</li>
            <li> I really like this palette, and I can&#x27;t complain much! The color has great pigment for the brand and price as well... I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Ordered this from Target, once rec&#x27;d most were shades of brown! I think they put each palate together with whatever they have!! They must have only had browns that day. LOL. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I did my research on this product before buying. I found a really great and informative review on you tube (...) which made me purchase it right away. I received my package 2 days later and was excited to open it. When I did, about 4 eye shadows were shattered. They also mixed in with the other colors. Amazon was great about the situation and sent me a free replacement without returning the other. I advised them that it needs bubble wrap or some padding to prevent it from banging against the box and messing up. I received package number 2 and this time only 2 eye shadows were messed up (no bubble wrap). Be prepared to clean up when you receive your eyeshadows.     Eyeshadows: I think all the colors are great. Some are too powdery (like a really light pink that was all over the packaging) and others are lacking that bold popping color (like the black). It is also a mixture of Matte and Shimmer shadows which is a plus. If you look at the review on you tube you can get a more elaborate and detailed look of this product (...). This is not me in the video. It is just a great review.    I personally like the product. Every color is great. I would have given 5 stars if it would have arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> So elf products are sorta sketchy sometimes because with my experience with them they sort of just wipe off pretty easily, I love the cheap prices on their makeup though so I can&#x27;t really complain all that much. The color selection is great on this pallette but to really bring out the color and pigments it takes some time.</li>
            <li> If your a beginner then these eye shadows are for you. Very pigmented. Beautiful colors. Only one color was broken when I received mine in the mail</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s a nice looking palette for a small price. It came two days later. I must say that the bubble protectors in the package that it was sent with were really disappointing. They were deflated which could of caused such a mess with the palette. Luckily my eyeshadows were still intact. I highly recommend using some type of eye primer to make the colors stand out even more.</li>
            <li> Got it way before it was due to arrive looks just like the picture and in perfect condition.  I love the variety of colors and textures.  Cant wait to start experimenting with the colors.</li>
            <li> I found this at Target on sale for $8.50. I&#x27;ve never used E.L.F. brand before; I buy most of my makeup from the higher-end brands at Sephora (I&#x27;m not a snob, I just find that I get what I pay for with most makeup) and am an extreme makeup junkie, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much given how cheap it was.     I picked this up because I was looking for a cheap palette with really bright colors just for fun, and I&#x27;d looked here on Amazon but found this the best deal. I loved the bright colors and opened it as soon as I got home. The individual pans are quite large, with a lot of product. I used my finger to swatch a color on my arm and immediately noticed how smooth and pigmented it was, even with my finger instead of a brush and without eyeshadow primer. I was shocked. I have continued to swatch the other colors (it takes time with so many!) and have found only good things. All the colors are highly pigmented with a very wide variety of colors. Most are shimmery but some are matte and a few have micro-glitter. All are beautiful colors; even if they don&#x27;t look like it in the pan, they are on skin. I would say they all are wearable colors and they offer a huge variety of options for creating looks.     I used the palette today to create a brightish green smoky eye and they went on beautifully with zero fallout, even the sparkly ones, and lasted all day without creasing (with an eyeshadow primer). I still cannot get over how good they are and how many beautiful colors there are. I saw no breakage in any of the palettes at Target and haven&#x27;t experienced any in mine (I keep it at home, though). I would highly recommend this palette for anyone, whether you like bright colors or not.</li>
            <li> There are tons of awesome colors in this palette, however mine came with the case cracked and several of the colors had broken and powder was everywhere. Had it arrived intact this would be a 5 star. Pretty good value.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find none of the eyeshadow broken when I recieved this item.  It wasn&#x27;t in any sort of bubble wrap but was in excellent condition.  The colors are pretty dramatic when placed over an eye primer and it was a great buy for such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I bought this set mainly because it was only $10 for 100 different colors and I also liked the color choices they had. I really like the variety of colors they have, they go from natural looking colors to more bold colors. It is also fun to mix up the colors as well. The eyeshadow set is great for what its worth but in order for it to look really good it will take time. Make sure you put eye primer on before because the eyeshadow needs a base to grasp onto. Also make sure you have really good brushes so you will be able to apply the eyeshadow fully onto your eye. This will take time because in order for the colors to really come out you must reapply a lot before your finished but the outcome is great. If your the kind of girl/women that likes to make your eyeshadow real flashy this might not be for you, well it could work but it will take really longtime to do but if your the type that likes to make it look more natural and calm than this is great for you. I am satisfied with my purchase for what its worth but if it was the same price as the other eyeshadow sets I would probably not be as satisfied.</li>
            <li> First off, for the price, I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants a variety of eyeshadow. I&#x27;ve had mine for well over a year now, and I&#x27;d say 1/3 stay on really well, 1/3 are good, bold colors but tend to crease, and 1/3 are difficult to apply due to low quality. There&#x27;s even a good matte brown I will sometimes use in this palette for my brows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use any of these eyeshadows without applying eye primer, and I highly recommend using a makeup brush when applying. While some of the eyeshadows are bright when you first apply, without eye primer, many do not stay on the skin for long. With a primer and patience when applying, some of these eyeshadows can be mistaken for a much more expensive brand!</li>
            <li> So I just received my palette in the mail this morning and I ordered it 2 days ago, so the service was very quick. After reading the reviews, I was expecting at least a few of the shadows to be broken, but I opened the package and all the shadows were in tact! That was the first great thing. I was also expecting the shadows to be dull when applied to skin, but I tested a few of the brighter shadows and they showed up perfectly without having to apply layers and layers! Keep in mind that I have very fair skin too. The shadow went on smoothly and cleanly and looked beautiful. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fun to play with, lots of colors. Good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and it arrived within 7 days after placing order. So when I opened up I saw 2 colors were empty and messed up on all over the pallet. That was a gift for my wife so she decided to keep it anyway.</li>
            <li> Perfect condition and arrived within a week of ordering. The colors have great pigmentation on my skin tone although I am very pale. There was one broken eyeshadow but I fixed it. Overall amazing quality</li>
            <li> I have purchased this on many different occasions. I love the brand and all of the colors in the palette</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews about them receiving this in pieces, I was worried. However, it came in today and it was all in one piece! I love that there&#x27;s a wide variety of matte-shimmery-glittery. Worth $10 in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented colors. I really enjoy the vibrant colors.It is worth the money.Well packaged and all my pigments were intact.Try it I think you will like it,I like a lot of the e.l.f. products and their brushes.</li>
            <li> i originally bought this because it had all the colours i wanted. it came more or less intact (there was some make up spilled in the case but nothing major). however, because i have darker skin, the colours were not as vibrant as i wanted them to be. however, still a good product for the occassional makeup wearer as myself.</li>
            <li> Had read other reviews and saw that after receiving their packages the pallets were shattered. When I purchase mine I crossed all fingers that this would not be. Sad to say the same thing happened to me. Most of the red pigment coloured pallets along with 2 green ones were shattered. To make matters worst The other colours were so messed up with the broken pallets they all looked like one colour. I did my utmost best to clean up using a makeup application brush along with cotton balls and alcohol. In the end I cleaned up most excepting the white and my fingers were pretty stained with red. Imagine me as a nurse going to work with red fingers :-(  I am amusing this was as a result of poor packaging right? Dont think I will be buying anymore make up online. To think this was suppose to be my birthday treat. Aww well guess you cant win all the time. sigh!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality. Really good.</li>
            <li> I think the pic says it all</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow! It works well for the price, it&#x27;s not too dark. If you want it to come out dark don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. Compared to the price on the site and the price i got for it was cheap. The colors are really pretty when you put them on!!!</li>
            <li> I am trying to get a girlfriend and I think this will be a good gift! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 1  ! !! !!  !1  1 1</li>
            <li> some colors are great, some are more chalky and of a lower quality. i also watched a youtube review before purchasing this palette. overall, i&#x27;m still extremely pleased, for what you pay, you really get a lot of decent shadows! mine was also shipped well-protected and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this at amazon but at target, I did not liked it so much it is not pigmented enough. You have to keep rubbing the color on your eye so the color will stick. There are other eye shadow pallets here at amazon to choose from.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of colors to experiment. My Niece love matching her eye shadow to her cloths and this product lets you have fun.</li>
            <li> Alright, well I gave this item 5 stars, though I did find one minor discrepancy: My friend bought the E.L.F. palette from Target during a promotional sale they held, and I loved it so much that I simply had to buy it. Now, I didn&#x27;t have my friend&#x27;s palette in front of me while I was ordering this palette, but I thought that some of the colors were a bit off from hers. I really wanted her exact palette, but I couldn&#x27;t be positive that any of the colors were actually different, so I ordered this palette anyway. Turns out, a few of the colors actually are a bit different from the other palette; maybe  just a shade or 2 darker. I didn&#x27;t see the other palette on line though, but her palette had more matte colors than this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;ve seen an E.L.F. palette from a Target dealer, this isn&#x27;t the exact same palette, but it&#x27;s comparably close. Just as good, same basic colors, just a few a shade or two darker. No biggie (hence 5 stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is a mix of matte and shimmer colors, but when I say &#x27;shimmer&#x27; I mean shimmer not sparkle. In light, you can see the reflective speckles, but after application, the powder comes off looking more satin like than shimmery, so if you&#x27;re a fan of pearl/satin textured shadows, this one&#x27;s for you. A plus is that the same palette also has matte colors, so there&#x27;s something for every one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors are perfectly pigmented for my skin tone. I have light to medium (touch of Olive to tan depending on whether or not I&#x27;m tan or if it&#x27;s summer), and these colors are perfect for those tones. They aren&#x27;t a vibrant as they seem in the picture, but still pigmented enough that you get the color you&#x27;re applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outer 2 rows and the upper wells of the middle 4 rows are great for highlight colors, or even if you&#x27;re just looking for light coverage, while the bottom of the palette is good for the details, more accented looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadow wells are good sized, especially compared to some ofthe other brands of palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primer is a must, though most makeup fiends probably don&#x27;t dare apply shadow without some sort of primer anyway. Because these colors aren&#x27;t as highly pigmented as say, MAC, they don&#x27;t last as long without primer and apply lighter, but this IS a $10 palette, so don&#x27;t expect MAC quality (though I do love this palette, more than the ultra vibrant MAC/BH palettes, but I&#x27;m more of a subtle-color girl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to palettes or eyeshadow, I&#x27;d highly recommend this palette. It boasts a wide range of colors and hues, so you can play around with the various colors to see what works for you and what doesn&#x27;t before you move on to a more expensive palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own 12 palettes, now including this one, from a variety of brands (some of them high-end like MAC, Tarte, Too Faced and BH), and I very much like this palette. It&#x27;s actually the one I go straight for on a daily basis, for my work look, and it&#x27;s much more attractive looking in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps if you&#x27;re on the fence for whatever reason!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow platte is such a great product of e.l.f! When i first saw it on e.l.f&#x27;s website, I fell in love. It&#x27;s perfect for make-up artists and just right for those who do there own make-up. The best part.... Its one big platte of eyeshadow. Instead of carrying aroung a bunch of mini eyeshadows or different sets, you have every color of the rainbow, AND MORE  love it wouod recomend it to ANYONE great birthday presant also(;</li>
            <li> 10 bucks for all that eyeshadow really isn&#x27;t a bad deal at all! I will be honest and say that you get what you pay for! The brighter colors work wonderfully on me (the pinks, greens, blues). But then again I have very pale skin. I&#x27;m wondering if these colors will be just as vibrant on darker skinned girls.  Using a primer on my eyelid before applying did help brighten the eyeshadow.  Be warned, it takes several layers of this eyeshadow to show.  The black is more of a grey and not as dark as you&#x27;d probably like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this and I use it from time to time.  I&#x27;d recommend this for young girls, maybe for costume ideas.</li>
            <li> even with a primer this shadow did not show up, im pale and not even the purples showed up on my skin!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price, my girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as all the other eyeshadow I have ever used, better than some actually. It has a super wide variety, goes on evenly, stays on as long as my other eyeshadow. This is the cheapest good makeup I have ever seen, I would suggest it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This palatte came with another palette that I ordered. The ELF palette was as nearly wrapped and secured as the other palette and alot of the shadows were broken and all over the place.</li>
            <li> There are a great blend of colors, I just wish they were more pigmented so that it pops on black skin.</li>
            <li> Colors stay all day long, Every color in here is my favorite. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I wont be buying eye shadows for a long time!</li>
            <li> Great for casual, great for going out, great for even holidays! I recommend it to every girl :) you could do some great Halloween makeup ideas with the funky colors too.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I have so many choices. I have used it to go out and to practice on new looks. I love the shimmer in all the colors</li>
            <li> I use a lot of E.L.F. products and I kept hearing good things about this, so I thought I would try it. It&#x27;s nice nd I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. The colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li> There are enough colors here (and the shadows are good enough quality) for you to try out some new looks and see what you like, but they don&#x27;t hold up very well. For $10 though it&#x27;s not bad at all. I think it would be best to use this kit to save money experimenting with some new looks, before buying something better in the colors you like.</li>
            <li> I have used all sort of make up - from one end of the spectrum to the other, both cheap and expensive and everything in between. I loved that this had a bunch of different colors I could play around with, so I ordered one, but immediately found out that something in the eye shadows cause an allergic reaction to me - eyelids puff up and get extremely itchy, eyes get all watery and red. Disappointed!!! Nothing has ever caused me to have an allergic reaction before, and nothing in my daily routine was changed except for this eyeshadow (it especially effected the area of the eyelid in direct contact with the eyeshadow), so I will unfortunately have to throw this out. I will not be using any e.l.f product again.</li>
            <li> I got this palette from Target over Christmas and I absolutely love it!  It has a great variety of colors and, despite what other reviewers have said, I think it has plenty of pigment to it.  You just have to know how to apply it.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.  Lots of eye shadow, small price.</li>
            <li> It is a all right Eyeshadow Palette the colors are NOT strong at all and unless you feel like pressing them on your eyelid for 30 minutes for some color payoff I recommend not buying this. The colors are very varied and dimensional. You can go from sassy everyday, to life of the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All together, It&#x27;s a good cheap buy, but it takes awhile to get color payoff.</li>
            <li> When I got this item i was not pleased. The outside of the box was covered with eyeshadow,so when I touched the box my hands were dirty. Also when I opened the box some of the colors were missing. In all I was not pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering these again. I ordered two because the price was so great; I read reviews that the shadow would not apply or would &amp;#34;flake&amp;#34; when applying but I haven&#x27;t had either problem and I&#x27;ve used every color in the tray. Great deal; great buy!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this palette so much! The colors look so good and they stay on long. I highly recommend this eyeshadow. I give this an A+!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow palette. There isn&#x27;t much else I need to say about it, It has every single color you could possibly want. My favorite part is that some of the colors are matte and some are shimmery. I already buy e.l.f. products so I figured this product would be as i expected. I highly recommend buying this if you are unsure. Its perfect for the price and it shipped so fast. Arrived about 4 days after I ordered!</li>
            <li> I gave the make up one star because I got it two days after I placed the order.  The container that holds the make up was broken and one full eye-shaddow was missing, and bits were missing out of others. I now have eye shaddow ALL over my room and now on my laptop and bed. I do NOT reccomend.</li>
            <li> I have always been hesitant to use Elf make up because I am not a fan using make up that I can buy at a grocery store.  A lot of my friends have been using Elf products and really liked the quality of it.  I decided to try some Elf make-up myself, and I have to say it&#x27;s not too bad.  If I am looking for something inexpensive that I want to wear over my eye lids, this would be the go to palette.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bff on Christmas, She LOVES IT!! If you want something cheep but good then this is you&#x27;re palette</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I am African American and the color of Milk Chocolate. So needless to say I have a hard time finding colors that work with my skin tone. However this palette is great. I do have to use a base/primer to wear it so that the color can be true. The only problem is that some of the eyeshadows seem loose and chalky. Which means it can get messy due to the looseness of the eyeshadows. They are also very low pigment so they are not vibrant colors. They are more so subtle and I like that.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get this palette; it was cheap and had a wide variety of colors. First off, I&#x27;m African American with a medium brown skin tone and these colors do NOT pop. Some of the colors aren&#x27;t too bad if your going for a natural look, the darker/heavier shades arent bad either; however, you will definitely need a really good primer/base for these colors to show and stay on. Overall it was only $10 so hey, make the best out of it.</li>
            <li> The colors are not vibrant at all and far too powdery... I use a base and I still can&#x27;t get any of the colors to STAY. So, I&#x27;d never buy it again.</li>
            <li> i loved all the colors and would recommend this product to friends and family, and i will order this again.</li>
            <li> The item was as i expected</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow kit I only wonder why it is a bit much on here as I had previously purchased mine from Target for only ten dollars. But it is nice to be able to find it on here in case you can&#x27;t get out and have to order online. I found the eyeshadow to be easy to blend and create some lovely smokey eye looks, it helps to also use a base on the eye before applying the colors really pop.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this project.  It arrived completely dirty and dusty from all the broken up makeup palettes.  At least four colors are completely missing, and two are mostly missing.  I am very disappointed.  This might be a good item to buy in a store; but it does not survive shipping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much use I get out of this stuff. The colors aren&#x27;t all super vibrant, but I don&#x27;t go for very colorful looks much. Not great for all-day wear without a primer, but works fine for short-term wear and primed eyelids.</li>
            <li> When you first see it 100 colors for $10.00 who wouldnt buy it. When it came in the mail a couple of days after I ordered it I was excited to open it.  But when I opened it, it was eyeshadow EVERY where it was a mess. All the colors where mixed up and some were missing. I tryed to use it but every time I use it, its a big mess but the colors that didnt get messed up are very pretty.</li>
            <li> product came in perfect condition.. just in time for my overseas trip!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;again SUPER FAST SHIPPING. Elf is my makeup brand, I already have the 100 palette but decided to give it to some family members. They are very pigmented, make sure you use a good primer before.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow palette includes many great colors that a very flattering on my fair complexing, without being too overpowering and making me look like a clown, which is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally get super funky with my eye shadow but when I do, like around Halloween, I need some kind of pallet for all of the colors.  Usually I use mineral make-up and while I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t have the vibrant ability like your standard eye shadows do.  So I started looking for a pallet and the last thing I wanted to do was pay hundreds for a crazy name when I&#x27;ll rightly be passing this thing onto my grandkids for all I&#x27;ll use it.  So I dug a little deeper and I was kind of creeped out about buying no brand name eyeshadow over the internet.  Wiggy.  Luckily I came across the e.l.f. brand, which I&#x27;ve known and used before so I immediately pounced.  All those colors for so little?  Yes, please.  It&#x27;ll help my Halloween costume greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely a solid selection of colors and if you&#x27;re looking to get funky Halloween make-up it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.  The only issue I had was the packaging sucked.  I pulled it out of the box and all it had for cushioning was a little plastic air bubble.  The box itself was crushed and when I took it out I found one of the eyeshadows shattered.  There was powder EVERYWHERE and some of the really light colors still have remnants of this shattered gray in it.  I didn&#x27;t bother initiating a return for a single smashed eyeshadow, especially when it&#x27;s still useful (there&#x27;s still a decent amount of color there).  Just be forewarned.  Based on some of he reviews I&#x27;ve seen I&#x27;m not the only one this happened to.  I was lucky in that it was only one eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a wise pallet purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it almost daily (with a good eyeshadow primer). The colors blend well together with the right brushes if you want to achieve that MAC look. I&#x27;m buying one for my mom when it&#x27;s back in stock.</li>
            <li> It was awesome, so many colors to choose from and play with. Eyeshadow were great not one cracked. Great buy.</li>
            <li> A large variety of colors</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product because of the low price and how many colors I was getting. When I put it on, I realized why it was priced so low. It&#x27;s more powdery than other eyeshadows, and thus doesn&#x27;t leave colors well. I spent 20 minutes applying it and was left with a light, bland color. I don&#x27;t regret buying it, however. I still think it&#x27;s a good buy; I like having a large palette, and it fits my day to day needs.</li>
            <li> I usually love ELF products for their cheap prices and quality products, but I am not impressed with this one. The shadows are very sheer, and some are very glittery to the point of looking like a craft store got dumped on my eyes. The powder does not stay, and smudges onto fingers and around the eyes. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> really cheap product, lots of excess, when u apply it it tends to powder and bleed on other parts of your face, sometimes leaving smears. good to have only as secondary</li>
            <li> It arrived poorly packaged and some of the eye shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> I got this because of the wide range of colours. I use it for bruise makeup and it work great. Only thing to keep in mind if you&#x27;re using it for the same reason is that most of the colours have sparkles in them. Cameras haven&#x27;t really seemed to pick them up, but it&#x27;s still something to be wary about.</li>
            <li> I wanted this palette in order to try out having a variety of colors to start off with as a beauty junkie. It has vibrant colors but I was disappointed in that a majority of the colors are shimmery when it was described to be a matte palette.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome palette for the money, the shadows aren&#x27;t as pigmented as some higher-end brands but they work well and you can create so many beautiful looks. I would suggest getting it directly from the E.L.F. website because it is cheaper ($10) and if you get it on a sale, which happens often, you can get it for half price or get a free gift thrown in. You have to pay for shipping though unless you spend a certain amount ($25 or $35 depending). I definitely recommend this eyeshadow set.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love ELF products! All of these colors for 10 bucks? You can&#x27;t beat that! And the colors are so pigmented MAC and Urban Decay can take a flying leap because ELF has stolen my heart.</li>
            <li> The set has a color for everything - I bought it to supplement face painting colors, and for occasional use.  If you wet the applicator and use a base coat the colors are really vibrant, or apply dry for a more subtle look.</li>
            <li> this item was for me because i love to match my eye shadow with my clothes and how the colors just set my clothes off</li>
            <li> Please do NOT buy this product online. E.L.F is an affordable makeup line that is sold in Target. I have two sets just like this and they were each under $5. Please just look this up at your local Target and go out and grab one there! Great product tho. Lots of variety and an amazing price. A nice start-up brand when you are first experimenting with makeup.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors broke up but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> One of the shadows broke I think because there wasn&#x27;t enough protection..</li>
            <li> Normally I only wear browns or the like, do to having predominantly green eyes, BUT I have found with a little bit of a base cover the pigments are wonderful! maybe only needing 1 or 2 applications.</li>
            <li> Love it. But I need more darker colors!</li>
            <li> Very big kit....,bigger than I expected. Has many colors...u can use the white tone to lighten colors if u want. I like it....</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. So many colors for the price. Some look a little different than you would expect from looking at it on the palette (the gold is more of a shiny orange on me - but that was a pleasant surprise, I think it looks cool!). The colors I have tried are all very vibrant and pretty. This isn&#x27;t something I use everyday but there is enough variety to if I wanted. I mostly use it for going out and try a complementary color to my outfit. No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Came to me dusty and damaged. Makeup got all over my hands when I took it out of its package and at least 6 shadows were empty. They sent me a new one and in this one only 2 were empty...just don&#x27;t do it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine a week and I absolutely LOVE it!!! I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my eye makeup in my life, let alone one week. I try to match or compliment my eye shadow to what I&#x27;m wearing and I never have a problem with that using this pallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said there are some things I don&#x27;t like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-if you don&#x27;t use a primer, you will have to reapply several times through out the day. I use the e.l.f. primer. It can be bought at kmart for $1. I&#x27;ve seen other people say it&#x27;s also available at target for about the same price. I want to try to too faced  Shadow insurance. My cousin uses it and as soon as I try hers I&#x27;ll update this to let yall know which of those is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s is very powdery. If you use brushes or sponge type applicators you&#x27;ll probably waste a good bit. I use a dampened finger tip(middle finger for lighter touch) and I don&#x27;t see the loose powder every where&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-there are shimmer and mattes in this pallet but the shimmer ones done have much shimmer to them. This is my first time using this brand. I find that the El cheapo pallets from the dollar general have better shimmer than this. And of course your drug store brands(physicians formula, Revlon,  maybellene, etc) have better shimmer as well. I find if I take my cheapo pallets and use the lightest shimmer color I have and lightly sweep over what I used out of my e.l.f. pallet it gives me the shimmer I&#x27;m missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would definitely buy this pallet again. The pros out weigh the cons in my book, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Niece is in make up heaven!</li>
            <li> Okay first off when I recieved this product half of the colors where missing I guess from being moved around on the truck, idk but there was no bubble wrap around it to protect it so I see why it did that. Two, the eyeshadow is very powdery. Even with eyelid primer that I used, it did not stay. In my opinion save your money and go to the store to buy u less you want half of your eyeshadow colors missing.</li>
            <li> She was really happy to get it... loves the colors she wants me to find more like it just different colors</li>
            <li> The actually palette came in horrible quality. A couple of the darker cells broke and when i opened it shadow was everywhere, the lighter colors were covered in gray shadow, and the whole top was just gross. After cleaning up the palette a little it was okay. The colors are good but not great. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase in the future through an online service such as amazon.</li>
            <li> like this product and would order it again.</li>
            <li> On TIME! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I use this pallet for colorful looks and it works fine. I just need to reapply certain colors a couple times to give off the true color.I wish their were matte colors in it. Some of the whiter colors give off a pinkish pigment so beware.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great variety of eye shadows for a great price, but you&#x27;ll probably never use half of them, and the shadows themselves don&#x27;t stick to my eyelids very well, usually requiring 2-4 applications for best results. Overall, not a bad purchase for the money, but not an awesome one.</li>
            <li> Overall you get your money&#x27;s worth. But, colors fade easily, are not vibrant, and the makeup itself is more powdery. Get a good primer and it helps it out some. Good makeup for someone just starting to experiment.</li>
            <li> i really love the colors provided in the pack but was upset to see that there was one palette missing when it arrived and there were colors popped out of where they were glued in. so it kind of came all messy but other than that i really like the colors, i wish there was more makeup inside each little square but i dont put much on so i guess that doesnt matter !</li>
            <li> Awesome deal!! Great colors!! and I love the variety of colors. I use them all!! Great product, I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> So i got my palette today.  I was exactly what i ordered.  The palette came and not one shadow was broken thank God but i do wish there was some bubble wrap.  The colors work fabulously some more than others.  I do still love it though i wish that there were more bright colors than neutrals.  This palette is great for a novice like me. :P  For a more detailed review watch this video: [...]</li>
            <li> i got this for my younger sister as a birthday present thinking it would be good since it&#x27;s e.l.f. brand and most of their products are decent for the price. i guess i was mistaken. my sister said some of the colors were good but not all of them were the best quality. however i didn&#x27;t expect anything high-end since this was only $10. for those who are looking for a multicolor palette, i would suggest getting a coastal scents palette instead. overall i probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this. i would rather pay a little bit extra for a better product.</li>
            <li> A bit messy once item was received however; good purchase</li>
            <li> i was a little disappointed of the purchase... the eye shadow itself is very smooth and well made(of course its e.l.f.), it does look beautifully when you blend.. but it does take a few times to apply when you want a more deeper tone to your shadow, so some of the comments are correct: YOU definitely need a primer to bring out the color ORRR continually applying until it darkens, which i prefer don&#x27;t lol(use primer) .. so that being said i don&#x27;t hate my choice, i just feel this palette wasn&#x27;t for me. it would be for someone whose looking for more of a natural look, but i&#x27;m sure the purchase is for those who prefer that over a more smokey eye.. or a darker color blend. but this palette works wonders for my base colors ^_^ so i&#x27;m still putting it to good use.. i&#x27;m getting my moneys worth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyone likes the soft, warm and more natural look, this palette is for you!&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for bold vibrant looks,,, it is the wrong palette... you will be sad &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I bought this palette because I needed one with a wide range of colors, and I really liked the pinks (what I was looking for) The price made it attractive, since I could get all of this for the same price as I could a set of JUST pinks. e.l.f had done me ok in the past, but the quality of the shadow in this set is marginal at best. It&#x27;s hard to get any sort of coverage - I had to apply 2-3 times to get what I was looking for, and the shadow itself is difficult to even get on the brush - I almost had to scrape it with a fingernail to get the color to even appear on the brush.   The packaging is flimsy and cheap, and this isn&#x27;t portable in the least bit. I didn&#x27;t rate it 1 star because I can make it do some alright stuff if I work for it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I got what I paid for, for sure.</li>
            <li> So I researched other reviews and saw they were mixed before I actually purchased this palette. Some people really like or really dislike.  I ordered this set and do NOT like it at all.  The colors that look pigmented, like the fuscia&#x27;s and purples barely show up. My advice, spend a little more and go with another palette.  There is no point of having all these shadows if you can&#x27;t use them because they don&#x27;t show up, even with a primer.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter, she liked them</li>
            <li> Horrible pigmentation! Only used a few times. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone! Waste of money! Especially since you can find it cheaper on the website and at walgreens itself!</li>
            <li> well i bought this.&lt;br /&gt;to replace the shany cosmetics 7 layer kit.&lt;br /&gt;really didn&#x27;t like that brand xP lol.&lt;br /&gt;gave this four stars.&lt;br /&gt;cause i didn&#x27;t really try it yet.&lt;br /&gt;but their brushes amazed me.&lt;br /&gt;and people on youtube give e.l.f. great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;and when I got this in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;nothing was broken.&lt;br /&gt;not one square ;3 hehe.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the mirror on the inside ;].&lt;br /&gt;the included smudgey brushes not so much.&lt;br /&gt;nice touch though.&lt;br /&gt;i did do a swatch on my finger.&lt;br /&gt;and them pinks glow like the sun lol.</li>
            <li> I really like my new eyeshadow palette. It&#x27;s fun using different colors to liven up my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that 6 of the shadows were busted and completely spilled out during&lt;br /&gt;the shipping process.</li>
            <li> I like the actual product HOWEVER when I received my shipment, some of the shadows were broken up and had mixed in with other colors.  One of the greens is almost half missing.</li>
            <li> the product arrived in good condition and complete. This page has 100 colors box shadows, very nice colors. Product quality is good and would return to buy the product in a future.</li>
            <li> Originally bought for the green eyeshadows for St. Patty&#x27;s Day but also for the bounty of other colors for costume nights or theme nights. They can go on somewhat soft but if you get the brush a little wet when applying it really bumps the color up quite a bit. I wish there was more of a variety of bolder colors now that I&#x27;m straying from more natural tones but overall there&#x27;s a color for every need that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like some folks have problems with colors being broken on arrival but mine arrived in perfect shape. All the colors were intact, the mirror was secure and it&#x27;s been able to take a bit of wear and tear from my general clumsiness. It goes on smoothly and lasts as long as I need so all around it&#x27;s been a good purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this palette off the elf website, I do not like it at all. The colors do not pop, they are boring nothing vibrant or pretty about these colors. They look nothing like the pictures. I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste your money nothing special about this in fact the moisturing lipstick are a greasy mess too. Won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore elf products the quality is no good hence the cheap prices.</li>
            <li> Love all of the colors</li>
            <li> When I got the item I found some other makeup power covering the eyeshadow and the packaging, I also saw some of the colors chipped. I know it was a cheap product, but the condition for it being new was unacceptable. Definitely not what I&#x27;m used to when ordering.</li>
            <li> i gave those to my your niece and she loved it, great price for 100 different colors!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars is due to the blending capabilities being on the fair side. If this is purchased  for anyone under 20  who doesnt know the difference than more than likely they will love it! great color options for experimenting .</li>
            <li> The quality of this eyeshadow is good. It stays on good, and doesn&#x27;t rub off too easy. however the top could have been made better. The second day i had it my mom was opening it and the whole top snapped off. i have to be careful how i open and close it now. other than that the eyeshadow colors are very pretty, would reccomend.</li>
            <li> When received it has a broken powder which made a huge mess. But 99 out of 100 is still good. And it was probably done in shipping. Lots of very pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Some of it was broken</li>
            <li> I love shopping on Amazon, so when I saw my favorite brand E.L.F. products and was amazed at the price, however I was very dissatisfied with the delivery of the palette as 5 colors were completely crushed which really makes me upset since I can&#x27;t return the palette because I need those colors for my outfits this weekend. Otherwise I wouldve easily given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, The color doesn&#x27;t show up. I&#x27;m darker toned but it took a lot to get the colors to look something like they appear. It just sits there and its like you have on some kitty makeup.</li>
            <li> the selection of colors is very good, versatile, i dont need another pallette when i have this one handy, but the color are so faint, i have to aply many coats of color to make it look vivid.</li>
            <li> It was a mess everything was broken even the box i was really looking forward to it&lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be a gift but that didn&#x27;t happen..</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Great pigmentation, no complaints. I always use a primer, it ensures wearability and depth of color. As long as you do that, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Received on time , packed well, and the colors are vived, and beautiful. Love this product.</li>
            <li> some of the colors in here are sparkly and its really pretty plus you really get ALOT of different shades in this</li>
            <li> Even with a primer, a good number of these colors lack decent pigmentation. Most of the browns are fine, along with the goldens. Some of the colors perform nicely, but most don&#x27;t. The lighter colors are difficult -- they lack pigmentation and don&#x27;t want to get on any of my brushes. I&#x27;ve had to really dig into the color to get anything, and the payoff was never worth it. Doesn&#x27;t matter which primer I use or if I use a white base underneath, too many of these colors just don&#x27;t show up well. Some will have color if I apply it three or four times, but by then it starts to look heavy and already crease-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this for a younger girl as cheap play make-up, but it&#x27;s not worth it for anyone else. There are palettes with better pigmentation in a similar price range.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size, about the sheet of a piece of paper maybe. The colors are in squares that are somewhat small. The makeup is great. Tons of different colors. None of them were broken or anything. Great colors. I&#x27;ve used it every day since I&#x27;ve gotten it.</li>
            <li> So much eyeshadow that I dont know what to do with myself. I bought this almost 3 years ago and still have tons more to use</li>
            <li> I knew these were a long shot, but I usually like ELF products. My makeup case is full of MAC and Benefit, but I do also have several ELF cosmetics in there, as well as their Elf studio brushes. At $0.10 a shade, these aren&#x27;t even worth that. They are impossible to pick up, even with a primer (Urban Decay Primer Potion) and the fallout is quite terrible. They don&#x27;t blend well, and I just don&#x27;t fancy these at all.</li>
            <li> this was a very good make up set i loved this. it was cheap and beautiful this was a really good deal</li>
            <li> I didnt purchase this product online but i have the same palette from elf and it is horrible there are only a couple of the colors that are pigmented i mostly only use the top four on the left side of the palette at a highlighter under my brow and the gold thats it maybe the black as a eyeliner so if i were you i would spend a couple more bucks and go to bh cosmetics and get there 88 palette</li>
            <li> I just ordered this palette a few hours ago. I should receive this by Saturday. I&#x27;m not really into anything too bright and bold and based on the review this palette was okay for them since the colors weren&#x27;t so bright. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I use this product for everyday make up....it works alright. i never use the brighter shades. Maybe there is some product which does not have so many colours.</li>
            <li> Bright colors and they last all day with a primer.</li>
            <li> good colors but you have to apply layers and use primer if you want pop</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast! The palette was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap, and nothing was broken. Completely satisfied with this product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very good product love it</li>
            <li> This is a great product with a great price on it. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and I recommend this eyeshadow palette for anyone, especially for beginners that want to experiment with makeup.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift so cannot rate on performance. However, colors looked nice and vibrant. Small set. My niece was super excited about it.</li>
            <li> I have been buying elf products for a while now but, I have never tried their eyeshadows. When I was looking for a palette, I came across this. Knowing what I do about elf I figured I would give it a try. It was packaged perfectly, not a broken shadow in the set. The colors look a little more muted than they do in the picture but, I can live with that. Autumnish colors are more ky style anyway. I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> Nice quality of eyeshadow and lots of colors to play around with.  I love it.  Delivery was nice too, none was broken.  Will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This plate is so cheap that you cannot even complain about its quality. To be honest,this eyeshadow is have to put and easy to fade. But it is cheap, so just take it.</li>
            <li> It is very good quality and i just love it i I will most probably buy more e.l.f. products from amazon in the future</li>
            <li> I had heard of ELF and thought it would be an okay brand to purchase so I could practice my make up with. I was a bit worried about the quality though and I guess I didn´t worry in vain. Several of the eyeshadows had loosened and where loose inside the palette when I received it. Needles to say that it was a huge mess! Several of the colors are now tainted. One of the eye shadows completely dissolved and was extremely hard to clean from the entire thing. I was seriously considering throwing it away because I thought it was beyond salvation. But I cleaned it up and glued the loose colors back on the palette and gave it too my little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows are not specially good. It looseness from the palette very easily, you get way too much with only one stroke of the brush and doesn´t contain much pigment. Most of the colors have lots of glitter in it, not the matt feeling I got from the picture. I don´t recommend if you´re thinking of using this seriously.</li>
            <li> This product is very good in my opinion. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that a couple of the colors were broken when I received it. The product has great pigmentation so you don&#x27;t need a lot. Overall it was worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> my wife was very excited with this eyeshadow palette until she realized that some colores were completely destroyed, I guess this was caused during packing or transport, but amazon or courier should take more care on packing this kind of items properly to avoid these inconveniences. Now my wife&#x27;s palette has four colors missing due to this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you anything about the product because when I got it,  it was so damaged I couldn&#x27;t tell one color from the other,  it was just a powder mixed together.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and use top name brand for my customers, I really love ELF its inexpensive and a delivers a good product. Product arrived in perfect condition and earlier than expected. great experience, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived in 2 days half of them were gone with the pieces of them everywhere ! Good product but not handled with care !</li>
            <li> The packaging was Perfect, they put the 6 different elf items I ordered together in a box and nothing was wrong at all :)&lt;br /&gt;I love elf always have, pretty cheap online or I can go to target and get things for a $1. Of course it&#x27;s not the best out there but for the price it&#x27;s amazing. I love my 100 piece palette, so many different colors to use instead of paying over $60 for small things of eyeshadow from MAC or other places. I use my elf primer before applying the eye shadow which makes it look 10 times better. I would definitely invest in elf they are awesome :)</li>
            <li> I was concerned about buying make-up online because of the shipping, but I shouldn&#x27;t have been. Amazon packaged this item well and the eye shadow itself is wonderful to use. I use it with the e.l.f. primer and it stays on very well.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. I like having such a large color pallette without having to buy 40 different products!</li>
            <li> I love this palette and the colors I&#x27;ve tried so far, the colors hold well and doesn&#x27;t crease like other eyeshadows but the golden color (2nd column 3rd row) is very frail and creates a lot of powder even with the gentlest strokes of an applicator (luckily I don&#x27;t use that color much), all in all it is a great product. Also it came wrapped tightly in 2 layers of bubble wrap and nothing was broken which I read was an issue with some of the other reviews so I was glad when I opened the box to see everything was intact.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Has a lot of colors to choose from!  Is in a nice case for keeping.  Great product with huge assortment of colors to choose from</li>
            <li> This was an amazing deal and after reading some reviews I was a little weary but I figured for the price I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  I got the case in perfect condition, and sampled some of the colors immediately and was shocked with the great quality!  I normally use MAC eyeshadows but wanted some fun &amp; funky colors for New Year&#x27;s and the quality was so good that after I applied it I wouldn&#x27;t have known it wasn&#x27;t MAC!  I did use my usual MAC eyeshadow primer so that might have made it better but even just testing the colors on my hand they went on bright and smooth.  I got compliments all night on my eyes on New Year&#x27;s and even the next day at the diner was told my eye makeup still looks perfect!  I&#x27;m ordering another one for my friend&#x27;s upcoming birthday because I&#x27;m so impressed with this.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see an eyeshadow palette with 100 colors for only $10! The only problem with it is that the eyeshadow isn&#x27;t very good quality but I knew I couldn&#x27;t expect a lot from it. It seems like some colors don&#x27;t work as well as others also. For example, one of the golds is kind of weird, but I love how the silver and some of the pinks work. I don&#x27;t like the little brush-thingies that come with it because they are really flimsy, but I just use ones from other palettes. I would rate this 3.5 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Since i discovered Urban Decay i swore i would never bother with cheap eyeshadow again. However this palette has changed my mind! There are a million gorgeous colors but more importantly, the consistency is great. Definitely not as lush and micronized as ud, but they do the job well. They are all pearlized slightly which I find makes blending so much easier. I have been using urban decays primer underneath and i think that makes a big difference too. With all the colors i feel like a kid in a candy store!! The colors are buildable too. I&#x27;m in love.  The shipper really needs to package this better though. Many of the reviewers mentioned broken pieces and one of my shadows came loose in shipping also. Luckily it didn&#x27;t smash and get everywhere and i just popped it back into place.  All in all I&#x27;m amazed that i could get such a huge variety of fun pretty colors in quality shadows for such a low price. This palette is a steal, buy it!</li>
            <li> Although I received the package and it was not damaged. The colors in the palette are not the ones that I ordered. :(</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this for someone that&#x27;s just getting into makeup I think this would be an ideal palette since it&#x27;s cheap for a lot of colors.  The quality is inconsistent.  Some of the colors I&#x27;ll barely touch with my brush and a TON of powder comes off, which can be messy.  Other colors I have to practically attack with my brush to get anything off!&lt;br /&gt;However, since it&#x27;s only $10, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I recieved some of the eyeshadows completely destroyed and damaged. Some of them survived. Amazon gave me a quick solution to the problem and refund my money, so I am not angry nor dissapointed at them. By the way, I recieved an excellent customer service and would definitely buy something from them again. But I think for future reference, they should protect the product with bubble wrap. The shadows are very nice, I like the colours very much and the price is good for what you recieve. Eventhough I believe that they should include more blue colours on the palette or at least a basic blue (nice blues like ultramarine, cobalt or prussian are definitely missing). The other colours are fine. I have read in other customer reviews that some of the shadows have survived shipping, some have not. So be prepared to maybe loose some of the shadows if the seller doesn&#x27;t change the shipping issues. I have already contact them suggesting more protection when packaging this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Love the colors and everything was perfect when I got it.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t show up as bright as i had hoped. And some of them have popped out..</li>
            <li> Love it!! Use it on all my clients!!</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I have the coastal scent palette and this is just as good. It did come with the one of the colors completely missing and all over the place but amazon quickly sent me a replacement that was cover tightly in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> The product is good overall, eyeshadows are very pigmented. However the picture shows that there are different shades of pink and purple. The one i got has no pink and purple at all and only one blue. Too bad</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. The colours are vibrant and it was packaged with such care.</li>
            <li> ho scelto questo set perchè mi servivano gli ombretti,quindi ho approfittato del gran numero di ombretti presenti e del basso costo&lt;br /&gt;consiglio vivamente</li>
            <li> very nice variety of color</li>
            <li> Awesome. I thought for the price it wouldn&#x27;t be very opaque and it would wear off fast. Nope! This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I love the range of colors and the quality of the pigments! However, shipping made chunks of certain colors fall out of their palette and crumble all over the rest of the colors. I had to use compressed air to blow all the dust and crumbs off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I recommend this to anyone - just beware of shippping.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette and the sleek feel of it. Except, the actual eyeshadow was not as pigmented as I thought it would be and goes on somewhat light. Other than that, I love it</li>
            <li> I love elf cosmetics very much!!! Not only are the colors are beautiful but i love the fact you can use Milk pencil by NYX &amp; the colors would look very vibrant &amp; also you can use urban Decay primer &amp; it also do the say only it shimmers. My point is if you don&#x27;t use a primer for this product,most likely it won&#x27;t work out for you. :D toddles</li>
            <li> When I got it in the mail and opened it up it was used and really dusty.look at the picture I took of it</li>
            <li> you can really do amazing effects on your eyes with this, every girl should have this to get ready. MUST BUY</li>
            <li> Quality eyeshadow in every shade. Price was definitely right on this one. A great way to try different colors without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> After shipping, some of the eyeshadow had fallen out of the tray, maybe 2 colors out of the hundred.  Still 98 colors is a great bargain for the price.  I gave it as a gift and am unsure of the quality of the product.  It Is perfect for those who experiment with many colors.</li>
            <li> Would have been perfect if the plastic hadn&#x27;t been cracked all over :( otherwise good and arrived pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Nice pallette.  My daughter likes to dress up in all kids of different characters, like Monster High and Ever After High.  Great variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I love the colors but shipping sucked ! i got it all dusty and two colors broken like they dropped it or something</li>
            <li> Useless when it comes shattered and crumbled.</li>
            <li> This is the worst eyeshadow I have ever used! The pigment is awful in almost every color and it does not blend well!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I find I&#x27;m in a make up rut, and want to try some different eyeshadow colors without spending a fortune. This e.l.f. 100 Piece Eyeshadow Palette lets me do that quite well. The quality of the eyeshadows themselves is pretty good in that they are lighter but mostly true to what they look like in the case. The \\&quot;pay off\\&quot; or pigment is not deeply infused, so if you want to get the full color effect, you would need to lightly dampen with water on your eyeshadow applicator for it to appear richer. I usually don&#x27;t do that, however, because I do like the more subtle shades of eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, having a teenage daughter who really likes to experiment with different shades, and who is young enough to be slightly more adventurous with it (but not too much, I&#x27;m kinda strict when it comes to makeup) we&#x27;ve really gotten some great use from this eyeshadow palette. This would also make a fantastic gift for just about any woman (younger or um...not so young, like me :) who enjoys using eyeshadow, because the variety of shades go from nice and natural/earthy to bright and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is not the best quality eyeshadow out there, it is certainly not bottom of the barrel either. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have too many shadows in it with a bunch of sparklies in it, and that it hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyelids or my daughter&#x27;s. In my opinion, this is a good deal and fun for experimenting with some different colored shadows on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that this palette must be handled gently, because the eyeshadows to tend to break if you are not careful. I bought mine in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are very pretty, but if you are not using the right brushes or eye shadow primer (I use concealer), it will not show on your lids. Even with my Mac and Sephora brushes, I have to go over my lid at least 3 - 4 times to achieve the color that I want. You definetely get what you pay for with this. Not a horrible purchase, but not the best either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love E.L.F products and this is no exception. Lots of great quality colors for a really decent price. I use an eye primer and I have no problem with these colors lasting all day and not creasing. This particular product I bought for my friend&#x27;s daughter who is learning to use make up. Probably a bit overwhelming but I showed her how to do a couple of looks and now she has lots of colors to experiment with and find what works best for her.</li>
            <li> So many colors , so many many colors. My  niece who&#x27;s 17 loves it. Made her day ! It&#x27;s a very large flat! About size of a dinner plate.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have chose a better eyeliner palette honestly this palette is my favorite , none of them were damaged, the colors are awesome, great product for the price especially i feel like i got a steal</li>
            <li> A lot of variety and colors, glitter ones too, The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that that the colors weren&#x27;t organized but hey.. what are you gonna do? I think the pigment is just fine for my liking so overall I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> I put water on a brush and have used a few of the wilder colors as eyeliner. This pack has a great color selection and will last for a few years. This was a very good value in itself but aside from that it will save me a lot of money by keeping me away from department store make-up counters.</li>
            <li> The colors on this set are not as they appear online.  There are very few light or highlight shades (except about 8 versions of yellow).  If you like wild colors then this may be for you.  Some of the colors are almost neon.  All of the pink shades come out looking red.  I gave up after just a couple weeks and have ordered the Coastal Scents warm.  I&#x27;m hoping the colors on that are more reasonable.  This was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> It was not what i expected. The colors were more irradescent then i would like. Its a good amount of shadow for the price, worth buying for younger girls.</li>
            <li> Looks like a good combination of colors.  But, this case is actually missing some major basics (e.g., light pinks, darker/more usable browns, purple, greens).  It&#x27;s disappointing.  It&#x27;s also difficult to tell from the palette what the color is actually going to look like on the eye.  I also think that the eyeshadow is not good quality.  I keep on getting a line of makeup in the crease of my eyelid that I didn&#x27;t with my Victoria&#x27;s Secret palettes.</li>
            <li> great colors, looks cute, stays on for a long time. very good price for a good product. I love it, use it daily</li>
            <li> Smaller than was expected for 100 piece.  Colors are nice.  Just I feel it will all be used up after  3-4 applications of each shade :(</li>
            <li> I love all the colors. They aren&#x27;t super pigmented, but that is fixed by first putting on NYX Jumbo eye pencil in Milk, or another with base. When it arrived one eyeshadow spot was missing, it had broke during shipping and crushed and was all over the place. It was super apparent how it happened since there was no padding or bubble wrap in the packaging. I went to look about returning it. Notice I got lucky, most people have lots of broken shadow spots. Didn&#x27;t return because they wouldn&#x27;t replace, only refund me and I only paid like 9 bucks for it, so it wasn&#x27;t worth returning and paying for shipping over one missing shade. But I wont be ordering any type of shadow from Amazon, since they down package it carefully.</li>
            <li> GREAT EXPANSE OF COLORING! The brushes ARE a little flimsy, but i love it anyway. great skin tone scale as well as gray scale, which was a nice surprise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for probably a lot longer than you&#x27;re supposed to keep makeup around, and I love it. Would definitely buy again and have recommended it.</li>
            <li> It arrived so dirty . It made a lot of messs some are empty .</li>
            <li> very nice palette it&#x60;s all that i wanted</li>
            <li> I am so enjoying this palette, the colors aren&#x27;t highly pigmented but it works perfectly for me. I like them softer. The shades are pretty on my skin. Everything came on time and in one piece. It was boxed very well. I will order more of these  palettes 😊</li>
            <li> i got it in time and it had everything in tact and nothing was broken, i loved it. it comes with 2 eyeshadow brushes too but they are foam but overall loved it honestly</li>
            <li> Great colors, high quality product, and a great deal! I would expect nothing else from E.L.F. products! They&#x27;re my new favorite brand!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 sets....was very pleased to see it was in good shape....Will by more in the future....hope there&#x27;s a improved packaging systems....love the product</li>
            <li> So I ordered this just because I needed some eyshadow, I also bought makeup brushes and eyeshadow primer from elf. The only bad thing about the eyeshadows it that you need a base before you put the colors on.&lt;br /&gt;When I got it in the mail, almost 10 of my shadows were broken! I think it was absolutely ridiculous !!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them. thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece for her birthday.  Although it came quickly it was all broken up. When I open the package there was eye shadow everywhere and there was like 8 shadows that was all broken into pieces. Not very happy...</li>
            <li> Everyday looks . Pigmentated . Great w/ primer.</li>
            <li> Product arrived covered in the dust of broken eyeshadows, and it is completely unusable. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My daughter got these for herself and she absolutely loves them too she also gota new brush set so I cant keep her out of the bathroom playing around with allher new makeup too. Girls Girls Girls.</li>
            <li> Came in bubble wrap. Not single piece was messed up. Beautiful colors. And comes with 2 spongy q tips and a lil mirror. Be careful opening.</li>
            <li> was very good product as expected.&lt;br /&gt;it was received on very next day after booking it.&lt;br /&gt;It was purchase to gift and met my expectation.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my sister.. she loves e.l.f. products so she loved it</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow palette came promptly in the mail with no damage to the case or the eyeshadows themselves. The colors are a mixture of matte and shimmery which is nice. I also bought the e.l.f. eyelip primer and the eyeshadow stays for hours without creasing. The only time I&#x27;ve noticed creasing was when I went to a wedding and was dancing all night (got all sweaty and make-up started to run). Many great colors, but I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because some of the colors do not have that \\&quot;pop\\&quot; effect I was expecting (i.e. the black and some of the brighter colors).</li>
            <li> i had to order new / different kind because this one the colors wasnt as bright on as they were in the kit.</li>
            <li> Love this palette! Especially  the colors towards the middle. Nice, vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The palette arrived on time and completely intact. The colors are beautiful. You also cannot beat the price. I was worried about purchasing because so many people said their&#x27;s arrived with broken eyeshadows but all of mine were completely intact. Very satisfied with transaction.</li>
            <li> Luckily its just for my daughter make up playtime..... i have 6 damaged palette..Hope u guys can think of an innovative ideas abt this issues.. Guess i am not the only one with this problems.</li>
            <li> bright colors,really nice, soft, bought it for my daughter she loves it, will definatly purchase more in the future for friends and family</li>
            <li> GREAT for makeup artist, makeup lovers! IT holds a variety of beautiful colors form bronze, gold, peach, gray etc. EVEN better is there are some that repeat twice but the difference is that one is matted and the other has glamorous glitter!</li>
            <li> I especially love the different highlight colors. Very rich and textured. They last all day too. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the variety! The eyeshadow lasts all day on my skin when I use a base.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette at a local drugstore, not amazon. So I can&#x27;t talk about shipping or packaging...But, I love this palette. I have fair skin and almost all the colors show up very nicely on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there&#x27;s so many colors to choose from, the browns and purples look really nice with my green eyes and the greens/pinks/blues are fun for when I&#x27;m feeling a little eccentric. :)&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took off one star is because some (not all) of the colors are drier and less pigmented than others, while some are highly pigmented. The more neutral shades seem to have a different consistency, while the bright colors stick quickly, the neutrals tend to need a few layers before they&#x27;re truly visible.&lt;br /&gt;I also use some of the browns to darken my eyebrows and it works great.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, was very excited to receive this item , when it arrived, it arrived smashed , two palettes were completely all over the place, it was a total mess just trying to open it.</li>
            <li> I still use ELF it is my favorite inexpensive make up!</li>
            <li> THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! i got it on time. Perfect condition. I love it and I will be buying it again. Thank you</li>
            <li> The powders don&#x27;t really stay that well on my eyes, even when I use a primer. They feel cheap and lack depth.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered fast.  The color pallet is awesome as well.  However due to the poor packaging one of the colors in the pallet was completely knocked out and dusted.  Not able to use the color at all.  Overall I like e.l.f products just think they need to ship in better packaging.</li>
            <li> i always expect nothing less from ELF. this palette is the best</li>
            <li> The palette that was shipped to me had different colors than in the picture.  It doesn&#x27;t have all those bright pinks in it.  Good product, great price.</li>
            <li> Received this item today. All broken and looked used. Opened the lid and it was just a mess of eyeshadow everywhere. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> When the eyeshadow arrived, some of the colors had broken apart and scattered into the other colors, leaving a mess. I do normally like e.l.f. products, but I was disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping I had a few colors pop out of the pallet but I can fix it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> eye shadow does not even last a half hour on</li>
            <li> this was a great product and arrived on time</li>
            <li> Great price. Great colors. Delivered quickly. Very pigmented. I highly recommend it to people who like wearing vivid colors on the regular.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Eye Shadow Palette and every colour is extremely gorgeous and goes on smoothly onto my eyelids. Also the colours look the same in person as they do online simply stunning and elegant colours.</li>
            <li> First of all I was expecting the package to arrive by September 27th or so, and I got it today so that makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the product the colors are so bright and beautiful and I just love it!! So happy I decided to purchase it!!!</li>
            <li> arrived smashed makeup everywhere.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely need a primer with these, not a whole lot of coverage or stay power. Great colors otherwise.</li>
            <li> This product allow me to creat master pieces on my eyes! I can match everything with all the colors. Last long!</li>
            <li> the colors are WAY bolder in person than advertised i love its bin a while since  bought it and its still good the colors are dull on skin but i am a soft honey so that may be why then again it is elf but its still one nice pallate for only 10bucks i think so</li>
            <li> Unlike others may have said, my palette came unbroken. All the colors were intact. I don&#x27;t tend to use the eyeshadow applicants that most sets come with, so I put those aside. The mirror does come off, but its small anyway, but I don&#x27;t tend to use those mirrors either. The pigment is good, but soft, so if you want a lit of pigment you will have to put a lot on the brush. The colors are all organized, in blues, greens, etc. this set does not contain yellow, which disappoints me, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it that much anyway. Overall, this set was a good set to have instead of buying tons of various colors. With this set, you get most of your desired colors, for only $10.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ELF GOOD QUALITY PRODUCTS AND AFORDABLE ALL COLORS YOU WANT AND THE HUES GO ON EVERY SKIN COLORS THE COLORS ARE VIBRANT.</li>
            <li> My GF loved it! being a dude I lack the skill or have a clue about make up  or in this case eyeshadow I just know that women love it!! Anyways if she&#x27;s happy im happy she said something about alot of colors soo im guessing its good!</li>
            <li> I received this product before its estimated arrival date, yay. The colors are beautiful and exactly as pictured. None of them we broken! :) The consistency of the shadows is great! They are smooth and stay on well. I definitely would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is really nice eye shadow for the low price.  The colors are great and they stay on well with little fallout.  Nice sized pallot.  The shipment came in good time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented. Great buy. Lots of colors to play around with and you can get many, many looks from this palette.</li>
            <li> a lot of the shadows do not have pigment, I prefer BH cosmetics</li>
            <li> MY STEP DAUGHTER HAS GONE THROUGH COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL AND IM ABOUT TO START AND NEITHER OF US CAN WAIT TO TRY THIS OUT...</li>
            <li> Im in beauty school, so its endless possibilities with this palette! Long lasting color for a good price! I love it and I wear it daily !</li>
