            <li>And that&#x27;s about the best thing I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>Kudoes to Interdesign for the perfect pump.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, and price.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE&amp;#60</li>
            <li>This ended up being a very good choice.</li>
            <li>but I was happy with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Looks great, works great.</li>
            <li>Works great in my shower for shampoo</li>
            <li>This is very nice came in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous, functional, and from a renewable resource, but the one I got has soap collecting where the pump is connected.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This soap dispenser looks really nice.</li>
            <li>Aside from not needing or wanting it, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the craftsmanship of the particular unit I received.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best looking and best operating soft soap pump I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t harmonize with my home decor, not a bank-breaking purchase, and as a gift it would be incomplete and I tend to gift better than this sort of item anyway.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE, love this pump.  </li>
            <li>Was really pleased with the look of this - goes well with my coastal décor.  </li>
            <li>It was fine.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not breakable which is nice with children, but you can&#x27;t really tell it&#x27;s not glass unless you touch it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very cheap, but it does match everything else and looks nice enough.</li>
            <li>Nice product so far.</li>
            <li>Have had mine a few years and still works great and NO RUST.  </li>
            <li>but now, after having used it for a year, and watching my kids using it, I can confirm that it&#x27;s a high quality, easy to use soap pump.</li>
            <li>Makes the whole set add something unique to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It is pretty.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely order more bathroom products in this line.</li>
            <li>vey pretty.</li>
            <li>Looks nice with all other bamboo accents that I have, and</li>
            <li>it goes very well with the rest of the bamboo accessories that I have in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It would seem the last action my phone was able to process</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this products.</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised to get it in the mail!  </li>
            <li>The tube is clear acrylic</li>
            <li>the clear plastic still looks clear and unscratched.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and has worked well for the past two months.</li>
            <li>This has now happened repeatedly and I continue to reinsert the nozzle back into the dispenser (which is difficult because you have to rotate the top to the exact point where the internal hole is for the nozzle to be put back into.</li>

            <li> Actually, I had accidentally purchased this item and didn&#x27;t know it, due to a bad lag on my phone at the time, which I had resolved by simply shutting it down for a few minutes and powering back up.  It would seem the last action my phone was able to process was this purchase.  Boy was I surprised to get it in the mail!  Aside from not needing or wanting it, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the craftsmanship of the particular unit I received.  I was literally, underwhelmed.  It was not significant to me to use; return for a refund or even give as a gift.  It didn&#x27;t harmonize with my home decor, not a bank-breaking purchase, and as a gift it would be incomplete and I tend to gift better than this sort of item anyway.  Still,  the item found a home (as it were,) in the local Goodwill, where I hope by now it has found a way into a home to provide its intended service.</li>
            <li> Looks great, works great.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best looking and best operating soft soap pump I have ever bought. Kudoes to Interdesign for the perfect pump.</li>
            <li> Works great in my shower for shampoo</li>
            <li> This soap dispenser looks really nice. The tube is clear acrylic so it&#x27;s not breakable which is nice with children, but you can&#x27;t really tell it&#x27;s not glass unless you touch it. Unfortunately they decided to put the sticker on it though and as of yet the cloudy residue hand&#x27; t come off. This is not a bog deal just a little annoying. Also, the spout comes off if you put too much pressure on it, but it isn&#x27;t hard to reattach it. I&#x27;m just not sure why they didn&#x27;t bond them in some way before hand. Overall though it seems like a quality piece that will probably outlive its function in my bath.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, and price. I highly recommend this products. it goes very well with the rest of the bamboo accessories that I have in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have bamboo accents in my bathroom and was looking for a bamboo soap pump. This ended up being a very good choice. I have two children under 5 and was concerned about them using it (I was afraid they could break it or the pump would be too hard to push for them) - but now, after having used it for a year, and watching my kids using it, I can confirm that it&#x27;s a high quality, easy to use soap pump. Looks nice with all other bamboo accents that I have, and the clear plastic still looks clear and unscratched. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It is pretty.  It&#x27;s lightweight and plastic, which is one reason I wanted it (my little one accidentally broke our ceramic one).  However, shortly after purchasing it, the spout popped out (and it doesn&#x27;t just pop back in).</li>
            <li> I LOVE, love this pump.  I didn&#x27;t have price tag issues like others did.  Have had mine a few years and still works great and NO RUST.  So aggravated with my other &amp;#34;matching&amp;#34; pumps that all rusted out.  These are imported, but there is a real USA company standing behind these products.  EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE&amp;#60; Plan to give these out as Christmas gifts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous, functional, and from a renewable resource, but the one I got has soap collecting where the pump is connected.</li>
            <li> a bit larger than I had thought</li>
            <li> It matches the other bamboo items in the room and is made well. I like that I can see the amount of soap in the dispenser and I&#x27;m not caught off guard when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Was really pleased with the look of this - goes well with my coastal décor.  Got the matching tissue holder as well.  Will definitely order more bathroom products in this line.</li>
            <li> Nice product so far. Only complaint is paper label glued to side if plastic body with an adhesive that was rediculously difficult to get off without scratching the plastic. Easy to fill and has worked well for the past two months.</li>
            <li> This is very nice came in a timely fashion. works well.I like the look of it vey pretty. I am done.</li>
            <li> If you think it is impossible for a soap dispenser to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34;, you&#x27;d be wrong. Within a week of purchasing this dispenser, the thin nozzle that the soap comes out of shot off of the dispenser when pushed the top down to dispense the soap. This has now happened repeatedly and I continue to reinsert the nozzle back into the dispenser (which is difficult because you have to rotate the top to the exact point where the internal hole is for the nozzle to be put back into. I had purchased this to replace the exact same soap dispenser that I had before, which had broke because the clear plastic part cracked off the bamboo base. It is really unfortunate that this soap dispenser isn&#x27;t more durable, because I like the look of it and it goes with the other bamboo accessories that I have in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Careful with the screp cap cover. But once I glued it. It was fine.</li>
            <li> I like the way it is designed with the added touch of bamboo. Makes the whole set add something unique to the bathroom.</li>
