            <li>I have to say, I was really impressed with the color and the crackle affect it gave!</li>

            <li>The crackle polish is  easy and fun to apply and looks great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;China Glaze is definitely better looking to me.</li>
            <li>the more perfection you can achieve.</li>
            <li>so I asked them about it, they said it worked better in their opinion</li>

            <li>Love the different/funky look</li>

            <li>I LOVE this crackle polish.</li>
            <li>it is cute....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better that what my salon uses.</li>
            <li>Newest trend and just love this product.  </li>
            <li>China Glaze has been one of the better brands of crackle nail polish I have found.  </li>
            <li>Love It ‚ù§</li>
            <li>I love this crackle from china glaze</li>
            <li>depends how many cracks you get on your nail</li>
            <li>And applied more coats trying to fill in the gaps.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as the higher costing crackle polish.</li>
            <li>I am also excited to receive the metals I bought as well!</li>
            <li>It works like a charm, the crackle is very cool.</li>
            <li>polish dries quickly, and looks glossy with a layer of top coat on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Something that I learned very quickly is for persons who have never tried it, be patient when applying.</li>
            <li>Me &amp; my sister loves this nail polish because we love to watch it crackle LOL &amp; the only reason I got</li>
            <li>The brush included is great and makes it easy to cover the nail without going back over it more than once.</li>
            <li>Work quickly!  </li>
            <li>Overall it worked great but</li>
            <li>This is a great crackle polish, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I loved it, and will buy more of this product in the future.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to apply it thinly &amp; quickly to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>Really fun to watch it crack too!</li>
            <li>So I was originally going to purchase the OPI nail polish</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t even know if its worth returning it!</li>
            <li>It works well over top of any solid colored polish and always looks amazing.</li>
            <li>it looks great with blue and its fun to see how it crackles this item</li>
            <li>I love the modern hip look</li>
            <li>Shipped fast too. :)</li>
            <li>Also, huge tip when using, make sure to let your bottom coat of nail polish completely dry before adding this on top because if you don&#x27;t, it will separate with the Crackle.  </li>
            <li>: Be quick when using it.</li>
            <li>OMG okay first of all it came a week early !!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed, because the desired effect was what I wanted, however the consistency of this product is pretty wack....</li>
            <li>It was packaged great, but when I went to use it, it appeared that the polish had been used before from the dried polish around the edges.</li>
            <li>I love the crackle effect, you can pair it with any color and it makes your nails look like they are professionally done.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty cool product.</li>
            <li>With all the rave reviews I really thought this would be better than it really is.</li>
            <li>Got this at a fair price, and it works as expected</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply, looks very cool and was priced way less than OPI&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>First drying instantly then cracking like its crackle polish then it peels off on its own.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my plainly painted toes and the awesome shattered effect was apparent.  </li>
            <li>It works best with the most crackle when you only apply one thin layer- try to cover your nail in three stripes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good black...</li>
            <li>Third, this is an item that needs to be practiced with as the more you practice with it</li>
            <li>Totally recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>This crackle looks great on almost every color, and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>And be sure to keep the lid on the bottle as much as possible, because it will get globby in the bottle if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying and using crackle nail polish</li>
            <li>This was the first crackle polish I ever used</li>
            <li>and I think that over white it is outstanding</li>
            <li>Most of my regular polishes are CG as well</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not a fan.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from the Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply website and they are pretty fast in shipping this polish.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the nail polish underneath is COMPLETELY dry before applying the crackle.</li>
            <li>Kinda odd to walk into the nail salon and bring your own polish.</li>
            <li>The product itself is good, but takes a very long time to dry, and is very watery!</li>
            <li>Second, be gentle and light when applying</li>
            <li>The nail polish in the bottle dries up fast while I&#x27;m trying  to paint the nail.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>because it dries REALLY fast.</li>
            <li>I didnt really like the way it came oit on my nails</li>
            <li>It does dry matte but with a top coat, it takes it to a new level.  </li>
            <li>Try using different colors on your nails for a fun tie-dyed effect!</li>
            <li>When this first arrived, I was very excited to use my new black crackle polish.</li>
            <li>It looks really cool and can be layered with different colors to match anything.</li>
            <li>it is because its black which is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>It cracks more randomly so each nail looks very unique.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This was my second purchase of the black, I love it because you can pretty much use it on any color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun watching the polish actually crackle on your fingernails.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but the cracks weren&#x27;t very dramatic &amp; looked more &amp;#34;leopard&amp;#34; than fissures, which is the look i prefer.</li>
            <li>I remember owning black crackle nail polish as a young child and not being able to find it for years.</li>
            <li>so far, my favourite crackle is the cracked concrete!    </li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving this a four star review is because it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked it to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very underpriced here on amazon, as I&#x27;ve seen a similar kind of black crackle at a local store for around twenty dollars.</li>
            <li>then getting it at the store &amp; its the exact same thing!</li>
            <li>you have to brush the whole nail pretty much at once or you are in danger of getting a clumpy mess.....</li>
            <li>It crackles well, and it looks really cool with other colours underneath -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as black as night and is not sheer (if applied correctly) :)</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put on too much, because then you&#x27;ll only get streaks.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you dont put on too thick of a coat.</li>
            <li>; to it is that it does get thick and goopy at the top.</li>
            <li>It does really well on long fingernails.</li>
            <li>next time, I&#x27;d like a brand new polish.</li>
            <li>Kind of thick and hard to apply, but leaves a really neat effect!</li>
            <li>Another important note is to use a top clear coat after the crackle nail polish has been applied to bring out the gloss of both your base coat and the crackle.</li>
            <li>The crackle was nice and random.</li>
            <li>The problem with it is that the entire nail-polish layer will come off in one piece, leaving you with a totally bare nail.</li>
            <li>I was not about to spend that much money on it, so I decided to try out China Glaze Black Mesh.</li>

            <li> The product itself is good, but takes a very long time to dry, and is very watery!</li>
            <li> Second, be gentle and light when applying</li>
            <li> The nail polish in the bottle dries up fast while I&#x27;m trying  to paint the nail.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> because it dries REALLY fast.</li>
            <li> I didnt really like the way it came oit on my nails</li>
            <li> It does dry matte but with a top coat, it takes it to a new level.  </li>
            <li> Try using different colors on your nails for a fun tie-dyed effect!</li>
            <li> When this first arrived, I was very excited to use my new black crackle polish.</li>
            <li> It looks really cool and can be layered with different colors to match anything.</li>
            <li> it is because its black which is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> It cracks more randomly so each nail looks very unique.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of the black, I love it because you can pretty much use it on any color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun watching the polish actually crackle on your fingernails.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but the cracks weren&#x27;t very dramatic &amp; looked more &amp;#34;leopard&amp;#34; than fissures, which is the look i prefer.</li>
            <li> I remember owning black crackle nail polish as a young child and not being able to find it for years.</li>
            <li> so far, my favourite crackle is the cracked concrete!    </li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this a four star review is because it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked it to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very underpriced here on amazon, as I&#x27;ve seen a similar kind of black crackle at a local store for around twenty dollars.</li>
            <li> then getting it at the store &amp; its the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> you have to brush the whole nail pretty much at once or you are in danger of getting a clumpy mess.....</li>
            <li> It crackles well, and it looks really cool with other colours underneath -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as black as night and is not sheer (if applied correctly) :)</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put on too much, because then you&#x27;ll only get streaks.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you dont put on too thick of a coat.</li>
            <li> ; to it is that it does get thick and goopy at the top.</li>
            <li> It does really well on long fingernails.</li>
            <li> next time, I&#x27;d like a brand new polish.</li>
            <li> Kind of thick and hard to apply, but leaves a really neat effect!</li>
            <li> Another important note is to use a top clear coat after the crackle nail polish has been applied to bring out the gloss of both your base coat and the crackle.</li>
            <li> The crackle was nice and random.</li>
            <li> The problem with it is that the entire nail-polish layer will come off in one piece, leaving you with a totally bare nail.</li>
            <li> I was not about to spend that much money on it, so I decided to try out China Glaze Black Mesh.</li>
            <li> and it did take a few tries to get it right</li>
            <li> Using less polish than normal will give you a very thin, fine crackle effect.</li>
            <li> , I tried it over several different colors dark to white</li>
            <li> It cracks instantly when you put it on, and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to dry.</li>
            <li> Although I have noticed if you put in on too thick, it takes longer to crack and not as much.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t use their nail polishes and haven&#x27;t read of any reviews but because it was cheaper and seemed similar if not exactly like the OPI I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> the bottle lasts for a long time too!</li>
            <li> I tried to apply it with it being partially dry and the nail polish didn&#x27;t crackle...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also way more expensive &amp; dried out when I still had 1/3 of the bottle</li>
            <li> I still am not totally happy with the patterns it creates and I tried it over several different polishes and at several different thicknesses.</li>
            <li> O_O. Plain robbery.</li>
            <li> I purchased the black and white one.</li>
            <li> and they were only half used.</li>
            <li> I purchased the whole China glaze set of crackle approximately four years ago.</li>
            <li> Got It Sooner Than Expected.</li>
            <li> but my black started to get clumpy...and then became a big clump mess in the bottle</li>
            <li> Another lesson I have learned is it is very important to allow your base nail polish to dry all the way before applying the crackle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get lumpy like some of the other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I just recently went through my nail polish collection and noticed that a few of the crackles had completely dried up</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and it is not gunky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really weird, it doesn&#x27;t just chip in pieces, the whole nail layer comes off.</li>
            <li> When I heard about Black Shatter, I had to have it.</li>
            <li> I purchased OPI&#x27;s black and silver shatter.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying every color except for black since I have the sally hansen</li>
            <li> Plus it cost me like 4 dollars less to order it on here</li>
            <li> really black...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t &amp;#34;over-paint&amp;#34;, as in don&#x27;t keep going over &amp; over your nail with it, or it will mess up the design (thick coat&#x3D; bigger chunks, thin coat&#x3D; smaller).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for over a year, and it hasn&#x27;t gotten clumpy or thick at all!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the crackle accidentally, not realizing it wasn&#x27;t plain black polish.</li>
            <li> It dries within ten to twenty seconds and leaves plenty of cracks behind.</li>
            <li> but seriously considering buying the black...    </li>
            <li> The key is that you have to let the base color dry throughly before applying this nail polish.  </li>
            <li> and it looks streaky, too thick</li>
            <li> I also use it when my normal nail color gets messed up, as it covers up any mistakes on the base color coat.  </li>
            <li> but this color no good.</li>
            <li> For a base color I used a lime green color from Sinful Colors (which name escapes me) and applied the Black Mesh over it.  </li>
            <li> Too thin</li>
            <li> Put on a thin layer</li>
            <li> Just horrible, it looks terrible in black color at least.</li>
            <li> nothing is wrong with it!</li>
            <li> which I hated :(</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE ME SOME CRACKLE!</li>
            <li> I remember owning black crackle nail polish as a young child and not being able to find it for years. Then I noticed OPI was coming out with one and immediately bought it. It was okay, but the cracks weren&#x27;t very dramatic &amp; looked more &amp;#34;leopard&amp;#34; than fissures, which is the look i prefer. It&#x27;s also way more expensive &amp; dried out when I still had 1/3 of the bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even bother with Sally Hansen&#x27;s version. It stinks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze is definitely better looking to me. It cracks more randomly so each nail looks very unique. Just be sure to apply it thinly &amp; quickly to get the full effect. I&#x27;m already on my second bottle. And the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I dont do my fingernails very often because if I cant get them perfect I will just want to wipe it off. This crackle polish to get a great look without a lot of effort. Just make sure you dont put on too thick of a coat. I took off a star for the price. Im just not use to paying almost 10 dollars for a bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on a weekly basis since I got it. Something that I learned very quickly is for persons who have never tried it, be patient when applying. Second, be gentle and light when applying because if you over apply you will not get the crackle affect you are seeking. Third, this is an item that needs to be practiced with as the more you practice with it the more perfection you can achieve. Another lesson I have learned is it is very important to allow your base nail polish to dry all the way before applying the crackle. Another important note is to use a top clear coat after the crackle nail polish has been applied to bring out the gloss of both your base coat and the crackle. The gloss actually allows them both to shine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It was very easy to apply, looks very cool and was priced way less than OPI&#x27;s. I love the crackle effect, you can pair it with any color and it makes your nails look like they are professionally done. Really fun to watch it crack too!</li>
            <li> When I heard about Black Shatter, I had to have it. However, it was nowhere to be found in my town and around $20 online. I was not about to spend that much money on it, so I decided to try out China Glaze Black Mesh. I was very impressed with the results. The crackle was nice and random. I get compliments on my nails every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> LOVED this product when the price was under $10! No way will I ever pay the asking price now. O_O. Plain robbery. Great quality and effects (when applied correctly)</li>
            <li> I purchased OPI&#x27;s black and silver shatter. they work great but my black started to get clumpy...and then became a big clump mess in the bottle so I bought Sally Hansen brand and when they were out of purple, went to another store. I actually went into a beauty store and they had OPI brand and China Glaze. I had only seen china glaze on the internet so I asked them about it, they said it worked better in their opinion so I purchased the white and the purple. I have to say, I was really impressed with the color and the crackle affect it gave! I ended up buying every color except for black since I have the sally hansen but seriously considering buying the black...    I am also excited to receive the metals I bought as well! so far, my favourite crackle is the cracked concrete!    I highly recommend these. they truly work</li>
            <li> I prefer China Glaze&#x27;s crackle effect over OPI any day. Using less polish than normal will give you a very thin, fine crackle effect. It&#x27;s fun watching the polish actually crackle on your fingernails.</li>
            <li> I loved this crackle! Although I have noticed if you put in on too thick, it takes longer to crack and not as much. Aside from that I LOVES IT! Totally recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> This is the worst. The nail polish in the bottle dries up fast while I&#x27;m trying  to paint the nail. I didn&#x27;t like how the nail polish turned out on my nail. You should not buy this item. AT ALLLLL!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It came packaged really well so it wouldn&#x27;t break or anything &amp; it works great nothing is wrong with it! Plus it cost me like 4 dollars less to order it on here then getting it at the store &amp; its the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool product. I purchased the black and white one. They work well. Love the different/funky look it adds to my nails! Make sure the nail polish underneath is COMPLETELY dry before applying the crackle. I tried to apply it with it being partially dry and the nail polish didn&#x27;t crackle...So, in result I had to remove both nail polishes and start over. But that was my fault for not following the directions!</li>
            <li> When this first arrived, I was very excited to use my new black crackle polish. It was packaged great, but when I went to use it, it appeared that the polish had been used before from the dried polish around the edges. Overall it worked great but next time, I&#x27;d like a brand new polish.</li>
            <li> Well, after agonizing over color and brand for a crackle topcoat, this is what i chose. I&#x27;m not disappointed, because the desired effect was what I wanted, however the consistency of this product is pretty wack....you have to brush the whole nail pretty much at once or you are in danger of getting a clumpy mess.....and I have tiny toenails (lol)</li>
            <li> This crackle looks great on almost every color, and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> If you apply it correctly, it works. It&#x27;s as black as night and is not sheer (if applied correctly) :)</li>
            <li> With all the rave reviews I really thought this would be better than it really is. I tried it 4 times and finally on the 4th try I started to get the hang of it. I found for me the trick was waiting until the next day to apply the crackle coat. I still am not totally happy with the patterns it creates and I tried it over several different polishes and at several different thicknesses. The best is a medium thickness. Too thin and it looks streaky, too thick and it doesn&#x27;t crackle well. TIPS:  1. Wait until the next day to apply the crackle coat  2. Work quickly!  3. Don&#x27;t use a top coat in between  4. Apply with a medium thickness  5. Use two strokes, one on each side of the nail for best results</li>
            <li> So I was originally going to purchase the OPI nail polish but, when I seen that $10.00 price tag, I just couldn&#x27;t do it. Ten dollars for a nail polish?! During my search I came across the China Glaze version. Now, I don&#x27;t use their nail polishes and haven&#x27;t read of any reviews but because it was cheaper and seemed similar if not exactly like the OPI I decided to give it a try. And I&#x27;m glad I did!! This polish works great, and it&#x27;s fun to watch the polish \\&quot;crack\\&quot; seconds after applying. I love the modern hip look it gives your nails.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this crackle polish. You get a great nail art design, in about 2 minutes! I always get compliments on my nails when I wear this stuff. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crackle polish tips: Be quick when using it. because it dries REALLY fast. Don&#x27;t &amp;#34;over-paint&amp;#34;, as in don&#x27;t keep going over &amp; over your nail with it, or it will mess up the design (thick coat&#x3D; bigger chunks, thin coat&#x3D; smaller). And be sure to keep the lid on the bottle as much as possible, because it will get globby in the bottle if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a crackle polish so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and buy one. I like it a lot. Works nice!</li>
            <li> This product was awesome. It does really well on long fingernails. I loved it, and will buy more of this product in the future.  [..] (Picture of the polish on nails!)</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this a four star review is because it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked it to. I purchased the whole China glaze set of crackle approximately four years ago. I used it quite extensively, however, never went through the bottles entirely. I just recently went through my nail polish collection and noticed that a few of the crackles had completely dried up and they were only half used. This was my second purchase of the black, I love it because you can pretty much use it on any color. Definitely a must have for your collection!</li>
            <li> This polish is a great, fun top coat for any colour! It crackles well, and it looks really cool with other colours underneath - the bottle lasts for a long time too!</li>
            <li> good black... really black... like it ... it is cute.... i give it to my sister because she needs one last week... we both like that color</li>
            <li> The crackle polish is  easy and fun to apply and looks great. I have always been wanting a crackle nail polish and was very happy with this</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying and using crackle nail polish and I love it! Just don&#x27;t put on too much, because then you&#x27;ll only get streaks. Put on a thin layer and it&#x27;ll look great!</li>
            <li> The product itself is good, but takes a very long time to dry, and is very watery! But the bottle appered as id it was used, and cake like repositories at the bottle neck! which I hated :(, I don&#x27;t even know if its worth returning it! So disappointed!</li>
            <li> OMG okay first of all it came a week early !!!! and it&#x27;s An AMAZING  PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This was the first crackle polish I ever used and it did take a few tries to get it right but it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous when you do, I tried it over several different colors dark to white and I think that over white it is outstanding, I just ordered 2 more bottles, it&#x27;s the perfect crackle over a light color polish</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from the Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply website and they are pretty fast in shipping this polish.  I tried it on my plainly painted toes and the awesome shattered effect was apparent.  For a base color I used a lime green color from Sinful Colors (which name escapes me) and applied the Black Mesh over it.  It crackled instantly.  The key is that you have to let the base color dry throughly before applying this nail polish.  It does dry matte but with a top coat, it takes it to a new level.  The consistency is perfect and I didn&#x27;t have to add nail polish thinner.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I LUV this polish! It&#x27;s better that what my salon uses. Kinda odd to walk into the nail salon and bring your own polish. The colors and metals are all beautiful. Most of my regular polishes are CG as well so they work well together! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> Newest trend and just love this product.  China Glaze has been one of the better brands of crackle nail polish I have found.  It doesn&#x27;t get lumpy like some of the other brands I have tried.  Also, huge tip when using, make sure to let your bottom coat of nail polish completely dry before adding this on top because if you don&#x27;t, it will separate with the Crackle.  I have found it easiest to paint the bottom coat one night and wait until the next day to add the Crackle.  I highly recommend this product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Good polish. Shipped fast too. :)</li>
            <li> Got It Sooner Than Expected. Love It ‚ù§</li>
            <li> Me &amp; my sister loves this nail polish because we love to watch it crackle LOL &amp; the only reason I got it is because its black which is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> Our daughter bought this nail polish, but it worked as promised.</li>
            <li> I love this crackle from china glaze I like the way it crackles it looks good over any nail color.</li>
            <li> I like the polish. Works just as good as the higher costing crackle polish.</li>
            <li> Happy with the price and the condition of the polish when I recieved it. I have used it several times and it is not gunky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Just horrible, it looks terrible in black color at least.</li>
            <li> Polish \\&quot;trnasforms\\&quot; before eyes. First drying instantly then cracking like its crackle polish then it peels off on its own. Brand itself is normally great but this color no good.</li>
            <li> Got this at a fair price, and it works as expected</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It&#x27;s very underpriced here on amazon, as I&#x27;ve seen a similar kind of black crackle at a local store for around twenty dollars. It looks really cool and can be layered with different colors to match anything. It cracks instantly when you put it on, and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to dry. I have no clue how it works, but it looks great! I love it!</li>
            <li> I immediately used this when I got it lol!! I love it!!! Only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; to it is that it does get thick and goopy at the top. But it works great and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all!</li>
            <li> This is a great crackle polish, especially for the price. I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for over a year, and it hasn&#x27;t gotten clumpy or thick at all!  The brush included is great and makes it easy to cover the nail without going back over it more than once. It works best with the most crackle when you only apply one thin layer- try to cover your nail in three stripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish dries quickly, and looks glossy with a layer of top coat on top of it.  I always get compliments on my nails when I&#x27;m wearing it.  I also use it when my normal nail color gets messed up, as it covers up any mistakes on the base color coat.  Try using different colors on your nails for a fun tie-dyed effect!</li>
            <li> Kind of thick and hard to apply, but leaves a really neat effect!</li>
            <li> This polish works amazingly well. It dries within ten to twenty seconds and leaves plenty of cracks behind. It works well over top of any solid colored polish and always looks amazing.</li>
            <li> well just got this item and it is awesome it looks great with blue and its fun to see how it crackles this item is a great buy depending how you put on the crackle depends how many cracks you get on your nail once again reccomend this product to everyone out there......hv fuun</li>
            <li> I ordered the crackle accidentally, not realizing it wasn&#x27;t plain black polish. So when it started cracking I was like... what is going on?? And applied more coats trying to fill in the gaps. Once I realized what the problem was, I decided to try it out for what it was. The problem with it is that the entire nail-polish layer will come off in one piece, leaving you with a totally bare nail. It&#x27;s really weird, it doesn&#x27;t just chip in pieces, the whole nail layer comes off. Unfortunately, not a fan.</li>
            <li> I didnt really like the way it came oit on my nails but its a good nail polish</li>
            <li> It shipped good. It works like a charm, the crackle is very cool. very nice price for crackle nail polish.</li>
