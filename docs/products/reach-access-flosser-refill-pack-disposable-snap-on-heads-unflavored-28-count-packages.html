            <li>I have used it for many months and it works perfectly, even one-handed.</li>
            <li>That said, the ease of use of these flossers is remarkable.  </li>
            <li>The Reach product line is the very best I have found over many decades of trying alternatives.</li>
            <li>[ I also see more people with dentures and realize how fond I am of my teeth :D ]</li>
            <li>and now I have a happy hubby (with gleaming teeth and healthy gums!)</li>
            <li>good  </li>
            <li>at the Amazon price, and shipped by Preferred Mart, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>and I am told by my periodonist that he can tell I am doing a good job flossing.</li>
            <li>With practice it can be just as good imo.  </li>
            <li>None are as good as Reach.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the flavored ones found in stores, they are too sweet, but these are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Great price for so many refills..</li>
            <li>LOVE these flossers!  </li>
            <li>Glad I can get them in bulk here!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and is great for traveling, too.</li>
            <li>His dentist told him he had to start flossing and doing it a certain way and after a number of trial and errors these worked the best.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, my online buying experience was great.</li>
            <li>that option has always kind of grossed me out.  </li>
            <li>The order came on time and was packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is so handy to have plenty of stock on hand</li>
            <li>This product remains as easy-to-use and effective as it always has.  </li>
            <li>Buying in quantity is both convenient and cost effective.</li>
            <li>i am very happy to have found them online for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The floss is strong, and the package holds a good supply of flossers.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>They provide a very easy way of getting family members to floss and</li>
            <li>it is so nice having healthy gums that don&#x27;t bleed when I go in for a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these unflavored flossers for many years and am delighted to find they are still available.</li>
            <li>I love my Reach Access Glosser and am glad to have so many refills.</li>
            <li>I love these flossers.</li>
            <li>I love the handle.</li>
            <li>This is where a floss like Glide may perform better.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep doing whatever it takes to get them to floss! :-)</li>
            <li>so glad I found these here online, because the stores around here either stopped carrying the unflavored flosser refills altogether, or they&#x27;re always out of them if they do carry them.</li>
            <li>My dentist tells me my gums are much better.</li>
            <li>I use one of these heads for a week or more, rinsing it off after each use.  </li>
            <li>This six-pack of 28 flosser heads per pack is the most affordable way I know of to get refills.</li>
            <li>WE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to get these.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to see this offering of 6 28-count packs of Feach Access Flosser refills&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad they were on</li>
            <li>bought several packs as this type of flosser is the best type for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li>Glad that it&#x27;s unflavored most of all.</li>
            <li>Much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to put your fingers in your mouth with these flossers, which makes me think that they are more sanitary than the alternatives for everyone.</li>
            <li>Truly I floss more now than I ever have.</li>
            <li>but now I don&#x27;t mind at all and also feel I&#x27;m able to do a much better job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need no stinking mint flavored floss :-)</li>
            <li>Since Amazon now carries the unflavored ones, will be able to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>I like them better because I don&#x27;t want any added chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love them because they are not flavored.</li>
            <li>So glad to have the flosser refills that are not flavored.</li>
            <li>my dentist &amp; dental hygienist kept trying to get me to floss more.  </li>
            <li>And because the floss heads/bows are disposable -- the hygiene is safe.  </li>
            <li>Love the unflavored.</li>
            <li>I love using these (on what looks like a reach-like toothbrush)</li>
            <li>The amazon price is better than buying a package at a time in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Love that these are  not minty</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I intend to buy more when they are needed.</li>
            <li>I love the reach</li>
            <li>After having received notification that the item had been shipped, we received notification that we were being reimbursed since item was no longer available!  </li>
            <li>With the floss reach stick and these flosser refill packs, I am more motivated to floss at night.</li>
            <li>Was able to get six of these four packs.  </li>
            <li>I love these because they are flavorless</li>
            <li>No alternative to flavored version by Listerine any more.</li>
            <li>glad you guys had these my wife looked all over town and could not find them.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and we were very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very useful and helpful for oral hygiene!</li>
            <li>Easy to use...not more hands in the mouth to floss your teeth</li>
            <li>My dentist &amp; dental hygienist are both very happy with my improved flossing -- which is mostly due to the &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; flossing</li>
            <li>The refills are easy to remove and install in this product.  </li>
            <li>This product, together with the handle, makes flossing easy.</li>
            <li>It cut into my fingers and shredded easily.  </li>
            <li>The Reach device makes it easy to floss</li>
            <li>I have an easy access flosser (given to me by my dentist.</li>
            <li>Thankfully Amazon carried the heads and I can floss the easy way.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so easy to use and reach to all of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The bow snaps in for easy use, then out again for replacement.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>You end up spending a huge amount more with this than you do with alternative floss holders, which is wonderful for this company, which is trying (and succeeding) to suck as much money from you as possible.</li>
            <li>They work fine with my automatic string flosser.</li>
            <li>fast speedy shipment and love the product!</li>
            <li>Very handy, as it uses a toothbrush handle to allow easy access to upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li>This is cheap enough and works great.</li>
            <li>that these refills fit.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness they are available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably find yourself using it regularly, which will make both your teeth and your dentist happy.</li>
            <li>I hope they will always be available.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from a gag reflex and sticking your fingers in your mouth while jockeying around a piece of floss that you had to wind around your fingertips simply doesn&#x27;t do it for you, then put aside your guilt and enjoy a truly handy, effective product.</li>
            <li>Have used the mint flavored since that was all that was available at the store.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Flossing with &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; is quick &amp; easy.  </li>
            <li>However, traditional flossing may offer more flexibility - quite literally! - for those who are able to use it.     </li>
            <li>These are the original</li>
            <li>I love these non-flavored flossers and buying them in quantity is a great savings over the little packages in the stores (when the non-flavored can even be found).</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good to have access to it via the net.</li>
            <li>I bought these many months ago when they were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This works almost as good as regular floss in producing end results.  </li>
            <li>I got my flosser from my dentist and it was so handy and easy to use, I actually started flossing the way the dental techs were telling me to.</li>
            <li>I started using the reach flosser, and found I really liked it (well, as much as anyone could really like flossing).  </li>
            <li>The best thing made for big mans hands and flossing back teeth.</li>
            <li>Good oral hygiene not only gives a fresh breath but it lowers one&#x27;s dental $ bills &amp; lowers the risk of undergoing recurrent &amp; cumbersome dental work.</li>
            <li>They work great and much easier then regular floss alone.</li>
            <li>But this particular brand of refill is inferior to the original bows, because the flossing thread breaks easily.</li>
            <li>it is a good product for dental care and may save teeth in the long run.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, and works very well.</li>
            <li>My hubby has had trouble finding these heads (we fear that J&amp;J is discontinuing them!), but these arrived quickly, were packaged beautifully -</li>
            <li>not sure why these aren&#x27;t available in a store anymore - they are a great invention for those who choke with your whole hand in your mouth!</li>
            <li>I prefer to get my fresh breath via my toothpaste and toothbrush, not my floss.  </li>
            <li>Am glad to see that Amazon offers the reach flosser and refills.</li>
            <li>Also, the floss head is quite thin and taut, and is best for people whose teeth aren&#x27;t too close together.</li>
            <li>I have a child with autism and these are the only things she can use on her own to</li>
            <li>Reach Access Flossers provide, for me, the only way I can effectively floss my teeth, as my dentist recommends.  </li>
            <li>on rare occasions, I do see the floss-inserts, but ALWAYS in the crappy Mint-Flavor.</li>
            <li>Was delighted to purchase the unflavored Reach Access Flosser, the stores sell only mint flavored, much too</li>
            <li>I have arthritis and find these extremely useful for flossing.</li>
            <li>Easy to use floss and pretty reasonable price on here.</li>
            <li>I must say, however, that I have been using the Reach flosser for over 10 years now, and the floss rarely breaks right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>I tried several other flossing aids -- but &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; was the easiest &amp; the best.  </li>
            <li>Product is fine, however the price is way too high.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the whole technology is being downgraded so they can sell us the less effective and more wasetful single-use disposable flossers.</li>
            <li>i purchased these for my husband, i like the clean paste ones, he wants no flavor.</li>
            <li>I can only find these in the stores with mint flavor which is very strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other methods, including plain floss, and have not been able to achieve good results.  </li>
            <li>The flosser handle lasts a long time but its head where the floss tread is needs to be changed frequently, I proceeded with an Internet search &amp; since I could not find a quality-like generic equivalent, I found that the best deal for this brand name product was from Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reach uses good quality floss in these disposable heads, they never shred or break on me even though I use them in some tight spaces.  </li>
            <li>I should think there is a significant hygiene problem if each head/bow is used 3, 4 or 5 times over a period of days before replacing it with a new one.  </li>
            <li>I floss my teeth a lot more with this easy-to-use device that sits next to my toothbrush, saying &amp;#34;use me!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Item was exactly what was advertised, and what was wanted.</li>
            <li>When I got all 168 of these flossers, the first couple out of the package broke immediately.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time to buy on line.</li>
            <li>I really hope this product is never discontinued!</li>
            <li>they are exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have it back.</li>
            <li>If you have not tried this flosser, then you really need to!</li>
            <li>Use each refill only once (or at most twice in one day) and throw it away.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d made a search of local stores and I could not find these anywhere, I am so glad I looked on line..</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t have to lie to my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>Not as cheap as a few other aids or manual flossing, but very easy to use -- and effective in flossing too.  </li>
            <li>It makes cleaning between your teeth easy and almost fun compared to using regular dental floss.</li>
            <li>I wish there weren&#x27;t so many as I think the refill pack will last me 6 months, but finding storage for so many is a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li>I tended to avoid flossing with regular floss because it was so akward, but these flossers make it so easy.</li>
            <li>I have large fingers, not slender &amp; nimble at all -- flossing my wrapping floss around</li>
            <li>This was just what we needed, so thank you for selling these in a large package.</li>
            <li>These are easy to snap on/off the handle and make flossing fast and easy - especially for my back teeth.</li>
            <li>However, it does work fine and is a low cost quality product.</li>
            <li>They are hard to find and the price is fair.</li>
            <li>A fair price for an item that has become hard to find at the store.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment Product as Advertised</li>
            <li>Wish these were available at our local store.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day and it makes flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li>If they do I&#x27;ll buy a whole case of them</li>
            <li>I much prefer the unflavored over the minted variety, so</li>
            <li>I really like the Disposable  Reach Floss system and  have  had  </li>
            <li>Amazon, because it is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>They fit properly and now I floss often, rather than once or twice a month.</li>
            <li>I much prefer these un scented ones.</li>
            <li>As described, and came extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>This vendor was VERY prompt.</li>
            <li>and I much prefer these unflavored heads to the really minty ones.</li>
            <li>thanks bunch.</li>
            <li>AND THEY WORK BETTER FOR ME THAN ANY OTHER FLOSSING SYSTEM I HAVE EVER USED.  </li>
            <li>For those like me who don&#x27;t need it and/or prefer a floss like Glide (my hygienist recommended it due to the nature of my teeth), this isn&#x27;t a better way to floss.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other flosser product for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Reach Access flosser is a wonderful solution for family members who have serious arthritis, and it would work very well for people with other hand impairments.</li>
            <li>I love the Reach Flosser but was unable to buy the plain unflavored refill packs where I live, so I was very happy to find them on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I recommend the clean paste version (the one with the blue color).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the mint refills have much less durability and it takes 3 or more of them to make it through one flossing.</li>
            <li>Kind of icky to think of regularly using a floss that many times, but it was an instructive experiment and it held true for several individual refills.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist says I don&#x27;t have gingivitis even though my limitations put me at high risk.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you use this product.</li>
            <li>According to periodontist my teeth improved on the top of my mouth by doing the coconut oil first and the flossing second, but on the bottom in the front, where most people have more tartar buildup, my teeth got a little worse, so that I went back to flossing the teeth first on the bottom before using the coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Cleans the back of my teeth easily and simple to use.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because of new regulations about plastic products in my area polluting</li>
            <li>I love the Reach Access flosser, it&#x27;s a necessity for me because I have a small mouth</li>
            <li>Floss heads sometimes can last for more than one use with some rinsing, but at times snaps or becomes too loose in less than one full use.</li>
            <li>Just be certain (especially with kids) to look in the mirror to see if you&#x27;re getting everything out.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the string breaks more easily lately</li>
            <li>If you know how much out of pocket expense you save yourself if you avoid having tooth extractions later in life, you would floss every day!.  </li>
            <li>Really wish they would come back in stock somewhere.</li>
            <li>I recommend that everyone starts flossing @ an early age</li>
            <li>so it becomes a natural habit.</li>
            <li>Flossing is simple and fast.</li>
            <li>Ever since trying this product, flossing has become so easy for her that she does it daily without any of her previous reluctance.  </li>
            <li>I really love the Reach Access Flosser; have a very small mouth and can&#x27;t get my fingers in there to floss by hand.</li>
            <li>In contrast, a past experiment we conducted found that a white, unflavored refill lasts for 6 or more flossings.</li>
            <li>this is the only way i can get my favorite flossers with out their usual peppermint taste which i am allergic to.</li>
            <li>Since flossing is a life long responsibility, I bought a large supply which made its $ cost lower.</li>
            <li>Using the reach long handle and snap-on floss attachment is much easier.  </li>
            <li>Average use is only two times, compared with five for the original flossing bows/heads.</li>
            <li>and they are just what I expected and wanted - at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>You can floss in hard to reach spots easily.</li>
            <li>I have very lmited use of my left hand, and this flosser makes it possible to floss thoroly.</li>
            <li>So why would I &amp;#34;love these?&amp;#34; For some reason the major stores in my area have stopped carrying them.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Research is also showing that it lowers risk for health problems in general since poor dental hygiene leads to infections &amp; inflammation, the latter is a frequent factor in many diseases, mainly in the above 50 yo population.</li>
            <li>it is so so so much easier than regular floss which hurt my fingers and takes too long, esp bec</li>
            <li>Plochman&#x27;s Flavored Yellow Mustard and Kraft Natural Lemon &amp; Herb Tartar Sauce.</li>
            <li>But a more important reason is that it has become almost impossible to find the white, inflavored refills on local shelves, either Walgreens, Target, etc.</li>
            <li>Since flossing without a flosser was cutting into the skin of my right hand index finger tip due to I  pressing with it to perform effective flossing, I asked my dentist &amp; dental hygienist how I could prevent this</li>
            <li>Apparently, though, I will find it only online as each store I&#x27;ve visited carries only the mint-flavored variety.  </li>
            <li>I just makes so much sense to use a little handle to manage the floss instead of trying to maneuver with your hands in your mouth.</li>

            <li> They work great and you just toss when finish.</li>
            <li> : For those who like the convenience or want to teach their kids good flossing habits, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many months and it works perfectly, even one-handed.</li>
            <li> That said, the ease of use of these flossers is remarkable.  </li>
            <li> The Reach product line is the very best I have found over many decades of trying alternatives.</li>
            <li> [ I also see more people with dentures and realize how fond I am of my teeth :D ]</li>
            <li> and now I have a happy hubby (with gleaming teeth and healthy gums!)</li>
            <li> good  </li>
            <li> at the Amazon price, and shipped by Preferred Mart, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> and I am told by my periodonist that he can tell I am doing a good job flossing.</li>
            <li> With practice it can be just as good imo.  </li>
            <li> None are as good as Reach.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the flavored ones found in stores, they are too sweet, but these are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Great price for so many refills..</li>
            <li> LOVE these flossers!  </li>
            <li> Glad I can get them in bulk here!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and is great for traveling, too.</li>
            <li> His dentist told him he had to start flossing and doing it a certain way and after a number of trial and errors these worked the best.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, my online buying experience was great.</li>
            <li> that option has always kind of grossed me out.  </li>
            <li> The order came on time and was packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is so handy to have plenty of stock on hand</li>
            <li> This product remains as easy-to-use and effective as it always has.  </li>
            <li> Buying in quantity is both convenient and cost effective.</li>
            <li> i am very happy to have found them online for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The floss is strong, and the package holds a good supply of flossers.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> They provide a very easy way of getting family members to floss and</li>
            <li> it is so nice having healthy gums that don&#x27;t bleed when I go in for a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these unflavored flossers for many years and am delighted to find they are still available.</li>
            <li> I love my Reach Access Glosser and am glad to have so many refills.</li>
            <li> I love these flossers.</li>
            <li> I love the handle.</li>
            <li> This is where a floss like Glide may perform better.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep doing whatever it takes to get them to floss! :-)</li>
            <li> so glad I found these here online, because the stores around here either stopped carrying the unflavored flosser refills altogether, or they&#x27;re always out of them if they do carry them.</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me my gums are much better.</li>
            <li> I use one of these heads for a week or more, rinsing it off after each use.  </li>
            <li> This six-pack of 28 flosser heads per pack is the most affordable way I know of to get refills.</li>
            <li> WE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to get these.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to see this offering of 6 28-count packs of Feach Access Flosser refills&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad they were on</li>
            <li> bought several packs as this type of flosser is the best type for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Glad that it&#x27;s unflavored most of all.</li>
            <li> Much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to put your fingers in your mouth with these flossers, which makes me think that they are more sanitary than the alternatives for everyone.</li>
            <li> Truly I floss more now than I ever have.</li>
            <li> but now I don&#x27;t mind at all and also feel I&#x27;m able to do a much better job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need no stinking mint flavored floss :-)</li>
            <li> Since Amazon now carries the unflavored ones, will be able to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I like them better because I don&#x27;t want any added chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love them because they are not flavored.</li>
            <li> So glad to have the flosser refills that are not flavored.</li>
            <li> my dentist &amp; dental hygienist kept trying to get me to floss more.  </li>
            <li> And because the floss heads/bows are disposable -- the hygiene is safe.  </li>
            <li> Love the unflavored.</li>
            <li> I love using these (on what looks like a reach-like toothbrush)</li>
            <li> The amazon price is better than buying a package at a time in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Love that these are  not minty</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I intend to buy more when they are needed.</li>
            <li> I love the reach</li>
            <li> After having received notification that the item had been shipped, we received notification that we were being reimbursed since item was no longer available!  </li>
            <li> With the floss reach stick and these flosser refill packs, I am more motivated to floss at night.</li>
            <li> Was able to get six of these four packs.  </li>
            <li> I love these because they are flavorless</li>
            <li> No alternative to flavored version by Listerine any more.</li>
            <li> glad you guys had these my wife looked all over town and could not find them.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and we were very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very useful and helpful for oral hygiene!</li>
            <li> Easy to use...not more hands in the mouth to floss your teeth</li>
            <li> My dentist &amp; dental hygienist are both very happy with my improved flossing -- which is mostly due to the &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; flossing</li>
            <li> The refills are easy to remove and install in this product.  </li>
            <li> This product, together with the handle, makes flossing easy.</li>
            <li> It cut into my fingers and shredded easily.  </li>
            <li> The Reach device makes it easy to floss</li>
            <li> I have an easy access flosser (given to me by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Thankfully Amazon carried the heads and I can floss the easy way.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so easy to use and reach to all of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The bow snaps in for easy use, then out again for replacement.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> You end up spending a huge amount more with this than you do with alternative floss holders, which is wonderful for this company, which is trying (and succeeding) to suck as much money from you as possible.</li>
            <li> They work fine with my automatic string flosser.</li>
            <li> fast speedy shipment and love the product!</li>
            <li> Very handy, as it uses a toothbrush handle to allow easy access to upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li> This is cheap enough and works great.</li>
            <li> that these refills fit.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness they are available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably find yourself using it regularly, which will make both your teeth and your dentist happy.</li>
            <li> I hope they will always be available.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from a gag reflex and sticking your fingers in your mouth while jockeying around a piece of floss that you had to wind around your fingertips simply doesn&#x27;t do it for you, then put aside your guilt and enjoy a truly handy, effective product.</li>
            <li> Have used the mint flavored since that was all that was available at the store.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Flossing with &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; is quick &amp; easy.  </li>
            <li> However, traditional flossing may offer more flexibility - quite literally! - for those who are able to use it.     </li>
            <li> These are the original</li>
            <li> I love these non-flavored flossers and buying them in quantity is a great savings over the little packages in the stores (when the non-flavored can even be found).</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s good to have access to it via the net.</li>
            <li> I bought these many months ago when they were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This works almost as good as regular floss in producing end results.  </li>
            <li> I got my flosser from my dentist and it was so handy and easy to use, I actually started flossing the way the dental techs were telling me to.</li>
            <li> I started using the reach flosser, and found I really liked it (well, as much as anyone could really like flossing).  </li>
            <li> The best thing made for big mans hands and flossing back teeth.</li>
            <li> Good oral hygiene not only gives a fresh breath but it lowers one&#x27;s dental $ bills &amp; lowers the risk of undergoing recurrent &amp; cumbersome dental work.</li>
            <li> They work great and much easier then regular floss alone.</li>
            <li> But this particular brand of refill is inferior to the original bows, because the flossing thread breaks easily.</li>
            <li> it is a good product for dental care and may save teeth in the long run.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, and works very well.</li>
            <li> My hubby has had trouble finding these heads (we fear that J&amp;J is discontinuing them!), but these arrived quickly, were packaged beautifully -</li>
            <li> not sure why these aren&#x27;t available in a store anymore - they are a great invention for those who choke with your whole hand in your mouth!</li>
            <li> I prefer to get my fresh breath via my toothpaste and toothbrush, not my floss.  </li>
            <li> Am glad to see that Amazon offers the reach flosser and refills.</li>
            <li> Also, the floss head is quite thin and taut, and is best for people whose teeth aren&#x27;t too close together.</li>
            <li> I have a child with autism and these are the only things she can use on her own to</li>
            <li> Reach Access Flossers provide, for me, the only way I can effectively floss my teeth, as my dentist recommends.  </li>
            <li> on rare occasions, I do see the floss-inserts, but ALWAYS in the crappy Mint-Flavor.</li>
            <li> Was delighted to purchase the unflavored Reach Access Flosser, the stores sell only mint flavored, much too</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and find these extremely useful for flossing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use floss and pretty reasonable price on here.</li>
            <li> I must say, however, that I have been using the Reach flosser for over 10 years now, and the floss rarely breaks right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> I tried several other flossing aids -- but &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; was the easiest &amp; the best.  </li>
            <li> Product is fine, however the price is way too high.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the whole technology is being downgraded so they can sell us the less effective and more wasetful single-use disposable flossers.</li>
            <li> i purchased these for my husband, i like the clean paste ones, he wants no flavor.</li>
            <li> I can only find these in the stores with mint flavor which is very strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other methods, including plain floss, and have not been able to achieve good results.  </li>
            <li> The flosser handle lasts a long time but its head where the floss tread is needs to be changed frequently, I proceeded with an Internet search &amp; since I could not find a quality-like generic equivalent, I found that the best deal for this brand name product was from Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reach uses good quality floss in these disposable heads, they never shred or break on me even though I use them in some tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> I should think there is a significant hygiene problem if each head/bow is used 3, 4 or 5 times over a period of days before replacing it with a new one.  </li>
            <li> I floss my teeth a lot more with this easy-to-use device that sits next to my toothbrush, saying &amp;#34;use me!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what was advertised, and what was wanted.</li>
            <li> When I got all 168 of these flossers, the first couple out of the package broke immediately.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time to buy on line.</li>
            <li> I really hope this product is never discontinued!</li>
            <li> they are exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have it back.</li>
            <li> If you have not tried this flosser, then you really need to!</li>
            <li> Use each refill only once (or at most twice in one day) and throw it away.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d made a search of local stores and I could not find these anywhere, I am so glad I looked on line..</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t have to lie to my dentist.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Not as cheap as a few other aids or manual flossing, but very easy to use -- and effective in flossing too.  </li>
            <li> It makes cleaning between your teeth easy and almost fun compared to using regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> I wish there weren&#x27;t so many as I think the refill pack will last me 6 months, but finding storage for so many is a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I tended to avoid flossing with regular floss because it was so akward, but these flossers make it so easy.</li>
            <li> I have large fingers, not slender &amp; nimble at all -- flossing my wrapping floss around</li>
            <li> This was just what we needed, so thank you for selling these in a large package.</li>
            <li> These are easy to snap on/off the handle and make flossing fast and easy - especially for my back teeth.</li>
            <li> However, it does work fine and is a low cost quality product.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> A fair price for an item that has become hard to find at the store.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment Product as Advertised</li>
            <li> Wish these were available at our local store.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and it makes flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li> If they do I&#x27;ll buy a whole case of them</li>
            <li> I much prefer the unflavored over the minted variety, so</li>
            <li> I really like the Disposable  Reach Floss system and  have  had  </li>
            <li> Amazon, because it is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> They fit properly and now I floss often, rather than once or twice a month.</li>
            <li> I much prefer these un scented ones.</li>
            <li> As described, and came extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> This vendor was VERY prompt.</li>
            <li> and I much prefer these unflavored heads to the really minty ones.</li>
            <li> thanks bunch.</li>
            <li> AND THEY WORK BETTER FOR ME THAN ANY OTHER FLOSSING SYSTEM I HAVE EVER USED.  </li>
            <li> For those like me who don&#x27;t need it and/or prefer a floss like Glide (my hygienist recommended it due to the nature of my teeth), this isn&#x27;t a better way to floss.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other flosser product for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Reach Access flosser is a wonderful solution for family members who have serious arthritis, and it would work very well for people with other hand impairments.</li>
            <li> I love the Reach Flosser but was unable to buy the plain unflavored refill packs where I live, so I was very happy to find them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I recommend the clean paste version (the one with the blue color).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the mint refills have much less durability and it takes 3 or more of them to make it through one flossing.</li>
            <li> Kind of icky to think of regularly using a floss that many times, but it was an instructive experiment and it held true for several individual refills.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist says I don&#x27;t have gingivitis even though my limitations put me at high risk.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you use this product.</li>
            <li> According to periodontist my teeth improved on the top of my mouth by doing the coconut oil first and the flossing second, but on the bottom in the front, where most people have more tartar buildup, my teeth got a little worse, so that I went back to flossing the teeth first on the bottom before using the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Cleans the back of my teeth easily and simple to use.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because of new regulations about plastic products in my area polluting</li>
            <li> I love the Reach Access flosser, it&#x27;s a necessity for me because I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> Floss heads sometimes can last for more than one use with some rinsing, but at times snaps or becomes too loose in less than one full use.</li>
            <li> Just be certain (especially with kids) to look in the mirror to see if you&#x27;re getting everything out.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the string breaks more easily lately</li>
            <li> If you know how much out of pocket expense you save yourself if you avoid having tooth extractions later in life, you would floss every day!.  </li>
            <li> Really wish they would come back in stock somewhere.</li>
            <li> I recommend that everyone starts flossing @ an early age</li>
            <li> so it becomes a natural habit.</li>
            <li> Flossing is simple and fast.</li>
            <li> Ever since trying this product, flossing has become so easy for her that she does it daily without any of her previous reluctance.  </li>
            <li> I really love the Reach Access Flosser; have a very small mouth and can&#x27;t get my fingers in there to floss by hand.</li>
            <li> In contrast, a past experiment we conducted found that a white, unflavored refill lasts for 6 or more flossings.</li>
            <li> this is the only way i can get my favorite flossers with out their usual peppermint taste which i am allergic to.</li>
            <li> Since flossing is a life long responsibility, I bought a large supply which made its $ cost lower.</li>
            <li> Using the reach long handle and snap-on floss attachment is much easier.  </li>
            <li> Average use is only two times, compared with five for the original flossing bows/heads.</li>
            <li> and they are just what I expected and wanted - at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> You can floss in hard to reach spots easily.</li>
            <li> I have very lmited use of my left hand, and this flosser makes it possible to floss thoroly.</li>
            <li> So why would I &amp;#34;love these?&amp;#34; For some reason the major stores in my area have stopped carrying them.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Research is also showing that it lowers risk for health problems in general since poor dental hygiene leads to infections &amp; inflammation, the latter is a frequent factor in many diseases, mainly in the above 50 yo population.</li>
            <li> it is so so so much easier than regular floss which hurt my fingers and takes too long, esp bec</li>
            <li> Plochman&#x27;s Flavored Yellow Mustard and Kraft Natural Lemon &amp; Herb Tartar Sauce.</li>
            <li> But a more important reason is that it has become almost impossible to find the white, inflavored refills on local shelves, either Walgreens, Target, etc.</li>
            <li> Since flossing without a flosser was cutting into the skin of my right hand index finger tip due to I  pressing with it to perform effective flossing, I asked my dentist &amp; dental hygienist how I could prevent this</li>
            <li> Apparently, though, I will find it only online as each store I&#x27;ve visited carries only the mint-flavored variety.  </li>
            <li> I just makes so much sense to use a little handle to manage the floss instead of trying to maneuver with your hands in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the available dental picks, but they were not nearly as good (not as easy, and tended to break when trying to get into difficult areas).  </li>
            <li> discontinuing this product line althogether, it is becoming impossible for find (although, I do see the handle around occasionally,but usually with only 5 floss-insets, and NO inserts available separately)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have large hands and a small mouth</li>
            <li> and if I do oil pulling first, then I have less flossing to do, at last less vigorous flossing to do...</li>
            <li> This should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> , my daughter in particular has a small mouth and has difficulty flossing without these.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and has for a long time.</li>
            <li> I  will be ordering the Reach Floss from  Amazon  as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it can be rough getting into/out of some spots (which results in the above mentioned concern and some minor gum bleeding).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar products from other brands but they use cheap floss or weird refill configurations.</li>
            <li> so I don;t have to worry about finding them for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have a disability that severely limits my jaw from opening, and I have limited hand movement.</li>
            <li> I have teeth that are very close together and getting regular floss in and out is near impossible, so these have made it to where I can floss daily!</li>
            <li> One trick I learned to make this easier is to not push the the string down between the teeth, but to put the handle at about a 45 degree angle and start at the front or back side of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magical tool, and must be used in a similar fashion to regular floss (i.e. to scrape against the sides of the teeth to remove plaque, etc.).    </li>
            <li> The mint ones aren&#x27;t actually flavored on the floss itself; instead, on the plastic part of the head on either side of the floss, there&#x27;s a little indentation there with mint flavored goo.  </li>
            <li> Especially the hard to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li> the floss does not smell as bad, which means that the coconut oil did most of the work...</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find these on Amazon after being frustrated looking in stores for months.</li>
            <li> My kids like to use them, and it seems to help the inexperienced/under-motivated person to floss in harder to reach areas.</li>
            <li> A pity, but seems to be the way our corporations choose to go.</li>
            <li> It became  harder to find them in the stores</li>
            <li> I used to use a flosser from glide that held a spool of floss in its hollow handle.  </li>
            <li> I tried other brands, but they would come loose and I had to pry them out of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I also find it easier to get the floss down between my teeth without exerting undue force (saving my gums from a beating) because I can bite down on the back of the flosser head to push the floss between my teeth in a controlled manner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are less messy as users do not have to open up as wide.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some flossers, the floss never detaches.</li>
            <li> It was always such a chore and resulted in yucky, messy floss strings that I had to dispose of - yuck!</li>
            <li> Other flossers are too big for my jaw and simultaneously too small for me to handle.</li>
            <li> The snap on heads last a few days, so a refill pack lasts a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I had trouble flossing with just a loose piece of floss for years.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone I see flossing the old-fashioned way, and to anyone who doesn&#x27;t floss because of the hassle/awkwardness of conventional flossing.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, big hands and tight teeth, I can not use the floss string.</li>
            <li> These are getting hard to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> Lately that have only the mint refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took away a star because sometimes I find the flossing string snaps before I am able to finish flossing, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> After my last dentist visit, I decided to get serious about trying to floss.  </li>
            <li> On the subject of these being unflavored....  </li>
            <li> Way easier than a floss string, and easier than the competing products (that cost less).  </li>
            <li> aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I note that one reviewer complained that the floss heads/bows refills tend to break after just a few uses -- if you read the package -- they are intended to be replaced daily, not used for a week!  </li>
            <li> Cost less on line then in the stores</li>
            <li> I really like the unflavored Reach Flosser refill because it doesn&#x27;t have the artificial taste of the flavored flossers.  </li>
            <li> and I now floss everyday.</li>
            <li> Must be caused by the crystals of mint flavor that are embedded in the green floss?</li>
            <li> The trouble is, my pharmacy no longer carries the product.  </li>
            <li> I use a reach flosser and always have trouble finding the unflavored refills in store.  </li>
            <li> (start off with less and build your way up!)...</li>
            <li> I cannot find them in any store that are plain and not flavored.  </li>
            <li> I have found it increasingly difficult to find these flosser refills at any of my local stores.  </li>
            <li> As usual, I resorted to Amazon.com and found them</li>
            <li> I have a lot of crowns, so using traditional floss has always been difficult.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find the plain ones in stores.</li>
            <li> in a nutshell I swish raw organic coconut oil around my mouth vigorously for at least 10 minutes, hopefully 20 minutes each day</li>
            <li> Sadly, it was discontinued, and I was unable to get new replacement rolls of floss for it.  </li>
            <li> It is getting hard to get and the stores around us no longer sell it.</li>
            <li> and I was having a hard time finding these at the store ...</li>
            <li> They are hard to find in the stores in my area.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can reach hard to reach places</li>
            <li> had a hard time finding these&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for having them for us</li>
            <li> This is apparently the last place on earth where you can find this floss-inserts without that awful Mint-Flavor.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that they are Johnson&amp;Johnson/Listerine</li>
            <li> I mean all the stores.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s sort of ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The mint flavored version is much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> a couple fingers was very awkward and very time consuming -- sticking fingers from both hands into my mouth was a challenge -- and uncomfortable as the floss cut off circulation from my finger tips.  </li>
            <li> My mom used to always ignore the dentist&#x27;s advice to floss because it was so awkward and difficult to do, and had to undergo some deep cleaning treatments to deal with the resulting gum disease.  </li>
            <li> If flossing manually (or with one of the other flossing aids) is awkward or difficult or excessively time-consuming -- face it</li>
            <li> They are very hard to find in our area.</li>
            <li> When I could only find the flavored flossers, I would always melt out all that flavoring crap before I used the flosser.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled--by some saner floss holders that don&#x27;t require unnecessary overpriced refills.</li>
            <li> There is just something distasteful about cramming my fingers in my mouth to floss my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to get fingers in there to floss.  </li>
            <li> I have some teeth where it is difficult to get the floss between two teeth.  </li>
            <li> all this is that I feel a bit guilty using a disposable plastic product that needs to be replaced so often.  </li>
            <li> For some reason these flosser refills are difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find these refills and the Reach access</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my family prefers the unflavored.</li>
            <li> It has been superseded by &amp;#34;Listerine Access Flosser&amp;#34;, and this is merely a rebranding.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing and frustrating.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely cynical money making scheme.</li>
            <li> I hate the mint flavor and had to use these while I recovered from a broken collarbone.</li>
            <li> Using a string of floss can be very difficult and painful for them, but the Reach Access works nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> btw, if the floss does ever smell bad, I rinse it or spray it with hydrogen peroxide...</li>
            <li> I use these flossers with my Reach Powerflosser, which is no longer unavailable :-(</li>
            <li> The unflavored gets boring and weird tasting.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed that Johnson &amp; Johnson is discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> Hate the mint flavored ones.  </li>
            <li> I hate the taste of the minty ones</li>
            <li> I hated that string floss.  </li>
            <li> I hate flavored floss!</li>
            <li> I had to order these on line as I wanted ones that weren&#x27;t flavored with any nasty goop on them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love my Reach Access Glosser and am glad to have so many refills. I floss my teeth a lot more with this easy-to-use device that sits next to my toothbrush, saying &amp;#34;use me!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Painless, efficient, no scam involved. Item was exactly what was advertised, and what was wanted.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment Product as Advertised</li>
            <li> These are the best for flossing your teeth</li>
            <li> I love these flossers. I tended to avoid flossing with regular floss because it was so akward, but these flossers make it so easy. I love the handle.</li>
            <li> I use these flossers with my Reach Powerflosser, which is no longer unavailable :-( anywhere.  I have found it increasingly difficult to find these flosser refills at any of my local stores.  As usual, I resorted to Amazon.com and found them*.  I prefer the ones without the flavor paste in them...that option has always kind of grossed me out.  When I could only find the flavored flossers, I would always melt out all that flavoring crap before I used the flosser.  The unflavored ones are definitely the way to go.  I prefer to get my fresh breath via my toothpaste and toothbrush, not my floss.  When I got all 168 of these flossers, the first couple out of the package broke immediately.  I guess I should take that up with the robot that made them.  I must say, however, that I have been using the Reach flosser for over 10 years now, and the floss rarely breaks right out of the package.  This is a great product.  When my Powerflosser eventually passes away, I will start using the regular Reach flosser.  There is just something distasteful about cramming my fingers in my mouth to floss my teeth.  This product is great and I hope Reach continues to support it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Other items that I can now only find on Amazon.com:  Plochman&#x27;s Flavored Yellow Mustard and Kraft Natural Lemon &amp; Herb Tartar Sauce.</li>
            <li> They are great. This was my first time to buy on line.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a reach flosser and a pack of refills quite some time ago, but still didn&#x27;t use it.  After my last dentist visit, I decided to get serious about trying to floss.  I started using the reach flosser, and found I really liked it (well, as much as anyone could really like flossing).  I have a lot of crowns, so using traditional floss has always been difficult.  Using the reach long handle and snap-on floss attachment is much easier.  When I went to the store, I found that they no longer seem to sell the reach refills.  I tried some of the available dental picks, but they were not nearly as good (not as easy, and tended to break when trying to get into difficult areas).  Am glad to see that Amazon offers the reach flosser and refills.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THESE REFILLS FOR YEARS AND THEY WORK BETTER FOR ME THAN ANY OTHER FLOSSING SYSTEM I HAVE EVER USED.  THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE, ESPECIALLY THE UNFLAVORED ONES, AND I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND THEM ON AMAZON.  I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO CARRY THESE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> The order came on time and was packaged nicely.  It&#x27;s not sold in stores around here so it&#x27;s good to have access to it via the net.</li>
            <li> My kids like to use them, and it seems to help the inexperienced/under-motivated person to floss in harder to reach areas. However, traditional flossing may offer more flexibility - quite literally! - for those who are able to use it.     Floss heads sometimes can last for more than one use with some rinsing, but at times snaps or becomes too loose in less than one full use. Also, the floss head is quite thin and taut, and is best for people whose teeth aren&#x27;t too close together. Otherwise it can be rough getting into/out of some spots (which results in the above mentioned concern and some minor gum bleeding). This is where a floss like Glide may perform better.    Bottom line: For those who like the convenience or want to teach their kids good flossing habits, this is a great option. For those like me who don&#x27;t need it and/or prefer a floss like Glide (my hygienist recommended it due to the nature of my teeth), this isn&#x27;t a better way to floss. However, it does work fine and is a low cost quality product. Just be certain (especially with kids) to look in the mirror to see if you&#x27;re getting everything out. It&#x27;s not a magical tool, and must be used in a similar fashion to regular floss (i.e. to scrape against the sides of the teeth to remove plaque, etc.).    Overall, my kids prefer it so I&#x27;ll keep doing whatever it takes to get them to floss! :-)</li>
            <li> Before discovering the Reach Access Flosser, I dreaded flossing. Especially the hard to reach back teeth. It was always such a chore and resulted in yucky, messy floss strings that I had to dispose of - yuck! Since I began using the Reach Access Flosser, I have been motivated to floss every night! It&#x27;s easy to use and is great for traveling, too. Just tear off a packet (consisting of seven flosser refills) and throw it in your toiletries bag! So convenient. I took away a star because sometimes I find the flossing string snaps before I am able to finish flossing, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> Wish these were available at our local store.  Hate the mint flavored ones.  These work great.</li>
            <li> that these refills fit.  The refills are easy to remove and install in this product.  The \\&quot;Access Flosser\\&quot; itself is a joy to use.  It makes cleaning between your teeth easy and almost fun compared to using regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> I really love the Reach Access Flosser; have a very small mouth and can&#x27;t get my fingers in there to floss by hand.</li>
            <li> I love the Reach Access flosser, it&#x27;s a necessity for me because I have a small mouth and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to get fingers in there to floss.  Not a lot of maneuvering room, so I never flossed until I found the Reach flosser.  I&#x27;ve now been using the Reach flosser for 6 years and it is so nice having healthy gums that don&#x27;t bleed when I go in for a dental cleaning.  Best invention ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reach uses good quality floss in these disposable heads, they never shred or break on me even though I use them in some tight spaces.  On the subject of these being unflavored....  I like that they&#x27;re unflavored.  The mint ones aren&#x27;t actually flavored on the floss itself; instead, on the plastic part of the head on either side of the floss, there&#x27;s a little indentation there with mint flavored goo.  That mint flavor sends my saliva glands into overdrive and by the end of the minute it takes me to floss, I&#x27;m outright drooling.  So, I stick to the unflavored flossing heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found these here online, because the stores around here either stopped carrying the unflavored flosser refills altogether, or they&#x27;re always out of them if they do carry them.</li>
            <li> it is a good product for dental care and may save teeth in the long run. use it for several years with no complents</li>
            <li> These flossing bows are part of the best flossing technology around, though it is disappearing from our stores. But this particular brand of refill is inferior to the original bows, because the flossing thread breaks easily. Average use is only two times, compared with five for the original flossing bows/heads. Perhaps the whole technology is being downgraded so they can sell us the less effective and more wasetful single-use disposable flossers. A pity, but seems to be the way our corporations choose to go.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and has for a long time. It is getting hard to get and the stores around us no longer sell it. I have noticed that the string breaks more easily lately and I hope the manufacturer is not skimping on the quality while raising the price.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for my kid&#x27;s. It is very easy to use and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I use these daily for flossing and the local stores were always out of them.  So, found what I wanted on Amazon and ordered a 6 pack.  The price was comparable to local stores but, like I said, everywhere I went they were out of stock.</li>
            <li> This is great item. I had trouble flossing with just a loose piece of floss for years. This product, together with the handle, makes flossing easy. My dentist tells me my gums are much better. You should use each Flosser one time.</li>
            <li> Got the product in timely manner, as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love these non-flavored flossers and buying them in quantity is a great savings over the little packages in the stores (when the non-flavored can even be found).</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  They are hard to find and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> I hated that string floss.  It cut into my fingers and shredded easily.  Once a friend gave me one of these Reach devices, I started flossing daily!  I use one of these heads for a week or more, rinsing it off after each use.  This refill pack is a lifetime supply.  I have some teeth where it is difficult to get the floss between two teeth.  One trick I learned to make this easier is to not push the the string down between the teeth, but to put the handle at about a 45 degree angle and start at the front or back side of the teeth.  If you know how much out of pocket expense you save yourself if you avoid having tooth extractions later in life, you would floss every day!.  The Reach device makes it easy to floss and I now floss everyday.</li>
            <li> I got my flosser from my dentist and it was so handy and easy to use, I actually started flossing the way the dental techs were telling me to. But when  my supply of refills ran out, I found that no store in my area had the refills. (Time to panic!!) Thank goodness they are available through Amazon. I urge everybody out there who doesn&#x27;t like using regular floss to try the Reach Flosser. You&#x27;ll probably find yourself using it regularly, which will make both your teeth and your dentist happy.</li>
            <li> I really like the unflavored Reach Flosser refill because it doesn&#x27;t have the artificial taste of the flavored flossers.  I am so thankful that Amazon carries this product!  I use it every day and it makes flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t like mint which limits our choices for flossing. I found this system in a local store but then they stopped carrying the unflavored version. This six-pack of 28 flosser heads per pack is the most affordable way I know of to get refills.</li>
            <li> So why would I &amp;#34;love these?&amp;#34; For some reason the major stores in my area have stopped carrying them.&lt;br /&gt;And I mean all the stores. I think it&#x27;s because of new regulations about plastic products in my area polluting&lt;br /&gt;the environment. I have a child with autism and these are the only things she can use on her own to&lt;br /&gt;floss her teeth.</li>
            <li> WE LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I ALREADY SENT IN A EVIEW ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I love the Reach Flosser but was unable to buy the plain unflavored refill packs where I live, so I was very happy to find them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It is so handy to have plenty of stock on hand so we don&#x27;t have to keep putting it on the grocery list</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these unflavored flossers for many years and am delighted to find they are still available. I don&#x27;t like the flavored ones found in stores, they are too sweet, but these are wonderful. The floss is strong, and the package holds a good supply of flossers.</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to get these.  They now only sell the mint/Listerine flavored refills in stores which I DO NOT LIKE AT ALL.  This should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought these many months ago when they were reasonably priced. Nobody in my family likes mint and you can&#x27;t find anything else. And I can&#x27;t find these anywhere anymore. Really wish they would come back in stock somewhere. If they do I&#x27;ll buy a whole case of them so I don&#x27;t ever run out. What are people who don&#x27;t like mint supposed to do. And don&#x27;t say use regular floss, my daughter in particular has a small mouth and has difficulty flossing without these. So we&#x27;ve given what we have left to her. Once we run out I&#x27;ve no idea what we will do.</li>
            <li> I was very happy and relieved to find these unflavored flossers.  I hate the mint flavor and had to use these while I recovered from a broken collarbone.</li>
            <li> I hope I could buy this item at amazon-japan by yen.</li>
            <li> Reach Access Flossers provide, for me, the only way I can effectively floss my teeth, as my dentist recommends.  I&#x27;ve tried many other methods, including plain floss, and have not been able to achieve good results.  I much prefer the unflavored over the minted variety, so I hope they will always be available.</li>
            <li> I have very lmited use of my left hand, and this flosser makes it possible to floss thoroly. I have used it for many months and it works perfectly, even one-handed.</li>
            <li> The easiest floss I have used!</li>
            <li> I really like the Disposable  Reach Floss system and  have  had  good  results  since I started  using  them. It became  harder to find them in the stores so I  was happy to see  that I could  order the  Reach Floss through  Amazon. I  will be ordering the Reach Floss from  Amazon  as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I used to use a flosser from glide that held a spool of floss in its hollow handle.  Sadly, it was discontinued, and I was unable to get new replacement rolls of floss for it.  The reason I mention all this is that I feel a bit guilty using a disposable plastic product that needs to be replaced so often.  That said, the ease of use of these flossers is remarkable.  If you suffer from a gag reflex and sticking your fingers in your mouth while jockeying around a piece of floss that you had to wind around your fingertips simply doesn&#x27;t do it for you, then put aside your guilt and enjoy a truly handy, effective product.</li>
            <li> Have used for several years now. Is great for those with a gag reflex. Can actually floss all my teeth.</li>
            <li> Works great, just like the ordinal.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see this offering of 6 28-count packs of Feach Access Flosser refills&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon, because it is a real bargain. But a more important reason is that it has become almost impossible to find the white, inflavored refills on local shelves, either Walgreens, Target, etc. Lately that have only the mint refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the mint refills have much less durability and it takes 3 or more of them to make it through one flossing. That&#x27;s sort of ridiculous. Must be caused by the crystals of mint flavor that are embedded in the green floss? Whatever. In contrast, a past experiment we conducted found that a white, unflavored refill lasts for 6 or more flossings. Kind of icky to think of regularly using a floss that many times, but it was an instructive experiment and it held true for several individual refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reach Access flosser is a wonderful solution for family members who have serious arthritis, and it would work very well for people with other hand impairments. Using a string of floss can be very difficult and painful for them, but the Reach Access works nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at the Amazon price, and shipped by Preferred Mart, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> For some reason these flosser refills are difficult to find. I&#x27;m really glad they were on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I bought several packs as this type of flosser is the best type for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they quit making the unflavored, so I stocked up. I hate flavored floss!</li>
            <li> The best. I try to buy these at wal mart but they are always sold out it seems. Now I just order them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought this product. It&#x27;s strong, and works very well. Glad that it&#x27;s unflavored most of all.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my husband for Christmas every year. Yes, I know. Real romantic isn&#x27;t it!! They are very hard to find in our area. We can find the flavored but not the unflavored so I buy him a years supply and he loves it! He actually looks forward to them. They have helped him save his teeth. His dentist told him he had to start flossing and doing it a certain way and after a number of trial and errors these worked the best. So, for him, he will keep getting them!!</li>
            <li> They fit properly and now I floss often, rather than once or twice a month. I wish there weren&#x27;t so many as I think the refill pack will last me 6 months, but finding storage for so many is a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> A fair price for an item that has become hard to find at the store. They work fine with my automatic string flosser. I just wish they had a mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Only have been using this for about a week,  No complaints about it I will update if issues arise but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for mint flavoring and I was having a hard time finding these at the store ... they were all mint!  Got a bunch of these so I don;t have to worry about finding them for a long time!</li>
            <li> Easy to use floss and pretty reasonable price on here.</li>
            <li> Correct product and great shipping time!</li>
            <li> I have an easy access flosser (given to me by my dentist. After the heads ran out, I could not find replacements in any store. Thankfully Amazon carried the heads and I can floss the easy way.</li>
            <li> I floss daily now that I found this flosser.  Your dentist will be happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years but it&#x27;s hard to find the plain ones in stores. This price was great also.</li>
            <li> LOVE these flossers!  They&#x27;re so easy to use and reach to all of my teeth.  Much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have a disability that severely limits my jaw from opening, and I have limited hand movement. If it wasn&#x27;t for Reach, I couldn&#x27;t floss at all. Other flossers are too big for my jaw and simultaneously too small for me to handle. You don&#x27;t have to put your fingers in your mouth with these flossers, which makes me think that they are more sanitary than the alternatives for everyone. Yet, I&#x27;ve looked all over the city for these replacement  floss heads, and nobody carries them. My dentist says I don&#x27;t have gingivitis even though my limitations put me at high risk. I really hope this product is never discontinued!</li>
            <li> Way easier than a floss string, and easier than the competing products (that cost less).  This is cheap enough and works great.</li>
            <li> The Reach product line is the very best I have found over many decades of trying alternatives. The snap on heads last a few days, so a refill pack lasts a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The best thing made for big mans hands and flossing back teeth. Truly I floss more now than I ever have. [ I also see more people with dentures and realize how fond I am of my teeth :D ]</li>
            <li> This product remains as easy-to-use and effective as it always has.  Apparently, though, I will find it only online as each store I&#x27;ve visited carries only the mint-flavored variety.  Fortunately, my online buying experience was great.</li>
            <li> fast speedy shipment and love the product!</li>
            <li> As advertized, no problems! This is apparently the last place on earth where you can find this floss-inserts without that awful Mint-Flavor.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that they are Johnson&amp;Johnson/Listerine is apparently:&lt;br /&gt;1. discontinuing this product line althogether, it is becoming impossible for find (although, I do see the handle around occasionally,but usually with only 5 floss-insets, and NO inserts available separately)&lt;br /&gt;2. on rare occasions, I do see the floss-inserts, but ALWAYS in the crappy Mint-Flavor. In fact in my area- at ALL the Walmarts, Walgreens, GroceryStores, there are lots of floss products but there are virtually none of them that aren&#x27;t &#x27;flavored&#x27; 98%&#x3D;MINT, the rest are like: cinnamin, wintergreen, or whatever</li>
            <li> Since flossing without a flosser was cutting into the skin of my right hand index finger tip due to I  pressing with it to perform effective flossing, I asked my dentist &amp; dental hygienist how I could prevent this &amp; they recommended a Reach access flosser. The flosser handle lasts a long time but its head where the floss tread is needs to be changed frequently, I proceeded with an Internet search &amp; since I could not find a quality-like generic equivalent, I found that the best deal for this brand name product was from Amazon. Since flossing is a life long responsibility, I bought a large supply which made its $ cost lower. I have been using them &amp; they are performing well. I recommend that everyone starts flossing @ an early age so it becomes a natural habit. Good oral hygiene not only gives a fresh breath but it lowers one&#x27;s dental $ bills &amp; lowers the risk of undergoing recurrent &amp; cumbersome dental work. Research is also showing that it lowers risk for health problems in general since poor dental hygiene leads to infections &amp; inflammation, the latter is a frequent factor in many diseases, mainly in the above 50 yo population.</li>
            <li> but now I don&#x27;t mind at all and also feel I&#x27;m able to do a much better job. I just makes so much sense to use a little handle to manage the floss instead of trying to maneuver with your hands in your mouth. Having these refills on hand also makes things easier.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in the store.  Glad I can get them in bulk here!  I don&#x27;t need no stinking mint flavored floss :-)</li>
            <li> they are exactly what i wanted.  in the stores they only have mint flavored. i cannot tolerate mint.</li>
            <li> It always used to be a struggle for me to try to floss regularly--the floss would cut into the corners of my mouth, the flavorings would burn the corners of my mouth, the floss would cut off the circulation to my fingertips, and my fingernails would get nicked and cut up from pushing against the floss.  This product eliminates all of those problems.  I also find it easier to get the floss down between my teeth without exerting undue force (saving my gums from a beating) because I can bite down on the back of the flosser head to push the floss between my teeth in a controlled manner.  I recommend this product to anyone I see flossing the old-fashioned way, and to anyone who doesn&#x27;t floss because of the hassle/awkwardness of conventional flossing.  My mom used to always ignore the dentist&#x27;s advice to floss because it was so awkward and difficult to do, and had to undergo some deep cleaning treatments to deal with the resulting gum disease.  It was a shame because she brushed religiously but couldn&#x27;t be bothered to ever floss.  Ever since trying this product, flossing has become so easy for her that she does it daily without any of her previous reluctance.  Even the dentist commented on the improved condition of her gums now that she is flossing regularly!</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised. It does what it is supposed to do, ASk your doctor if it is for you.</li>
            <li> I like the unflavored Reach flosser refills. Have used the mint flavored since that was all that was available at the store. Since Amazon now carries the unflavored ones, will be able to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> These are the original so they don&#x27;t have the flavoring, so I like them better because I don&#x27;t want any added chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time now, and my dentist has told me it has improved my oral health.  The trouble is, my pharmacy no longer carries the product.  I&#x27;m glad to have it back.</li>
            <li> I had to order these on line as I wanted ones that weren&#x27;t flavored with any nasty goop on them.</li>
            <li> I miss these.  Please bring them back.  I don&#x27;t like the flavored versions.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time and as described! Our family loves the reach flosser but my son doesn&#x27;t like mint. This is a great refill option for him and us too.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, big hands and tight teeth, I can not use the floss string. This works great and fits into even the tightest teeth. I tried other brands, but they would come loose and I had to pry them out of my teeth. This one fits so that the handle is on bottom when you lift and the head stays in place. I use them regularly and their the only ones I can use.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this from this seller. I love them because they are not flavored. They are hard to find in the stores in my area. If you have not tried this flosser, then you really need to! I have teeth that are very close together and getting regular floss in and out is near impossible, so these have made it to where I can floss daily!</li>
            <li> I have been using the reach flosser for years and I am told by my periodonist that he can tell I am doing a good job flossing.</li>
            <li> So glad to have the flosser refills that are not flavored. They work wonderful.</li>
            <li> For years (before I found the &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; flosser) my dentist &amp; dental hygienist kept trying to get me to floss more.  I have large fingers, not slender &amp; nimble at all -- flossing my wrapping floss around a couple fingers was very awkward and very time consuming -- sticking fingers from both hands into my mouth was a challenge -- and uncomfortable as the floss cut off circulation from my finger tips.  I tried several other flossing aids -- but &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; was the easiest &amp; the best.  Not as cheap as a few other aids or manual flossing, but very easy to use -- and effective in flossing too.  If flossing manually (or with one of the other flossing aids) is awkward or difficult or excessively time-consuming -- face it, you probably won&#x27;t floss as often as you should.  Flossing with &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; is quick &amp; easy.  And because the floss heads/bows are disposable -- the hygiene is safe.  My dentist &amp; dental hygienist are both very happy with my improved flossing -- which is mostly due to the &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; flossing aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I note that one reviewer complained that the floss heads/bows refills tend to break after just a few uses -- if you read the package -- they are intended to be replaced daily, not used for a week!  Use each refill only once (or at most twice in one day) and throw it away.  I should think there is a significant hygiene problem if each head/bow is used 3, 4 or 5 times over a period of days before replacing it with a new one.  Just as I would never save and re-use a length of floss used for manual flossing, I would never save &amp; reuse these floss heads/bows.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I can only find these in the stores with mint flavor which is very strong. Love the unflavored. Use these to reach the back teeth without gagging! Very useful and helpful for oral hygiene!</li>
            <li> We have gotten these before.  This is why I ordered this back-up supply before they disappear from the market. Now we are set for the next year.</li>
            <li> I use the &amp;#34;bow&amp;#34; concept to floss. Very handy, as it uses a toothbrush handle to allow easy access to upper and lower teeth. The bow snaps in for easy use, then out again for replacement. Preferable to using &amp;#34;string&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Perfect product&lt;br /&gt;No need to say anything else</li>
            <li> Was shipped as it said that it would be.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d made a search of local stores and I could not find these anywhere, I am so glad I looked on line..</li>
            <li> I love using these (on what looks like a reach-like toothbrush) bec it is so so so much easier than regular floss which hurt my fingers and takes too long, esp bec my teeth are close together.  This works almost as good as regular floss in producing end results.  With practice it can be just as good imo.  The amazon price is better than buying a package at a time in the stores.  I split the price with my mother...I got her to use these too, for the same reason...she gave up on flossing til I told her about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use coconut oil pulling which you can look up online...in a nutshell I swish raw organic coconut oil around my mouth vigorously for at least 10 minutes, hopefully 20 minutes each day (start off with less and build your way up!)...if i do it before flossing, the coconut oil pulls germs out of the mouth closer up to under the gums where they hide(and out of your body believe it or not that is how it prevents and cures diseases even fibromyalgia)...and if I do oil pulling first, then I have less flossing to do, at last less vigorous flossing to do...the floss does not smell as bad, which means that the coconut oil did most of the work...btw, if the floss does ever smell bad, I rinse it or spray it with hydrogen peroxide...According to periodontist my teeth improved on the top of my mouth by doing the coconut oil first and the flossing second, but on the bottom in the front, where most people have more tartar buildup, my teeth got a little worse, so that I went back to flossing the teeth first on the bottom before using the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Love that these are  not minty and my kids can use them.</li>
            <li> These are getting hard to find in local stores.  They provide a very easy way of getting family members to floss and&lt;br /&gt;often.  Our dentist is happy too.</li>
            <li> Saved my teeth, must have</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t have to lie to my dentist.  :)  These are easy to snap on/off the handle and make flossing fast and easy - especially for my back teeth.</li>
            <li> They work great and much easier then regular floss alone. I recommend this product to my friends. My Dentist also likes it.</li>
            <li> Was delighted to purchase the unflavored Reach Access Flosser, the stores sell only mint flavored, much too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> These have no flavor slathered on the floss, which is wonderful.  I cannot find them in any store that are plain and not flavored.  What would I do without Amazon?  Just floss; no goop coating the floss.  Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find these refills and the Reach access Flosser is the best one that I can recommend.  Easy to use...not more hands in the mouth to floss your teeth</li>
            <li> Product is fine, however the price is way too high.  The mint flavored version is much less expensive.  Unfortunately, my family prefers the unflavored.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Works better than any other flosser product for me.  I have large hands and a small mouth and this gets to all parts of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find these on Amazon after being frustrated looking in stores for months. These are the very best solution for flossing that I know of. You can floss in hard to reach spots easily. They also allow for one-handed use.&lt;br /&gt;They are less messy as users do not have to open up as wide.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some flossers, the floss never detaches. I much prefer these un scented ones.</li>
            <li> Still the gold standard in flossing. I recommend the clean paste version (the one with the blue color). The unflavored gets boring and weird tasting. I&#x27;ve tried similar products from other brands but they use cheap floss or weird refill configurations. None are as good as Reach.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and find these extremely useful for flossing. They work well. I intend to buy more when they are needed.</li>
            <li> We are always searching for these refill packs for the reach flosser.  This was just what we needed, so thank you for selling these in a large package.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I like the fact that I can reach hard to reach places and it still does the job.</li>
            <li> I was never a big flosser. My dentist suggested I start using this product and I now floss daily. It is great. I highly recommend you use this product.</li>
            <li> Beats trying to floss with just floss</li>
            <li> As described, and came extremely fast.  It has been superseded by &amp;#34;Listerine Access Flosser&amp;#34;, and this is merely a rebranding.  It is the same product.  The Reach and Listerine flosser and heads are compatible.  This vendor was VERY prompt.</li>
            <li> this is the only way i can get my favorite flossers with out their usual peppermint taste which i am allergic to.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years, they work well for me, and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> Will be getting these again.</li>
            <li> I love the reach Flosser and I much prefer these unflavored heads to the really minty ones. I recommend these.</li>
            <li> Love these floss sticks!!!!  I am extremely disappointed that Johnson &amp; Johnson is discontinuing this product. They are replacing it with a product that is only offered in &#x27;mint&#x27; flavor and I must have the unflavored product.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I can only find this unflavored floss refill on line.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Buying in quantity is both convenient and cost effective.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like flossing? Takes a lot of time and it&#x27;s uncomfortable?&lt;br /&gt;This product is the answer. Flossing is simple and fast.</li>
            <li> Great price for so many refills..</li>
            <li> After having received notification that the item had been shipped, we received notification that we were being reimbursed since item was no longer available!  Very disappointing and frustrating.</li>
            <li> My hubby has had trouble finding these heads (we fear that J&amp;J is discontinuing them!), but these arrived quickly, were packaged beautifully - and now I have a happy hubby (with gleaming teeth and healthy gums!)</li>
            <li> Cleans the back of my teeth easily and simple to use.</li>
            <li> With the floss reach stick and these flosser refill packs, I am more motivated to floss at night. Using the floss string doesn&#x27;t help. Also, buying them on here is cheaper than buying them in the store.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what we wanted. For some reason, the stores around our place aren&#x27;t carrying them anymore. They arrived quickly and we were very pleased.</li>
            <li> Repeat order and recommend this Reach product for personal dental health.  Seller shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Was able to get six of these four packs.  Cost less on line then in the stores and you can buy bulk. In the stores the shelf will have maybe four of these on a peg to buy at a time.  They work great and you just toss when finish.</li>
            <li> I love these because they are flavorless I hate the taste of the minty ones&lt;br /&gt;We had a hard time finding these&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for having them for us</li>
            <li> not sure why these aren&#x27;t available in a store anymore - they are a great invention for those who choke with your whole hand in your mouth!</li>
            <li> i purchased these for my husband, i like the clean paste ones, he wants no flavor. can&#x27;t find these in stores, only the mint. i am very happy to have found them online for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely cynical money making scheme. Compare this product with the Flossaid Floss Holder which doesn&#x27;t require purchasing overpriced refills. You end up spending a huge amount more with this than you do with alternative floss holders, which is wonderful for this company, which is trying (and succeeding) to suck as much money from you as possible. Don&#x27;t be fooled--by some saner floss holders that don&#x27;t require unnecessary overpriced refills.</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued by mfg.  No alternative to flavored version by Listerine any more.</li>
            <li> Our dentist continues to brag on how well our teeth look.  We have a reach flosser in every vehicle and our overnite kits as well!</li>
            <li> awesome!! awesome!! glad you guys had these my wife looked all over town and could not find them. thanks bunch.</li>
            <li> I use a reach flosser and always have trouble finding the unflavored refills in store.  I ordered these and they are just what I expected and wanted - at a reasonable price!</li>
