            <li>When I received my bottle, it had a very strong medicinal smell, not by any stretch of the imagination</li>
            <li>So happy to have found a quality EO at such a good price!</li>

            <li>I got it as an antiseptic/antifungal and so far, so good!</li>
            <li>have been much more floral, light and &#x27;soapy&#x27; smelling.</li>

            <li>Easy to find and order...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a hint of sweetness, not a hint of anything floral, just a strong medicinal type scent.</li>
            <li>This smells more medicinal and herbal than sweet and floral.</li>

            <li>Plant therapy essential oils are very good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes you feel better using this instead of a whole bunch of unknown chemicals.</li>
            <li>The description mentions that this oil has a \\&quot;sweet floral scent.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>did it have a sweet or floral smell.</li>
            <li>I know that my oil was not rancid, as it did not smell rancid at all, just medicinal and not at all sweet.</li>
            <li>product came quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the strength and quality of this essential oil.</li>
            <li>This is a strong smelling product but as it states it is 100% pure UNDILUTED</li>
            <li>Fast easy shipping...</li>
            <li>The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  </li>
            <li>It helped the rash but the smell may not be worth it.</li>
            <li>Right now using it as a hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Learning of all the benefits right now.</li>
            <li>I MADE MY FIRST BODY LOTION</li>
            <li>I take the top off and leave it open on my bedstand.  </li>
            <li>and this is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>Love ordering from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>This EO seems to be high quality and was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong for the first day, then it faded away the next day.  </li>
            <li>I use a lot of lavender and have several different kinds - this one is a very good quality - and I got it shortly after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>No, sorry, this is an absolute lie.</li>
            <li>I would recommend starting with one drop and adding from there because it is strong.</li>
            <li>Very helpful when the post office decided to send my shipment on a scenic route.</li>
            <li>No complaints from me since it is a very relaxing smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal</li>
            <li>Stunk up our whole house.  </li>
            <li>I tried different organic versions, but always had to go back to an extra-strength kind.  </li>
            <li>This really made my red marks fade really quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Plant Therapy Essential Oils and love that they offer organic oils.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>After using it on acne on my face and then trying a more expensive, better smelling french lavender oil, I had to come back and say that this oil is by far more therapeutic.</li>
            <li>I actually use it to help calm my child.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, they get right back to you.  </li>
            <li>Also tried some other oils from this company and they are equally fabulous</li>
            <li>When I opened it, it had the same medicinal smell as the first one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a little bit more of a medicinal (strong) lavender smell than some other lesser quality oils I have used</li>
            <li>This is not the sweet lavender that most people (or at least me) would think of due to the misconceptions of the smell in commercial products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this essential oil.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product a few days ago and was surprised to receive it so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this if you have new acne scars and red marks.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this really helped with red marks &#x27;cause I also apply aloe vera( fresh)</li>
            <li>Husband has trouble sleeping at night due to facial spasms and using this lavender for a week has helped him rest much better.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than some other brands</li>
            <li>I complained about the problem, the company then sent me a second bottle of this oil for free.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and other Plant Therapy Oils.</li>

            <li> Plant therapy essential oils are very good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes you feel better using this instead of a whole bunch of unknown chemicals.</li>
            <li> The description mentions that this oil has a \\&quot;sweet floral scent.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> did it have a sweet or floral smell.</li>
            <li> I know that my oil was not rancid, as it did not smell rancid at all, just medicinal and not at all sweet.</li>
            <li> product came quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the strength and quality of this essential oil.</li>
            <li> This is a strong smelling product but as it states it is 100% pure UNDILUTED</li>
            <li> Fast easy shipping...</li>
            <li> The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  </li>
            <li> It helped the rash but the smell may not be worth it.</li>
            <li> Right now using it as a hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Learning of all the benefits right now.</li>
            <li> I MADE MY FIRST BODY LOTION</li>
            <li> I take the top off and leave it open on my bedstand.  </li>
            <li> and this is the real deal!  </li>
            <li> Love ordering from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> This EO seems to be high quality and was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong for the first day, then it faded away the next day.  </li>
            <li> I use a lot of lavender and have several different kinds - this one is a very good quality - and I got it shortly after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> No, sorry, this is an absolute lie.</li>
            <li> I would recommend starting with one drop and adding from there because it is strong.</li>
            <li> Very helpful when the post office decided to send my shipment on a scenic route.</li>
            <li> No complaints from me since it is a very relaxing smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal</li>
            <li> Stunk up our whole house.  </li>
            <li> I tried different organic versions, but always had to go back to an extra-strength kind.  </li>
            <li> This really made my red marks fade really quick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Plant Therapy Essential Oils and love that they offer organic oils.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After using it on acne on my face and then trying a more expensive, better smelling french lavender oil, I had to come back and say that this oil is by far more therapeutic.</li>
            <li> I actually use it to help calm my child.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions, they get right back to you.  </li>
            <li> Also tried some other oils from this company and they are equally fabulous</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it had the same medicinal smell as the first one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit more of a medicinal (strong) lavender smell than some other lesser quality oils I have used</li>
            <li> This is not the sweet lavender that most people (or at least me) would think of due to the misconceptions of the smell in commercial products.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this essential oil.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few days ago and was surprised to receive it so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this if you have new acne scars and red marks.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this really helped with red marks &#x27;cause I also apply aloe vera( fresh)</li>
            <li> Husband has trouble sleeping at night due to facial spasms and using this lavender for a week has helped him rest much better.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than some other brands</li>
            <li> I complained about the problem, the company then sent me a second bottle of this oil for free.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and other Plant Therapy Oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat minor things like diaper rash, bug bites and sunburns.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I put a small amount direct on my pillow.  </li>
            <li> I had to come back and edit my previous review.</li>
            <li> I added as little amount as possible of it that I could get out of the bottle with the emu and put it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not the smell I expected.</li>
            <li> I might buy another empty bottle to dilute it with jojoba oil as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> smells a bit synthetic, but burns well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other lavender oils I have smelled</li>
            <li> Even though I do not like lavender, I bought it (and other products) to make homemade bug spray.</li>
            <li> I also thought of using in baths but absolutely not!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the other lavender oils I have used before from other brands.</li>
            <li> Very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> drip does seem to come out a bit much, my only complaint and it may just be my bottle.</li>
            <li> but I guess when you get a whiff of the artificial stuff you loose the scent of what it really is supposed to smell like.</li>
            <li> I was first unhappy with the oil because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I mix it with shea butter or coconut oil and massage her feet and hands and dot a little on her forehead.</li>
            <li> Put a few drops on your sheets by your pillows, will help you sleep and relax at night.  </li>
            <li> I dabbed a bit on my pillows and added a few drops to my dog&#x27;s bathwater.  </li>
            <li> Smelled like some kind of awful disinfectant.  </li>
            <li> but I can usually tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the smell.</li>
            <li> This lavender has a harsh, woody and unpleasant smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to make a homemade hair treatment with a coconut oil base.</li>
            <li> This stuff is overpowering with a BAD stench!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it as a moth repellent.  </li>
            <li> The smell is horrific!</li>
            <li> after all this cold days!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell, the price is great, and the packaging is perfect!</li>
            <li> I MADE MY FIRST BODY LOTION AND I USE THIS LAVENDER AND IT SMELLS GREAT AND IT DOESN&#x27;T IRRITATE YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> This does have the best smell of all essential lavenders I have tried. Nice consistency. Works well. Husband has trouble sleeping at night due to facial spasms and using this lavender for a week has helped him rest much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat minor things like diaper rash, bug bites and sunburns.  This lavender has a harsh, woody and unpleasant smell to it.  I am not an expert in lavender but I wonder is this isn&#x27;t actually lavandin, a lavender hybrid.  Other lavender oils I have smelled have been much more floral, light and &#x27;soapy&#x27; smelling.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Lavender supposed to help one sleep.  I take the top off and leave it open on my bedstand.  Sometimes I put a small amount direct on my pillow.  Even if I don&#x27;t go to sleep the room smells great.</li>
            <li> I am not too fond of the smell of lavender but I can usually tolerate it. I had a friend tell me this was a good cure for itchy rashes (like poison ivy) so I ordered this. I applied it to my husband&#x27;s poison ivy and it made both of us cringe. The smell was rancid. It helped the rash but the smell may not be worth it.</li>
            <li> I love their oils and use lavender in a lot of my homemade face creams, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> Wife is using EO for variety of purposes.  This EO seems to be high quality and was shipped quickly.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not the smell I expected. Instead of relaxing me it gives me a headache</li>
            <li> Very nice, will buy from again</li>
            <li> This was a great essential oil. I used it in place of a dryer sheet, and I liked it a lot. Smells great and makes you feel better using this instead of a whole bunch of unknown chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Plant Therapy Essential Oils and love that they offer organic oils.  Lavender is a must have oil in my household and this is the real deal!  It does have a little bit more of a medicinal (strong) lavender smell than some other lesser quality oils I have used but it is more effective than those brands.  I highly recommend this and other Plant Therapy Oils.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Plant Therapy has the best essential oils and they are reasonably priced.  If you have any questions, they get right back to you.  I love this company and their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lavender is perfect - I use it for sleep.  I also put a drop in my mascara to add to the health of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love it! Smells wonderful, and came very quickly and packaging was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price.  Customer service was also excellent.  Very helpful when the post office decided to send my shipment on a scenic route.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff a lot.  I made my own fabric softener using the lavender and epsom salts, and it made the laundry smell great. I also use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the lavender it&#x27;s smell was very nice. Plant therapy essential oils are very good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I use this for so many things, including my DIY skincare. I would definitely purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;The drip does seem to come out a bit much, my only complaint and it may just be my bottle. Overall, great product and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> It has the aroma I needed for my diffuser.</li>
            <li> I only put organic stuff on my face, so once I get this product, I will apply on entire face. My skin can handle it by itself.  I might buy another empty bottle to dilute it with jojoba oil as a moisturizer.  Lavender oil is my favorite! I love the smell, I smell good when I apply on skin and hair. I like smelling this.. I do inhale deeply to feel relaxed. I recommend this if you have new acne scars and red marks. This really made my red marks fade really quick.  Not sure if this really helped with red marks &#x27;cause I also apply aloe vera( fresh) but I did research and saw this minimize scars which it did to me. It also make your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance.  Delighted.</li>
            <li> I used the organic lavender in a body scub I made with coconut oil and sugar.  It is amazing and the scent is not overpowering.  I love the Plant Therapy oils!!</li>
            <li> Has a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece, who has been in the hospital. I mix it with shea butter or coconut oil and massage her feet and hands and dot a little on her forehead. She says it relaxes her and soothes her anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the purity and high quality of the product and will order more from this dealer.</li>
            <li> Fast easy shipping...excellent quality - organic and smells wonderful.  Easy to find and order...i use this on my skin &amp; it helps with relaxation.</li>
            <li> This was as advertised, packaged well and works great. I got it as an antiseptic/antifungal and so far, so good! Great price.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of lavender and have several different kinds - this one is a very good quality - and I got it shortly after I ordered it. I will purchase again from this shop. Blessings, Cheryl Janecky</li>
            <li> The ladies in the family use it on pillows, throws, etc.  No complaints from me since it is a very relaxing smell.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I buy lavender oil for my wife.  The fragrance is natural and the quality of the oil is excellent.  She often mixes it with unscented lotion to make the perfect blend.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great smell (not too medicinal). So happy to have found a quality EO at such a good price!</li>
            <li> Plant therapy oils are so nice. I&#x27;m really impressed by the quality. I actually use it to help calm my child. I mixed it with lotion and shampoo and it helps relax the body.. I also infuse it with water and burn it out with a candle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this essential oil. It is a fantastic moisturizer for hair and skin in the shower or bath and it smells divine.</li>
            <li> I just love the way this smells when it is diluted. I made a spray for our bedroom and it smells so wonderful when you walk in the room. I also used this for washing my bedsheets and my sheets smell so wonderful even after they are dried. Such a plus that it is organic. Will definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent &amp; I love that it&#x27;s organic.  Plant Therapy always has great oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many lavender oils and this is one of my favorites! The smell is amazing and even diluted, still smells lovely! Much cheaper than some other brands but has all the same benefits! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great oil from Plant Therapy.  Put a few drops on your sheets by your pillows, will help you sleep and relax at night.  Item as described and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> product came quickly and as described. great fresh scent. product is organic which is great to find. I will be using this product in home made air freshener, linen spray, cleaning, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Will work with it more over the summer. Smell OK. Right now using it as a hand moisturizer. Learning of all the benefits right now.</li>
            <li> The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  Even though I do not like lavender, I bought it (and other products) to make homemade bug spray. It worked great!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this oil at a great price!!</li>
            <li> I use this for my dryer balls. It makes my laundry room and clothes smell magnificent!</li>
            <li> I got this to keep away mosquitoes and help me sleep. I didn&#x27;t realize how potent it is, but it is just what I need. I would recommend starting with one drop and adding from there because it is strong. I put one drop on my pillow once a week and it is great!</li>
            <li> how can you not like lavender?</li>
            <li> Used this product on the soles of my toddlers feet when she broke out into a fever and experienced body aches. To my amazement, the fever broke and the aches went away within minutes!</li>
            <li> Great product and helpful for some many uses: diffusing into the air, sleep aid, or for insect bites.  Great value, too!</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the smell. I Have tried various ways but I just don&#x27;t get any satisfaction from the product.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful, and priced better than lower grade counterparts. Also tried some other oils from this company and they are equally fabulous</li>
            <li> Excellent, strong pure, shipping arrived before I expected it.  I will definitely order&lt;br /&gt;more esential oils from Plant Therapy.  If one is using it as a medicine, this is&lt;br /&gt;the one</li>
            <li> Ow... $10 for a tiny tiny bottle.  I wanted to use it as a moth repellent.  The fragrance is strong for the first day, then it faded away the next day.  I soaked about 15 cotton balls with this oil and the smell still didn&#x27;t last.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Well I love Organic things but I guess when you get a whiff of the artificial stuff you loose the scent of what it really is supposed to smell like. However it does help with my pain and it truely is very potent and a good calmer for people.&lt;br /&gt;thx medicine</li>
            <li> Ive never bought Lavender oil before so I cant compare it to others but I just got this in the mail today. I wanted it to mix with some emu oil for a scar remedy. I added as little amount as possible of it that I could get out of the bottle with the emu and put it on my skin. The smell is horrific! Its giving me a headache and making me nauceous! Im going to have to get another shower to get it off me and the rest will be going in the garbage. I also thought of using in baths but absolutely not! This stuff is overpowering with a BAD stench!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil, love the lavender smell and this oil is odorant enough.&lt;br /&gt;I like to put 2-3 drops on my pillow before I go to bed...</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy never disappoints, this one is no different!  Great quality!</li>
            <li> This oil smells and works great, and seems very fresh. I was worried about quality for the price, but I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> I love lavender - scent is great. i Will definitely be buying from this vendor again when I am all out!</li>
            <li> This is not the sweet lavender that most people (or at least me) would think of due to the misconceptions of the smell in commercial products.  This is a strong smelling product but as it states it is 100% pure UNDILUTED - this is the truth. Very little goes a long way. This product is the real deal and I find that it works well in laundry and liquid soaps/handwash.  It arrived very quickly and thus far am very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> very nice for every use.</li>
            <li> I was in search of something to replace chemical-laden deodorants.  I tried different organic versions, but always had to go back to an extra-strength kind.  Through online research I came across a YouTube video in which this model says she almost never puts on deodorant, even in the heat of the summer because she uses this essential oil.  I also ordered another product that is basically a kind of rubbing alcohol spray that smells like citrus, which kills any bacteria that causes the odor, and then I add this oil for long-lasting protection and a nice scent along with it.  Love this oil!</li>
            <li> Eh. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the other lavender oils I have used before from other brands. Good thing I am just using it for cleaning instead of medicinal uses.</li>
            <li> Love ordering from Plant Therapy Essential Oils. Great Prices on all the oils.The lavender is pure and wonderful in a mister.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few days ago and was surprised to receive it so quickly.  The packaging was okay, and the product was intact.  The first thing I noticed was the wonderful aroma - - smells great.  I dabbed a bit on my pillows and added a few drops to my dog&#x27;s bathwater.  Very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Stunk up our whole house.  Smelled like some kind of awful disinfectant.  Not relaxing at all.  Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research trying to find the best affordable essential oils and I believe these are it!! I love these oils and they ship very fast for free which is also great.</li>
            <li> I had to come back and edit my previous review. I was first unhappy with the oil because of the smell. This smells more medicinal and herbal than sweet and floral. After using it on acne on my face and then trying a more expensive, better smelling french lavender oil, I had to come back and say that this oil is by far more therapeutic. It cures breakouts in a couple of days, and if you apply when a pimple is just starting it will just disappear! Best acne treatment in the world and no side effects like chemical medications!!! Also, a fraction of the cost. A life saver!!! So 3 stars for the smell but, 5 stars for medicinal value.</li>
            <li> uuummm  uuuummm  uuummm  LOVE IT!!!.. Nothing like a pillow smelling like a delicious spring... after all this cold days!!!</li>
            <li> smells a bit synthetic, but burns well and a little goes a long way. I mix with Rosemary so the combination is nice, good for the price.</li>
            <li> A bit potent, however I use it as an air freshener &amp; it leaves a nice refreshing smell. Id never heard of this, until a friend told me about it. Didn&#x27;t knw where I could find it, so when in doubt go 2 Amazon. If u don&#x27;t find ANY item there, then it doesn&#x27;t exist!</li>
            <li> Perfect for allergies!! I love adding to bath during allergy season : )</li>
            <li> This oil has a pleasant aroma, not as \\&quot;lavender-ie\\&quot; as I would like, but it is nice. I put it on my pillows at night and do think it relaxs me.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the strength and quality of this essential oil. Would recommend and will reorder.</li>
            <li> It had a chemically smell to it.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipment and item as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to make a homemade hair treatment with a coconut oil base. It worked well and has a very strong and very pleasant fragrance; I mixed it with vetiver essential oil. I like its aromatherapy value, too, which wasn&#x27;t what I originally bought it for.</li>
            <li> The description mentions that this oil has a \\&quot;sweet floral scent.\\&quot; No, sorry, this is an absolute lie. When I received my bottle, it had a very strong medicinal smell, not by any stretch of the imagination did it have a sweet or floral smell. I know that my oil was not rancid, as it did not smell rancid at all, just medicinal and not at all sweet. This is probably not lavender oil, but something else instead. I think this company is using a substitute and calling it lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I complained about the problem, the company then sent me a second bottle of this oil for free. When I opened it, it had the same medicinal smell as the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a hint of sweetness, not a hint of anything floral, just a strong medicinal type scent. Not even remotely pleasant. I use it on my skin and it does seem to have some medicinal properties, but then again I could just be getting a placebo effect, I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying lavender oil from another company in the future.</li>
