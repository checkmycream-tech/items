            <li>The Thickening Spray works fine with or withOUT the PM Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo/Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use this product more for the quick drying aspect then the thickening.  </li>
            <li>Advanced...</li>
            <li>In my area you can only buy it at Hair Cuttery, so it&#x27;s great that  amazon has it.  </li>
            <li>I have had more success with the drug store thickening or volumizing products.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, with a light scent, and also feels light on my hair, not heavy or sticky like many hair products.   </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anybody suffering from light thinning of the hair.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much I bought two.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product from my hair dresser.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner and loved both products.</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years,  does what it says,  smells good too</li>
            <li>I feel that it really helps keep your hair healthy and well behaved.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and live in the humid state of Florida.  </li>
            <li>This does indeed smell great and fresh, and not intense.  </li>
            <li>I ran out and luckily found it here...  </li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell makes the best hair thickening spray and I must be one of few users in the area I live because I no longer can find it in any retail outlet or salon.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this thickening spray last summer and find that using it on dry hair in order for restyling or reivigorating a day-old style is the best way to use it.  </li>
            <li>The smaller bottle smells fresher, and hair was manageable, feels natural, pleasant and light.</li>
            <li>I keep buying this because it is not sticky or heavy and smells great.</li>
            <li>It has been worth the money.  </li>
            <li>As I am getting older my fine hair has become thinner.</li>
            <li>and she was right</li>
            <li>The Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Spray is a great product for fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel pretty again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>post back when I have more info</li>
            <li>Not only does this product make my hair fuller but it also makes me look like I have more hair.</li>
            <li>Much to my delight, my search led me to Amazon!</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product about two years ago when I went to the hair salon to have a perm.  </li>
            <li>I am a 24 year old caucasion male with fair brown-blonde hair, who has been stressed from finishing school and trying to find a job and ergo found my hair was much thinner.</li>
            <li>I have struggled all my life with fine hair and I live in a place with high humidity - so a nightmare for styling my hair in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Even after wearing a hat and sweating on a hot (Los Angeles) day, my hair seems to bounce back and look clean again within 15 minutes of removing the hat!  </li>
            <li>It seems just more effective in styling on dry hair as opposed to wet, shampooed hair.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product because I love the shampoo so much.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this trio.  </li>
            <li>I ended up really liking it.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t really seen or felt the volume</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>So much easier to order it this way.</li>
            <li>i like this whole line of hair care products from paul mitchell.</li>
            <li>I noticed no change in the thickness of my hair, in fact my hair seemed more weighed down and almost greasy.</li>
            <li>This stuff does its job - Spray it on damp hair, comb through (that part is important), and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I normally wash my hair daily, but using this spray enables me to have my hair looking fresh the next day - without having a fresh wash.   </li>
            <li>and I like trying new products</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and sculpting foam seems to weigh it down when I style it.  </li>
            <li>this spray is the first product I have ever used that actually did what I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>But this spray doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the shampoo &amp; conditioner (sort of old-man-ish, actually) and it tends to make my hair really gunky and greasy feeling after only a few hours.</li>
            <li>I had not tried other hair thickeners, but decided to try this as my fine, straight hair which can often get really flat by mid-day.  </li>
            <li>i have super thin &amp; fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Okay product, but I found a similar volume product for half the cost :</li>
            <li>the bottle in the picture clearly says 2.5 ounces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 50s and am experiencing the change that many woman do at this age.  </li>
            <li>This product actually makes my hair look and feel thicker and MUCH easier to style even in the humidity.</li>
            <li>It does work and while my hair is not thin, I do like the added volume immensely.  </li>
            <li>It does make your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Took everything home and after researching my findings realized this spray might be something that would help my baby soft hair.</li>
            <li>This spray is designed to be applied directly to the scalp and then rubbed in.</li>
            <li>Its not heavy on my hair</li>
            <li>Perfect for thin hair to build volume when blow drying with big round brush.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but have trouble finding it in a regular store.  </li>
            <li>That second day \\&quot;look\\&quot; also appears to give my thin hair more volume - another plus for its use for me !</li>
            <li>it gives volume to hair like no other product I have used</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and this cuts my drying time nearly in half.  </li>
            <li>but when I do, especially if I&#x27;m going out, it goes a long way to way my scalp look much thicker.</li>
            <li>I like my hair to look as natural as possible,</li>
            <li>this stuff really works, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t cause a lot of hair to come out when i use it like some other products</li>
            <li>The only other thing I want to note as a positive is it is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>I hope it is not an imitation, but real Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without using this spray to style my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Helps me manage my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair, and after using this product it was like I didn&#x27;t put anything on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>

            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this trio.  </li>
            <li> I ended up really liking it.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t really seen or felt the volume</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> So much easier to order it this way.</li>
            <li> i like this whole line of hair care products from paul mitchell.</li>
            <li> I noticed no change in the thickness of my hair, in fact my hair seemed more weighed down and almost greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff does its job - Spray it on damp hair, comb through (that part is important), and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I normally wash my hair daily, but using this spray enables me to have my hair looking fresh the next day - without having a fresh wash.   </li>
            <li> and I like trying new products</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and sculpting foam seems to weigh it down when I style it.  </li>
            <li> this spray is the first product I have ever used that actually did what I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> But this spray doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the shampoo &amp; conditioner (sort of old-man-ish, actually) and it tends to make my hair really gunky and greasy feeling after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> I had not tried other hair thickeners, but decided to try this as my fine, straight hair which can often get really flat by mid-day.  </li>
            <li> i have super thin &amp; fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Okay product, but I found a similar volume product for half the cost :</li>
            <li> the bottle in the picture clearly says 2.5 ounces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50s and am experiencing the change that many woman do at this age.  </li>
            <li> This product actually makes my hair look and feel thicker and MUCH easier to style even in the humidity.</li>
            <li> It does work and while my hair is not thin, I do like the added volume immensely.  </li>
            <li> It does make your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Took everything home and after researching my findings realized this spray might be something that would help my baby soft hair.</li>
            <li> This spray is designed to be applied directly to the scalp and then rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Its not heavy on my hair</li>
            <li> Perfect for thin hair to build volume when blow drying with big round brush.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but have trouble finding it in a regular store.  </li>
            <li> That second day \\&quot;look\\&quot; also appears to give my thin hair more volume - another plus for its use for me !</li>
            <li> it gives volume to hair like no other product I have used</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate and this cuts my drying time nearly in half.  </li>
            <li> but when I do, especially if I&#x27;m going out, it goes a long way to way my scalp look much thicker.</li>
            <li> I like my hair to look as natural as possible,</li>
            <li> this stuff really works, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t cause a lot of hair to come out when i use it like some other products</li>
            <li> The only other thing I want to note as a positive is it is not sticky.  </li>
            <li> I hope it is not an imitation, but real Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without using this spray to style my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Helps me manage my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, and after using this product it was like I didn&#x27;t put anything on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I also have fine &amp; thin hair, this just made it flat &amp; lifeless.</li>
            <li> It kinda makes my hair sticky and stiff not so much anything else.</li>
            <li> I already have thick hair but having an extra boost of thickness is an added bonus to the quick dry time.</li>
            <li> live in a rural setting and was not able to find this larger size so you can imagine how&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t up to the standard of all the other Paul Mitchell products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and it looks thicker and stays in place.  </li>
            <li> You can use it and not blow your hair dry too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the thickening spray a few weeks later, wanting to have the entire trio of products.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply after a shower, just spray and comb, not getting you hands dirty.</li>
            <li> The thickening spray gives my hair that little extra &amp;#34;umpf&amp;#34; of all over height and volume with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I spray it on wet hair and comb</li>
            <li> noticed that since my hair is so thin it makes a much fuller and thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I already had a Spray and thought the shampoo/conditioner would help but not much difference.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair thick feeling like when I was young.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder about all these other rave reviews ...</li>
            <li> do due to how sticky the product is.  </li>
            <li> But I felt this one makes my hair heavy, and dry up and not keeping the lustre.</li>
            <li> Simply spray a small bit of this into your hair, rub it a little and brush.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when it arrived the product was leaking out.</li>
            <li> helps me keep my cow lick hidden.  </li>
            <li> and then I usually blow my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell does warn of counterfeit hair care products directly on the bottle, so perhaps the bottle I purchased online was watered down or fake.</li>
            <li> And it does give my hair a little lift, so it looks just-washed all day rather than a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> I bought it from amazon a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> The spray gives my hair volume but is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The thicking spary gives my hair body, and my hair isn&#x27;t limp.  </li>
            <li> Hair was getting thin, both in quantity and actual thickness of the strands.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, gave to my sister who also said it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product everyday</li>
            <li> Not important for me, but it may be for some.</li>
            <li> It adds volume without feeling sticky or too heavy.</li>
            <li> this product gives volume,is not sticky and does not cause your hair to be stiff when applied.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a year now,my hairdresser started me using it and it is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> Product did leak in shipping but very little.</li>
            <li> I spray it on and then blow dry it, and it makes very thin hair have body and style.  </li>
            <li> And at least it isnt sticky.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and have spent years trying products.</li>
            <li> sorry this product was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Adds grest volume to thin hair without flstteningbitbout like mousse.  </li>
            <li> It does wonders for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this product, but unfortunately I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I stumbled onto this product as I had been searching for something to manage thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair...</li>
            <li> really thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I use very small amounts (spraying fingertips and working up through hair that way), so it isn&#x27;t from going crazy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not notice any difference when i used this product!</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Ended up in the garbage. :(</li>

            <li> Love the product.  Adds grest volume to thin hair without flstteningbitbout like mousse.  Product did leak in shipping but very little.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without using this spray to style my thin, fine hair.  I color my hair and add highlights.  I&#x27;m in my late 50s and am experiencing the change that many woman do at this age.  This spray along with Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo and conditioner has given me shiny, thicker, healthy hair.  I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this trio.  I love the effortless transaction through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought the matching shampoo &amp; conditioner, which I LOVE. They work well and smell delicious! But this spray doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the shampoo &amp; conditioner (sort of old-man-ish, actually) and it tends to make my hair really gunky and greasy feeling after only a few hours. I use very small amounts (spraying fingertips and working up through hair that way), so it isn&#x27;t from going crazy with the product. It just isn&#x27;t up to the standard of all the other Paul Mitchell products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always buy Paul Mitchell though; NO ANIMAL TESTING / CRUELTY FREE!</li>
            <li> my hairstylist recommending this and I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this definitely helps my hair look and feel thicker. It helps my styling as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it from amazon a few months ago. Has been using it, but I think it is different than the smaller size bottle I got from the salon. The smaller bottle smells fresher, and hair was manageable, feels natural, pleasant and light. I loved it. But I felt this one makes my hair heavy, and dry up and not keeping the lustre. I hope it is not an imitation, but real Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of product for it to thicken.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thickening spray last summer and find that using it on dry hair in order for restyling or reivigorating a day-old style is the best way to use it.  It seems just more effective in styling on dry hair as opposed to wet, shampooed hair.  I normally wash my hair daily, but using this spray enables me to have my hair looking fresh the next day - without having a fresh wash.   That second day \\&quot;look\\&quot; also appears to give my thin hair more volume - another plus for its use for me !</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  I have very fine hair and live in the humid state of Florida.  This product actually makes my hair look and feel thicker and MUCH easier to style even in the humidity.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has a great scent and really gives your hair more fullness.  I also use it for detangling !!</li>
            <li> The Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Spray is a great product for fine, thin hair.  It gives me extra body and helps my hair to hold the style.  Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I had never used a thickening spray before and didn&#x27;t think I needed it but my niece had this product and I like trying new products so I gave it a whirl.  I ended up really liking it.  It does work and while my hair is not thin, I do like the added volume immensely.  I also like the scent.  The only other thing I want to note as a positive is it is not sticky.  I&#x27;m able to style my hair and my brushes go through my hair smoothly.  I&#x27;ve added it to my daily morning routine and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff~</li>
            <li> This product works great to make fine hair appear thicker...I use it every morning. Not sticky or heavy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Okay product, but I found a similar volume product for half the cost : Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection AgeDefy Advanced...&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t really seen or felt the volume</li>
            <li> I am going bald and this does a good job of thickening my hair.  It  does the job of making my hair look a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying this product and decided to give it a try. It does wonders for my thin hair.  I spray it on wet hair and comb it thought.  Then I style.  This product gives my hair texture and therefore a fuller look.  I feel pretty again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great lite thickener.  In my area you can only buy it at Hair Cuttery, so it&#x27;s great that  amazon has it.  It gives hold without brittleness and fullness without greasiness.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever used on my hair.  The spray gives my hair volume but is not too heavy.  Absolutely awesome!  I have struggled all my life with fine hair and I live in a place with high humidity - so a nightmare for styling my hair in the summer.  This product has changed my &amp;#34;hair life.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my hair thick feeling like when I was young. I am constantly getting compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> this product gives volume,is not sticky and does not cause your hair to be stiff when applied. Really works well. I have used it for over a year now,my hairdresser started me using it and it is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this because it is not sticky or heavy and smells great. Perfect for thin hair to build volume when blow drying with big round brush. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but have trouble finding it in a regular store.  So much easier to order it this way.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month. Bought a second bottle. Hair seems fuller. Defiantly softer.&lt;br /&gt;Will post back when I have more info</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and sculpting foam seems to weigh it down when I style it.  The thicking spary gives my hair body, and my hair isn&#x27;t limp.  Best product I have used!.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of hair products.  I don&#x27;t like to smell like a lot of products either.  I like my hair to look as natural as possible, just really good.  I had not tried other hair thickeners, but decided to try this as my fine, straight hair which can often get really flat by mid-day.  This does indeed smell great and fresh, and not intense.  And it does give my hair a little lift, so it looks just-washed all day rather than a couple hours.  Even after wearing a hat and sweating on a hot (Los Angeles) day, my hair seems to bounce back and look clean again within 15 minutes of removing the hat!  Also does not feel like I have any product in it, which I love.  This product won&#x27;t give you &#x27;the hair you never had&#x27;, but it will help give you more good hair days.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from the reviews of it being really good, but it really doesnt thicken as well as some others on the market.  It does make your hair soft and shiny.  And at least it isnt sticky.</li>
            <li> This will definitely make your hair thicker.  Feels like hair spray if you do not brush it all out.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this product, but unfortunately I am very disappointed! I noticed no change in the thickness of my hair, in fact my hair seemed more weighed down and almost greasy. I have had more success with the drug store thickening or volumizing products. Paul Mitchell does warn of counterfeit hair care products directly on the bottle, so perhaps the bottle I purchased online was watered down or fake.</li>
            <li> Hair was getting thin, both in quantity and actual thickness of the strands. This product was reccommended to me by a Paul Mitchell school and it actually works. I don&#x27;t write reviews, but for women over 60, it&#x27;s like having my younger head of hair back...</li>
            <li> Great product - will be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> I love this thickening spray from Paul Mitchell. I have very fine hair, and this works awesome. I also use the tea tree shampoo and styling gel. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It kinda makes my hair sticky and stiff not so much anything else. Smells good tho</li>
            <li> I love this product! I spray it when my hair is damp. It&#x27;s light, adds volume and smells great! My only complaint is that when it arrived the product was leaking out. I wish the spray portion was better packaged to prevent spilling during shipping.</li>
            <li> I was given a smaller size of this product last year for Christmas by my Beautician.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that since my hair is so thin it makes a much fuller and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a rural setting and was not able to find this larger size so you can imagine how&lt;br /&gt;excited I was to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner and loved both products. My hair looks thicker and is definitely more manageable.  I purchased the thickening spray a few weeks later, wanting to have the entire trio of products.  It smells nice, with a light scent, and also feels light on my hair, not heavy or sticky like many hair products.   This product makes a nice addition to the shampoo and conditioner, and I expect to continue using all three products.  They are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this product. As I am getting older my fine hair has become thinner. Not only does this product make my hair fuller but it also makes me look like I have more hair. Love Love Love this product.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell makes the best hair thickening spray and I must be one of few users in the area I live because I no longer can find it in any retail outlet or salon.  I spray it on and then blow dry it, and it makes very thin hair have body and style.  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this product!</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED BECAUSE MY HAIR STYLIST RECOMMENDED IT, I HAVE CURLY AND SOMETIMES FRIZZY , VERY FINE HAIR AND THIS PRODUCT MAKES IT BEAUTIFUL AND MANAGEABLE</li>
            <li> I also have fine &amp; thin hair, this just made it flat &amp; lifeless. Makes me wonder about all these other rave reviews ...</li>
            <li> Helps me manage my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product from my hair dresser.  I ran out and luckily found it here...  I have alot of baby fine hair and this product is fabulous !</li>
            <li> I love this product BUT I am concerned that it says 6.8 ounces for $16.49 but the bottle in the picture clearly says 2.5 ounces. Can someone clarify this for me?</li>
            <li> not as stated, product dosemt do anything, no thickening of hair shaft, no hold. sorry this product was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years,  does what it says,  smells good too</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I feel that it really helps keep your hair healthy and well behaved.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product every day and loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product...it gives volume to hair like no other product I have used</li>
            <li> It was sort of a fluke that I even began using this thickening spray. I picked it up at a Yard Sale in a &amp;#34;spa package&amp;#34; with a number of  items that I had never heard of. In fact I didn&#x27;t make the purchase because of the spray, but because of the basket in was in. Took everything home and after researching my findings realized this spray might be something that would help my baby soft hair. I tried it and I must say, I was impressed. I spray it on after washing and toweling my hair, but before blow drying. The thickening spray gives my hair that little extra &amp;#34;umpf&amp;#34; of all over height and volume with no sticky residue. I am plagued with a two cowlicks that make my hair severely part on each side of my scalp. The thickening spray gives my hair enough volume in those areas, that it helps almost eliminate the parts. After one use, I knew I would be buying more of this product. Much to my delight, my search led me to Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great smells - does nothing. I have fine, thin hair, and after using this product it was like I didn&#x27;t put anything on my hair. Waste of money, gave to my sister who also said it did nothing. Ended up in the garbage. :(</li>
            <li> For my fine heair, this product is perfect</li>
            <li> i have super thin &amp; fine hair.  this stuff really works, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t cause a lot of hair to come out when i use it like some other products do due to how sticky the product is.  i like this whole line of hair care products from paul mitchell.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and have spent years trying products. this spray is the first product I have ever used that actually did what I hoped it would. I have more volume, more texture, and more manageable hair. I am going to try the shampoo and conditioner in the line next!</li>
            <li> Love it - I have very fine hair and I have finally found a product that gives it some body.</li>
            <li> This spray is designed to be applied directly to the scalp and then rubbed in. It makes your hair fuller, and avoids those indentations that folks with thinning hair tend to get.</li>
            <li> I use this product more for the quick drying aspect then the thickening.  I live in a very humid climate and this cuts my drying time nearly in half.  I already have thick hair but having an extra boost of thickness is an added bonus to the quick dry time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m a repeat buyer!</li>
            <li> Love this TEA Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Spray.&lt;br /&gt;2nd time to order.  Wouldn&#x27;t  leave home without it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to All</li>
            <li> I stumbled onto this product as I had been searching for something to manage thin hair.  Simply spray a small bit of this into your hair, rub it a little and brush.  I blow dry my hair and it looks thicker and stays in place.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not notice any difference when i used this product!</li>
            <li> Wife likes product. End of story.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I was first introduced to this product about two years ago when I went to the hair salon to have a perm.  I have fine, thin hair so the beautician tried this product on my hair after the perm.  It made my hair look full, and the perm looked so good.  I now use this product all the time.  It has become a &amp;#34;best friend&amp;#34; to me.  Absolutely great product.</li>
            <li> controls my hair without leaving a sticky residue.  helps me keep my cow lick hidden.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Adds volume and manageability to your hair</li>
            <li> My wife is finally happy with a product that produces the right effect and it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this and she was right - it IS better than any gel or mousse.  I have very thin hair and this does&lt;br /&gt;make it thicker.  Has a lovely fragrance also.</li>
            <li> The Thickening Spray works fine with or withOUT the PM Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo/Conditioner. I already had a Spray and thought the shampoo/conditioner would help but not much difference. I will order the SPRAY again but probably not the shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray works ok when you blow-dry - but I see best (VOLUME) RESULTS when I use curling iron!  YMMV - HTH.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anybody suffering from light thinning of the hair. This product won&#x27;t work miracle, but for what it accomplishes and the price point, I believe it is of great value. I am a 24 year old caucasion male with fair brown-blonde hair, who has been stressed from finishing school and trying to find a job and ergo found my hair was much thinner. I don&#x27;t use this product everyday but when I do, especially if I&#x27;m going out, it goes a long way to way my scalp look much thicker. Also, like most Paul Mitchell products the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product. Liked it so much I bought two. It was very easy to order online and it arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product because I love the shampoo so much.  This spray did make my hair look thicker but it dried my hair out and frizzed it too much.  I tried it several times before finally just throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I would have returned it if I could. This did nothing for my dry/greasy hair. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Its not heavy on my hair and it has a great smell. It is easy to apply after a shower, just spray and comb, not getting you hands dirty.</li>
            <li> This stuff does its job - Spray it on damp hair, comb through (that part is important), and then blow dry.  It has a wonderful light scent and thinkens my fine hair appreciably.  One thing to note is that it doesn&#x27;t work if you let your hair air-dry.  Not important for me, but it may be for some.</li>
            <li> I just spray this product on my roots when I&#x27;m done shampooing and then I usually blow my hair dry. It adds volume without feeling sticky or too heavy. It is a great product. You can use it and not blow your hair dry too. It will still add body.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair...really thin hair.  I started using this product about a year ago and it definitely has made a difference.  My hair looks thicker and feels fuller.  I use it daily.  It has been worth the money.  I recently purchased the Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo and I actually feel the difference while still rinsing my hair.  Thank you Paul Mitchell!!</li>
