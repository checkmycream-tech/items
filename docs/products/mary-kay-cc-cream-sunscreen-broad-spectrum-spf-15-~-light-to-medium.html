            <li>So far so good....</li>
            <li>I tried this on a lark after reading so many positive reviews  </li>
            <li>that it has SPF 15 Good for winter but not enough for summer</li>
            <li>even if I just use the CC Cream, that my skin looks so fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad product</li>

            <li>Exactly as shown!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>~only wish there were more colors!</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and light, and doesn&#x27;t settle into my lines or enhance my pores (like some of the other BB creams).  </li>
            <li>(the price was right,  so why not?)</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and this moisturizes in all the right places and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oils.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It really makes you look fresh and gives just the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>My first purchase of this was from a Mary Kay Party.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried many different BB/CC creams over the years.  </li>
            <li>I discovered Body Shop&#x27;s Moisture Foundation SPF 15, which isn&#x27;t a BB cream but has the same lightweight coverage and up until now has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and gives you a natural glow.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The coverage is good, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like foundations can feel.</li>
            <li>Fast forward a month, and this cc cream is now all I need - all of the time.</li>
            <li>After using this for a while, my skin evened out and didn&#x27;t break out so much</li>
            <li>I am fortunate to have skin without any particular challenge, however since turning 40 my focus in recent years has been a dewy hydrated type of coverage.</li>
            <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange like some other products.</li>
            <li>and was really only hoping for a week day alternative to a full foundation look</li>
            <li>Great coverage and no weird small like other BB or CC creams.</li>
            <li>(too drying, too light), Garnier (too heavy, color mismatch), Almay True Match Anti-Aging (nice, but color is just slightly off), Physician&#x27;s Formula (color didn&#x27;t match), some Korean brands (too drying, colors didn&#x27;t match), some Japanese brands (colors didn&#x27;t match) and some others I don&#x27;t remember.  </li>
            <li>I normally would apply with a pricey pressed mineral powder.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be better than wearing a heavy foundation.  </li>
            <li>(I only sparingly spot treat shiny areas with powder and use a light concealer under the eyes - but that&#x27;s a personal preference - I could probably skip both.)  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Very happily surprised by this product!</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that the SPF could be higher, but then perhaps that might affect the texture.</li>
            <li>makes my skin so soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>I do get a natural dewy finish.</li>
            <li>I set it with Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana Powder (which I originally bought to correct pink tones often found in other foundations).  </li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin, which is usually sensitive to different things.</li>

            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t really like it a little bit to thick</li>
            <li> all at once and does not cause irritation as other make ups, creams, or sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> I have very pink undertones and have a hard time with creams that come off too orange or red with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Causes breakouts, no coverage not worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not full coverage, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for -</li>
            <li> but it could also be heavy if u wanted to layer it.</li>
            <li> I usually start with some smashbox primer, the Mary Kay concealer in Ivory 2, then finish with the CC Cream.</li>
            <li> blends well, not a perfect match</li>
            <li> Utterly shocked at my satisfaction with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love Mary Kay - so light on skin</li>
            <li> Good product in terms of coverage, but it seems to cause my skin to breakout a bit.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! LOVE IT!!! It is light wait, the coverage is amazing and I love that it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange like some other products. I also got the MK translucent powder to go with this which works amazing as well!!! Never gonna use anything else again!!!! I&#x27;m so so so glad I got this!!!</li>
            <li> Got here on time, great product-- all good.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. Coverage was very sheer and it did not cover or minimize any redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad product I actually like Mary Kay and lots of their  products i like that it has SPF 15 Good for winter but not enough for summer My skin doesn&#x27;t really like it a little bit to thick</li>
            <li> Mary Kay has quality products. This goes on the face very smooth and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I will order again. Love this product and the fact I can order it online. It arrived in a timely matter. I was very pleased</li>
            <li> great light coverage....can&#x27;t even tell you have it on.  evens out skin tone nicely without looking like you have make up on</li>
            <li> Utterly shocked at my satisfaction with this product. I had not used a Mary Kay product in 15 years.  I am fortunate to have skin without any particular challenge, however since turning 40 my focus in recent years has been a dewy hydrated type of coverage. Wow!  I tried this on a lark after reading so many positive reviews  (the price was right,  so why not?) and was really only hoping for a week day alternative to a full foundation look I normally would apply with a pricey pressed mineral powder.  Fast forward a month, and this cc cream is now all I need - all of the time. My pores are noticeably smaller (rather: UNnoticealbe) and by skin looks wonderful!  (I only sparingly spot treat shiny areas with powder and use a light concealer under the eyes - but that&#x27;s a personal preference - I could probably skip both.)  Added to the fact that my order arrived quickly,  I will be returning for more.  Very happily surprised by this product!</li>
            <li> i like this cream, really good</li>
            <li> My first purchase of this was from a Mary Kay Party.  I will definitely buy this again, but from another source since I&#x27;d rather not deal with a sales rep trying to get me to host a party or meet with her sales director or buy additional product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried many different BB/CC creams over the years.  L&#x27;oreal (too drying, too light), Garnier (too heavy, color mismatch), Almay True Match Anti-Aging (nice, but color is just slightly off), Physician&#x27;s Formula (color didn&#x27;t match), some Korean brands (too drying, colors didn&#x27;t match), some Japanese brands (colors didn&#x27;t match) and some others I don&#x27;t remember.  I discovered Body Shop&#x27;s Moisture Foundation SPF 15, which isn&#x27;t a BB cream but has the same lightweight coverage and up until now has been my favorite.  It&#x27;s a fairly close match for my skin, just a tad off.  Mary Kay is now my favorite, as the Light to Medium color is the best match for my skin - it&#x27;s got yellow undertones, which is perfect for Asian skin.  It goes on nice and light, and doesn&#x27;t settle into my lines or enhance my pores (like some of the other BB creams).  It&#x27;s not full coverage, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for - I want it to even out my skin tone, cover the redness around my nose, and &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; the freckles/age spots on my cheeks.  The Mary Kay CC cream does this nicely.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing foundation at all.  I used to use a beauty blender to apply foundation, but don&#x27;t bother with that anymore.  This applies nicely, evenly, and quickly using just my fingertips - no fuss or muss.  I set it with Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana Powder (which I originally bought to correct pink tones often found in other foundations).  My only criticism is that the SPF could be higher, but then perhaps that might affect the texture.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown! Perfect</li>
            <li> I used some my daughter has when she came to visit for Christmas. It is perfect and came so quickly. Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Great coverage and no weird small like other BB or CC creams. Super fast shipping.  Will definitely buy from this seller again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome makes my skin look soo good. It can be light but it could also be heavy if u wanted to layer it. makes my skin so soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> It is nice and light.  It seems to be better than wearing a heavy foundation.  At the same time it also has sun protection which is an added plus.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many CC creams  and I absolutely love this one</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only thing I wear anymore. It evens out my skin tone and it&#x27;s not heavy or oily. I love that is has sunscreen. I put it on in the morning and I&#x27;m out the door. It doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup. It just looks like I have great skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I use it in the summer as a foundation/spf. It goes on smooth and gives you a natural glow. I love it. I put it over the timewise moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using MK products for many years and they are truly good products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  The price is even better.  Now off to find mineral blush.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this CC Cream! I have very pink undertones and have a hard time with creams that come off too orange or red with my skin tone. This CC Cream covers nicely, while still feeling light all day. I usually start with some smashbox primer, the Mary Kay concealer in Ivory 2, then finish with the CC Cream. Adding a light translucent powder leads to the best looking skin I&#x27;ve ever had. I get lots of compliments, even if I just use the CC Cream, that my skin looks so fresh and smooth. I would definitely recommend this CC Cream. My favorite on the market.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...blends well, not a perfect match but I use a loose powder over it. I have acne prone skin, which is usually sensitive to different things. but I have not had any breakouts or reaction to this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear make up anymore. This is my make up. After using this for a while, my skin evened out and didn&#x27;t break out so much</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I use this cream as my daily makeup. I just love it. It is a great advantage that I can have makeup, sunscreen, anti-aging cream...all at once and does not cause irritation as other make ups, creams, or sunscreens do. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this cc cream! Arrived sooner than i thought..which was awesome..:)</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and light foundation~only wish there were more colors!</li>
            <li> Causes breakouts, no coverage not worth it</li>
            <li> Arrived  quickly. Great  product.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay products for years.  It works great!</li>
            <li> My favorite on the go concealer/foundation. It really makes you look fresh and gives just the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this. Light coverage without the cakey look of foundation!!</li>
            <li> My wife love this cc cream, l always buy for her!!</li>
            <li> Very nice coverage without feeling caked on.</li>
            <li> Perfect for lightweight coverage that still covers what you need and evens skin tone! It actually improved the look of my skin over time!</li>
            <li> I have tried cc creams two and three times the price of this and none come close. I have combo skin and this moisturizes in all the right places and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oils. I do get a natural dewy finish. Great coverage, perfect color, layers well with bronzer and highlighting powder.</li>
            <li> So far so good....nice to not have to use so many products, this is all in one.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Perfect product.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a foundation.  The coverage is good, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like foundations can feel.</li>
