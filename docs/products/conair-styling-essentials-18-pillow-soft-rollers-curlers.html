            <li>I use these to curl their hair and they work perfectly on the mohair.</li>
            <li>these are perfect.</li>
            <li>impressed with how well these do the job!</li>
            <li>I used them while my hair was still damp and slept in them for 5 hours and the curls came out perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent - ab,e</li>
            <li>My curls were as perfect on day 3 as they were on day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I am quite happy with these rollers!</li>
            <li>Best thing I have ever used on my toddlers hair!</li>
            <li>This is a good solution to have perfect hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Mom is happy with all the curls and so am I.</li>
            <li>Great Product</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>I think these are good for styling/ protecting your hair from heat.</li>
            <li>However, the stitching used to cover the wire you use to secure the rollers isn&#x27;t the greatest</li>
            <li>Surprisingly hold a lot of hair, given their size.  </li>
            <li>So very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>Love them !</li>
            <li>Maybe someone handling our baggage liked them better than we did!  </li>
            <li>Excellent service and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Or, to be fair, they all look lovely for about 15 minutes after I take them out, and then promptly fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product would and could be good if the seams were stitched better.</li>
            <li>had these kind of rollers some time ago and it worked for me.</li>
            <li>These work GREAT in my long fine hair!!!!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and produce beautiful curls and are easy to sleep in</li>
            <li>Work great and are comfortable :)</li>
            <li>Makes great curls for the hair and comfortable for sleep but please stitch the edges better.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and no issue when sleeping.</li>
            <li>I believe these are best for a freer look, not a tightly permed looking hairdo.  </li>
            <li>Really easy, quick and looks great in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shirley Temple curls -- which is fine if that is what you are going for!</li>
            <li>well and very very comfortable</li>
            <li>The rollers themselves are just ok.</li>
            <li>I like to be able to curl my hair without the damage of heat from curling irons.  </li>
            <li>and I think they would not work as well there unless I had a lot more of them.  </li>
            <li>being said, they produce wonderful curls are are simple to use.</li>
            <li>:) Mine have squished a bit from where I rolled my hair tighter, but it hasn&#x27;t affected the curling process.</li>
            <li>Of course you can add more for curls all over.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way easier and works better.</li>
            <li>so it is more wavy then curled</li>
            <li>Love them though.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>The thinner the sections you roll, the better the curls, and b/c</li>
            <li>love these things-  </li>
            <li>Tighter is better in this case, b/c you&#x27;ll want to be able to brush them after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure would be adorable,</li>
            <li>It will be looser, softer, and more  Mary Pickford than Shirley Temple.</li>

            <li>Great for fast easy curls.</li>
            <li>Needed new ones these currlers work great</li>
            <li>These work so fabulous I love using them every night at bed time and with a silk cap.</li>

            <li>Easy to roll up and then twist to hold.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, you just roll and twist.  </li>
            <li>Easy to store or take with you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are easy to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Easy to put in and sleep on -</li>
            <li>but my hair tears easily</li>
            <li>easy to roll.</li>
            <li>and these work fine with it.  </li>
            <li>and these work fine with it.  </li>
            <li>They work fine</li>
            <li>this praise said: this is  V E R Y cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anyone can wear these to bed comfortably.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m still on the search for curlers i can sleep in comfortably.</li>
            <li>They were comfortable to sleep on</li>
            <li>These are good quality soft rollers.  </li>
            <li>I assumed the high tag was b/c they were sold at a drug store, but online, they&#x27;re even more- $19 plus shipping?!</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold curls, but these actually worked very nicely.</li>
            <li>Although, make sure they&#x27;re secure or one might fall out in your sleep (happened to me the first night</li>
            <li>exactly what was advertised - i think the pricing could have been better</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine and thinning with age.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very fine, and normally straight.  </li>
            <li>These are really comfortable, you can sleep in them pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>She loved her original set, but could not find them after a trip we took last year.  </li>
            <li>When I removed the rollers this morning, I had genuine curls for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>I liked them, but as with all pillow soft rollers, after 3 uses the wires wanted to peek through the material.</li>
            <li>these puppies WILL give you super-bouncy, full, three day curls, that you can brush through without fear of them falling out  </li>
            <li>fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more money and get a decent product.</li>
            <li>Most women have finer hair around the face, and will curl much more than the heavier hair you have at the sides and back.  </li>
            <li>Most women have finer hair around the face, and will curl much more than the heavier hair you have at the sides and back.  </li>
            <li>I know a lot of rollers say that, but honestly, thee are the only one i&#x27;ve found this to be true with.  </li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re so soft that they&#x27;re very comfortable to sleep</li>
            <li>these are my favorite curlers so far.</li>
            <li>This by far irks me the most-</li>
            <li>These are a step in the right direction for me.</li>
            <li>The fell out right away and as soon as you use them they change shape and stay that way.</li>
            <li>but they do require some time investment to get them right-</li>
            <li>Super soft and comfortable-</li>
            <li>These are amazing for putting on dry hair before heading to bed to have heatless, voluminous curls in the morning.</li>
            <li>The curlers are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>so if you want soft, strong curls you can run your hands through, these are the ones you want-</li>
            <li>so if you want soft, strong curls you can run your hands through, these are the ones you want-</li>
            <li>So easy and soft to sleep in,</li>
            <li>These curlers work really well if you like a curly look and they really do stay in well and are comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, more comfortable than hard rollers.  </li>
            <li>Also, you will need to straighten them out, put them back into shape, make sure the wire ends are tucked in close so they don&#x27;t poke out of the fabric.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t hurt and are not uncomfortable while sleeping.</li>
            <li>Overall the result in the morning is still workable and these will be what i use until i find something better...</li>
            <li>I wish there was the same type of item but better quality out there....</li>
            <li>I have tried every type of curler out there: curling irons, hot rollers, steam rollers, bendy-rollers that heat up, bendy rollers that don&#x27;t heat up, stick-shaped bendy rollers, foam curlers, velcro curlers</li>
            <li>This means, they&#x27;re pretty flimsy-  </li>
            <li>I bought my first pack of 18 from a Walgreens, and paid $13.00-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that curling irons will cause the curl to drop-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that curling irons will cause the curl to drop-</li>
            <li>so I was able to only buy one package.</li>
            <li>She loves them because they are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>You can also wind your hair more tightly or more loosely for tighter or looser curls, respectively.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, straight, very fine hair that refuses to hold a curl</li>
            <li>I have really long and think hair had to use all of them wish i could find some that holds more hair</li>
            <li>This also takes up more valuable space if you have long</li>
            <li>By staggering them (rolling higher in back than you do in front), you will get a more uniform, natural</li>
            <li>By staggering them (rolling higher in back than you do in front), you will get a more uniform, natural</li>
            <li>The stiching is very flimsy, and the wire is poking out the ends of 3-4 of the rollers.</li>
            <li>They worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
            <li>I end up having to brush my curls out because they are a bit too intense.</li>
            <li>The wires are already poking through, and the stitching is cheap and threads were hanging off the items and have pulled the seams open.  </li>
            <li>felt they were very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really worried, you might want to ask the seller the measurements to see if they match up-</li>
            <li>felt they were very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really worried, you might want to ask the seller the measurements to see if they match up-</li>
            <li>so it holds very well</li>
            <li>dont really work or stay in the hair.</li>
            <li>I gotta say I had VERY curly hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>Wow, these really work!</li>
            <li>so if you notice one or two ends that didn&#x27;t set right and want to curl them, only do the very end, or the whole section will lose it&#x27;s shape.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I now have a couple sets, I use more, but if your hair is shoulder length to mid back, 18 will work</li>
            <li>These are so super cheap, small and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about them is that they&#x27;re little foam pillows</li>
            <li>I have thick long hair and the curlers worked great with my hair.</li>
            <li>* When done right, the curls will last you a minimum of 3 days.  </li>
            <li>but these new ones did not please me.</li>
            <li>Gave nice curls but the wires ripped through the fabric after only a few uses and damages hair</li>
            <li>Particularly given the fact that they need frequent replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, ABOUT THAT 6-8 HOUR TURN AROUND TIME:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>or, in the event you order them, and they&#x27;re much smaller than these ones, you at least have good reason to ask for them to exchange or refund you for them.  </li>

            <li>If your curlers are ripping open the cheap-o fabric after just a couple wears, then consider making sure you are tucking in the sharp wire</li>
            <li>MUCH better then other regular rollers you sleep in.</li>
            <li>Roll them as you want, but small sections will give you the most body, and the tightest curls-</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comprised of a square piece of foam, a wire that runs through the middle of it and sticks out each side, for twisting closed, and the whole thing is covered in very soft cotton (like t-shirt material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a trick to using them, and they are not without their flaws, but they really do work when used right, and I heartily recommend them to anyone out there who has hair similar to mine and wants</li>
            <li>but I like the soft look without the hair products.</li>
            <li>A couple of hours later they are ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I had some of the soft rollers/curlers before and they were worn out.</li>
            <li>I actually have very think medium length hair</li>
            <li>They stay in pretty well, with only 1 or 2 coming loose the whole time they wore them.  </li>
            <li>Well... I had some almost exactly like these for a few years and between them wearing out a little and my daughter now wanting to use them at the same time as me, I decided to get more.  </li>
            <li>Except it doesn&#x27;t dry straight-</li>
            <li>These work pretty well if you leave them in long enough, such as overnight.  </li>
            <li>Conair Pillow Soft Roller are essentially an updated rag roller.</li>
            <li>Use them to sleep in and although the curls are a little tight in the morning, they are comfortable and serve my purpose.</li>
            <li>Product is decent and does what it says, the quality of material is a bit light - the wires that allow it to be twisted poke/break through very easily (not a positive feature when the person using these is a 5 year old...)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to curl my long long and  thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It was one little skinny straight wire that looked like it would break after a couple of uses.</li>

            <li> These are good quality soft rollers.  </li>
            <li> I assumed the high tag was b/c they were sold at a drug store, but online, they&#x27;re even more- $19 plus shipping?!</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold curls, but these actually worked very nicely.</li>
            <li> Although, make sure they&#x27;re secure or one might fall out in your sleep (happened to me the first night</li>
            <li> exactly what was advertised - i think the pricing could have been better</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine and thinning with age.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very fine, and normally straight.  </li>
            <li> These are really comfortable, you can sleep in them pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> She loved her original set, but could not find them after a trip we took last year.  </li>
            <li> When I removed the rollers this morning, I had genuine curls for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> I liked them, but as with all pillow soft rollers, after 3 uses the wires wanted to peek through the material.</li>
            <li> these puppies WILL give you super-bouncy, full, three day curls, that you can brush through without fear of them falling out  </li>
            <li> fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay more money and get a decent product.</li>
            <li> Most women have finer hair around the face, and will curl much more than the heavier hair you have at the sides and back.  </li>
            <li> Most women have finer hair around the face, and will curl much more than the heavier hair you have at the sides and back.  </li>
            <li> I know a lot of rollers say that, but honestly, thee are the only one i&#x27;ve found this to be true with.  </li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re so soft that they&#x27;re very comfortable to sleep</li>
            <li> these are my favorite curlers so far.</li>
            <li> This by far irks me the most-</li>
            <li> These are a step in the right direction for me.</li>
            <li> The fell out right away and as soon as you use them they change shape and stay that way.</li>
            <li> but they do require some time investment to get them right-</li>
            <li> Super soft and comfortable-</li>
            <li> These are amazing for putting on dry hair before heading to bed to have heatless, voluminous curls in the morning.</li>
            <li> The curlers are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> so if you want soft, strong curls you can run your hands through, these are the ones you want-</li>
            <li> so if you want soft, strong curls you can run your hands through, these are the ones you want-</li>
            <li> So easy and soft to sleep in,</li>
            <li> These curlers work really well if you like a curly look and they really do stay in well and are comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, more comfortable than hard rollers.  </li>
            <li> Also, you will need to straighten them out, put them back into shape, make sure the wire ends are tucked in close so they don&#x27;t poke out of the fabric.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t hurt and are not uncomfortable while sleeping.</li>
            <li> Overall the result in the morning is still workable and these will be what i use until i find something better...</li>
            <li> I wish there was the same type of item but better quality out there....</li>
            <li> I have tried every type of curler out there: curling irons, hot rollers, steam rollers, bendy-rollers that heat up, bendy rollers that don&#x27;t heat up, stick-shaped bendy rollers, foam curlers, velcro curlers</li>
            <li> This means, they&#x27;re pretty flimsy-  </li>
            <li> I bought my first pack of 18 from a Walgreens, and paid $13.00-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that curling irons will cause the curl to drop-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that curling irons will cause the curl to drop-</li>
            <li> so I was able to only buy one package.</li>
            <li> She loves them because they are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> You can also wind your hair more tightly or more loosely for tighter or looser curls, respectively.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, straight, very fine hair that refuses to hold a curl</li>
            <li> I have really long and think hair had to use all of them wish i could find some that holds more hair</li>
            <li> This also takes up more valuable space if you have long</li>
            <li> By staggering them (rolling higher in back than you do in front), you will get a more uniform, natural</li>
            <li> By staggering them (rolling higher in back than you do in front), you will get a more uniform, natural</li>
            <li> The stiching is very flimsy, and the wire is poking out the ends of 3-4 of the rollers.</li>
            <li> They worked really well.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
            <li> I end up having to brush my curls out because they are a bit too intense.</li>
            <li> The wires are already poking through, and the stitching is cheap and threads were hanging off the items and have pulled the seams open.  </li>
            <li> felt they were very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really worried, you might want to ask the seller the measurements to see if they match up-</li>
            <li> felt they were very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really worried, you might want to ask the seller the measurements to see if they match up-</li>
            <li> so it holds very well</li>
            <li> dont really work or stay in the hair.</li>
            <li> I gotta say I had VERY curly hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> Wow, these really work!</li>
            <li> so if you notice one or two ends that didn&#x27;t set right and want to curl them, only do the very end, or the whole section will lose it&#x27;s shape.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I now have a couple sets, I use more, but if your hair is shoulder length to mid back, 18 will work</li>
            <li> These are so super cheap, small and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about them is that they&#x27;re little foam pillows</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and the curlers worked great with my hair.</li>
            <li> * When done right, the curls will last you a minimum of 3 days.  </li>
            <li> but these new ones did not please me.</li>
            <li> Gave nice curls but the wires ripped through the fabric after only a few uses and damages hair</li>
            <li> Particularly given the fact that they need frequent replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, ABOUT THAT 6-8 HOUR TURN AROUND TIME:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> or, in the event you order them, and they&#x27;re much smaller than these ones, you at least have good reason to ask for them to exchange or refund you for them.  </li>
            <li> or, in the event you order them, and they&#x27;re much smaller than these ones, you at least have good reason to ask for them to exchange or refund you for them.  </li>
            <li> If your curlers are ripping open the cheap-o fabric after just a couple wears, then consider making sure you are tucking in the sharp wire</li>
            <li> MUCH better then other regular rollers you sleep in.</li>
            <li> Roll them as you want, but small sections will give you the most body, and the tightest curls-</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re comprised of a square piece of foam, a wire that runs through the middle of it and sticks out each side, for twisting closed, and the whole thing is covered in very soft cotton (like t-shirt material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a trick to using them, and they are not without their flaws, but they really do work when used right, and I heartily recommend them to anyone out there who has hair similar to mine and wants</li>
            <li> but I like the soft look without the hair products.</li>
            <li> A couple of hours later they are ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I had some of the soft rollers/curlers before and they were worn out.</li>
            <li> I actually have very think medium length hair</li>
            <li> They stay in pretty well, with only 1 or 2 coming loose the whole time they wore them.  </li>
            <li> Well... I had some almost exactly like these for a few years and between them wearing out a little and my daughter now wanting to use them at the same time as me, I decided to get more.  </li>
            <li> Except it doesn&#x27;t dry straight-</li>
            <li> These work pretty well if you leave them in long enough, such as overnight.  </li>
            <li> Conair Pillow Soft Roller are essentially an updated rag roller.</li>
            <li> Use them to sleep in and although the curls are a little tight in the morning, they are comfortable and serve my purpose.</li>
            <li> Product is decent and does what it says, the quality of material is a bit light - the wires that allow it to be twisted poke/break through very easily (not a positive feature when the person using these is a 5 year old...)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to curl my long long and  thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It was one little skinny straight wire that looked like it would break after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Anything past mid back will take up too much space to give you enough room leftover to tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long hair in general is always harder to curl, because the sheer weight of it is counter-productive to bouncy, light-weight curls, but I have finally found the solution-</li>
            <li> The cotton covering the whole thing is soft like a men&#x27;s white tee-shirt, but it&#x27;s thin, and the wire tends to poke through it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick and frizzy</li>
            <li> : You can drag out replacing them by simply tying the two ends of the cloth shut, but they&#x27;re a pain to get out, and I only can do this with the shorter layers of my hair.</li>
            <li> If they still seem really tight, it&#x27;s alright, they do loosen a little in the first hour or so.  </li>
            <li> If they still seem really tight, it&#x27;s alright, they do loosen a little in the first hour or so.  </li>
            <li> sponge inside soo small not like older ones that went all the way to the ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted, but Conair quality is not good.  </li>
            <li> Once you take them out you can (at least in my case) run your fingers through your hair and control how much curl you have.  </li>
            <li> I remember when I was a kid and the only choice were those pink.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning these because they were much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The foam part of it, is about 1-1/2 inches long, &amp; not even 1/2 in.</li>
            <li> again, you&#x27;ve got a square piece of foam with a long wire through it-</li>
            <li> No soft curls here, ended up with an afro</li>
            <li> I finally tracked these down on the Amazon site and bought them instantly.  </li>
            <li> (this has been my other big issue:  </li>
            <li> Parts of my hair is very long</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very long</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and let it air dry so that it was 99% dry, then I put these in before bed.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair in the am and then roll my hair up in these babies.  </li>
            <li> Wash and condition your hair, and let it air dry almost to</li>
            <li> dry-</li>
            <li> So almost dry, but not quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too wet, the hair won&#x27;t dry at the ends, but if it&#x27;s too dry, the hair won&#x27;t dry into the shape you need.</li>
            <li> tip to tip, these are 7\\&quot; long, and at the foam, about 1/2\\&quot; wide.  </li>
            <li> tip to tip, these are 7\\&quot; long, and at the foam, about 1/2\\&quot; wide.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, wrap &#x27;em loose and not up to the scalp.</li>
            <li> unless you have very long hair (past mid back), you don&#x27;t want to roll all the way to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve only relaxed slightly.</li>
            <li> and I only needed to use half the pack for curls.</li>
            <li> either the curls didn&#x27;t take, or they fell out within half an hour, or when I brushed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll roll the back sections, where my hair is thickest and longest, almost to the scalp, but i&#x27;ll roll the finer, face-framer layers of my hair to about the chin or slightly lower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt they were small, but I do know there is one listing, with dozens of sellers, and it is possible that different sizes are being sold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt they were small, but I do know there is one listing, with dozens of sellers, and it is possible that different sizes are being sold.  </li>
            <li> I think way WAY back people used little pieces of cloth (hence \\&quot;rags\\&quot;) for this.  </li>
            <li> I could even sleep with them in my hair, BUT I have a memory foam pillow, which is a bit hard, so I would recommend a really SOFT pillow if you keep them in your hair over night.</li>
            <li> my hair is long enough to sit on, and I can usually do it all with 20-25 rollers.  </li>
            <li> They are not very durable either.</li>
            <li> so a few of mine I have to tuck back in before twisting.</li>
            <li> I expected a v shaped wire since the ends were that way.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> closed-</li>
            <li> My hair is only shoulder length and the curls were very tight after sleeping in these.</li>
            <li> When you take them out, don&#x27;t unwrap the curl- slide the rollers down, and let the hair spiral loose.</li>
            <li> When you take them out, don&#x27;t unwrap the curl- slide the rollers down, and let the hair spiral loose.</li>
            <li> I will keep them since there aren&#x27;t any other choices out there</li>
            <li> These rollers are not at all what I expected!  </li>
            <li> But any other type of curl just brushes</li>
            <li> Of course having these on while sleeping isn&#x27;t as comfortable as not has them, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I do have somewhat thick hair, but its short.</li>
            <li> The idea is good, the design is terrible.</li>
            <li> I knew that my kids would throw a temper tantrum and want them out as soon as they put their head down.</li>
            <li> the weight of it pulls the curls down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I have very, very long hair- past the waist-</li>

            <li> You can roll your hair tight, or loose -- with a lot of hair or with small segments.</li>
            <li> Plus, I wash my hair at night and then sleep on it damp, so that when I wake up my hair is a mess.  </li>
            <li> There are 18 in this set, so unless you have a lot of thick long hair, this should be enough!&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if you wrap them tight, from the end up to your scalp, you are going to have tight,</li>

            <li> but once your hair has fully dried, don&#x27;t bother, it won&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> You now have curls that would make Shirley Temple green with envy.</li>
            <li> You now have curls that would make Shirley Temple green with envy.</li>
            <li> These are stupidly small and tight.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed because the wires are so thin and flimsy they barely hold the curler in and seem like they will wear out and break very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very tight curls.</li>
            <li> I feel like a little girl when I use these overnight, but boy, do they work!</li>
            <li> No more curling irons for me.</li>
            <li> I do small strands on damp hair with gel, pomade or mousse</li>
            <li> You can also try using a larger barreled brush or base to coil the section around after brushing it, to get bigger, softer curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;Admittedly, I have the hard to curl type of hair-</li>
            <li> I try to circumvent this from happening by twisting the wire ends into a curve before I use them, but it&#x27;s hard to to because they&#x27;re covered.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love them ! I could even sleep with them in my hair, BUT I have a memory foam pillow, which is a bit hard, so I would recommend a really SOFT pillow if you keep them in your hair over night.</li>
            <li> I make and sell dolls. I use these to curl their hair and they work perfectly on the mohair.</li>
            <li> exactly what was advertised - i think the pricing could have been better</li>
            <li> I like these -- simple idea, works well, curl lasts at least 2 days. Easy to roll up and then twist to hold. You can roll your hair tight, or loose -- with a lot of hair or with small segments. There are 18 in this set, so unless you have a lot of thick long hair, this should be enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t tell they were in my hair when I wore them to bed. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with them coming out during the night. You do have to make sure the wire twisted well.  Also, you will need to straighten them out, put them back into shape, make sure the wire ends are tucked in close so they don&#x27;t poke out of the fabric. If your curlers are ripping open the cheap-o fabric after just a couple wears, then consider making sure you are tucking in the sharp wire ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you wrap them tight, from the end up to your scalp, you are going to have tight, Shirley Temple curls -- which is fine if that is what you are going for! Otherwise, wrap &#x27;em loose and not up to the scalp. You&#x27;ll look like you have little snow balls on your head with your hair wrapped!!  Sometimes I put my hair in a pony tail and just wrap pieces of the pony in the curlers. Really easy, quick and looks great in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get these at your local CVS for about $10 in NY. I never noticed them before -- they are rather under-advertised. I think these are good for styling/ protecting your hair from heat. I bought a  second package to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this praise said: this is  V E R Y cheaply made. It&#x27;s just a piece of foam with a wire through it, and covered in the cheapest white material ever made. Seriously... I do not want to think about the sweat shop conditions this product was made.</li>
            <li> Work great and are comfortable :)</li>
            <li> i was looking for something i could curl my hair and sleep in. these are perfect. and the curl lasted for days.</li>
            <li> Wow, these really work! I have very long, straight, very fine hair that refuses to hold a curl (I couldn&#x27;t even have perms back in the day.) Figured there was no harm in trying these. I washed my hair and let it air dry so that it was 99% dry, then I put these in before bed. I spritzed a bit of blowout spray on each section of hair before I rolled it up. When I removed the rollers this morning, I had genuine curls for the first time in my life! It&#x27;s been 2 hours and they&#x27;ve only relaxed slightly. I&#x27;m truly amazed. See photos below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they&#x27;re so soft that they&#x27;re very comfortable to sleep in-- no problems there whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m taking off a star is because several of the rollers were defective. The stiching is very flimsy, and the wire is poking out the ends of 3-4 of the rollers. One of them is discolored, with a brown substance covering half the roller. So those 5 got discarded. Luckily, I only need 12 to cover my entire head bc I like the bigger, looser curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with how well these do the job! No more curling irons for me.</li>
            <li> worked well. You have to work with it alittle</li>
            <li> I got these for my 2 daughters (8 &amp;10) so they could go to sleep and wake up with curls.  I remember when I was a kid and the only choice were those pink. hard plastic rollers that broke your head when you slept on them.  I knew that my kids would throw a temper tantrum and want them out as soon as they put their head down. So, I got these.  They worked really well.  They are easy to use, you just roll and twist.  They stay in pretty well, with only 1 or 2 coming loose the whole time they wore them.  The girls were a little uncomfortable in the beginning, but they didn&#x27;t mind sleeping in them after a few minutes.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to curl my long long and  thick hair.  I didn&#x27;t have to use all e curlers in one packet. I use it on damp hair and then wear a mesh cap to keep the curls intact. Otherwise the curlers do fall out in the middle of night. Using damp hair curls, the curls don&#x27;t stay all day.</li>
            <li> The rollers themselves are just ok. I couple of the wires came out. I followed the directions and when I took them out, I looked like Shirley Temple!</li>
            <li> The foam that covers the wire is very thin. I could feel the wires against my head while lying on my pillow, &amp; could not sleep in these things. They are not very durable either. I only attempted to use these twice, &amp; they already have threads unraveling at the seams.</li>
            <li> Well... I had some almost exactly like these for a few years and between them wearing out a little and my daughter now wanting to use them at the same time as me, I decided to get more.  These were the only ones I could find ANYWHERE so I bought them.  I will keep them since there aren&#x27;t any other choices out there but I was very disappointed because the wires are so thin and flimsy they barely hold the curler in and seem like they will wear out and break very quickly.  Maybe I will find some thicker wire and redo them myself someday??</li>
            <li> I have used the cloth (rag-type) curlers on my Mom&#x27;s hair. She is invalid and can no longer shower to cleanse her hair. Her hair is about 2 inches or shorter. I use a shower shampoo cap to cleanse her hair and while the hair is damp I apply the curlers. The curlers are soft and easy to use. We let the curlers stay in overnight.  Then we finger out the curls in the morning.  I bought 2 packages and used about 1 1/2 of the package to curl the hair. Mom is happy with all the curls and so am I.</li>
            <li> Items were as described. I have thick long hair and the curlers worked great with my hair. I used them while my hair was still damp and slept in them for 5 hours and the curls came out perfect. You could also use hair styling products to keep the hold on the curls but I like the soft look without the hair products.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well if you leave them in long enough, such as overnight.  I like to be able to curl my hair without the damage of heat from curling irons.  Plus, I wash my hair at night and then sleep on it damp, so that when I wake up my hair is a mess.  I avoid blow dryers as much as possible. This is a good solution to have perfect hair in the morning.  Of course having these on while sleeping isn&#x27;t as comfortable as not has them, but it&#x27;s not too bad. Definitely possible to sleep well still.</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine and thinning with age.  I blow dry my hair in the am and then roll my hair up in these babies.  A couple of hours later they are ready to go.  I then comb it back into clip for my &amp;#34;party in the back look&amp;#34;  Voila!</li>
            <li> I like these for the shorter lengths of my hair. Parts of my hair is very long and I think they would not work as well there unless I had a lot more of them.  1/2015 update.  The wires have started to poke thru.  So have dropped my rating.</li>
            <li> Excellent - ab,e to sleep with these in.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold curls, but these actually worked very nicely. these are my favorite curlers so far. My favorite thing about them is that they&#x27;re little foam pillows so they don&#x27;t hurt and are not uncomfortable while sleeping. However, the stitching used to cover the wire you use to secure the rollers isn&#x27;t the greatest so a few of mine I have to tuck back in before twisting. I used a bandanna to cover the curlers while I slept just to avoid any tangling or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, they produce wonderful curls are are simple to use. :) Mine have squished a bit from where I rolled my hair tighter, but it hasn&#x27;t affected the curling process. I would definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking to buy a wetset.  I did have to buy two to cover all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely had curl the next morning, but it didn&#x27;t stay but an hour or 2.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning these because they were much smaller than I expected and I could not roll my hair with these.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and produce beautiful curls and are easy to sleep in</li>
            <li> not what i thought it was</li>
            <li> fall apart quickly. Don&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
            <li> I liked them, but as with all pillow soft rollers, after 3 uses the wires wanted to peek through the material.</li>
            <li> perfecct stay tight....set a curl well and very very comfortable</li>
            <li> These are amazing for putting on dry hair before heading to bed to have heatless, voluminous curls in the morning. Although, make sure they&#x27;re secure or one might fall out in your sleep (happened to me the first night bc I move a lot in my sleep).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thickness hair and medium length hair ( little longer than my collarbone) and I only needed to use half the pack for curls. Of course you can add more for curls all over. I just curled the ends and around my face.  Comfortable to sleep in - you will hardly notice they&#x27;re in your hair. MUCH better then other regular rollers you sleep in.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, more comfortable than hard rollers.  Easy to store or take with you. Great for fast easy curls.</li>
            <li> These are stupidly small and tight. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone can wear these to bed comfortably. I do have somewhat thick hair, but its short. There is no way I could use these. They had to be returned. And the worst part is that the arrived with hair on them. Ew.</li>
            <li> These rollers are not at all what I expected!  The foam part of it, is about 1-1/2 inches long, &amp; not even 1/2 in. thick. I expected a v shaped wire since the ends were that way. It was one little skinny straight wire that looked like it would break after a couple of uses. They&#x27;re going back, and my confidence in Conair products has taken a hit. I&#x27;d rather pay more money and get a decent product.</li>
            <li> These are very small square shaped foam wrapped in cloth.  The idea is good, the design is terrible.</li>
            <li> So very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> I feel like a little girl when I use these overnight, but boy, do they work!</li>
            <li> These are so super cheap, small and flimsy.  Don&#x27;t even bother.  Check out how to curl your hair with socks on Youtube it&#x27;s way easier and works better.</li>
            <li> Very tight curls. My hair is only shoulder length and the curls were very tight after sleeping in these. I used two of them in chunky pieces of half way dried hair. It works well if you brush it out after, the curls do last about three days, for reference I have pretty thick and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to sleep in.</li>
            <li> work well and get the job done....I have really long and think hair had to use all of them wish i could find some that holds more hair so it is more wavy then curled</li>
            <li> These rollers work almost too well. I end up having to brush my curls out because they are a bit too intense. Love them though.</li>
            <li> Use them to sleep in and although the curls are a little tight in the morning, they are comfortable and serve my purpose.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m still on the search for curlers i can sleep in comfortably. These are a step in the right direction for me. Easy to put in and sleep on - but when i woke up i had lost several in the night. Overall the result in the morning is still workable and these will be what i use until i find something better...</li>
            <li> Excellent service and fast delivery. Not what I expected.Very tiny in width and too flimsy. Wire has gone through cloth on all but three after using twice.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and no issue when sleeping. Great Product</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted, but Conair quality is not good.  The wires are already poking through, and the stitching is cheap and threads were hanging off the items and have pulled the seams open.  These are almost deposable after a few uses, which is just too expensive to do.  I wish there was the same type of item but better quality out there....</li>
            <li> These work GREAT in my long fine hair!!!!</li>
            <li> These work so fabulous I love using them every night at bed time and with a silk cap.</li>
            <li> I had some of the soft rollers/curlers before and they were worn out. Needed new ones these currlers work great</li>
            <li> Product is decent and does what it says, the quality of material is a bit light - the wires that allow it to be twisted poke/break through very easily (not a positive feature when the person using these is a 5 year old...)</li>
            <li> Stupid curlers. The fell out right away and as soon as you use them they change shape and stay that way.</li>
            <li> You can totally put these in your hair at night and u won&#x27;t even feel them while your sleeping. I love them.</li>
            <li> Gave nice curls but the wires ripped through the fabric after only a few uses and damages hair</li>
            <li> Way back, these were called \\&quot;rag\\&quot; curlers.  I think way WAY back people used little pieces of cloth (hence \\&quot;rags\\&quot;) for this.  These are really comfortable, you can sleep in them pretty easily.  Once you take them out you can (at least in my case) run your fingers through your hair and control how much curl you have.  You can also wind your hair more tightly or more loosely for tighter or looser curls, respectively.  I believe these are best for a freer look, not a tightly permed looking hairdo.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried every type of curler out there: curling irons, hot rollers, steam rollers, bendy-rollers that heat up, bendy rollers that don&#x27;t heat up, stick-shaped bendy rollers, foam curlers, velcro curlers...  You get the idea.  They all fail.  Or, to be fair, they all look lovely for about 15 minutes after I take them out, and then promptly fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I have the hard to curl type of hair- it&#x27;s very long (I can sit on it), it&#x27;s very fine, and normally straight.  Except it doesn&#x27;t dry straight- it dries wavy, but the minute I brush it, it just looks frizzy.  Long hair in general is always harder to curl, because the sheer weight of it is counter-productive to bouncy, light-weight curls, but I have finally found the solution- these puppies WILL give you super-bouncy, full, three day curls, that you can brush through without fear of them falling out  (this has been my other big issue:  I don&#x27;t like hair that I can&#x27;t run my hands through or touch- I prefer the way curls look after they&#x27;ve been brushed, and spring back. But any other type of curl just brushes out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Pillow Soft Roller are essentially an updated rag roller. They&#x27;re comprised of a square piece of foam, a wire that runs through the middle of it and sticks out each side, for twisting closed, and the whole thing is covered in very soft cotton (like t-shirt material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a trick to using them, and they are not without their flaws, but they really do work when used right, and I heartily recommend them to anyone out there who has hair similar to mine and wants curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the Pro&#x27;s and Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Super soft and comfortable- I don&#x27;t even notice them sleeping.  I know a lot of rollers say that, but honestly, thee are the only one i&#x27;ve found this to be true with.  Also, b/c there is no \\&quot;clasp\\&quot; per say- again, they twist closed- there&#x27;s no kink from the clasp you get with foam rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Surprisingly hold a lot of hair, given their size.  Again- my hair is long enough to sit on, and I can usually do it all with 20-25 rollers.  The thinner the sections you roll, the better the curls, and b/c I now have a couple sets, I use more, but if your hair is shoulder length to mid back, 18 will work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Creates super-strong, super-bouncy curls, that can be brushed through, and which then bounce back into place into even prettier, softer, spiral-type curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When done right, the curls will last you a minimum of 3 days.  Maybe longer: I wash my hair every day, but earlier this winter our pipes froze and then burst, and we were without water for three days.  My curls were as perfect on day 3 as they were on day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* TIME CONSUMING:  The process of rolling them only takes about 15 minutes, and you don&#x27;t even need to look at a mirror to see what you&#x27;re doing- BUT.... They require a minimum of 6-8 hours for the type of curls I&#x27;m waxing poetic about (more about that in a minute)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* QUALITY: The wire that goes through the foam is similar in size and purpose to that of a twist-tie for a produce bag at the grocery store. This means, they&#x27;re pretty flimsy-  again, you&#x27;ve got a square piece of foam with a long wire through it- and after about three months of daily use, the end of the wire that stick out on each end of the foam, which are used to twist the curler shut- will break off, leaving you with a piece of foam and a wire inside it, but not enough on the ends to twist the curler shut.&lt;br /&gt;FYI: You can drag out replacing them by simply tying the two ends of the cloth shut, but they&#x27;re a pain to get out, and I only can do this with the shorter layers of my hair. Anything past mid back will take up too much space to give you enough room leftover to tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* QUALITY (again): The cotton covering the whole thing is soft like a men&#x27;s white tee-shirt, but it&#x27;s thin, and the wire tends to poke through it. I try to circumvent this from happening by twisting the wire ends into a curve before I use them, but it&#x27;s hard to to because they&#x27;re covered.  This also takes up more valuable space if you have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* PRICE: This by far irks me the most- I bought my first pack of 18 from a Walgreens, and paid $13.00- I assumed the high tag was b/c they were sold at a drug store, but online, they&#x27;re even more- $19 plus shipping?! For foam, twist-tie and tshirt?! Meh. That&#x27;s a bit of a stretch Conair. Particularly given the fact that they need frequent replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, ABOUT THAT 6-8 HOUR TURN AROUND TIME:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these things-  but they do require some time investment to get them right- so here&#x27;s how to get three day curls.  Any time I have deviated from this pattern, they haven&#x27;t worked- either the curls didn&#x27;t take, or they fell out within half an hour, or when I brushed them- but I promise, if you follow these steps, they will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash and condition your hair, and let it air dry almost to dry- but once your hair has fully dried, don&#x27;t bother, it won&#x27;t work well. If it&#x27;s too wet, the hair won&#x27;t dry at the ends, but if it&#x27;s too dry, the hair won&#x27;t dry into the shape you need. So almost dry, but not quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Roll them as you want, but small sections will give you the most body, and the tightest curls- they loosen though, so don&#x27;t worry about looking like Shirley Temple. Tighter is better in this case, b/c you&#x27;ll want to be able to brush them after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also- unless you have very long hair (past mid back), you don&#x27;t want to roll all the way to the scalp.  Shorter hair, rolled to the scalp, will give you an afro.  Which I&#x27;m sure would be adorable, if that&#x27;s the look you want- but if not, then I suggest rolling them somewhere between chin and shoulders.  Longer hair can be rolled closer to the scalp b/c the weight of it pulls the curls down.  Also, try staggering them a bit- I&#x27;ll roll the back sections, where my hair is thickest and longest, almost to the scalp, but i&#x27;ll roll the finer, face-framer layers of my hair to about the chin or slightly lower.  Most women have finer hair around the face, and will curl much more than the heavier hair you have at the sides and back.  By staggering them (rolling higher in back than you do in front), you will get a more uniform, natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:&lt;br /&gt;You MUST leave them in for at least 6 hours- preferably longer. I know, that&#x27;s insane if you have a life, but I just put them in before bed, and they&#x27;re ready to take out in morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. When you take them out, don&#x27;t unwrap the curl- slide the rollers down, and let the hair spiral loose. You now have curls that would make Shirley Temple green with envy. Don&#x27;t panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. WAIT at least 30-40 minutes to brush them out.  The longer you wait, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Use a brush to brush through each curl/section, individually, once- and then, using either two fingers, or the handle of your brush, wrap the section around it like a curling iron, and let the hair slide out again. It will be looser, softer, and more  Mary Pickford than Shirley Temple. If they still seem really tight, it&#x27;s alright, they do loosen a little in the first hour or so.  You can also try using a larger barreled brush or base to coil the section around after brushing it, to get bigger, softer curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. No hairspray needed, no mousse, no gel. No setting lotion.  Easy-peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that curling irons will cause the curl to drop- so if you notice one or two ends that didn&#x27;t set right and want to curl them, only do the very end, or the whole section will lose it&#x27;s shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else has ever done the job the way these do- so if you want soft, strong curls you can run your hands through, these are the ones you want- just remember to give yourself the time needed to make them set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt; Recently, I was asked about the size of these rollers- a couple people who bought them on amazon felt they were very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I have very, very long hair- past the waist- and these work fine with it.  I&#x27;ve never felt they were small, but I do know there is one listing, with dozens of sellers, and it is possible that different sizes are being sold.  So I took the measurements of one of mine, and then took a picture of one, next to a dime. If you&#x27;re really worried, you might want to ask the seller the measurements to see if they match up- or, in the event you order them, and they&#x27;re much smaller than these ones, you at least have good reason to ask for them to exchange or refund you for them.  So, here&#x27;s the measurements, and a link to the photo- I hope that helps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From tip to tip, these are 7\\&quot; long, and at the foam, about 1/2\\&quot; wide.  The piece of foam itself is only about 2\\&quot; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://i1372.photobucket.com/albums/ag353/WhereTheWolvesKnow/Ebay%20Fox%20and%20Fawn%20Listings/2FinAleWispy_zpsc3038a9f.jpgand longest, almost to the scalp, but i&#x27;ll roll the finer, face-framer layers of my hair to about the chin or slightly lower.

            <li> The wire inserts can pop through. I ran them all in the sewing machine to give it a tighter closure. Works great</li>
            <li> They work fine but my hair tears easily, I have used them for years. They can be slept in all night.</li>
            <li> Or so my wife says!  She loved her original set, but could not find them after a trip we took last year.  Maybe someone handling our baggage liked them better than we did!  I finally tracked these down on the Amazon site and bought them instantly.  She has been using them ever since and loves them.</li>
            <li> No soft curls here, ended up with an afro lol!  Guess I need longer hair, so I will just stick with my curling iron!</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with these rollers! So easy and soft to sleep in, easy to roll. I actually have very think medium length hair so I bought 2 packs and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does not get caught in them. I do small strands on damp hair with gel, pomade or mousse so it holds very well so they are springy when they are unrolled.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product.  They smell and are over priced.  I still have 1 pack unopened that I&#x27;d like to return.</li>
            <li> These worked like a charm!  Lots and lots of curls that lasted!</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable to sleep on!</li>
            <li> These are good quality soft rollers.  They were comfortable to sleep on and there is a lot in the package so I was able to only buy one package.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have ever used on my toddlers hair!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.. The metal wire is already poking through one after using once.</li>
            <li> I gave these curlers away as a gift ... She loves them because they are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> dont really work or stay in the hair.</li>
            <li> This product would and could be good if the seams were stitched better. Makes great curls for the hair and comfortable for sleep but please stitch the edges better.</li>
            <li> Well, if you want curls, this is the product to buy. I used them on damp hair with hair mousse. I gotta say I had VERY curly hair in the morning. Next time I won&#x27;t use them all night.</li>
            <li> had these kind of rollers some time ago and it worked for me. but these new ones did not please me. sponge inside soo small not like older ones that went all the way to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend mabe to children growing up experimenting with various hair rollers</li>
            <li> These curlers work really well if you like a curly look and they really do stay in well and are comfortable to sleep in.</li>
