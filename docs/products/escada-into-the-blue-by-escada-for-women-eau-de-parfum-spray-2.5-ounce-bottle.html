            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>This however, is very crisp and fresh smelling, and I can spray just about as much as I want and love it!</li>
            <li>It has a unique scent and does not wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>I use 2 others but this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that smells fresh and clean but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
            <li>This perfume is great for those who do not like heavy scents.  </li>
            <li>The only perfume I have ever used where so many (especially men) notice after hours of putting it on and commenting how good it smells.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;3)I&#x27;d say this perfume caters more towards the adult crowd rather than teens .</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who likes a fresh, clean scent, and not a heavy strong perfume.  </li>
            <li>It seems to fade pretty quickly, and I wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>I love Into the Blue, and havent found anything to compare, yet.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with everything about this order.[[ASIN:B000VOLM16 Escada Into The Blue By Escada For Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 2.5-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li>I felt it was too manly at first.</li>
            <li>The reason I may have thought it was manly was that it was different than most perfumes.</li>
            <li>say the scent strength is moderate for the most part . .not</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this perfume lasts the same amount of time as most perfumes (which is around 8 hours).</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the ocean, and I apply it on the days I need a mood lift and inner strength - which are most days.  </li>
            <li>and I STILL get asked almost daily for the name! :-)</li>
            <li>yet pretty this is the fragance for you.</li>
            <li>I have trouble selecting a fragrance that is good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, brand new, and delivered quick.</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>HAHA)</li>
            <li>Finally, for this past Christmas, I had the great idea of looking online</li>
            <li>Escada&#x27;s Into the Blue has been my favorite for several years now!</li>
            <li>If you are trying to decide between the smaller and the larger bottle - go for the big one and make sure to remember the name - you WILL get asked a lot!   </li>
            <li>This was new to me at the time.</li>
            <li>Escada into the Blue was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>.There are plenty of other Escada perfumes teens will love such as Sunset Heat, Ocean Lounge, or Moon Sparkle</li>
            <li>Because this fragrance can no longer be found in stores, I was worried the on-line bottles may be old and not as fragrant - not so.  </li>
            <li>My fiance had brought this for my for my bday a few years back, and my mother fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sort of in that limbo between teen and adult]</li>

            <li> My wife asked me to order this fragrance for her.  It was as delightful as expected and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a gift for my friend as she loves this scent and they dont sell it in stores anymore. Item arrive quickly and my friend was very pleased.</li>
            <li> This item was received timely and in very good condition.  Because this fragrance can no longer be found in stores, I was worried the on-line bottles may be old and not as fragrant - not so.  The only perfume I have ever used where so many (especially men) notice after hours of putting it on and commenting how good it smells.  I hope it is still being manufactured and all these on-line bottles are not just left overs.  A definite thumbs-up!!</li>
            <li> I do not have any luck finding perfume I like, but I got a free sample of this in the mail about 4 years ago, and I have been hooked ever since. This is the best smelling perfume. Not too strong, or flowery. It has a unique scent and does not wear off quickly. I love Into the Blue, and havent found anything to compare, yet.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0012EKDKK Escada Into the Blue By Escada for Women EDP 2.5 Oz.]]  Inexpensive, brand new, and delivered quick. What more can I ask for? Smells amazing as well, for the misses!</li>
            <li> Perfume usually give&#x27;s me a headache if I smell it on me all day.  This however, is very crisp and fresh smelling, and I can spray just about as much as I want and love it!</li>
            <li> Escada into the Blue was exactly as described.  The package arrived very quickly and was there in plenty of time for Christmas. I was pleased with everything about this order.[[ASIN:B000VOLM16 Escada Into The Blue By Escada For Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 2.5-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. I bought it for my sister and will probably buy it for myself as well.  Very nice daytime scent that will not be too strong for anyone.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this purchase and will continue to order from this site.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with a majority of the perfumes.  I got a 1.7 for 10$ on sale and figured it would be nice and fruity as most ESCADA perfumes are.  But I should have known it wasn&#x27;t by the name.  At first, this perfume smells terrible, way to clean and bug spray smelling, but it changes throughout the day and smells terrific!  It&#x27;s my new favorite and I love it!  Which is surprising because i&#x27;m way more of a sweet smelling perfume kind of person.</li>
            <li> The perfume is the best. Before I used this, I didn&#x27;t like wearing perfume. Once I tried this one I decided I should wear perfume. I use 2 others but this one is my absolute favorite. I need more!</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with Into the Blue as I did with the Escada Signature. I felt it was too manly at first. Though as the day went on it either grew on me or the scent changed as the time went on. I&#x27;ll go with both. The reason I may have thought it was manly was that it was different than most perfumes. It had not just floral [blue lotus &amp; peony] and fruit notes [watermelon], but also wet woods and watery notes. This was new to me at the time. I&#x27;ve never smelled an aquatic-based perfume before and it was a little odd to me at first. But like I said before, it grew on me. Now I wear it frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips/Suggestions/Comments involving Escada Into the Blue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)I&#x27;d say the scent strength is moderate for the most part . .not too intense and not too subtle . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;d say this perfume lasts the same amount of time as most perfumes (which is around 8 hours). It&#x27;s perfect for a day at work or school or whatever . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)I&#x27;d say this perfume caters more towards the adult crowd rather than teens . .There are plenty of other Escada perfumes teens will love such as Sunset Heat, Ocean Lounge, or Moon Sparkle [I, myself, love all three and I&#x27;m 19 so I&#x27;m sort of in that limbo between teen and adult]</li>
            <li> My fiance had brought this for my for my bday a few years back, and my mother fell in love with it. For mother&#x27;s day she wanted me to get it for her, so I looked all over and couldnt find it. Finally, for this past Christmas, I had the great idea of looking online (Who would have thought to look online? HAHA) She loved it more than anything!</li>
            <li> This parfum makes you feel sexy, confident and pretty ... you should buy it ! it lasts all day long</li>
            <li> Escada&#x27;s Into the Blue has been my favorite for several years now! It reminds me of the ocean, and I apply it on the days I need a mood lift and inner strength - which are most days.  :)  It&#x27;s a clean, bracing, yet calming scent that always makes me feel good. It seems to fade pretty quickly, and I wish it lasted longer. I&#x27;m so glad I found it and hope I always will be able to.</li>
            <li> What an amazing scent! Well worth the money! If you are trying to decide between the smaller and the larger bottle - go for the big one and make sure to remember the name - you WILL get asked a lot!   I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance since the day they released it and I STILL get asked almost daily for the name! :-)</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that smells fresh and clean but yet pretty this is the fragance for you. I love this product and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and will continue to.</li>

            <li> This cologne has such a beautiful light, fresh and clean citrus scent.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a fresh, clean scent, and not a heavy strong perfume.  I have allergies, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Great price on Amazon.com.  BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> The packaging and timeliness were great but my daughter just opened it to use and it&#x27;s not the same cologne - has a completely different scent - very disappointing at that price</li>
            <li> I first wore this perfume when I was 16 and have been on a man hunt since to find it!!  I absolutely love this perfume and get non-stop complements from men and women about how good it smells!!  Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This perfume is great for those who do not like heavy scents.  It is light and floral and very appealing.</li>
