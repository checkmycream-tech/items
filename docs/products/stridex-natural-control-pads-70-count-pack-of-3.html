            <li>These are the best salicylic acid pads I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used MANY over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>pads are huge &amp; there&#x27;s plenty of medication on them (both good things in my book).&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no nasty odor...</li>
            <li>this is definitely the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product, but purchased on 9/14 and paid around $11, now they are asking $19.  </li>
            <li>And for the love of all that is holy, don&#x27;t wear make up to the gym.</li>

            <li>Side note, it did foam up and leave residue like many reviewers on this site on others have stated.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I have used it for a year.  </li>
            <li>I love using this product.  </li>
            <li>and I used to be able to find it at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>They no longer carry it at my local Walmart, so I am very glad that I found for a great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good for acne control.  </li>
            <li>absoulely great face pads the smell of them is even better than moring bursts ones and they make your face feel clean and drys fast</li>
            <li>They make you feel clean and don&#x27;t burn your face if you have acne!</li>
            <li>But most importantly, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These pads also clear up blackheads, which is great.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for my mature, but acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I will say it is strong, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and everyone is particular; what is strong and pleasant to some might be overpowering and nauseating to others.</li>

            <li>First I found a good, gentle cleanser that was affordable and effective at balancing my skin.</li>
            <li>A moisturizer seems to take care of that easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now, and it&#x27;s still a huge battle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m inclined to use the raised side, but I try to keep with the smooth side application when it comes to my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m inclined to use the raised side, but I try to keep with the smooth side application when it comes to my face.</li>
            <li>Cant find this natural formula in the storeâ€¦ I have a cat who has a skin condition much like a humans seborrhea,,, vet recommended it and it works great</li>
            <li>, stridex cloths are like towels, they need to be rung out before you put it on your face to clean it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will not cure acne on its own, especially if you have anything but the most mild of acne.</li>
            <li>My face was blotchy and bright red within a minute or two of swiping these on.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t eliminate acne on its own, you should see a dermatologist or add something like [[ASIN:B000EPA4FW Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System]]</li>
            <li>I found it irritates the skin more than if you just wash your face, treat it as a whole, and let it alone to heal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all different types of Stridex pads and this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>Although for some they can be great, sometimes you only really want or need one of the products in them and they add up in cost.</li>
            <li>The pads are large and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I&#x27;ve invested in a light moisturizer with a high spf for during the day and at night I use another equally light moisturizer to go overtop the Stridex medication to keep from drying out.</li>

            <li>In fact, after regularly using this product, my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>The larger pads are better than the original Stridex size and the natural astringent is milder than the original Stridex pads, but I think that is better for your skin.</li>
            <li>product has a distinct non-medicine smell.</li>
            <li>The product has a distinct non-medicine smell.</li>
            <li>I like them even better than the ones for sensitive skin, which contains alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I bought the three pack from Amazon, so the price was right also.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t melt your face off, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>In the morning and at night I wash with a gentle cleanser, pat my face with a clean towel, and use one of these.</li>
            <li>In the morning and at night I wash with a gentle cleanser, pat my face with a clean towel, and use one of these.</li>
            <li>I typically use Stridex Maximum Strength Pads and they work wonderfully, even though they are actually stronger than these (2 vs. 1 percent salicylic).</li>
            <li>Thanks stridex for making a more natural formula!</li>
            <li>And with the popular kits the majority of the product has benzoyl in it, or a combination of benzoyl and salicylic acid so as a result you can over medicate or over dry.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.  </li>
            <li>Even at age 45, I have oily skin and acne flair-ups, plus I am very prone to red, splotchy skin which is very easily irritated.  </li>
            <li>had gotten to the point of using so many different products that I was getting overwhelmed and literally threw out everything and started from scratch.</li>
            <li>you are past the teenage years and have the combo whammy of aging skin along with acne, these pads are perfect.  </li>
            <li>Love the larger size and works well</li>
            <li>I use these for daily/routine cleaning (I use a version of this with higher medication levels when I&#x27;m having breakouts).</li>
            <li>I like the Stridex in the red box better.</li>
            <li>The PH is too high to really de-gunk pores, but it&#x27;s mildly astringent and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Triangles are pretty big and do a good job of clogging all the pores on your entire face.</li>
            <li>My pores look clean and clear after using these.  </li>
            <li>I have tried oral medications, but because I&#x27;m fair skin and haired, already extremely photosensitive to the sun, after my first medication related burn, I stopped.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t pay that much, I&#x27;ll buy elsewhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather avoid skin cancer, thanks.</li>
            <li>(so I&#x27;d still have acne management in a low dose), alcohol free, in a pad</li>
            <li>As a result, I&#x27;m getting a very even looking complexion.</li>

            <li>As a result, I&#x27;m getting a very even looking complexion.</li>
            <li>This works very well without over-drying.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stridex</li>
            <li>My face feels refreshed and ready to go.</li>
            <li>I really like these Stridex pads.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing to use occasionally at night when you&#x27;re too tired to fully wash your face, as well as a good thing to use after washing for specific break outs.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, smooth, supple, and clear.</li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s quick and simple to apply), boasting natural ingredients, affordable, easy to find, and designed for sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>many of those types of medications have other undesirable side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A pad is both large enough and loaded with more than enough medication to treat your face, neck, and shoulders if you so chose.</li>

            <li>Naturally Clear pads gave me exactly what I was looking for: 1% salicylic acid</li>

            <li>only other time I have EVER experienced this was with a generic grocer brand grapefruit cleanser bought on vacation in London.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well or even better then the more expensive products out there.  </li>
            <li>digress, back to the aforementioned mission...after a good cleanser I looked for an acne treatment that was simple, quick, and specific for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tend to apply, let it sit for a sec, and lightly pat the excess off with a towel.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s the least harsh and most effective.</li>
            <li>I would love to say it completely gets rid of all acne and imperfections, but I&#x27;ve only been using this regime for a short amount of time.</li>

            <li>I do wish there were more, but I can understand why they have less than their similar counterparts, as the individual pads themselves are huge.</li>

            <li>You won&#x27;t get soapy residue on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, always try out a new product on your arm before smearing it on your face.</li>
            <li>There are two sides to each pad, a smooth and slightly raised side.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve only had one lone evildoer pop up since (hormone related), but it was much smaller and easily dealt with than those that had come before it.</li>

            <li>in addition to Stridex Naturally Clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything topically to clear my skin up.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t working anyway to clear up my face, unless the goal was to burn off the acne with the sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used scrubs, gels, concoctions, potions, lotions of with varying degrees of potency, prescriptions, old wives&#x27; tales, holistic remedies, etc...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 years old with maturing skin type that&#x27;s seldomly oil.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was using the Stridex pads for sensitive skin but was attracted to the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients in these</li>
            <li>They leave my skin soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li>bought these for my 12 year old daughter as a one step acne treatment.</li>
            <li>Find something that specifically states for sensitive skin and aim for something a little more natural; the less complex of ingredients the better.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this product is that in addition to gradually eliminating my acne and blackheads, it is also lightened the harsh discoloration of those I&#x27;ve long since healed in the past.</li>

            <li>the pads are large enough that only one pad is needed.</li>
            <li>I can cover my whole face and still have enough left over to cover my neck and shoulders too.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the marketing behind why a larger pad is better, but I guess that&#x27;s just American consumer mentality at work.</li>
            <li>Cosmetic Cop Paula Begoun approves of these pads and she generally dislikes all pads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: The number of pads in comparison to others, the need to use multiple times in a day, lingering soapy/filmy residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a mission to clear up my skin for a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g topical to clear up my skin since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>My guess is that they could be used similarly to the Aveeno Positively Clear Cleansing Pads, as a wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Invest in sensitive skin specific towelettes or blotting papers to help reduce the appearance of oil on the skin during the day.</li>
            <li>never has made my face red or dry or peel and does very well at getting blimish pimples away</li>
            <li>The less that inhibits your skin&#x27;s ability to shed dead skin cells the better.</li>
            <li>Pros: Works extremely well for sensitive, t-zone/combination, acne prone skin, reasonable cost especially when it&#x27;s on sale, size of product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Just FYI, the main ingredient in these is betaine, it also contains white tea, and other natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this product, especially for adult or mixed-type skin (normal/oily, etc).</li>
            <li>it does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is moisturized (not dried out, like other pads can do) and clear from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li>This is the first acne-specific product I&#x27;ve ever tried that hasn&#x27;t dried the heck out of my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine toner but a poor chemical exfoliant.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Although for some they can be great, sometimes you only really want or need one of the products in them and they add up in cost.</li>
            <li> The pads are large and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;ve invested in a light moisturizer with a high spf for during the day and at night I use another equally light moisturizer to go overtop the Stridex medication to keep from drying out.</li>

            <li> In fact, after regularly using this product, my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> The larger pads are better than the original Stridex size and the natural astringent is milder than the original Stridex pads, but I think that is better for your skin.</li>
            <li> product has a distinct non-medicine smell.</li>
            <li> The product has a distinct non-medicine smell.</li>
            <li> I like them even better than the ones for sensitive skin, which contains alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I bought the three pack from Amazon, so the price was right also.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t melt your face off, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> In the morning and at night I wash with a gentle cleanser, pat my face with a clean towel, and use one of these.</li>

            <li> I typically use Stridex Maximum Strength Pads and they work wonderfully, even though they are actually stronger than these (2 vs. 1 percent salicylic).</li>
            <li> Thanks stridex for making a more natural formula!</li>
            <li> And with the popular kits the majority of the product has benzoyl in it, or a combination of benzoyl and salicylic acid so as a result you can over medicate or over dry.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.  </li>
            <li> Even at age 45, I have oily skin and acne flair-ups, plus I am very prone to red, splotchy skin which is very easily irritated.  </li>
            <li> had gotten to the point of using so many different products that I was getting overwhelmed and literally threw out everything and started from scratch.</li>
            <li> you are past the teenage years and have the combo whammy of aging skin along with acne, these pads are perfect.  </li>
            <li> Love the larger size and works well</li>
            <li> I use these for daily/routine cleaning (I use a version of this with higher medication levels when I&#x27;m having breakouts).</li>
            <li> I like the Stridex in the red box better.</li>
            <li> The PH is too high to really de-gunk pores, but it&#x27;s mildly astringent and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Triangles are pretty big and do a good job of clogging all the pores on your entire face.</li>
            <li> My pores look clean and clear after using these.  </li>
            <li> I have tried oral medications, but because I&#x27;m fair skin and haired, already extremely photosensitive to the sun, after my first medication related burn, I stopped.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t pay that much, I&#x27;ll buy elsewhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather avoid skin cancer, thanks.</li>
            <li> (so I&#x27;d still have acne management in a low dose), alcohol free, in a pad</li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;m getting a very even looking complexion.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing to use occasionally at night when you&#x27;re too tired to fully wash your face, as well as a good thing to use after washing for specific break outs.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, smooth, supple, and clear.</li>
            <li> (so it&#x27;s quick and simple to apply), boasting natural ingredients, affordable, easy to find, and designed for sensitive skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do not understand why this stridex has such poor reviews. I&#x27;ve used all different types of Stridex pads and this is definitely the best. It&#x27;s the least harsh and most effective. The pads are large and easy to use. There is no nasty odor... But most importantly, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will not cure acne on its own, especially if you have anything but the most mild of acne. However, for what it is (salicylic acid) this is definitely the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for stridex pads, this is the one to get. If it doesn&#x27;t eliminate acne on its own, you should see a dermatologist or add something like [[ASIN:B000EPA4FW Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System]] in addition to Stridex Naturally Clear.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but purchased on 9/14 and paid around $11, now they are asking $19.  I won&#x27;t pay that much, I&#x27;ll buy elsewhere</li>
            <li> They make you feel clean and don&#x27;t burn your face if you have acne!</li>
            <li> Pros: Works extremely well for sensitive, t-zone/combination, acne prone skin, reasonable cost especially when it&#x27;s on sale, size of product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The number of pads in comparison to others, the need to use multiple times in a day, lingering soapy/filmy residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a mission to clear up my skin for a while. I&#x27;ve used everything topically to clear my skin up. I&#x27;ve used scrubs, gels, concoctions, potions, lotions of with varying degrees of potency, prescriptions, old wives&#x27; tales, holistic remedies, etc... I&#x27;m surprised I didn&#x27;t have someone burn sage and chant in hopes of warding off the bad juju haunting my complexion. So let me clarify once again I&#x27;ve used e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g topical to clear up my skin since I was a teenager. I have tried oral medications, but because I&#x27;m fair skin and haired, already extremely photosensitive to the sun, after my first medication related burn, I stopped. It wasn&#x27;t working anyway to clear up my face, unless the goal was to burn off the acne with the sun. I&#x27;d rather avoid skin cancer, thanks. Plus, I think it is ridiculous to take something internally to fix a rather external problem and many of those types of medications have other undesirable side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re talking nearly two decades here of finicky, temperamental, acne prone, rash prone, combination skin producing boils, cysts, blisters, whiteheads, blackheads, relentless post inflammatory hyper pigmentation (i.e. extremely difficult subcutaneous lesions and severe purple or red discolorations that take months to disappear even after they&#x27;ve essentially healed). So I think that alone should endow me with some authority or clout when it comes to dispensing acne remedies advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten to the point of using so many different products that I was getting overwhelmed and literally threw out everything and started from scratch. Sometimes it&#x27;s just best to start anew. I avoided investing in kits, though I had used those in the past. Although for some they can be great, sometimes you only really want or need one of the products in them and they add up in cost. First I found a good, gentle cleanser that was affordable and effective at balancing my skin. If you have very sensitive skin, you should not invest in scrubs, they tend to exacerbate the problem; causing splotchy excessive oil production, or over dry the skin. Find something that specifically states for sensitive skin and aim for something a little more natural; the less complex of ingredients the better. Also, don&#x27;t over wash, this causes the same problems; twice a day or as necessary if you also work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invest in sensitive skin specific towelettes or blotting papers to help reduce the appearance of oil on the skin during the day. Don&#x27;t wear excessive or heavy make up. The less that inhibits your skin&#x27;s ability to shed dead skin cells the better. And for the love of all that is holy, don&#x27;t wear make up to the gym. You&#x27;re just going to sweat it all off anyway. Give up on spot treating. I found it irritates the skin more than if you just wash your face, treat it as a whole, and let it alone to heal. Don&#x27;t pick, pop, or poke. It&#x27;s been proven you cause more damage than good. You want the nasty red thing on your face to go away quickly, but in picking, popping, or poking it, now you&#x27;ve caused a horrible discoloration that lingers long after the pimple itself has healed. This is called post inflammatory hyper pigmentation. It&#x27;s essentially (subcutaneous) damage below the surface of the skin and it can take months to heal, maybe weeks with the assistance of medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress, back to the aforementioned mission...after a good cleanser I looked for an acne treatment that was simple, quick, and specific for sensitive skin. I gave up on benzoyl peroxide products entirely, regardless of the claims. Even the lower dosage caused problems. And with the popular kits the majority of the product has benzoyl in it, or a combination of benzoyl and salicylic acid so as a result you can over medicate or over dry. Chemically, in moderate to low doses, it can be an affective treatment for managing acne, but for those of us outliers with extremely sensitive skin, it can actually make it worse. It did in my case, so I ventured to salicylic acid only. I&#x27;ve used it in the past like the benzoyl, in varying degrees of potency. Most products have 2% and even that didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Thus, I went to a lighter dosage and that is where I found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stridex Naturally Clear pads gave me exactly what I was looking for: 1% salicylic acid (so I&#x27;d still have acne management in a low dose), alcohol free, in a pad (so it&#x27;s quick and simple to apply), boasting natural ingredients, affordable, easy to find, and designed for sensitive skin. I&#x27;d considered the Stridex Sensitive Skin with Aloe with 0.5%, but I tried these first. I&#x27;m sure as I age and my skin changes I might have to go to an even lower dosage of salicylic acid, but until then, I&#x27;m happy using these. There are 70 in the container. I do wish there were more, but I can understand why they have less than their similar counterparts, as the individual pads themselves are huge. A pad is both large enough and loaded with more than enough medication to treat your face, neck, and shoulders if you so chose. In the morning and at night I wash with a gentle cleanser, pat my face with a clean towel, and use one of these. There are two sides to each pad, a smooth and slightly raised side. If I have a stubborn patch of blackheads I&#x27;m inclined to use the raised side, but I try to keep with the smooth side application when it comes to my face. The majority of days I use 2-3 pads, as sometimes when I hit the door in the afternoon after work I will use one hours before I intend to wash my face (just prior to bedtime). I would watch using it too close to the eyes and mouth as forewarned on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a distinct non-medicine smell. I will say it is strong, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and everyone is particular; what is strong and pleasant to some might be overpowering and nauseating to others. When you apply the product you may notice it leaves a soapy, almost filmy residue that takes a few moments to dry. I tend to apply, let it sit for a sec, and lightly pat the excess off with a towel. Additionally, I&#x27;ve invested in a light moisturizer with a high spf for during the day and at night I use another equally light moisturizer to go overtop the Stridex medication to keep from drying out. Thankfully, I&#x27;ve not really encountered that problem, nor have I had to deal with reddening, stinging, burning, excessive oil, etc...The great thing about this product is that in addition to gradually eliminating my acne and blackheads, it is also lightened the harsh discoloration of those I&#x27;ve long since healed in the past. As a result, I&#x27;m getting a very even looking complexion. I would love to say it completely gets rid of all acne and imperfections, but I&#x27;ve only been using this regime for a short amount of time. I&#x27;ve only had one lone evildoer pop up since (hormone related), but it was much smaller and easily dealt with than those that had come before it. I am extremely satisfied with the product in comparison to others. I will continue to use it so long as it works as well as it has been.as a result you can over medicate or over dry. Chemically, in moderate to low doses, it can be an affective treatment for managing acne, but for those of us outliers with extremely sensitive skin, it can actually make it worse.

Most products have 2% and even that didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Thus, I went to a lighter dosage and that is where I found these.    The Stridex Naturally Clear pads gave me exactly what I was looking for: 1% salicylic acid (so I&#x27;d still have acne management in a low dose), alcohol free, in a pad (so it&#x27;s quick and simple to apply), boasting natural ingredients, affordable, easy to find, and designed for sensitive skin. I&#x27;d considered the Stridex Sensitive Skin with Aloe with 0.5%, but I tried these first. I&#x27;m sure as I age and my skin changes I might have to go to an even lower dosage of salicylic acid, but until then, I&#x27;m happy using these. There are 70 in the container. I do wish there were more, but I can understand why they have less than their similar counterparts, as the individual pads themselves are huge. A pad is both large enough and loaded with more than enough medication to treat your face, neck, and shoulders if you so chose. In the morning and at night I wash with a gentle cleanser, pat my face with a clean towel, and use one of these. There are two sides to each pad, a smooth and slightly raised side. If I have a stubborn patch of blackheads I&#x27;m inclined to use the raised side, but I try to keep with the smooth side application when it comes to my face. The majority of days I use 2-3 pads, as sometimes when I hit the door in the afternoon after work I will use one hours before I intend to wash my face (just prior to bedtime). I would watch using it too close to the eyes and mouth as forewarned on the package.    The product has a distinct non-medicine smell. I will say it is strong, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and everyone is particular; what is strong and pleasant to some might be overpowering and nauseating to others. When you apply the product you may notice it leaves a soapy, almost filmy residue that takes a few moments to dry. I tend to apply, let it sit for a sec, and lightly pat the excess off with a towel. Additionally, I&#x27;ve invested in a light moisturizer with a high spf for during the day and at night I use another equally light moisturizer to go overtop the Stridex medication to keep from drying out. Thankfully, I&#x27;ve not really encountered that problem, nor have I had to deal with reddening, stinging, burning, excessive oil, etc...The great thing about this product is that in addition to gradually eliminating my acne and blackheads, it is also lightened the harsh discoloration of those I&#x27;ve long since healed in the past. As a result, I&#x27;m getting a very even looking complexion. I would love to say it completely gets rid of all acne and imperfections, but I&#x27;ve only been using this regime for a short amount of time. I&#x27;ve only had one lone evildoer pop up since (hormone related), but it was much smaller and easily dealt with than those that had come before it. I am extremely satisfied with the product in comparison to others. I will continue to use it so long as it works as well as it has been.</li>
            <li> Works great for my tween daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old with maturing skin type that&#x27;s seldomly oil. This product made my skin break out in less than 6 hours.  Solution will clog your pores if you don&#x27;t rinse it off, which defeats the purpose of using cleansing pads when you want to try and avoid cleansing with water.     Pros:  Triangles are pretty big and do a good job of clogging all the pores on your entire face. I bought this product for $3.</li>
            <li> This works very well without over-drying.  It&#x27;s a good thing to use occasionally at night when you&#x27;re too tired to fully wash your face, as well as a good thing to use after washing for specific break outs.</li>
            <li> this stridex is perfect. it does not dry out your skin. i bought 2 more this time and its perfect. and my skin likes it</li>
            <li> Each wipe is sufficient size for face, neck, and shoulders.  Cleared up my shoulders where my sports bra straps made me break out.  No medicinal scent, no sting.  Very good product!</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent skin care product for people who have sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li> absoulely great face pads the smell of them is even better than moring bursts ones and they make your face feel clean and drys fast never has made my face red or dry or peel and does very well at getting blimish pimples away</li>
            <li> Cant find this natural formula in the storeâ€¦ I have a cat who has a skin condition much like a humans seborrhea,,, vet recommended it and it works great</li>
            <li> I really like this stridex and I would like to address a couple things from reviews I&#x27;ve seen on here.&lt;br /&gt;One, stridex cloths are like towels, they need to be rung out before you put it on your face to clean it. There is no sense in putting a saturated cloth on your face, because it is like pouring chemicals on your face. If you wring your cloth out a little like I did. You won&#x27;t get soapy residue on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, always try out a new product on your arm before smearing it on your face. I have sensitive skin. And I have had zero issues with this product, however, everyone is allergic to something different so always try it on your forearm then wait a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I love this product. It does not smell as bad as other stridex products. And it isn&#x27;t as corrosive to the skin. It cleans my skin just as well, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any pimples since my second use. My face feels refreshed and ready to go. Thanks stridex for making a more natural formula!</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and gave me a bad rash. Use maximum strength Stridex for real good results</li>
            <li> I really like these Stridex pads.  I was using the Stridex pads for sensitive skin but was attracted to the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients in these so I gave them a try.  I like them even better than the ones for sensitive skin, which contains alcohol.  Just FYI, the main ingredient in these is betaine, it also contains white tea, and other natural ingredients.  The pads are larger than regular Stridex pads so they go further.  I can cover my whole face and still have enough left over to cover my neck and shoulders too.  Even at age 45, I have oily skin and acne flair-ups, plus I am very prone to red, splotchy skin which is very easily irritated.  I have been using these everyday for two weeks now and my skin is less red and splotchy and I have less acne.  It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin, nor does it feel greasy.  It does leave a thin film on your skin that takes about a minute or two to completely dry, but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after that.  I&#x27;m also prone to allergies and have to stay away from heavy perfumes so this fits the bill there also.  It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything.  The salicydic acid in it helps to control acne although I use a stronger medicated gel for spot treatments where needed.  These pads also clear up blackheads, which is great.  My pores look clean and clear after using these.  I bought the three pack from Amazon, so the price was right also.  I definitely would recommend this product, especially for adult or mixed-type skin (normal/oily, etc).</li>
            <li> we prefer this stridex product over the others because it has a less harsh formula and smell.  It works quite well without offending your nose.</li>
            <li> These are the best salicylic acid pads I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used MANY over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are past the teenage years and have the combo whammy of aging skin along with acne, these pads are perfect.  They are alcohol-free and best of all, along with other great ingredients, they contain soybean seed extract which is great for the skin.  My skin is moisturized (not dried out, like other pads can do) and clear from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is selling them at an amazing price.  If you&#x27;re on the fence try them!  They leave my skin soft and glowing.  Best of all, NO acne anymore.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for acne control.  They don&#x27;t melt your face off, and the price is right.  They accomplish the same goal as any salicylic acid treatment, which is to get some acne relief and prevention.  They&#x27;re a bit big- I don&#x27;t really understand the marketing behind why a larger pad is better, but I guess that&#x27;s just American consumer mentality at work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible acne skin since I was about 11 years old. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now, and it&#x27;s still a huge battle. This is the first acne-specific product I&#x27;ve ever tried that hasn&#x27;t dried the heck out of my skin. There is also no irritation whatsoever! In fact, after regularly using this product, my skin has never looked better! No redness. No blotchy patches. My skin is soft, smooth, supple, and clear. I&#x27;ve already decided that if ever Stridex goes to discontinue this product, I&#x27;ll be buying out the remainder of their stock. Super serious about that...</li>
            <li> Love the larger size and works well</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the other Stridex products, but I like trying to stay natural.  These pads have cleared away some very stubborn ingrown hair and other minor skin abnomalies that other products could not successfully treat.  Very gentle.  Can be used with any facial regiment.</li>
            <li> Cosmetic Cop Paula Begoun approves of these pads and she generally dislikes all pads.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for my 12 year old daughter as a one step acne treatment. They work well, don&#x27;t dry her skin and seem to keep adolescent acne under some control.</li>
            <li> This product instantly caused a terrible reaction in my skin tonight. My face was blotchy and bright red within a minute or two of swiping these on. I am worried about lingering effects tomorrow. My face still feels puffy and is burning even after washing and applying a soothing cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t take well to harsh treatments, but not anything serious. I can use almost any product, including fragrances and preservatives, with no issues.  I typically use Stridex Maximum Strength Pads and they work wonderfully, even though they are actually stronger than these (2 vs. 1 percent salicylic). I will be going back to those. I wanted to try the 1 percent as I probably don&#x27;t need max strength. This product looked tempting. Bad decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other time I have EVER experienced this was with a generic grocer brand grapefruit cleanser bought on vacation in London.  I wonder if I&#x27;m allergic to artifical fruit acids? So weird! This was an awful experience and waste of money. Side note, it did foam up and leave residue like many reviewers on this site on others have stated. The instructions say that they provide added &#x27;cleansing&#x27; even though they are just wipes. My guess is that they could be used similarly to the Aveeno Positively Clear Cleansing Pads, as a wash. But don&#x27;t risk buying it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my mature, but acne prone skin.  I love this product, and I have used it for a year.  Just sometimes it is out of stock, so I have to time my purchases so I don&#x27;t get stuck without it.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help me keep my face from breaking out.  I&#x27;m middle aged and am still fighting acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads are huge &amp; there&#x27;s plenty of medication on them (both good things in my book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these help.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with my face reacting to the medication in these.  My face does get a little dry, if I use them a lot in the winter.  A moisturizer seems to take care of that easily.  These seem to be quite a bit gentler on my face than a lot of other products.  I use these for daily/routine cleaning (I use a version of this with higher medication levels when I&#x27;m having breakouts).</li>
            <li> The PH is too high to really de-gunk pores, but it&#x27;s mildly astringent and the price is right. It&#x27;s a fine toner but a poor chemical exfoliant. I like the Stridex in the red box better.</li>
            <li> These work well. Especially after a workout.</li>
            <li> Best Stridex pads.  The larger pads are better than the original Stridex size and the natural astringent is milder than the original Stridex pads, but I think that is better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love using this product.  It works just as well or even better then the more expensive products out there.  I have been using it for several years now and I used to be able to find it at Walmart.  They no longer carry it at my local Walmart, so I am very glad that I found for a great price on Amazon.  I will definitely by it again.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of cleaning my face and the pads are large enough that only one pad is needed.</li>
