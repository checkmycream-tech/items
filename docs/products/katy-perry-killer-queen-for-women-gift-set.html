            <li>The large bottle of perfume is GORGEOUS!</li>
            <li>It is Excellent, I received on time and the quality is great work as It’s required and I will give 5 stars, it’s just Wonderful, better impossible</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s her favorite</li>
            <li>Love love love this scent one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and the roller ball is nice</li>
            <li>I just love</li>
            <li>so now I am buying more on my favorite site to buy perfumes here</li>
            <li>the scent description matches what I always wear, and 3) I love Queen and the song Killer Queen</li>
            <li>But It doesn&#x27;t change how much I love the scent</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift more than once.  </li>
            <li>Evreything was amazing and good also the shipping was so fast</li>
            <li>The box is quite large and sturdy, lined with good foil, I am going to use it as a makeup box.</li>
            <li>the most important part the perfume cracked</li>
            <li>I like good perfume as much as I like jewelry.</li>
            <li>I like this smell not to strong -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light with a hint of sweetness and spice.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT and highly recommend it !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I ordered this gift set so I could get the rollerball perfume stick - fits better in my purse than a miniature bottle of the large one.</li>
            <li>the smell is really very pretty....</li>
            <li>Like many other items is the second time that I buy, its sweet aroma is extremely exquisite, my wife loves it and especially that so complete kit comes with everything included, is a spectacular fragrance.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was nice, but a little bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>I  first bought this at riteade in my home town</li>
            <li>The item came two days before the promised shipping date, and it is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Love this long lasting sweet smell</li>
            <li>normally I don&#x27;t really care for Star&#x27;s perfumes but</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very picky on what I wear this one I will stock up&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who always turns whatever perfume she wears into a much stronger, incense-y scent.</li>
            <li>Hubby really likes this scent.</li>
            <li>, I was checking many different and similar of this one</li>
            <li>Subtle sweet smell, not over powering heavy scent great for the summer, bonus travel size bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wikipedia lists the fragrance notes: &amp;#34;Its top notes include wild berries, dark plum and bergamot accords.</li>
            <li>Katy Perry Killer Queen is a very soft scented perfume that over whelms your senses.</li>
            <li>I would have saved some money and gotten only the large bottle of perfume if I had known that.</li>
            <li>you could wear day or night and not be overly loud.</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>The main note of the heart is velvety red flower (celosia), but there are also sambac jasmine and rainbow plumeria.</li>
            <li>I paid more in store for one small bottle, than I paid for this entire set.</li>
            <li>With both perfumes, the lotion and the shower gel, be aware: a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> but the staying power unfortunately sucks.</li>
            <li> The base contains cashmere, patchouli and liquid praline.&amp;#34; I mistook the praline for white chocolate!</li>

            <li> I cant seem to find it anywhere :(</li>
            <li> Instead, I get the stupid miniature bottle!</li>

            <li> Killer Queen is the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought! The item came two days before the promised shipping date, and it is exactly as pictured. The box is quite large and sturdy, lined with good foil, I am going to use it as a makeup box. The large bottle of perfume is GORGEOUS!

The base contains cashmere, patchouli and liquid praline.&amp;#34; I mistook the praline for white chocolate! *laughs*</li>
            <li> It was a lovely set and made a great gift! The scent was very nice!</li>
            <li> It is Excellent, I received on time and the quality is great work as It’s required and I will give 5 stars, it’s just Wonderful, better impossible, I was checking many different and similar of this one and I couldn’t find someone like this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gift set so I could get the rollerball perfume stick - fits better in my purse than a miniature bottle of the large one. Instead, I get the stupid miniature bottle! I would have saved some money and gotten only the large bottle of perfume if I had known that. *AND* of course, I cannot return anything with flammable liquids, so I&#x27;m stuck with the products. Sell me what the picture looks like, for crying out loud.</li>
            <li> My daughter lives it! Great buy! I almost bought it at Kohls for double the price.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, and it&#x27;s beautiful! A really great gift. My wife loves this scent.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at this set for a while now and finally decided to buy it when I got an amazon gift card for my birthday. You can&#x27;t beat the price since it was around $65 at Ulta. It came in perfect condition. I will definitely buy it again when I run out, which probably won&#x27;t be for a while since there&#x27;s a lot of perfume in the set.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent! I bought the smaller bottle at Ulta for $50! This is a way better deal! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product! The only thing I wish they sold was the stand for the bottle. I cant seem to find it anywhere :( But It doesn&#x27;t change how much I love the scent and I will still continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of the best I have ever used and I am big on perfumes. I like good perfume as much as I like jewelry. Katy Perry Killer Queen is a very soft scented perfume that over whelms your senses. The fragrance is captivating!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. I paid more in store for one small bottle, than I paid for this entire set. It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> love the perfume it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Hubby really likes this scent.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter...smells awesome. She loves it. Only complaint is no roller ball was included, it was the smaller version instead. My daughter preferred that though.</li>
            <li> Like many other items is the second time that I buy, its sweet aroma is extremely exquisite, my wife loves it and especially that so complete kit comes with everything included, is a spectacular fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the gift set - comes in a nice box. But instead of a rollerball fragrance, you get a miniature version of the perfume bottle. Perfect gift for someone or for yourself!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent, great value, and great product.  I bought it as a gift more than once.  Everyone I gave it to liked it.  My only complaint is that it does not come with a stand for the perfume bottle, and the bottle must be laid down on its side.  However, the product is great, the scent is great, and I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars even without the bottle-stand.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! It&#x27;s light with a hint of sweetness and spice.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic!! It lasts a long time and definitely turns heads to the wearer. You can wear it as perfume only or use the lotion to soften your skin, too. Either way you smell like a Killer Queen (wonderful).</li>
            <li> I would compare this to a mix between Beyonce&#x27;s &#x27;Heat&#x27;, and Mariah Carey&#x27;s &#x27;M&#x27;....the smell is really very pretty....but the staying power unfortunately sucks. I have to reapply every few hours, otherwise the smell just completely disappears.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and pleasant buying thank you!</li>
            <li> Was not happy when delivered. About a quarter of the perfume had spilled in the gift boxed and stained it.</li>
            <li> I like this smell not to strong - you could wear day or night and not be overly loud. Try it</li>
            <li> Evreything was amazing and good also the shipping was so fast but I gave it 3⭐️⭐️⭐️Because the most important part the perfume cracked</li>
            <li> Great perfume! Arrived early. Thrilled customer :-)</li>
            <li> Best value I have found anywhere</li>
