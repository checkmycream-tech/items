            <li>Rohto makes awesome eyedrops.</li>
            <li>After a couple times, it worked wonderful!</li>
            <li>Best eye drops on the market if you ask me!</li>
            <li>The best thing about the drops, of course, is that they get the redness out!  </li>
            <li>GREATEST EYEDROPS</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>They also work to sooth irritated eyes extremely effectively.  </li>
            <li>ooo how wonderful on my eyes, thanks</li>
            <li>Honestly...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing - even better if you put it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, I have chronic dry eye syndrome and this gets my eyes lubricated and feeling good every morning.</li>
            <li>I love the cooling effect of them as well.</li>
            <li>This really works great, though it stings in the beginning.</li>
            <li>suppose if you need to muster up some tears for an acting gig or something though, these would be great!</li>
            <li>Upon application you will feel a strong mint-like refreshing feeling in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I saw them here!  </li>
            <li>I love the cooling burn it gives you and the quick redness relief.</li>
            <li>Feel awesome and really get the red out.</li>
            <li>After two days of using this, it reduced the redness significantly.</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>my eyes feel amazing and like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rohto cool which I like a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good icy burn...</li>
            <li>It feels pretty nice after application and markedly improves the way your eyes feel (all while completely eliminating any redness)  </li>
            <li>even though its very intense, they weren&#x27;t lying when they said &amp;#34;arctic freeze&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My eyes even got more red sometimes after use.</li>
            <li>I really like the &amp;#34;arctic cooling&amp;#34; feeling of these eye drops!  </li>
            <li>They really wake you up!  </li>
            <li>And really fast, too!  </li>
            <li>USED, THEY REALLY WAKE UP MY EYES!</li>
            <li>These are much better than the Visine Extra</li>
            <li>My eyes stung, turned bright red, and the red did not go away.  </li>
            <li>After I read that knew these were the drops I was looking for haha.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I like them too much.</li>
            <li>They burn so much you will probably make a pact with the Prince of Darkness himself just to make the pain stop.</li>
            <li>Sure, there is a slight burn (cooling effect) when you first put them in, but I am used to it at this point.</li>
            <li>Although it totally doesn&#x27;t make your eye completely clear and white, it&#x27;s very refreshing and works</li>
            <li>I have tried the other variations by Rohto and this is the strongest in terms of cooling, which I love.</li>
            <li>My eye whites were clean and white looking.</li>
            <li>Did some research on this product and found it highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but after that your eyes are paper white and feel so fresh</li>
            <li>Put it in a few minutes before you want to be seen :)</li>
            <li>My right eye has been red for a week and nothing would suffice in reducing the redness.</li>
            <li>These eye drops work within 60-90 seconds to completely remove any redness.  </li>
            <li>really gets the red out!</li>
            <li>The item came in on the date expected and when I used it, it did sting a lot at first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to find a reason for the eyes to need an arctic fresh feel, they have an uncomfortable burn for the first 30 seconds</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was nervous to put it in my eye but gathered up the courage to do so. It wasn&#x27;t as bad as everyone else was saying. It&#x27;s just a minty feeling in your eye. My right eye has been red for a week and nothing would suffice in reducing the redness. After two days of using this, it reduced the redness significantly. Although it totally doesn&#x27;t make your eye completely clear and white, it&#x27;s very refreshing and works alright.</li>
            <li> This is a harsh eye product - quite a lot of stinging.</li>
            <li> best burn in the world</li>
            <li> Feel awesome and really get the red out.</li>
            <li> I cam across these drops at my local drug store and couldn&#x27;t find them again when I ran out.  Luckily I saw them here!  They are AWESOME for eyes prone to seasonal allergies.  I love the cooling effect of them as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews.  I gave it an ample number of tries and could not use it.  My eyes stung, turned bright red, and the red did not go away.  I just couldn&#x27;t use it.  I am throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Rohto makes awesome eyedrops. I have eye allergies and occasional dry eyes. I love the cooling burn it gives you and the quick redness relief.</li>
            <li> Works so well for my red eyes when I have allergies and it really reawakens my vision when I&#x27;m staying up late studying. So worth it!</li>
            <li> Fyi your eyes will burn like fire and look like they&#x27;re bleeding for about 5 minutes but after that your eyes are paper white and feel so fresh</li>
            <li> These eye drops work within 60-90 seconds to completely remove any redness.  They also work to sooth irritated eyes extremely effectively.  Upon application you will feel a strong mint-like refreshing feeling in your eyes.  It&#x27;s been compared to mouthwash for your eyes and I think that&#x27;s a solid description of the sensation.  It feels pretty nice after application and markedly improves the way your eyes feel (all while completely eliminating any redness)  If you happen to be a cannabis smoker, this product is a must.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking forward to use this. I have a lot of visible red blood vessels in my eyes which gives it a red appearance. The eye drops tingled but there hasn&#x27;t been any difference for me. My eyes even got more red sometimes after use. Disappointed really</li>
            <li> Did some research on this product and found it highly recommended. The item came in on the date expected and when I used it, it did sting a lot at first. An icy feeling of course. After a couple times, it worked wonderful! My eye whites were clean and white looking. I wear contacts and I stay up late a lot, therefore my eyes are often red, between looking cloudy and a lot of veins.</li>
            <li> I have used these and was looking through the reviews and I see a 1 star review that says &amp;#34;burns like fire from a thousand suns&amp;#34; or something along those lines.  After I read that knew these were the drops I was looking for haha.  The reason I like them is because of the burn, and otherwise don&#x27;t use eye drops.  It&#x27;s a good icy burn...</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing - even better if you put it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> This really works great, though it stings in the beginning. Put it in a few minutes before you want to be seen :)</li>
            <li> Found these eye drops a few years back and have been hooked ever since. When I use Visine or other brands, it causes my tear ducts to become uncomfortable for about 30 minutes.... these do not have that affect. Sure, there is a slight burn (cooling effect) when you first put them in, but I am used to it at this point. Not to mention, once the cold subsides (about 30 seconds) my eyes feel amazing and like new. Best eye drops on the market if you ask me!</li>
            <li> I really like the &amp;#34;arctic cooling&amp;#34; feeling of these eye drops!  They really wake you up!  The best thing about the drops, of course, is that they get the redness out!  And really fast, too!  The bottle is a big improvement over the other eye drops out there.  The lid can be popped off instead of having to twist and turn to get it off, but the lid has never popped off accidentally.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> did not clear up my eyes.  bosch and lomb max redness relief is my pick</li>
            <li> GREATEST EYEDROPS I EVER USED, THEY REALLY WAKE UP MY EYES!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I like them too much. I don&#x27;t seem to find a reason for the eyes to need an arctic fresh feel, they have an uncomfortable burn for the first 30 seconds</li>
            <li> ooo how wonderful on my eyes, thanks</li>
            <li> Honestly... It&#x27;s like putting mouthwash in your eyes; not a pleasant feeling. They work sometimes (some redness would still stay.) Everyone is different though.</li>
            <li> These eye drops had to have been made in the fiery depths of Hell. They burn!!!! They burn so much you will probably make a pact with the Prince of Darkness himself just to make the pain stop. Arctic? Cooling? Uh, no. Not even close. Hell fire, folks. Hell. Fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you need to muster up some tears for an acting gig or something though, these would be great! Because you WILL have an abundance of tears when this liquid fire makes contact with your eyeballs.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I have chronic dry eye syndrome and this gets my eyes lubricated and feeling good every morning. It helps to wake me up too due to the cooling factor. I have tried the other variations by Rohto and this is the strongest in terms of cooling, which I love. These are much better than the Visine Extra Strength.&lt;br /&gt;Redness elimination A-&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication A&lt;br /&gt;Cooling A+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rohto cool which I like a lot. I thought I&#x27;d try this one and in my opinion it doesnt even compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably just throw this away because I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my eyes feel.</li>
            <li> really gets the red out! even though its very intense, they weren&#x27;t lying when they said &amp;#34;arctic freeze&amp;#34;</li>
