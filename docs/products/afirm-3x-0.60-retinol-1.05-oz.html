    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>Probably the best non-prescription cream.</li>
            <li>Great as a night cream!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>Truly a great product for skin!</li>
            <li>Afirm 3x 0.60 % Retinol is a great product!</li>
            <li>In addition, it does a wonderful job on wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I think this product is one of the best you can get without going to a prescription retinol.  </li>
            <li>Eventually I will switch to a prescription strength cream, but for the cost this is a very good product that will do a lot to help maintain your skin.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>A great product and delivery</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 months: it got rid of my freckles and reduced my pores but gave me more wrinkles!!</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>must be used with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be sure not to over do it with this product!</li>
            <li>Its nice when the ordering experience goes so well.  </li>
            <li>Effective.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best retinol cream on the market.</li>
            <li>nice healthy skin appeared.  </li>
            <li>It is great for keeping skin free of fine lines and a reducing pore size.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again.  </li>
            <li>Ordering for sure again</li>
            <li>So I continued and I love how my skin looks now</li>
            <li>There is no peeling of my skin which brings up better looking and textured skin with the Retin A.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>Oh, and when I get home and have something I can use to exfoliate my skin better, I&#x27;m going to begin doing so</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I may try it one more time,</li>
            <li>Better price than what I was using (and can no longer afford).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than using nothing...</li>
            <li>I am happy with my results so far.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, fast shipping, always available, easy to use, good size packaging, good brand name.</li>
            <li>I liked this item very much, but since I use it on my arms, hands, and chest as well as my face and neck</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sandiness is pretty much gone now and my skin kind of feels like it&#x27;s pulling for lack of a better term.  </li>
            <li>have reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>Be warned that it might make you break out more for the first month of use because it works by causing increased turn over of skin cells and that will bring buried impurities to the surface.  </li>
            <li>Not a problem though because it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have mild peeling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll return with review of the product but for now confidently recommend this seller, thanks so much!</li>
            <li>the 3X was really strong, but I had absolutely zero side effects.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and because it is the highest strength it was suggested I dilute with face cream 50/50 if my face became too sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference right away with 1x.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m outside most all day in the summer.  </li>
            <li>the first four or five days</li>
            <li>After the first week my skin was noticeably softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any type of retinol cream.</li>
            <li>Also use it at night because it will increase sun sensitivity at first.</li>
            <li>Not only did DermStore provide FREE shipping with the most competitive price of the product, it arrived exactly on time (early actually), well packed with free sample products.  </li>
            <li>I mix a small amount with a good moisturiser.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it is as good as they say it is.</li>
            <li>This has helped tremendously and my face is so soft and exfoliated but not irritated.</li>
            <li>and you will get beautiful smooth skin after about a month to 6 weeks of use at least every other day.  </li>
            <li>It is really working for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t try skin products like this very often.  </li>
            <li>But the recipient seems to enjoy it well enough.</li>
            <li>It worked as good if not better than rx .1 Tretinoins!</li>
            <li>It will make your skin peel and it will become very sensitive to the sun!</li>
            <li>Because since my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, most over the counter products I&#x27;ve tried in the past didn&#x27;t seem to make a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>The real truth will come in about 6 months, which is how long it would normally take going to the dermotoligist ...and you bypass their fees.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old, and people still think I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a retinol product, I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve waited so long.</li>
            <li>I guess that area is locally sensitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So all in all, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that this product is working as well as claimed and as well as</li>
            <li>I got no peeling action whatsoever from this product, which is what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>These scars are starting to gently peel.</li>
            <li>If you have never used a retinol cream before or have sensitive skin, start with the 1x.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or are just beginning to use retinol products, I would start with AFIRM 1x .15% Retinol or Afirm 2x .30% Retinol.</li>
            <li>keep using it and see since the retinol products are supposed to be a good alternative to expensive Retin A.</li>
            <li>Afirm apparently makes skin sensitive to the sun, so also use sun screen every morning.</li>
            <li>My skin never got red, just started to dry a little and top layer of skin flaked off and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to Retin A and not sure if this product is strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>start with lesser strength if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I just really wanted to see if this product really has any effect at all, and I can say that at least at this point, it seems to have.  </li>
            <li>More is not more!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> More is not more!!!</li>
            <li> And while I&#x27;ve been starting to get some small age spots recently, my skin isn&#x27;t really beat up or wrinkled to begin with,  </li>
            <li> I am 38 years old, don&#x27;t do any other wrinkle creams or anything</li>
            <li> A tiny amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Recommend you use facial scrub to wash away any dry skin cells.</li>
            <li> I had a slight burning sensation directly under my eyes....</li>
            <li> I use Afirm 3x 0.60 % Retinol every third night and alternate with other anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> I use it every other nights and just recently started to combine it with a vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; without potential interference from any other chemicals, and then apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and a half now, so I&#x27;ll have to update this after a month, but this is how I&#x27;m applying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying only small amounts to my forehead, cheeks, nose, under and around the outside corner of my eyes (not too close though).  </li>
            <li> I guess the Afirm itself makes my skin a little sensitive and the moisturizer irritates it a little.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a truly objective way to determine this, but my skin does seem a little smoother and the wrinkles don&#x27;t seem as pronounced.  </li>
            <li> A few months back, I bought the Philosophy retinol and it didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin.</li>
            <li> Like it&#x27;s tight or being stretched.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> i use it probably every other day.</li>
            <li> I have tried other retinol products.</li>
            <li> I have a slight itchiness that&#x27;s persisting though.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a slight burning sensation for about five minutes afterwards once I do.  </li>
            <li> After a few days I noticed a slight sandiness texture to my skin and that persisted until just a couple of days ago.  </li>
            <li> plan is that once I get through a few weeks of the twice a day thing, I&#x27;ll go to once a day.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for a few years.  </li>
            <li> but I use table sugar and olive to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!!</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was ever so slightly smoother looking, but after using it for three months, the change was extremely subtle for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Keeps pores small, for me.  </li>
            <li> Well they are staying not more than a week or so.</li>
            <li> I have very few wrinkles for my age.</li>
            <li> but I thought maybe I could give this product a try and stay ahead of the game so to speak.  </li>
            <li> These other products were terrible because they had pore clogging ingredients in them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, would not recommend.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> you can see the visible results on your face from using this product. will reorder.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months: it got rid of my freckles and reduced my pores but gave me more wrinkles!! Not worth it!!</li>
            <li> Its nice when the ordering experience goes so well.  Not only did DermStore provide FREE shipping with the most competitive price of the product, it arrived exactly on time (early actually), well packed with free sample products.  I&#x27;ll return with review of the product but for now confidently recommend this seller, thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and will never be without it.  I&#x27;m 52 years old, and people still think I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s.  Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I liked this item very much, but since I use it on my arms, hands, and chest as well as my face and neck it went rather rapidly and I could not afford to use it on a regular basis</li>
            <li> I feel the tingle when I used the prescription Retin A.  I love it and will buy it again.  Probably the best non-prescription cream.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the closest thing to a prescription strength retinol.  It is really working for my skin.  The real truth will come in about 6 months, which is how long it would normally take going to the dermotoligist ...and you bypass their fees. I am so happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> It works, but you have to stick to it in order to make a difference.  I can only use it in the winter, b/c I&#x27;m outside most all day in the summer.  But, it does work!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a retinol product, I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve waited so long. I have been using Afirm 3x for 3 days and already there is a drastic change in my skin&#x27;s texture... Ordering for sure again</li>
            <li> Effective.  A little goes a long way.  Hint....start with lesser strength if you have sensitive skin.  Recommend you use facial scrub to wash away any dry skin cells.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I went through the 1X and 2X before I landed on the 3X and I noticed a difference right away with 1x. So I continued and I love how my skin looks now, it reduced my pours and my skin feels tighter and smoother from before when I had acne scars/damage. I can never go back to life without this creme!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Wish they had not discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this product works. I don&#x27;t see a difference. I&#x27;m used to Retin A and not sure if this product is strong enough for me. There is no peeling of my skin which brings up better looking and textured skin with the Retin A.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it and see since the retinol products are supposed to be a good alternative to expensive Retin A.</li>
            <li> Great as a night cream! I use it every other nights and just recently started to combine it with a vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t try skin products like this very often.  Because since my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, most over the counter products I&#x27;ve tried in the past didn&#x27;t seem to make a noticeable difference.  So I was skeptical about this one going in, but the reviews were so glowing that I gave it a shot, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 56 and work offshore.  And while I&#x27;ve been starting to get some small age spots recently, my skin isn&#x27;t really beat up or wrinkled to begin with,  but I thought maybe I could give this product a try and stay ahead of the game so to speak.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and a half now, so I&#x27;ll have to update this after a month, but this is how I&#x27;m applying it and the results I&#x27;ve seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, after washing.  I&#x27;ve been applying only small amounts to my forehead, cheeks, nose, under and around the outside corner of my eyes (not too close though).  I&#x27;ve also been applying it to the backs of my hands.  I wait about 30 minutes in the hopes it&#x27;ll get started doing it&#x27;s &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; without potential interference from any other chemicals, and then apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first four or five days I had a slight burning sensation directly under my eyes....I guess that area is locally sensitive.  It stopped burning at all after that though and I can apply Afirm with no problem there now.  After a few days I noticed a slight sandiness texture to my skin and that persisted until just a couple of days ago.  So for about a week I noticed that feeling and even saw tiny flakes of skin peeling off in places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sandiness is pretty much gone now and my skin kind of feels like it&#x27;s pulling for lack of a better term.  Like it&#x27;s tight or being stretched.  Am I putting on weight?  Just kidding.  I have a slight itchiness that&#x27;s persisting though.  But I&#x27;m interpreting that as a sign that the product is still working.  I don&#x27;t have a truly objective way to determine this, but my skin does seem a little smoother and the wrinkles don&#x27;t seem as pronounced.  The spots I had though are noticeably fading though.  Also, even thought I wait about 30 minutes before applying the moisturizer, there&#x27;s a slight burning sensation for about five minutes afterwards once I do.  It&#x27;s just a feeling though as my skin doesn&#x27;t get red or anything.  I guess the Afirm itself makes my skin a little sensitive and the moisturizer irritates it a little.  Not a problem though because it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is that once I get through a few weeks of the twice a day thing, I&#x27;ll go to once a day.  I just really wanted to see if this product really has any effect at all, and I can say that at least at this point, it seems to have.  Oh, and when I get home and have something I can use to exfoliate my skin better, I&#x27;m going to begin doing so before I apply this.  But since I&#x27;m on an offshore rig as I write this, I don&#x27;t have access to anything to do so out here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that this product is working as well as claimed and as well as the user reviews say it does.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again when I&#x27;m done with this tube.</li>
            <li> I got no peeling action whatsoever from this product, which is what I was hoping for. I noticed my skin was ever so slightly smoother looking, but after using it for three months, the change was extremely subtle for the price I paid. Very disappointed, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few years.  I mix a small amount with a good moisturiser.  I have very few wrinkles for my age. Keeps pores small, for me.  Will always use this product.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a Christmas gift.  Have never personally used it.  But the recipient seems to enjoy it well enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they stopped making this!!! It worked as good if not better than rx .1 Tretinoins! Haven&#x27;t tried the 2x yet but based on 3x performance maybe I should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  given this product 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 weeks. After the first week my skin was noticeably softer and smoother. I&#x27;m African American and have some acne scar tissue that has been on my arms for years. These scars are starting to gently peel. I&#x27;ve also noticed the duration of acne and cysts on my face have reduced significantly. You know when you get those cysts that stay for weeks? Well they are staying not more than a week or so. That&#x27;s awesome! This is my first time using any type of retinol cream. I use it 6 days per week and it has not caused any irritation or outbreaks. Sometimes I have mild peeling but I use table sugar and olive to remove the dead skin. I am happy with my results so far. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> i use it probably every other day. helps control age spots and deeper wrinkle. must be used with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best retinol cream on the market. It comes in 3 strengths so you can work your way up to your desired level. It is great for keeping skin free of fine lines and a reducing pore size. A few months back, I bought the Philosophy retinol and it didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin. Once I got this in the mail and began using it again, my skins tone, texture, and color came back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure not to over do it with this product! More is not more!!! It will make your skin peel and it will become very sensitive to the sun! If you have never used a retinol cream before or have sensitive skin, start with the 1x.</li>
            <li> Truly a great product for skin! No lines or wrinkles yet and i&#x27;m almost 59! YAY! No peeling either..Hope it works like this forever!.</li>
            <li> Afirm 3x 0.60 % Retinol is a great product! I have tried other retinol products. These other products were terrible because they had pore clogging ingredients in them. If a retinol product contains pore clogging ingredients, it wipes out all the acne clearing benefits. Afirm 3x 0.60 % Retinol does not contain pore clogging ingredients. In addition, it does a wonderful job on wrinkles. However, Afirm 3x 0.60 % Retinol has the highest percentage of retinol of all the Afirm products offered. If you have sensitive skin or are just beginning to use retinol products, I would start with AFIRM 1x .15% Retinol or Afirm 2x .30% Retinol. I use Afirm 3x 0.60 % Retinol every third night and alternate with other anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> I love it. Good quality. i will recommend this product. Reasonable price, fast shipping, always available, easy to use, good size packaging, good brand name.</li>
            <li> I have recommended AFirm to friends and family. I use it nightly on face, hands, arms &amp; neck. This retinol product is an affordable alternative to a name brand retinal</li>
            <li> I love this product and because it is the highest strength it was suggested I dilute with face cream 50/50 if my face became too sensitive. This has helped tremendously and my face is so soft and exfoliated but not irritated. I would recommend people start at the Affirm 1x and move up to the 3x to reduce chances of irritation. I will never go back to Retin-A!</li>
            <li> I started with the 1X and worked my way up to the 3X.  That&#x27;s how I recommend using this product.  I&#x27;m a doctor and I think this product is one of the best you can get without going to a prescription retinol.  I&#x27;ve used this for the last 3 years.  I am 38 years old, don&#x27;t do any other wrinkle creams or anything and this is keeping me from looking my age.  Eventually I will switch to a prescription strength cream, but for the cost this is a very good product that will do a lot to help maintain your skin.  Be warned that it might make you break out more for the first month of use because it works by causing increased turn over of skin cells and that will bring buried impurities to the surface.  Stick with it and you will get beautiful smooth skin after about a month to 6 weeks of use at least every other day.  Also use it at night because it will increase sun sensitivity at first.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years in a routine started by my then dermatologist. Think it has made a difference in my facial skin, though I did research Retinol before starting. I do not use it every night.  Routine is every 4 nights with also use of glycolic acid (MD Forte Facial Cream) every 4 nights (for defoliation) and skin cream in between use of either Afirm or glycolic acid. Definitely do not use Afirm and glycolic acid together. Afirm apparently makes skin sensitive to the sun, so also use sun screen every morning.</li>
            <li> I used to get Retin A from my doctor, but ran out.  Afirm 3X does the same thing and the tube is much bigger.  A tiny amount goes a long way.  My skin never got red, just started to dry a little and top layer of skin flaked off and nice healthy skin appeared.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> A great product and delivery</li>
            <li> Not sure it is as good as they say it is. How can you tell?  I may try it one more time,</li>
            <li> Better price than what I was using (and can no longer afford).  But I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle drug.  It&#x27;s better than using nothing...but I&#x27;m not wowed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I kept reading hat the 3X was really strong, but I had absolutely zero side effects.  No redness or peeling whatsoever.  Everyone&#x27;s different I suppose.</li>
