    <ol>

            <li>I was also impressed with the size of the of the Mannequin head</li>
            <li>The best manikin I ever had!</li>
            <li>She was very happy to receive and was using while learning how to braid the hair mannequin.</li>
            <li>A great price too!</li>
            <li>Good choice for anyone who is licensing!</li>
            <li>This is a great dollhead for practicing styles and colors on.</li>
            <li>Great investment, I teach hair lessons for styling.</li>
            <li>This has been great practice for her.  </li>
            <li>This is a great mannequin for the price.</li>
            <li>The hair length is great for ponytails, braiding, plaits, and curling.</li>
            <li>The length of the hair is just great to create a hairstyle.</li>
            <li>It.met the need it was bought for and the quality of hair was great.</li>
            <li>This is a great mannequin for the price.  </li>
            <li>This head it better if you are doing weaveless styles, the way her head shape just doesn&#x27;t do the best with braids then tracks FOR ME.</li>
            <li>Great mannequin head, good quality.</li>
            <li>Good quality item.</li>
            <li>Ordered for my daughter who totally loved it.  </li>
            <li>and I think its a good purchase.</li>
            <li>The hair is of good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Good no complaints.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints, way better than the ones they have at my school perfect for everything totally worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I had to cut a good 4-5&amp;#34; off to make the hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>The hair is nice and shine.</li>
            <li>Have to say this mannequin is nicely made.</li>
            <li>The color is nice but hair has spitting ends.  </li>
            <li>it looks great, but isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>The real hair is wonderful and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Stay away from this product and invest in a more quality product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the hair itself is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be able to manage with her for the updo class</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s certainly better than the Clic mannequins I have leftover from cosmetology school.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Hair quality is ok.</li>
            <li>I got this one because it was a better price than the ones that was in the store.</li>
            <li>And my daughter also said the hair is better as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better then the heads I got from school</li>
            <li>The hair is an ideal length for braided styles as well as updos and the texture is extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>This is a much better choice.</li>
            <li>In order to get a nice full perimeter,I would have had to cut off 3-4 inches leaving the hair around sholder length.</li>
            <li>I wish the hair were thicker and plentiful, but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li>and I read the first couple reviews and thought this was goin to be a good buy</li>
            <li>It curls fairly easy.</li>
            <li>This mannequin head is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>but then again the price was cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working great for practicing updos and different styles!</li>
            <li>The hair is soft, easy to comb, and has a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>My daughter has had so much fun with this!  </li>
            <li>But it was true and got there 2 days after i ordered it.</li>
            <li>True to length.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This product appears to have a deep tan, however, this mannequin has very light skin and is Caucasian.</li>
            <li>I brought this for my daughter and it came just as expected she liked it ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected, a beautiful long haired mannequin!</li>
            <li>There was too many inconsistent lengths which made the blow dry very frizzy.</li>
            <li>It was already very course, as in a feeling overly processed way.</li>
            <li>She wants to get another one.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for the bargin price</li>
            <li>The hair feels almost real no bald spot or any nonsense</li>
            <li>It was better then I expected.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of other brands that are top quality</li>
            <li>I question if this is really human hair as many of the strands have turned white and feel like plastic.</li>
            <li>Decent product for the money.  </li>
            <li>She is 14 and would like to go to beauty school after high school.  </li>
            <li>Not what I expected definitely not 24&amp;#34; more like 18 doesn&#x27;t have much hair  </li>
            <li>Will serve the purpose for me buying it to practice on and learning new techniques.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft though.</li>
            <li>This is my second mannequin from this company in the hopes that the first was just an exception.</li>
            <li>I love the hair but the size of the head is smaller than my other mannequins.</li>
            <li>The hair is easy to comb, with little shedding.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mannequin head as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for my 10 year old and she loves it.</li>
            <li>this she is white and looks high and drunk good hair though.</li>
            <li>in all she&#x27;s a decent mannequin, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected .</li>
            <li>The head is overall good..minimal if any shedding, hair holds a curl and is pretty long.</li>
            <li>I spent over 1 hour &amp;#34;unmatting&amp;#34; it and lost more than half of the hair in the process!</li>

            <li> there is a lot of shorter hair mixed in with the long</li>
            <li> but the hair isn&#x27;t long enough.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it a higher rating, but the seller should know that the Mannequin was listened as 24 inches long, but the ends are very thin, so it is really about 20 inches long.  </li>
            <li> although technically 24&amp;#34; from front hairline to the end of the longest hairs down the back, by the time you get to those longest hairs there is only about 25 strands to speak of.</li>
            <li> The last time I washed the doll head it turned into a complete tangled mess!</li>
            <li> The length of the hair was long but was even.</li>
            <li> Long length</li>
            <li> Hair isn&#x27;t as long as pictured though</li>
            <li> Yes, the hair is pretty thin compared to the picture, but its just like any other manekin used in comso school, so obviously its workable and enough of the hair to cut and do hairstyles with.</li>
            <li> It was a Free &amp; limited time offer, so i was kinda skeptical about it thinking it was just someting the seller said to make ppl buy it.</li>
            <li> the hair length looks longer on the picture but only by a little shorter</li>
            <li> just as expected....... luv it &amp; will purchase again</li>
            <li> Would not hold an undo or basic round brushing.</li>
            <li> Not even 24&amp;#34; long its way less than that.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product and practice various styles, but was surprisingly disappointed upon using it.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for a student at Paul Mitchell Schools and the teachers and other students agreed...</li>
            <li> We were not very pleased with the mannequin head as the hair was thinner and shorter than we expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Not worth the 50 dollars</li>
            <li> The hair could be a little thicker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve styled the hair a few times and the hair texture has changed dramatically.</li>
            <li> She works with this head just about everyday.</li>
            <li> a few synthetic strands seem stuck in the mix and melted to my curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> Ive uploaded a few pictures of updos, to get an idea you can check it out on facebook/Instagram Goodlooks by Pia/</li>
            <li> The ends are dead and split and whatever I do to her</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> not full enough, very thin</li>
            <li> I like this manequin , the hair is a little thin</li>
            <li> I think the hair is a little thin</li>
            <li> if she were a client I&#x27;d recommend she have at least 3&amp;#34; cut off so that she didn&#x27;t look like she just emerged from a year in the wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The hair is very thin towards the ends and not fully 24&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
            <li> The ends were very thin.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the hair it is so thin one string may be the length it says</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Skin looks as though improperly attached at base.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comes out awful.</li>

            <li> This is my second mannequin from this company in the hopes that the first was just an exception. The quality is still unsatisfactory. Skin looks as though improperly attached at base. Disappointed. I will look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> How could I have lived before I had this doll head now I have some one to talk to who listens to me.</li>
            <li> This mannequin head is pretty nice. I purchased it because I wanted a different color head to practice weaves on. This head it better if you are doing weaveless styles, the way her head shape just doesn&#x27;t do the best with braids then tracks FOR ME. The head is overall good..minimal if any shedding, hair holds a curl and is pretty long.</li>
            <li> This is a great dollhead for practicing styles and colors on. The density of the hair varies from perimeter to crown, but it  is not inhibitive.</li>
            <li> Great investment, I teach hair lessons for styling. Perfect for this</li>
            <li> just as expected....... luv it &amp; will purchase again</li>
            <li> I like this manequin , the hair is a little thin but I like the ste, the hair color, and it arrived in great time !</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product and practice various styles, but was surprisingly disappointed upon using it. The hair is very thin towards the ends and not fully 24&amp;#34; as advertised. I&#x27;ve styled the hair a few times and the hair texture has changed dramatically. I question if this is really human hair as many of the strands have turned white and feel like plastic. The last time I washed the doll head it turned into a complete tangled mess! I spent over 1 hour &amp;#34;unmatting&amp;#34; it and lost more than half of the hair in the process! The hair has lost it&#x27;s luster and feels like broom straws. Stay away from this product and invest in a more quality product.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my daughter and it came just as expected she liked it ....the hair length looks longer on the picture but only by a little shorter</li>
            <li> My daughter has had so much fun with this!  She is 14 and would like to go to beauty school after high school.  This has been great practice for her.  Good quality item.</li>
            <li> The length of the hair was long but was even. There was too many inconsistent lengths which made the blow dry very frizzy. I had to cut a good 4-5&amp;#34; off to make the hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> The head came with hair thinned out on the ends. It was already very course, as in a feeling overly processed way. I tried to restore it with deep conditioning treatments but it didn&#x27;t help. I used this mannequin to practice color, which it suited that purpose well. I even used a hi lift color on it and it did work.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my daughter who totally loved it.  She works with this head just about everyday. She wants to get another one.</li>
            <li> Great mannequin head, good quality. Bought for a student in cosmetology school. I would recommend this product for students. .......</li>
            <li> Product arrived within 2 days as promised. It was a Free &amp; limited time offer, so i was kinda skeptical about it thinking it was just someting the seller said to make ppl buy it. But it was true and got there 2 days after i ordered it. The manekin looks like the Picture posted above. Yes, the hair is pretty thin compared to the picture, but its just like any other manekin used in comso school, so obviously its workable and enough of the hair to cut and do hairstyles with. So no complaints here. One thing though, i havent used any heat on it yet (hair straighteners, blow dryer, hair color etc.) so i cant say how well the hair reacts to heat yet. The hair is very soft though.</li>
            <li> This is a great mannequin for the price. I have used a lot of other brands that are top quality but they aren&#x27;t affordable. The quality and price of this one is perfect. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> although technically 24&amp;#34; from front hairline to the end of the longest hairs down the back, by the time you get to those longest hairs there is only about 25 strands to speak of. there is a lot of shorter hair mixed in with the long and it&#x27;s rather straggly looking. if she were a client I&#x27;d recommend she have at least 3&amp;#34; cut off so that she didn&#x27;t look like she just emerged from a year in the wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the hair itself is nice and smooth. I&#x27;d call it 99.9% human. a few synthetic strands seem stuck in the mix and melted to my curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all she&#x27;s a decent mannequin, especially for the price. I think I&#x27;ll be able to manage with her for the updo class I bought her for. she&#x27;s certainly better than the Clic mannequins I have leftover from cosmetology school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected . Perfect for practicing updos and haircuts. Long length so you can cut it a ton of times before it&#x27;s at Debbie&#x27;s length</li>
            <li> I purchased this mannequin with the intent to use it to practice and teach updos. The ends were very thin. In order to get a nice full perimeter,I would have had to cut off 3-4 inches leaving the hair around sholder length. I didn&#x27;t expect much for the bargin price but I was still dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the hair it is so thin one string may be the length it says</li>
            <li> Decent product for the money.  I wish the hair were thicker and plentiful, but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Not even 24&amp;#34; long its way less than that. The hair gets matted as soon as you spray water in it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the way the seller shipped out the product, I think it was at my door in 2 days.  I was also impressed with the size of the of the Mannequin head and I especially needed the human hair.  I would have given it a higher rating, but the seller should know that the Mannequin was listened as 24 inches long, but the ends are very thin, so it is really about 20 inches long.  Over all I please with my purchase.  It will meet my needs</li>
            <li> I purchased this mannequin head as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old daughter. She loves styling her hair. The hair length is great for ponytails, braiding, plaits, and curling. The hair is soft, easy to comb, and has a nice sheen. I think the hair is a little thin but she does not think it&#x27;s that noticeable. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Good choice for anyone who is licensing! The real hair is wonderful and easy to work with. And I appreciate the price!</li>
            <li> The hair is nice and shine. The length of the hair is just great to create a hairstyle. The best manikin I ever had!</li>
            <li> Its okay but doesn&#x27;t look Luke this she is white and looks high and drunk good hair though.</li>
            <li> I use it to practise updos. I like it a lot and I think its a good purchase. Ive uploaded a few pictures of updos, to get an idea you can check it out on facebook/Instagram Goodlooks by Pia/goodlooksbypia.&lt;br /&gt;All updos are made on this Mannequin.</li>
            <li> The hair could be a little thicker but then again the price was cheap.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift. She was very happy to receive and was using while learning how to braid the hair mannequin.</li>
            <li> The hair is of good quality. It curls fairly easy. The hair is easy to comb, with little shedding. I purchased this item for my 10 year old and she loves it. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> We were not very pleased with the mannequin head as the hair was thinner and shorter than we expected it to be.</li>
            <li> not full enough, very thin</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and wants to go to cosmetology school n a few years. Does anyone know if the mannequins hair can be washed?</li>
            <li> This product appears to have a deep tan, however, this mannequin has very light skin and is Caucasian.</li>
            <li> I ordered this last night at 6pm and got it this morning by 10am! The hair feels almost real no bald spot or any nonsense I have no complaints, way better than the ones they have at my school perfect for everything totally worth the price!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Good no complaints. Hair isn&#x27;t as long as pictured though</li>
            <li> I go to cosmetology school and I needed another mannequin and I read the first couple reviews and thought this was goin to be a good buy but I was wrong. The ends are dead and split and whatever I do to her it&#x27;s comes out awful. I do not recommend buying this mannequin it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Product as described.  Hair quality is ok.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected definitely not 24&amp;#34; more like 18 doesn&#x27;t have much hair  Not worth the 50 dollars</li>
            <li> I got this one because it was a better price than the ones that was in the store. And my daughter also said the hair is better as well. I would get this again if need be.</li>
            <li> It.met the need it was bought for and the quality of hair was great. I tried others and they did not compare.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected, a beautiful long haired mannequin! It&#x27;s been working great for practicing updos and different styles! A great price too!</li>
            <li> It was better then I expected. It&#x27;s better then the heads I got from school</li>
            <li> I love the hair but the size of the head is smaller than my other mannequins.</li>
            <li> This is a great mannequin for the price.  The hair is an ideal length for braided styles as well as updos and the texture is extremely soft.  Had to shampoo it to get rid of the wig hair smell but overall it&#x27;s a winner.  Purchased Whitney prior to this but the hair isn&#x27;t long enough.  This is a much better choice.</li>
            <li> Have to say this mannequin is nicely made. Will serve the purpose for me buying it to practice on and learning new techniques.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This was not 100% real human hair.  Would not hold an undo or basic round brushing. This was ordered for a student at Paul Mitchell Schools and the teachers and other students agreed...it looks great, but isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but hair has spitting ends.  True to length.</li>
