            <li>I wasn&#x27;t horribly impressed with these scissors.</li>
            <li>My 2 1/2-year-old looks great!</li>
            <li>Very good pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>If they were in good condition, they would have been perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>These are great scissors  </li>
            <li>Great scissors</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are an impressive pair of scissors that should stand up to many years of use.</li>
            <li>They are nice scissors, but they are not acceptable everywhere!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of like shearing a sheep!</li>
            <li>This is best scissors I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life for sure.</li>
            <li>This was a good price for Tweezerman brand this one made in Italy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good quality product.</li>
            <li>They are good</li>
            <li>so that was a good thing.</li>
            <li>Since it is a bit shorter than many sets, it is ideal for kid&#x27;s trims and to store for use in a kit or for road travel.</li>
            <li>It works well and needs time to prove whether it is good for long-term use.</li>
            <li>Bought a pair for my daughter&#x27;s birthday because she loved using my mom&#x27;s scissors.</li>
            <li>I liked the size and they cut very nice.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>These work perfectly and are just as good as the ones that cost 10 times as much.</li>
            <li>Cuts effectively, does the job.</li>
            <li>Usually, I love Tweezerman products, but these shears aren&#x27;t good at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been known to cut my own hair....</li>
            <li>I like these scissors because I wanted to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li>These scissors are okay, but they kind of hurt my fingers when I use them for a while.</li>
            <li>Great shears, they&#x27;re holding up beautifully, they did accumulate a bit of rust over the years (!)</li>
            <li>Came very quickly!</li>
            <li>Tweezerman anything is very good quality, this one in particular does not perform as well - seems to be a used item.</li>
            <li>For what they&#x27;re worth, they&#x27;re okay but not that great.</li>
            <li>These scissors are easy to handle and I am able to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li>These cut fine and are a good fit for my medium-size fingers.</li>
            <li>I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>was more defined with no noticeable splitting or rigidness.</li>
            <li>Mostly I am dissipated in Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>If your hands are small/normal, they should work OK.  </li>
            <li>Ok for the price.</li>
            <li>OK for trimming</li>
            <li>They would be better if they had like a rubber grip or something</li>
            <li>More information on this can be found on their website.</li>
            <li>probably OK.</li>
            <li>However it would be better if the sheers were longer</li>
            <li>I am planning on buying more for my daughters.</li>
            <li>Love these shears I went ahead</li>
            <li>A bit pricey though Im sure it will sell more if the price point was a bit lower.</li>
            <li>Pleased, gave as a gift to aspiring hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure what metal quality it is.</li>
            <li>These scissors were a nice weight and fit my hands well, except they were defective.  </li>
            <li>Time to find a better pair</li>
            <li>You really get quality shears for the price!!!!</li>
            <li>Very light and has an easy grip for arthritis hands.</li>
            <li>cut both my girls hair and it turned out pretty good.  </li>
            <li>, the fact that it is 5.5\\&quot;, it&#x27;s just perfect in my hand and not too long.</li>
            <li>These are high quality 5.5 shears very nice to use at home or for work.  </li>
            <li>It cuts well, but I need something more comfortable for my fingers.</li>
            <li>Would be ideal for facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that Tweezerman shears come with free lifetime sharpening, that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Fair priced, good brand, sharp and lightweight.</li>
            <li>These are pretty nice scissors.</li>
            <li>The best size for trimming hair; very very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Handles are comfortable.</li>
            <li>Peened is what the REALLY cheap scissor manufacturers do to hold the scissor adjustment correctly.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving these scissors, I found that my hands didn&#x27;t fit well in them at all.  </li>
            <li>The cut does not impress me that much and these kind of hurt my fingers before I am done with one haircut.</li>
            <li>My wife says they are really comfortable and cut well.</li>
            <li>but I cannot comfortably get my fingers into these scissors.  </li>
            <li>It is so light</li>
            <li>The quality is there though and for the price it&#x27;s worth a buy for most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is exceptional and they are packaged nicely in a folded sheet plastic box with a molded tray which can be used for storage if you are careful in opening and closing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Perfectly adequate for the intended purpose of some fine craft work.  </li>
            <li>glad they were not expensive.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find the exact ones any more.</li>
            <li>I also clean up around the edges and around his ears with these.</li>
            <li>so it is quick and accurate.</li>
            <li>My old scissors cut much better!</li>
            <li>Not quite good enough for haircutting.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and are great for light trimming.</li>
            <li>These are well suited for quick trims and haircuts at home.</li>
            <li>Our four year old has hair which is very easy to cut, so there&#x27;s no need for a \\&quot;formal\\&quot; haircut yet, and the youngest just needs the hair trimmed away from the eyes.  </li>
            <li>but overall very very pleased.</li>
            <li>and you get exactly the cut you want!).</li>
            <li>As I cut hair, the screw becomes more and more loose until it comes apart.</li>
            <li>This pair of scissors is great -- if you&#x27;re a little kid.  </li>
            <li>I already used them to trim my boyfriends hair and my own... would suggest them to anyone who needs some reliable hair scissors for an occasional trim.</li>
            <li>These are a nice addition to the 7-1/2&amp;#34; shears we also purchased from the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a great item, nice sharp cutting edges, worked great on our toddler who doesn&#x27;t hold still.  </li>
            <li>I have small-ish lady hands, and the handle holes are just right for me.</li>
            <li>The length is decent but I would have probably opted for a 7\\&quot; if available.</li>
            <li>These are great little shears!</li>
            <li>If you just need some small hair trimming shears, these are great.</li>
            <li>to trim my own split ends in between haircuts, because my hair was a bit damaged being that long.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you look into the Sally Hansen brand because clearly the Pakistanny&#x27;s know a tremendous more about scissors than the Chinese Twizzerman scissors.</li>
            <li>After over a year they are still in good condition and have stayed sharp!</li>
            <li>I buy those at a local drugstore in NYC Chinatown for $9.50 and they are far superior in terms of mechanism and the precision of the cut.</li>
            <li>Amazon did a great job shipping them among  many other items in one single package which arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27; tall and have fairly petite hands, and I found the thumb hole to be uncomfortably tight.</li>
            <li>They are a very nice quality with smooth precision cutting and an easy grip.</li>
            <li>They were okay for the money, but next time, I&#x27;ll make an in-person purchase.</li>
            <li>While these scissors are OK, they are not the same quality one expects from Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>My fingers are a bit larger than most</li>
            <li>of the reasons I purchased was that the manufacturer offers free lifetime sharpening of the product.</li>
            <li>That worked with my tiny hands :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I would rather have smaller and more nimble shears...</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m not the only one</li>
            <li>yet it is a struggle for me to quickly and comfortably fit my fingers through the tiny finger holders.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I do have larger fingers, but not that large.</li>
            <li>These scissors would be great for someone with very small fingers.</li>
            <li>They are nice and sharp and have the serrated edge.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>I needed a good pair of cutting shears, however did not want to spend a lot of money for a nice pair.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than what was on my old shears, but if they hold up as long and as well as my old ones, I will be happy!!</li>
            <li>These are the first hair shears I have bought, so I can&#x27;t really compare, but I like them.</li>
            <li>Also if you are a man and looking for a good mustache trimmer, the finger holes are way too small.</li>
            <li>I am a women and don&#x27;t have particularly large hands.  </li>
            <li>As others have noted, these are great quality and very sharp scissors (definitely not for children).  </li>
            <li>They are adjustable in that there is a screw at the hinge instead of a rivet, so if they should become loose after use, you should be able to tighten the screw.</li>
            <li>but now that I think about it, it&#x27;s probably better to have that grip then be too loose</li>
            <li>These seem like they are a pretty decent quality scissor</li>
            <li>They were very easy to use and perfectly sharp!</li>
            <li>I do NOT have huge hands, but I don&#x27;t have tiny hands either.</li>
            <li>I really thought that the 5 1/2 was the size of the blade portion.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!Shears came neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>I bought these shears because I am trying to grow my hair out, and every time i go in for a trim they cut too much hair off.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel is not magnetic.</li>
            <li>I expected better.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth to pay for return shipping, these are complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think I got the 2000 shears.  </li>
            <li>They did the job of cutting hair perfectly and were a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed.</li>
            <li>after 20 years I replaced my 5 1/2\\&quot; stainless sheers.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier for her.</li>
            <li>I have just started cutting my husbands hair with the price of haircuts these days and these work wonderful.</li>
            <li>My wife now cuts my hair using these stainless scissors.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really work at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that the other reviews pointed this out before I bought them.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure if I needed to buy an expensive set of shears to get the results I wanted, but I am surprised and pleased with these!</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and cut very precisely.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think an average man would be able to use these.  </li>
            <li>Good quality product for light weight trimming, cutting.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to have a decent set to trim my kid&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good quality set and should last a long time.</li>
            <li>There was a rusty streak on the inside of the blades, so they didn&#x27;t close smoothly, and the hinge was loose.  </li>
            <li>these are excellent affordable small scissors, I have owned a larger pair for 2 years and they are still sharp.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if i would use only these for my hair, but i do find them useful for the split end trims between my twice a year haircuts.</li>
            <li>Left my last excellent pair at our other home and just re-ordered the more expensive hair scissors from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to it, it feels more natural in your hand and you begin to notice it less.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as professional scissors but nice enough to trim hair with.</li>
            <li>They are as sharp now as they were when they arrived, but if i ever feel like they have dulled, tweezerman will sharpen them for free.</li>
            <li>Having that option helped me make up my mind when researching which shears to get, since i wouldn&#x27;t need to purchase new ones once these dulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I returned it since it is not acceptable for a new item to have defects.</li>
            <li>Wife cuts my hair and she said she loves these new shears.</li>
            <li>I will order a new pair from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Used to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair, it&#x27;s very sharp, cut and trim easily.</li>
            <li>I got these when I had super long hair (I have since cut 12 inches off!)</li>
            <li>The blade length is also pretty short, which for my purpose is all I need.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Tweezerman is a good brand and priced well, and not over priced like some of those so called high end shears.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old shears with the Tweezerman&#x27;s and when I received them found out they were the exact same shear</li>
            <li>The finger holes are clearly suited for female hands, though, so you if you have large sausage fingers, find another set than these.</li>
            <li>and I like them so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just checked all my old scissors and</li>
            <li>There is no way I&#x27;m letting these near my bangs.</li>
            <li>Not a joke, they are meant for a 10 year old.</li>
            <li>But spend the extra money for something that is actually stainless and designed for guys.</li>
            <li>Immediately after opening the package, I tried to trim my bangs - wow -</li>
            <li>Professional stylists stay away, this is not a shear to use on your clients hair.  </li>
            <li>and I do not always want to go to have my hair professionally trimmed.</li>
            <li>Great shears for trimming my fringe - they definitely get the job done and are sharp enough not to worry about uneven trimming.</li>
            <li>Sharp, lightweight and excellent for cutting my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I have to do very small amount at a time or else I would have to apply a bit more force to cut the hair.</li>
            <li>They work fine, but as others have noted, the finger holes are quite small.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female with pretty tiny hands anyway</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually okay with that; my disappointment was in how fast they lost their edge, and when I sent them back for a free re-sharpening they came back to me &amp;#34;Return to sender&amp;#34; -- apparently the place (in Houston, TX) doesn&#x27;t exist!</li>
            <li>Need something with a little more flow when I have limited time to work with them.</li>
            <li>keep the shears from becoming dull by keeping them in the package they came in when i dont use them.</li>
            <li>My only wish would be to make the finger holder a little larger (more of an annoyance then a useability issue).</li>
            <li>I mean again, these shears are very sharp, and do work good.</li>
            <li>It is sufficient for what I&#x27;m capable of doing at the moment, I&#x27;d opt for a bigger size in the future.</li>
            <li>However, to agree with previous reviews, the handle is very small, so you need small hands. :D</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty sharp</li>
            <li>They are definitely made for small fingers, but that&#x27;s not an issue for me! :)</li>
            <li>These are fine for my purposes, they are sharp, small for my small hands and seem to keep an edge through many uses.</li>
            <li>not as large as expected</li>
            <li>They lasted through 2 or 3 professional sharpenings and countless family hair cuts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that big hands for an adult, but</li>
            <li>Will probably order again although these are pretty solid and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Nice enough scissors, but the finger holes are way too small for the average man&#x27;s fingers.  </li>
            <li>you are a person with THIN fingers, then it&#x27;s an OK scissor.</li>
            <li>Maybe better for someone with thin fingers.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more (I am) and buy the Tweezerman shears with the black handles</li>
            <li>These get stuck easily and you have to work really hard to open and close them.</li>
            <li>Plus the package says stainless steel on one side and nickel plated on the other.</li>
            <li>They were dull right out of the package!</li>
            <li>Not only are these not sharp, but they were showing signs of rust within a week or so.</li>
            <li>Sharp and does a great job cutting hair.</li>
            <li>If I could do it over again, I&#x27;d pass on these small sciccors and spend a little more $ for the longer pair.  </li>
            <li>(a good pair of scissors is still less expensive than a hair cut in a salon</li>
            <li>They are easy to hold because of the small size and very sharp.</li>
            <li>I bought this item 2 years ago and it&#x27; still sharp and still looks new.</li>
            <li>Several reviews said the finger holes were really small, however I am a 6&#x27; female and have pretty large hands and didn&#x27;t have any trouble using them.</li>

            <li> This was a good price for Tweezerman brand this one made in Italy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a good quality product.</li>
            <li> They are good</li>
            <li> so that was a good thing.</li>
            <li> Since it is a bit shorter than many sets, it is ideal for kid&#x27;s trims and to store for use in a kit or for road travel.</li>
            <li> It works well and needs time to prove whether it is good for long-term use.</li>
            <li> Bought a pair for my daughter&#x27;s birthday because she loved using my mom&#x27;s scissors.</li>
            <li> I liked the size and they cut very nice.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly and are just as good as the ones that cost 10 times as much.</li>
            <li> Cuts effectively, does the job.</li>
            <li> Usually, I love Tweezerman products, but these shears aren&#x27;t good at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been known to cut my own hair....</li>
            <li> I like these scissors because I wanted to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> These scissors are okay, but they kind of hurt my fingers when I use them for a while.</li>
            <li> Great shears, they&#x27;re holding up beautifully, they did accumulate a bit of rust over the years (!)</li>
            <li> Came very quickly!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman anything is very good quality, this one in particular does not perform as well - seems to be a used item.</li>
            <li> For what they&#x27;re worth, they&#x27;re okay but not that great.</li>
            <li> These scissors are easy to handle and I am able to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> These cut fine and are a good fit for my medium-size fingers.</li>
            <li> I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> was more defined with no noticeable splitting or rigidness.</li>
            <li> Mostly I am dissipated in Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> If your hands are small/normal, they should work OK.  </li>
            <li> Ok for the price.</li>
            <li> OK for trimming</li>
            <li> They would be better if they had like a rubber grip or something</li>
            <li> More information on this can be found on their website.</li>
            <li> probably OK.</li>
            <li> However it would be better if the sheers were longer</li>
            <li> I am planning on buying more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> Love these shears I went ahead</li>
            <li> A bit pricey though Im sure it will sell more if the price point was a bit lower.</li>
            <li> Pleased, gave as a gift to aspiring hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure what metal quality it is.</li>
            <li> These scissors were a nice weight and fit my hands well, except they were defective.  </li>
            <li> Time to find a better pair</li>
            <li> You really get quality shears for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> Very light and has an easy grip for arthritis hands.</li>
            <li> cut both my girls hair and it turned out pretty good.  </li>
            <li> , the fact that it is 5.5\\&quot;, it&#x27;s just perfect in my hand and not too long.</li>
            <li> These are high quality 5.5 shears very nice to use at home or for work.  </li>
            <li> It cuts well, but I need something more comfortable for my fingers.</li>
            <li> Would be ideal for facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that Tweezerman shears come with free lifetime sharpening, that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Fair priced, good brand, sharp and lightweight.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice scissors.</li>
            <li> The best size for trimming hair; very very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Handles are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Peened is what the REALLY cheap scissor manufacturers do to hold the scissor adjustment correctly.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving these scissors, I found that my hands didn&#x27;t fit well in them at all.  </li>
            <li> The cut does not impress me that much and these kind of hurt my fingers before I am done with one haircut.</li>
            <li> My wife says they are really comfortable and cut well.</li>
            <li> but I cannot comfortably get my fingers into these scissors.  </li>
            <li> It is so light</li>
            <li> The quality is there though and for the price it&#x27;s worth a buy for most.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is exceptional and they are packaged nicely in a folded sheet plastic box with a molded tray which can be used for storage if you are careful in opening and closing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Perfectly adequate for the intended purpose of some fine craft work.  </li>
            <li> glad they were not expensive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the exact ones any more.</li>
            <li> I also clean up around the edges and around his ears with these.</li>
            <li> so it is quick and accurate.</li>
            <li> My old scissors cut much better!</li>
            <li> Not quite good enough for haircutting.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and are great for light trimming.</li>
            <li> These are well suited for quick trims and haircuts at home.</li>
            <li> Our four year old has hair which is very easy to cut, so there&#x27;s no need for a \\&quot;formal\\&quot; haircut yet, and the youngest just needs the hair trimmed away from the eyes.  </li>
            <li> but overall very very pleased.</li>
            <li> and you get exactly the cut you want!).</li>
            <li> As I cut hair, the screw becomes more and more loose until it comes apart.</li>
            <li> This pair of scissors is great -- if you&#x27;re a little kid.  </li>
            <li> I already used them to trim my boyfriends hair and my own... would suggest them to anyone who needs some reliable hair scissors for an occasional trim.</li>
            <li> These are a nice addition to the 7-1/2&amp;#34; shears we also purchased from the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a great item, nice sharp cutting edges, worked great on our toddler who doesn&#x27;t hold still.  </li>
            <li> I have small-ish lady hands, and the handle holes are just right for me.</li>
            <li> The length is decent but I would have probably opted for a 7\\&quot; if available.</li>
            <li> These are great little shears!</li>
            <li> If you just need some small hair trimming shears, these are great.</li>
            <li> to trim my own split ends in between haircuts, because my hair was a bit damaged being that long.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you look into the Sally Hansen brand because clearly the Pakistanny&#x27;s know a tremendous more about scissors than the Chinese Twizzerman scissors.</li>
            <li> After over a year they are still in good condition and have stayed sharp!</li>
            <li> I buy those at a local drugstore in NYC Chinatown for $9.50 and they are far superior in terms of mechanism and the precision of the cut.</li>
            <li> Amazon did a great job shipping them among  many other items in one single package which arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27; tall and have fairly petite hands, and I found the thumb hole to be uncomfortably tight.</li>
            <li> They are a very nice quality with smooth precision cutting and an easy grip.</li>
            <li> They were okay for the money, but next time, I&#x27;ll make an in-person purchase.</li>
            <li> While these scissors are OK, they are not the same quality one expects from Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> My fingers are a bit larger than most</li>
            <li> of the reasons I purchased was that the manufacturer offers free lifetime sharpening of the product.</li>
            <li> That worked with my tiny hands :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I would rather have smaller and more nimble shears...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m not the only one</li>
            <li> yet it is a struggle for me to quickly and comfortably fit my fingers through the tiny finger holders.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I do have larger fingers, but not that large.</li>
            <li> These scissors would be great for someone with very small fingers.</li>
            <li> They are nice and sharp and have the serrated edge.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> I needed a good pair of cutting shears, however did not want to spend a lot of money for a nice pair.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than what was on my old shears, but if they hold up as long and as well as my old ones, I will be happy!!</li>
            <li> These are the first hair shears I have bought, so I can&#x27;t really compare, but I like them.</li>
            <li> Also if you are a man and looking for a good mustache trimmer, the finger holes are way too small.</li>
            <li> I am a women and don&#x27;t have particularly large hands.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, these are great quality and very sharp scissors (definitely not for children).  </li>
            <li> They are adjustable in that there is a screw at the hinge instead of a rivet, so if they should become loose after use, you should be able to tighten the screw.</li>
            <li> but now that I think about it, it&#x27;s probably better to have that grip then be too loose</li>
            <li> These seem like they are a pretty decent quality scissor</li>
            <li> They were very easy to use and perfectly sharp!</li>
            <li> I do NOT have huge hands, but I don&#x27;t have tiny hands either.</li>
            <li> I really thought that the 5 1/2 was the size of the blade portion.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!Shears came neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> I bought these shears because I am trying to grow my hair out, and every time i go in for a trim they cut too much hair off.</li>
            <li> Stainless steel is not magnetic.</li>
            <li> I expected better.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth to pay for return shipping, these are complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think I got the 2000 shears.  </li>
            <li> They did the job of cutting hair perfectly and were a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> after 20 years I replaced my 5 1/2\\&quot; stainless sheers.</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier for her.</li>
            <li> I have just started cutting my husbands hair with the price of haircuts these days and these work wonderful.</li>
            <li> My wife now cuts my hair using these stainless scissors.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really work at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that the other reviews pointed this out before I bought them.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure if I needed to buy an expensive set of shears to get the results I wanted, but I am surprised and pleased with these!</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and cut very precisely.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think an average man would be able to use these.  </li>
            <li> Good quality product for light weight trimming, cutting.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to have a decent set to trim my kid&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good quality set and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> There was a rusty streak on the inside of the blades, so they didn&#x27;t close smoothly, and the hinge was loose.  </li>
            <li> these are excellent affordable small scissors, I have owned a larger pair for 2 years and they are still sharp.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if i would use only these for my hair, but i do find them useful for the split end trims between my twice a year haircuts.</li>
            <li> Left my last excellent pair at our other home and just re-ordered the more expensive hair scissors from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to it, it feels more natural in your hand and you begin to notice it less.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as professional scissors but nice enough to trim hair with.</li>
            <li> They are as sharp now as they were when they arrived, but if i ever feel like they have dulled, tweezerman will sharpen them for free.</li>
            <li> Having that option helped me make up my mind when researching which shears to get, since i wouldn&#x27;t need to purchase new ones once these dulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I returned it since it is not acceptable for a new item to have defects.</li>
            <li> Wife cuts my hair and she said she loves these new shears.</li>
            <li> I will order a new pair from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Used to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair, it&#x27;s very sharp, cut and trim easily.</li>
            <li> I got these when I had super long hair (I have since cut 12 inches off!)</li>
            <li> The blade length is also pretty short, which for my purpose is all I need.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Tweezerman is a good brand and priced well, and not over priced like some of those so called high end shears.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old shears with the Tweezerman&#x27;s and when I received them found out they were the exact same shear</li>
            <li> The finger holes are clearly suited for female hands, though, so you if you have large sausage fingers, find another set than these.</li>
            <li> and I like them so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just checked all my old scissors and</li>
            <li> There is no way I&#x27;m letting these near my bangs.</li>
            <li> Not a joke, they are meant for a 10 year old.</li>
            <li> But spend the extra money for something that is actually stainless and designed for guys.</li>
            <li> Immediately after opening the package, I tried to trim my bangs - wow -</li>
            <li> Professional stylists stay away, this is not a shear to use on your clients hair.  </li>
            <li> and I do not always want to go to have my hair professionally trimmed.</li>
            <li> Great shears for trimming my fringe - they definitely get the job done and are sharp enough not to worry about uneven trimming.</li>
            <li> Sharp, lightweight and excellent for cutting my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have to do very small amount at a time or else I would have to apply a bit more force to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> They work fine, but as others have noted, the finger holes are quite small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female with pretty tiny hands anyway</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually okay with that; my disappointment was in how fast they lost their edge, and when I sent them back for a free re-sharpening they came back to me &amp;#34;Return to sender&amp;#34; -- apparently the place (in Houston, TX) doesn&#x27;t exist!</li>
            <li> Need something with a little more flow when I have limited time to work with them.</li>
            <li> keep the shears from becoming dull by keeping them in the package they came in when i dont use them.</li>
            <li> My only wish would be to make the finger holder a little larger (more of an annoyance then a useability issue).</li>
            <li> I mean again, these shears are very sharp, and do work good.</li>
            <li> It is sufficient for what I&#x27;m capable of doing at the moment, I&#x27;d opt for a bigger size in the future.</li>
            <li> However, to agree with previous reviews, the handle is very small, so you need small hands. :D</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty sharp</li>
            <li> They are definitely made for small fingers, but that&#x27;s not an issue for me! :)</li>
            <li> These are fine for my purposes, they are sharp, small for my small hands and seem to keep an edge through many uses.</li>
            <li> not as large as expected</li>
            <li> They lasted through 2 or 3 professional sharpenings and countless family hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that big hands for an adult, but</li>
            <li> Will probably order again although these are pretty solid and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice enough scissors, but the finger holes are way too small for the average man&#x27;s fingers.  </li>
            <li> you are a person with THIN fingers, then it&#x27;s an OK scissor.</li>
            <li> Maybe better for someone with thin fingers.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more (I am) and buy the Tweezerman shears with the black handles</li>
            <li> These get stuck easily and you have to work really hard to open and close them.</li>
            <li> Plus the package says stainless steel on one side and nickel plated on the other.</li>
            <li> They were dull right out of the package!</li>
            <li> Not only are these not sharp, but they were showing signs of rust within a week or so.</li>
            <li> Sharp and does a great job cutting hair.</li>
            <li> If I could do it over again, I&#x27;d pass on these small sciccors and spend a little more $ for the longer pair.  </li>
            <li> (a good pair of scissors is still less expensive than a hair cut in a salon</li>
            <li> They are easy to hold because of the small size and very sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought this item 2 years ago and it&#x27; still sharp and still looks new.</li>
            <li> Several reviews said the finger holes were really small, however I am a 6&#x27; female and have pretty large hands and didn&#x27;t have any trouble using them.</li>
            <li> Also, I could see a small sliver of space in between the blades when they were together, making me think they aren&#x27;t that great for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> No adult on earth could possibly get a finger in that hole.</li>
            <li> The holes are fairly small, but my average size fingers fit well inside without slipping.  </li>
            <li> As many other reviews stated, these are small scissors with small finger holes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a few months and they still cut like new.  </li>
            <li> I have to tighten it several times in a single sitting.</li>
            <li> so you could not see the extreme low quality on the back.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult contolling these when your fingers dont fit well.</li>
            <li> But the item was smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is they are beginning to spot rust after minimal use, sitting in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not pros, just trying to save money long term.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> As other have stated beware of the finger holes as they are small --- i do not have particularly large hands or fingers</li>
            <li> I have large hands, and the fit is really annoying.  </li>
            <li> This product was obviously made for smaller hands and the blades are a little thicker that the Revlon shears.</li>
            <li> So for what it&#x27;s worth, they&#x27;re useless on a beard unless you have a tiny woman trimming it for you.</li>
            <li> a single hitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finger holes were a little bit small for my large arthritic joints.</li>
            <li> bought these to do hair trimming but found them to be sized too small for adult hands and finger.</li>
            <li> We have a bunch of other scissors in the house, but after using these, I can&#x27;t go back to using any other pair.</li>
            <li> I think a barber or hair stylist would get fatigued cutting hair with these-I couldn&#x27;t imagine using these all day but for limited use I think they are fine.</li>
            <li> I received the Stainless 2000 shears and have found them to be very dull.  </li>
            <li> I have previously purchased hair shears from Tweezerman and they worked like a dream — sharp, precise, very fluid cutting motion.</li>
            <li> you gotta be careful with it when you use&lt;</li>
            <li> People with bigger fingers should consider another choice as they  are very tight.</li>
            <li> not much to say other that it works and does not rust and stays sharp does what I bought it for</li>
            <li> The thumb finger hole is to small and the seller provided ONLY a front photo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had others that stayed sharp longer too.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit weird to handle at first, b/c</li>
            <li> and I would buy other products from them.</li>
            <li> , the holes are too small for larger fingers.</li>
            <li> They did seem sharp, but I return them anyway.</li>
            <li> Sharp, and a warranty/free sharpening to keep them sharp.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The finger holes are small so not a good pair if you have large hands.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, but not stainless.</li>
            <li> My wife can barely fit her fingers in the holes and it would be impossible for me.</li>
            <li> I should mention i have thin curly hair, so individuals with different hair type might experience a different result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth it when trying to cut my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> they cut about half the time and just tug and pull at the hair the other half.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the handle is VERY small.</li>
            <li> However, it was very sharp.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are very sharp and appear to be well made.  </li>
            <li> they are very, very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, basically what they use at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem very sharp.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp.</li>
            <li> The rings on handles are really small, my (small size) fingers sometimes got stuck, it might be quite a challenge for larger hand/fingers.</li>
            <li> The cost of professional shears are very expensive these shears do the same job at a way less price.</li>
            <li> The cutting action is a little stiff but works well enough.</li>
            <li> and they can be a little tight in the fingers</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size of the small finger hole.</li>
            <li> Even my little finger was a squeeze to get purchase.</li>
            <li> A little smallish</li>
            <li> These are very hard to work - have to use two hands to open and close them.</li>
            <li> They come loose, cut badly and the label says stainless steel</li>
            <li> We purchased a few pairs of these because we can never find hair scissors when we need them.</li>
            <li> These scissors are not worth $2 let alone $20 plus excessive shipping charges.</li>
            <li> Frustrating and totally preventable if someone was managing quality control.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted some scissors to cut her bangs and dead ends.  </li>
            <li> I guess, therefore, it is not easy to handle for me.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not sharp and like the nail clipper I have from them they are useless in no time.</li>
            <li> They are so small.</li>
            <li> The finger holes are really small.</li>
            <li> the product appears to be well made but is designed for extremly small hands</li>
            <li> Maybe it can be considered small, but for me it&#x27;s all that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Small finger holes</li>
            <li> The handle holes would be too small for my husband to use.</li>
            <li> What is not okay is the screw that holds both scissor pieces together.</li>
            <li> These were small but efficient.</li>
            <li> I bought these small shears because I knew they would be allowed by TSA regulations.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what the advantage is for having these shorter pair of scissors either.</li>
            <li> While some may prefer longer shears, I prefer to cut  small amount of hair at each snip so</li>
            <li> Way too small fingerholes.  </li>
            <li> But they are a bit on the small side.  </li>
            <li> Too small for finger.</li>
            <li> Just as others have said, these shears are really small.</li>
            <li> The holes for the fingers were extremely small.  </li>
            <li> but I have had various different scissors and hate each and everyone of them on day 1.  </li>
            <li> I usually pre-cut his hair before I switch to clippers because it&#x27;s thick, dense and curly...</li>
            <li> The blades are horrific and get stuck easily when they come together.</li>
            <li> Ordered expecting Tweezerman shears as listed in the title, received package today with DULL shears made from Pakistan.</li>
            <li> bought this one for the sole purpose of cutting my girls&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time using these as the finger holes are very small.  </li>
            <li> After a few cuts, the bad fit became really annoying.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking a professional level hair shears, don&#x27;t buy these, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> not ONE of them has holes that are too small.&lt;br /&gt;THIS SUCKS!</li>
            <li> Finger holes small and difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> not good scissors poor quality do not buy</li>
            <li> It could have been that the shears were exposed to moisture or poor manufacturing.    </li>
            <li> Poor quality at this price point.  </li>
            <li> Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> This is false branding.</li>
            <li> I have normal-size hands for a woman (wedding ring is size 6), and these are uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this is what a scissor is supposed to be like.. cutting things without frustrating the user</li>
            <li> Scissor pivot point in an awkward  location.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife since she does all of the hair cutting and trimming in our family.</li>
            <li> I always end up getting roped into cutting my sons hair.</li>
            <li> Use for hair cutting</li>
            <li> I purchased these for at home cutting.</li>
            <li> I have been sharpening and adjusting scissors for 20 years and these Twizzerman scissors are the worst scissors I have ever received.</li>
            <li> These scissors are awful!</li>
            <li> (I thought paying someone $20 for them to snip 4 times was a bit outrageous, not to mention the tip they expect you to</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works well. I use it to cut my dogs fur as the do not like the clippers.</li>
            <li> As many other reviews stated, these are small scissors with small finger holes. I&#x27;m actually okay with that; my disappointment was in how fast they lost their edge, and when I sent them back for a free re-sharpening they came back to me &amp;#34;Return to sender&amp;#34; -- apparently the place (in Houston, TX) doesn&#x27;t exist!</li>
            <li> We purchased a few pairs of these because we can never find hair scissors when we need them. After over a year they are still in good condition and have stayed sharp!</li>
            <li> Perfectly adequate for the intended purpose of some fine craft work.  I am fully satisfied. The finger holes are clearly suited for female hands, though, so you if you have large sausage fingers, find another set than these.</li>
            <li> they cut about half the time and just tug and pull at the hair the other half. glad they were not expensive.</li>
            <li> They are so small. I really thought that the 5 1/2 was the size of the blade portion. The finger holes are really small. I returned them and order the 7inch shears. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Tweezerman is a good brand and priced well, and not over priced like some of those so called high end shears.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t do fancy haircutting, this is for home use, so take the review for what it is.  Great shears, they&#x27;re holding up beautifully, they did accumulate a bit of rust over the years (!) but overall very very pleased.</li>
            <li> These scissors would be great for someone with very small fingers. My wife can barely fit her fingers in the holes and it would be impossible for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!Shears came neatly packaged. They are very sharp and are great for light trimming. Handles are comfortable. I love the fact that Tweezerman shears come with free lifetime sharpening, that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I think I got a returned pair.  They were okay for the money, but next time, I&#x27;ll make an in-person purchase.</li>
            <li> Nothing else to say about those scissors, they do their job well!  People with bigger fingers should consider another choice as they  are very tight. Amazon did a great job shipping them among  many other items in one single package which arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> I bought these shears because I am trying to grow my hair out, and every time i go in for a trim they cut too much hair off. So my solution was these shears, which i use to trim my slit ends and let my hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;I keep the shears from becoming dull by keeping them in the package they came in when i dont use them. They are as sharp now as they were when they arrived, but if i ever feel like they have dulled, tweezerman will sharpen them for free. Having that option helped me make up my mind when researching which shears to get, since i wouldn&#x27;t need to purchase new ones once these dulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i compared the hair stand cut with these shears and one cut with regular scissors, the strand cut with scissors had a rigid/spliting end while the strand cut with these shears was more defined with no noticeable splitting or rigidness. I should mention i have thin curly hair, so individuals with different hair type might experience a different result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if i would use only these for my hair, but i do find them useful for the split end trims between my twice a year haircuts.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, these are great quality and very sharp scissors (definitely not for children).  My only wish would be to make the finger holder a little larger (more of an annoyance then a useability issue).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how tiny they were - couldn&#x27;t stick my fingers through the holes. Guess I&#x27;ll see if the wife can use them.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly! I use these all the time to trim split ends and even cut my bangs with them. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> These seem like they are a pretty decent quality scissor and I like them so far. The only thing is that the handle is VERY small. I&#x27;m a female with pretty tiny hands anyway so it isn&#x27;t a problem for me but I could definitely see the handle size being an issue for somebody with larger hands (especially any guys hoping to use these).</li>
            <li> bought these to do hair trimming but found them to be sized too small for adult hands and finger. the product appears to be well made but is designed for extremly small hands</li>
            <li> Maybe it can be considered small, but for me it&#x27;s all that I wanted. Fair priced, good brand, sharp and lightweight. I only use it for trimming my bangs to save some weeks before returning to the salon.</li>
            <li> one of the blades were not properly nickel plated.  this resulted in the edge and the surface at the point of the shears to be stained / rusted.    It could have been that the shears were exposed to moisture or poor manufacturing.    However, it was very sharp.  I returned it since it is not acceptable for a new item to have defects.</li>
            <li> I have been sharpening and adjusting scissors for 20 years and these Twizzerman scissors are the worst scissors I have ever received. The screw that holds them together has no locking point on them nor are they peened. Peened is what the REALLY cheap scissor manufacturers do to hold the scissor adjustment correctly. $20 scissors have a lock nut or tapered threads to ensure stability. Twizzerman scissors DO NOT HAVE ANY of that. They come loose, cut badly and the label says stainless steel but the scissors are magnetic. Stainless steel is not magnetic. Plus the package says stainless steel on one side and nickel plated on the other. The manufacturer does not even know what they are making or selling. The thumb finger hole is to small and the seller provided ONLY a front photo so you could not see the extreme low quality on the back. These scissors are not worth $2 let alone $20 plus excessive shipping charges. I strongly recommend you look into the Sally Hansen brand because clearly the Pakistanny&#x27;s know a tremendous more about scissors than the Chinese Twizzerman scissors.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how a company can manufacture this scissor. I have NO IDEA where they got their dimmensions for the finger holes on this scissor.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a person with THIN fingers, then it&#x27;s an OK scissor. I do NOT have huge hands, but I don&#x27;t have tiny hands either. I&#x27;ve just checked all my old scissors and not ONE of them has holes that are too small.&lt;br /&gt;THIS SUCKS!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work all that well for people with thicker hair.  I have to do very small amount at a time or else I would have to apply a bit more force to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> While these scissors are OK, they are not the same quality one expects from Tweezerman.  I have purchased similar scissors from the Korean Brand \\&quot;Denco\\&quot;.  Some of their products are listed on Amazon but not the hair scissors.  I buy those at a local drugstore in NYC Chinatown for $9.50 and they are far superior in terms of mechanism and the precision of the cut.</li>
            <li> Poor quality at this price point.  Finger holes small and difficult to use.  Scissor pivot point in an awkward  location.  Mostly I am dissipated in Tweezerman.  I expected better.  Instead if using the for hair grooming, these go to my garage for shop work.</li>
            <li> I needed a good pair of cutting shears, however did not want to spend a lot of money for a nice pair. I liked the size and they cut very nice. I would recommend these to others.</li>
            <li> Ordered expecting Tweezerman shears as listed in the title, received package today with DULL shears made from Pakistan. Not even worth to pay for return shipping, these are complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> My fingers are a bit larger than most I guess, therefore, it is not easy to handle for me.  It cuts well, but I need something more comfortable for my fingers.</li>
            <li> Ordered these to replace scissors that I have used for years to trim hair &amp; beard. They were dull right out of the package! My old scissors cut much better!</li>
            <li> I have had these for two haircuts and the scissors already are feeling friction when i open an shut them</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend buying these shears. You really get quality shears for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price. Several reviews said the finger holes were really small, however I am a 6&#x27; female and have pretty large hands and didn&#x27;t have any trouble using them. I already used them to trim my boyfriends hair and my own... would suggest them to anyone who needs some reliable hair scissors for an occasional trim.</li>
            <li> Good quality product for light weight trimming, cutting. But the item was smaller than what I expected. I uploaded an image if anyone need a quantitative estimate rather than just saying  \\&quot;small\\&quot;.  Please check the customer uploaded images.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think I got the 2000 shears.  This was a good price for Tweezerman brand this one made in Italy.  They are nice and sharp and have the serrated edge.  Small finger holes but I can manage to use them.  Maybe better for someone with thin fingers.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving these scissors, I found that my hands didn&#x27;t fit well in them at all.  After a few cuts, the bad fit became really annoying.  If your hands are small/normal, they should work OK.  I have large hands, and the fit is really annoying.  I will be looking for another pair with larger finger/thumb holes.</li>
            <li> Used to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair, it&#x27;s very sharp, cut and trim easily. The rings on handles are really small, my (small size) fingers sometimes got stuck, it might be quite a challenge for larger hand/fingers. It&#x27;s definitely a good quality product. It is sufficient for what I&#x27;m capable of doing at the moment, I&#x27;d opt for a bigger size in the future.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice scissors. The one flaw, and it&#x27;s a big one for me, is the finger holes are sized for a tiny woman or a kid. Not man-sized at all. So for what it&#x27;s worth, they&#x27;re useless on a beard unless you have a tiny woman trimming it for you.</li>
            <li> Ok for the price. Not quite good enough for haircutting. OK for trimming</li>
            <li> These scissors are okay, but they kind of hurt my fingers when I use them for a while. They would be better if they had like a rubber grip or something so they don&#x27;t dig into my fingers.</li>
            <li> Very light and has an easy grip for arthritis hands. Cuts effectively, does the job. The scissor is not too big.</li>
            <li> They are pretty small. I&#x27;m glad that the other reviews pointed this out before I bought them. I have small-ish lady hands, and the handle holes are just right for me. The handle holes would be too small for my husband to use. The blade length is also pretty short, which for my purpose is all I need. If you just need some small hair trimming shears, these are great. If you are looking a professional level hair shears, don&#x27;t buy these, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These scissors are awful! I have previously purchased hair shears from Tweezerman and they worked like a dream — sharp, precise, very fluid cutting motion. These get stuck easily and you have to work really hard to open and close them. The blades are horrific and get stuck easily when they come together. There is no way I&#x27;m letting these near my bangs.</li>
            <li> These cut fine and are a good fit for my medium-size fingers. What is not okay is the screw that holds both scissor pieces together. As I cut hair, the screw becomes more and more loose until it comes apart. I have to tighten it several times in a single sitting. Frustrating and totally preventable if someone was managing quality control. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> The cut does not impress me that much and these kind of hurt my fingers before I am done with one haircut.</li>
            <li> Ok, I do have larger fingers, but not that large. My ring size is about 6. I can not get my fingers in these! Not a joke, they are meant for a 10 year old.</li>
            <li> The scissors are very sharp and appear to be well made.  They did the job of cutting hair perfectly and were a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife since she does all of the hair cutting and trimming in our family. Retired now are her plastic-handled cheapos bought from a local discount store that didn&#x27;t cut all that well and wound up causing her hands to cramp and become tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are an impressive pair of scissors that should stand up to many years of use. They are adjustable in that there is a screw at the hinge instead of a rivet, so if they should become loose after use, you should be able to tighten the screw. My wife says they are really comfortable and cut well. These are a nice addition to the 7-1/2&amp;#34; shears we also purchased from the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is exceptional and they are packaged nicely in a folded sheet plastic box with a molded tray which can be used for storage if you are careful in opening and closing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I purchased was that the manufacturer offers free lifetime sharpening of the product. More information on this can be found on their website. It appears that the only cost to you would be the shipping to get the product to them. They also have a &amp;#34;sharpening tracker&amp;#34; that will send out email updates as they process your product for service.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted some scissors to cut her bangs and dead ends.  These were small but efficient.</li>
            <li> I bought these small shears because I knew they would be allowed by TSA regulations. They are nice scissors, but they are not acceptable everywhere! On my return from a recent trip to Quito, Ecuador, the security agent at the Quito airport took them away, insisting that by Ecuador rules, they are a potential weapon.</li>
            <li> Not only are these not sharp, but they were showing signs of rust within a week or so. Don&#x27;t bother spending your money on these.</li>
            <li> They work fine, but as others have noted, the finger holes are quite small.  I have normal-size hands for a woman (wedding ring is size 6), and these are uncomfortable to use.  I&#x27;ve had others that stayed sharp longer too.</li>
            <li> not much to say other that it works and does not rust and stays sharp does what I bought it for</li>
            <li> Tweezerman anything is very good quality, this one in particular does not perform as well - seems to be a used item.</li>
            <li> I use these shears all the time.  They are good</li>
            <li> The shears are advertised as tweezerman but they are generic shears labeled ss Pakistan. This is false branding. I didn&#x27;t try them out</li>
            <li> Very disapointed. Buyer beware. They are very sharp, but not stainless. Within a week I have seen signs of rust. Also if you are a man and looking for a good mustache trimmer, the finger holes are way too small. I mean again, these shears are very sharp, and do work good. But spend the extra money for something that is actually stainless and designed for guys.</li>
            <li> Best Shears I Have Owned For The Price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item 2 years ago and it&#x27; still sharp and still looks new.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly and are just as good as the ones that cost 10 times as much. They already paid for themselves several times over by not having to go pay 15 to 20 dollars for haircuts.</li>
            <li> That worked with my tiny hands :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty sharp you gotta be careful with it when you use&lt;br /&gt;It was okay&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice enough scissors, but the finger holes are way too small for the average man&#x27;s fingers.  I had to give them to my wife and go back out on the hunt for a pair with bigger grips I can use for mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> We purchased these because I cut my husbands hair myself. They are a very nice quality with smooth precision cutting and an easy grip. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are the first hair shears I have bought, so I can&#x27;t really compare, but I like them. And I have tiny hands, so I don&#x27;t have the thumb-fitting problems others report. I would rather have smaller and more nimble shears... Have used them twice already.</li>
            <li> after 20 years I replaced my 5 1/2\\&quot; stainless sheers. They lasted through 2 or 3 professional sharpenings and countless family hair cuts. I replaced my old shears with the Tweezerman&#x27;s and when I received them found out they were the exact same shear so that was a good thing. My only complaint is the size of the small finger hole. It is smaller than what was on my old shears, but if they hold up as long and as well as my old ones, I will be happy!!</li>
            <li> I do not have big hands but I cannot comfortably get my fingers into these scissors.  I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great product. Item as described.</li>
            <li> Wife cuts my hair and she said she loves these new shears. Makes it so much easier for her.</li>
            <li> These scissors cut hair well. The only issue I have is they are beginning to spot rust after minimal use, sitting in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> These are well suited for quick trims and haircuts at home. It can be a bit weird to handle at first, b/c the finger holes are not the same. Once you get used to it, it feels more natural in your hand and you begin to notice it less. Since it is a bit shorter than many sets, it is ideal for kid&#x27;s trims and to store for use in a kit or for road travel. Overall, a good quality set and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I recommend this and I would buy other products from them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to have a decent set to trim my kid&#x27;s hair.  Our four year old has hair which is very easy to cut, so there&#x27;s no need for a \\&quot;formal\\&quot; haircut yet, and the youngest just needs the hair trimmed away from the eyes.  One caution- they are very, very sharp.  Would be ideal for facial hair.  I&#x27;d recommend these shears.</li>
            <li> these are excellent affordable small scissors, I have owned a larger pair for 2 years and they are still sharp.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure if I needed to buy an expensive set of shears to get the results I wanted, but I am surprised and pleased with these! Not bad for the price and they work great. However, to agree with previous reviews, the handle is very small, so you need small hands. :D</li>
            <li> Very good pair of scissors. Perfect size for trimming details.</li>
            <li> They may cut alright, but I&#x27;ll never know. No adult on earth could possibly get a finger in that hole. Even my little finger was a squeeze to get purchase. Poorly designed. Not for humans.</li>
            <li> These are great touch up scissors for sideburns or a beard!</li>
            <li> For what they&#x27;re worth, they&#x27;re okay but not that great. Not as sharp as professional scissors but nice enough to trim hair with.</li>
            <li> These are high quality 5.5 shears very nice to use at home or for work.  I have just started cutting my husbands hair with the price of haircuts these days and these work wonderful.</li>
            <li> My wife now cuts my hair using these stainless scissors.  We&#x27;re not pros, just trying to save money long term.  These work perfect for her.  Very sharp, basically what they use at the salon.  FYI though, if you&#x27;re a guy and you&#x27;re buying these for yourself to use, the holes are too small for larger fingers.</li>
            <li> Years ago I borrowed my wife&#x27;s Revlon shears that looked just like this product for mustache and hair trimming. Can&#x27;t find the exact ones any more. Ordered this one because of the similarities.This product was obviously made for smaller hands and the blades are a little thicker that the Revlon shears. I&#x27;ll have to keep looking. This product may be 5 stars for a girl but only 3 stars for me.</li>
            <li> As other have stated beware of the finger holes as they are small --- i do not have particularly large hands or fingers but it&#x27;s difficult contolling these when your fingers dont fit well.No issues with the quality or them being sharp--they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More slender ladies hands or younger adults--probably OK.</li>
            <li> not as large as expected</li>
            <li> I ordered these shears to cut my dog&#x27;s fur.  They are very sharp and cut very precisely.  I&#x27;ve had them for a few months and they still cut like new.  The holes are fairly small, but my average size fingers fit well inside without slipping.  We have a bunch of other scissors in the house, but after using these, I can&#x27;t go back to using any other pair.</li>
            <li> He comprado esta tijera para mi hermana que tiene un perrito toy y dice que puede peluquiarle muy bien. Según ella recomienda este producto y yo recomiendo al vendedor que ha cumplido al pie de la letra lo pautado.</li>
            <li> I got these when I had super long hair (I have since cut 12 inches off!) to trim my own split ends in between haircuts, because my hair was a bit damaged being that long. I wasn&#x27;t horribly impressed with these scissors. I wish they were a bit sharper. Also, I could see a small sliver of space in between the blades when they were together, making me think they aren&#x27;t that great for cutting hair. I probably would not purchase these again, but they do work and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> These are very hard to work - have to use two hands to open and close them. Not worth it when trying to cut my children&#x27;s hair. Need something with a little more flow when I have limited time to work with them.</li>
            <li> It fits in my fingers well however someone else may find them a bit smaller than they think. It works well and needs time to prove whether it is good for long-term use.</li>
            <li> I received the Stainless 2000 shears and have found them to be very dull.  Usually, I love Tweezerman products, but these shears aren&#x27;t good at all.  Immediately after opening the package, I tried to trim my bangs - wow - didn&#x27;t really work at all.  Spend a little more (I am) and buy the Tweezerman shears with the black handles - I can&#x27;t remember their name.  Left my last excellent pair at our other home and just re-ordered the more expensive hair scissors from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was a great item, nice sharp cutting edges, worked great on our toddler who doesn&#x27;t hold still.  Would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This pair of scissors is great -- if you&#x27;re a little kid.  I don&#x27;t have that big hands for an adult, but yet it is a struggle for me to quickly and comfortably fit my fingers through the tiny finger holders.  If I could do it over again, I&#x27;d pass on these small sciccors and spend a little more $ for the longer pair.  Not really sure what the advantage is for having these shorter pair of scissors either.</li>
            <li> Sharp, lightweight and excellent for cutting my husband&#x27;s hair. While some may prefer longer shears, I prefer to cut  small amount of hair at each snip so these work well.</li>
            <li> I always end up getting roped into cutting my sons hair. Why is it always mom? I usually pre-cut his hair before I switch to clippers because it&#x27;s thick, dense and curly...it&#x27;s kind of like shearing a sheep! I also clean up around the edges and around his ears with these. I&#x27;ve also been known to cut my own hair....why not, it&#x27;s only hair, it WILL grow back. These are fine for my purposes, they are sharp, small for my small hands and seem to keep an edge through many uses.</li>
            <li> Sharp and does a great job cutting hair. The cost of professional shears are very expensive these shears do the same job at a way less price. However it would be better if the sheers were longer</li>
            <li> Way too small fingerholes.  Doesn&#x27;t seem very sharp.</li>
            <li> A little smallish but I like them.  Nice and sharp.  I trim my hair and cut bandages with them.  But they are a bit on the small side.  If you have big hands they may be a problem.</li>
            <li> Really th  only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I did understand that the length was as short as it was.  I dint know where to measure from.  Firefighters though.  My 2 1/2-year-old looks great!</li>
            <li> These are great scissors  They are easy to hold because of the small size and very sharp. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Too small for finger. Medium grade quality. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> Just as others have said, these shears are really small. I am 5&#x27; tall and have fairly petite hands, and I found the thumb hole to be uncomfortably tight. They did seem sharp, but I return them anyway.</li>
            <li> The best size for trimming hair; very very sharp.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy them.  I am planning on buying more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m not the only one but I have had various different scissors and hate each and everyone of them on day 1.  They just don&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one for the sole purpose of cutting my girls&#x27; hair.  (I thought paying someone $20 for them to snip 4 times was a bit outrageous, not to mention the tip they expect you to give.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut both my girls hair and it turned out pretty good.  And not once did the scissor aggravate me.  It cut where and when I wanted to without a single hitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;this is what a scissor is supposed to be like.. cutting things without frustrating the user&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fact that it is 5.5\\&quot;, it&#x27;s just perfect in my hand and not too long.</li>
            <li> not good scissors poor quality do not buy</li>
            <li> Love these shears I went ahead an ordered a second one. Will probably order again although these are pretty solid and will last a long time. A bit pricey though Im sure it will sell more if the price point was a bit lower.</li>
            <li> Pleased, gave as a gift to aspiring hairdresser.</li>
            <li> These are great little shears! I use them to trim my bangs between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman products are made in Pakistan with the lowest grade steel. The blades are not sharp and like the nail clipper I have from them they are useless in no time.</li>
            <li> This might be one of the cheapest shears I&#x27;ve ever held.  It is so light I&#x27;m not even sure what metal quality it is. Professional stylists stay away, this is not a shear to use on your clients hair.  Invest in quality tools. [...] (SEE the difference)</li>
            <li> Great shears for trimming my fringe - they definitely get the job done and are sharp enough not to worry about uneven trimming. They are definitely made for small fingers, but that&#x27;s not an issue for me! :)</li>
            <li> My mom had a pair of these. They are very sharp. The finger holes are small so not a good pair if you have large hands. Use for hair cutting so it is quick and accurate. Bought a pair for my daughter&#x27;s birthday because she loved using my mom&#x27;s scissors.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time using these as the finger holes are very small.  I am a women and don&#x27;t have particularly large hands.  I don&#x27;t think an average man would be able to use these.  I am going to have to get another type of shears to replace these.</li>
            <li> Sharp, and a warranty/free sharpening to keep them sharp.  Finger holes were a little bit small for my large arthritic joints.</li>
            <li> I like these scissors because I wanted to trim my own hair.I have long hair and I do not always want to go to have my hair professionally trimmed.These scissors are easy to handle and I am able to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> Used these to chop off my hair. They were very easy to use and perfectly sharp! Great scissors</li>
            <li> I purchased these for at home cutting. I&#x27;m 6&#x27; and 220 lbs and they can be a little tight in the fingers but now that I think about it, it&#x27;s probably better to have that grip then be too loose but it&#x27;s noticeable. The length is decent but I would have probably opted for a 7\\&quot; if available. The quality is there though and for the price it&#x27;s worth a buy for most.</li>
            <li> These scissors were a nice weight and fit my hands well, except they were defective.  There was a rusty streak on the inside of the blades, so they didn&#x27;t close smoothly, and the hinge was loose.  I think they may have been used and returned.  If they were in good condition, they would have been perfect.  Time to find a better pair (a good pair of scissors is still less expensive than a hair cut in a salon and you get exactly the cut you want!).</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews. The holes for the fingers were extremely small.  I will order a new pair from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is best scissors I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life for sure. Shaping/cutting my beard, mustache and hair has never been easier.</li>
            <li> The cutting action is a little stiff but works well enough. I would recommend for home use. I think a barber or hair stylist would get fatigued cutting hair with these-I couldn&#x27;t imagine using these all day but for limited use I think they are fine. Given that limitation I would recommend these scissors.</li>
