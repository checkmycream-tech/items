    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is perfect.</li>
            <li>If the nozzle was redesigned with &amp;#34;air flow focus&amp;#34; in mind, rather than &amp;#34;air flow restriction&amp;#34;, it would be a great nozzle.  </li>
            <li>I would like one that would fit better, but the shape is great!</li>
            <li>Love the width of it.</li>
            <li>and i am sure</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>It fits fine, but I noticed almost no air flow through the working end.  </li>
            <li>I should have read the measurements, as it didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>tHIS DOESNT EVEN FIT MY HAIR DRYER</li>
            <li>I just hoped that this concentrator would fit too.  </li>
            <li>Cheap product, no go at all</li>
            <li>and it fit on my revlon blow dryer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li>Product melted when I used it its a concentrator for a blow dryer and it didn&#x27;t even fit right plus the inside plastic strips melted</li>
            <li>It did look like a good product other than the fact it didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but it took some effort to fit on my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>makes my hair super straight</li>
            <li>melted on first use.  </li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>I noticed a couple of reviews that stated that it over heated; I can see that happening, because of the restricted, extremely hot air flow.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use a universal diffuser with this dryer, so</li>
            <li>Hair dryer was too hot</li>
            <li>The first use it melted while I was blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>So, that&#x27;s a good $10 wasted.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product thinking that I would just be able to attach it to my everyday hair dryer, but the attachment didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money!!!</li>
            <li>Your dryer would need to have a prominently long, skinny nozzle for this concentrator to fit.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the tip doesn&#x27;t stay on very snugly, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s made to be compatible with different sizes.</li>
            <li>The plastic is way too thin and flimsy to be up to handling the heat, anyway, so it&#x27;s probably for the better it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It was not even worth the shipping to send it back.</li>
            <li>could fit other blow dryer</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m off to just look for a Hot Tools specific concentrator....</li>
            <li>Not worth sending back to the company because it would cost more than the product itself.</li>
            <li>I did have a hair dryer that it happened to fit, but with the attachment, I noticed little to no difference with using it, and the attachment kept falling off.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money .</li>
            <li>I have tried it on 3 different dryers--- I love the concept of it but have to be careful that I am the only one in the bathroom while I&#x27;m drying my hair!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have two different blow dryers and both nozzles are normal if not small.</li>
            <li>Not sure which product this would fit.</li>
            <li>The major unhappiness was that this product overheats and causes the blow dryer to overheat when being used.</li>
            <li>Nozzle is too small to fit my hair dryer (which by all means is a standard hair dryer).</li>
            <li>Was disappointed because the description said it would fit most hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, whoever designed this concentrator nozzle, doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of concentration.  </li>
            <li>nozzle was to large did not fit the dryer.</li>

            <li> Did not fit on the barrel of my blow dryer.</li>

            <li> nozzle was to large did not fit the dryer.</li>
            <li> melted on first use.  DO NOT buy if you value your time or money.</li>
            <li> I should have read the measurements, as it didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> 0 stars . Worst product ever. Do not waste your money . Melted on first use and ruined my expensive blow dryer</li>
            <li> The nozzle keeps popping off the dryer--- and lands across the room!! I have tried it on 3 different dryers--- I love the concept of it but have to be careful that I am the only one in the bathroom while I&#x27;m drying my hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does not fit all hairdryers!</li>

            <li> I bought this attachment to replace the one that cracked from dropping it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. The first time I attached it to  my blow dryer&lt;br /&gt;I smelled a weird smell.  It was this nozzle melting on to the end of it.</li>
            <li> Product melted when I used it its a concentrator for a blow dryer and it didn&#x27;t even fit right plus the inside plastic strips melted so incredibly disappointed I couldn&#x27;t even return it</li>
            <li> This did not fit my hairdryer (and I have a standard one by Conair). Not worth sending back to the company because it would cost more than the product itself. Contacted the company and they said that this is a standard size- they don&#x27;t have a larger or smaller one. Not sure which product this would fit.</li>
            <li> tHIS DOESNT EVEN FIT MY HAIR DRYER IT IS TOO SMALL.  i HAVE A REGULAR SIZED DRYER AND NOW I HAVE WASTED MY MONEY :(</li>
            <li> I bought this for my tiny Conair Infinity blow dryer.  It fits fine, but I noticed almost no air flow through the working end.  I looked closely at the unit, and the problem is the opening, which is extremely narrow.  I noticed a couple of reviews that stated that it over heated; I can see that happening, because of the restricted, extremely hot air flow.  I can also see something happening to my hair dryer because of this ridiculously restricted air flow.  Apparently, whoever designed this concentrator nozzle, doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of concentration.  What I need (and I assume others need), is to take ALL of the airflow from a hairdryer, and FOCUS it in one direction.  This is the definition of Concentration!  If the nozzle was redesigned with &amp;#34;air flow focus&amp;#34; in mind, rather than &amp;#34;air flow restriction&amp;#34;, it would be a great nozzle.  The only reason it rated 2 stars for me instead of 1, is that I think I can &amp;#34;redesign&amp;#34; the nozzle myself, before it melts or damages my hair dryer.  I like how it fits onto the dryer, but it&#x27;s the only thing I like.</li>
            <li> The minor unhappiness was how it came to me in shipping. The shipping packaged looked as if it had been opened and when I opened it, the product was out of it&#x27;s packaging as if someone had ripped it opened. The major unhappiness was that this product overheats and causes the blow dryer to overheat when being used. I do not recommend buying.</li>
            <li> Just got this item (VERY fast shipping!), but unfortunately the opening is too narrow for my Hot Tools blow dryer.  I was able to use a universal diffuser with this dryer, so I just hoped that this concentrator would fit too.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just way too narrow an opening for my blow dryer.  So, that&#x27;s a good $10 wasted.  Your dryer would need to have a prominently long, skinny nozzle for this concentrator to fit.  Now, I&#x27;m off to just look for a Hot Tools specific concentrator....</li>
            <li> Nozzle is too small to fit my hair dryer (which by all means is a standard hair dryer). The plastic is way too thin and flimsy to be up to handling the heat, anyway, so it&#x27;s probably for the better it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Fits  almost every hair dryer.It is perfect.</li>
            <li> Nozzle does not stay on blow dryer. It is a standard dryer. Not worth the effort everytime it pops off..Love the width of it. WIsh they could fix it so it would not pop off!</li>
            <li> This concentrator broke after 1 usage. The plastic instantly melted and the spring came out! Cheap product, no go at all</li>
            <li> This melted off my dryer</li>
            <li> Hair dryer was too hot so it melted the inside now it just falls off</li>
            <li> Did not fit.  Was disappointed because the description said it would fit most hair dryers.  It did look like a good product other than the fact it didn&#x27;t fit.  I returned it and got my money back</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money!!! Worse purchase ever. The very 1st time I used it, it melted to my expensive 90$ Hot Tools hair dryer and scarred it all up...unfortunately I dropped my hair dryer and broke my original concentrator. This product is a complete Piece of Crap!</li>
            <li> This was a terrible purchase.  The first use it melted while I was blow drying my hair.  A serious waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> makes my hair super straight and it fit on my revlon blow dryer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use and i am sure could fit other blow dryer</li>
            <li> concentrator melted in the inside during first use, and was unable to stay on nozzle. Inside spring became loose.  I needed it for heat to straighten my hair.  Waste of money couldnt withstand the heat.</li>
            <li> I have two different blow dryers and both nozzles are normal if not small. And the concentrator did not fit either one. And it was shipped to me cracked as well. It was not even worth the shipping to send it back.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but it took some effort to fit on my hair dryer. it also pops off every so often. I would like one that would fit better, but the shape is great!</li>
            <li> Too small for my blow dryer;(</li>
