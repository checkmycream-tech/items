            <li> Just wanted to say hi to everyone who wrote here who ALSO has loved this lipstick and worn it for years. The trusty Wild Plum 640. We should gather over a glass of wine or 2 while we still have 640 to wear, take some selfie&#x27;s. What were they thinking? This is a color for the ages...</li>

            <li> This has been my favorite colour for Years!! I purchase on line from Amazon  because the stores never have this colour stocked. Convenient  from the comfort of my home. No lines, no frustration :)</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when it was delivered because it sat on my front porch in 10 degree weather for several hours before I got home from work.  It was frozen when I opened it and when it thawed it turned real soft and I can&#x27;t even use it.  I love the lipstick but not when it has been frozen.</li>
