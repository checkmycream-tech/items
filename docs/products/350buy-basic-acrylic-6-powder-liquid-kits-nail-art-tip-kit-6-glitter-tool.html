            <li>what&#x27;s already great is it came 3 weeks before it was supposed to</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>The product wasn&#x27;t as great as I hoped.</li>
            <li>It all worked great except for the brush.</li>
            <li>The buffers and nail file&#x27;s did come in great condition but after using them the sand paper wears off and they begin not to work.</li>
            <li>The powders all worked great</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>

            <li>Love my orders!!</li>
            <li>I love everything!!</li>
            <li>It included everything in the photo and the quality of it all is very nice.</li>
            <li>Great kit my girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>is strong smelling, it included an instruction sheet which is excellent.</li>
            <li>Everything was very good quality for the the very inexpensive price, worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>On the bright side i guess i can get my reimbursement for this impulse buy.</li>
            <li>The portions are great the acrylic liquid is about 3oz which is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>Fit description perfectly!</li>
            <li>So this is good considering the price.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend getting a good one.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>Over all this was a good deal.</li>
            <li>Instructions would be good.</li>
            <li>I got every thing that it said I would I loved</li>
            <li>but everything else I received&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in good time and condition&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Otherwise It was a good buyfor the price.</li>
            <li>the powders are not that good lets</li>
            <li>I did n8r like the fact that it had not so good acrylic powder.</li>
            <li>Good for beginners</li>
            <li>i got all of that in good condition when it arrived</li>
            <li>This is a good starter set.</li>
            <li>I suggest you buy your own nail glue when purchasing this product and buying a power nail drill as the nail filers weren&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li>I got everything as described and the address change during shipment went very smoothly!</li>
            <li>I really love if an it works great and the acrylic powders and glitters</li>
            <li>this is a great started kit for cheap!</li>
            <li>It is amazing, the acrylic powders are gorgeous</li>
            <li>then that it a great order just make sure you have nails or get some</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I know most reviews say its not that great</li>
            <li>Good product just wish there was more of the powder acrylic and would have loved info on the slim box of glitter that it came with bc idk what do with it</li>
            <li>I love this set!</li>
            <li>Invest in something better!</li>
            <li>Love the products!</li>
            <li>I really love it ! ‚ù§</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect, shipping was much faster!</li>
            <li>An amazing product.</li>
            <li>I belive it was an amazing deal to get.</li>
            <li>pusher.&lt;br /&gt;- Cuticle oil (which works AMAZING, &amp; smells great!!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>The polymer is nice.</li>
            <li>but my sister insisted it was okay since she&#x27;s been waiting for a good month for it to come.</li>
            <li>The products are all nice</li>
            <li>Honestly i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>so make sure you have a good one on hand</li>
            <li>the sizing was good &amp; the smaller powders are great for mixing!</li>
            <li>Any way, the clear acrylic was perfect.</li>
            <li>And everything came in perfect condition,wrapped up nice &amp; neat and placed properly in the package,</li>
            <li>but the acrylic has a very cheap look to it when applying to the nail.</li>
            <li>I love glitter</li>
            <li>well id love to write a review, but mine never came</li>
            <li>it is better quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for someone that is starting out !</li>
            <li>I love everything in this kit.</li>
            <li>This kit was awesome, The sizes of the products(the glitters and caviar) was a bit smaller</li>
            <li>need more acrylic powder</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>So I would suggest you buy another jar just in case you needed more like I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better then</li>
            <li>I have bought product from the store that has worked better then this.</li>
            <li>and I love the colors that come in this package.</li>
            <li>this was for my daughter,she&#x27;s okay with it.</li>
            <li>So i said ok i go home to use the kit</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say ok to that.</li>
            <li>otherwise everything else was ok.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li>I suggest buying more tips off here on amazon or at sallys beauty supply.</li>
            <li>files really aren&#x27;t that good, I just went and bought my own</li>
            <li>so I was able to organize everything but the beads.</li>
            <li>The item itself is ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>(one with a really cute floral design)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was overall great!</li>
            <li>it came is okay</li>
            <li>it was ok</li>
            <li>I love this package.</li>
            <li>Many items were included in this</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for at home nails, the big file and glue</li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>All and all i love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li>I ordered my package very excited to get it, and I was also very excited when i seen what I got.</li>
            <li>when I picked my package up from the post office all of the little caviar beads were all over the box so was a good amount of the glitter I don&#x27;t think they were packaged very good so.</li>
            <li>It came with super cute glitter in it&#x27;s own kit called &amp;#34;glitter nail kit&amp;#34; which I thought was cool!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other then that all the colors i got go on good and so far look really cute</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten about 4 full sets before I needed to purchase more nail tips and acrylic powder.</li>
            <li>Everything else is just fine for the price.</li>
            <li>But besides the glue, everything works fine...</li>
            <li>but as far as I can tell the important stuff has worked amazingly!</li>
            <li>were cheap</li>
            <li>cheap quality did not even use except one time to test it.</li>
            <li>but it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>also had some cheap miss match nails</li>
            <li>but the nail are really cheap</li>
            <li>It might be more, but it is so worth your money.</li>
            <li>Shipping was timely--but I would have rather waited a day or two to ensure everything was secure in it&#x27;s package.  </li>
            <li>The powder goes on disguatingly and the nails are soo cheap.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but figured I would write the review now since I&#x27;ve never done my own acrylic before and wouldn&#x27;t really know if these are quality products or not.</li>
            <li>The glue looked used and the brush didn&#x27;t fit the kit.</li>
            <li>got all good / cute colors, got like 3 different pinks</li>
            <li>I love the beautiful colors and the glitter little jewels</li>
            <li>It ran out quick and the arcylic powder isn&#x27;t even that full!</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest opening this in a well ventilated area because the smell is strong right</li>
            <li>Was not that user friendly</li>
            <li>Materials are super cheap.  </li>
            <li>A dust brush, to clean off any excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was super excited when I got this.</li>
            <li>then i expected, still the acrylic worked great and the files and buffers did as well.</li>
            <li>Overall for the price this is a really good deal.</li>
            <li>and I thought it look cool.</li>
            <li>Overall good product for the price.</li>
            <li>The acrylic jar isn&#x27;t completely full either...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for starting out.</li>
            <li>ONE FULL SET b4</li>
            <li>Honestly, get your nails done at a salon or go to Sally&#x27;s and buy professional items.</li>
            <li>personally I received a good product</li>
            <li>fast shipping and as described love it</li>
            <li>This would be a good buy for someone who is starting out with doing nails !</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this was the gems and glitter.</li>
            <li>and I had no problems with them, def good for starters such as myself in cosmetology school.</li>
            <li>Good things about this kit is that it came earlier than i thought</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>My point was for me at least this was a very good buy for so cheap.</li>
            <li>i would have returned the item but as it came from china i didnt expect a quick exchange process....</li>
            <li>and my brush was ruined quickly.</li>
            <li>but luckily everything was still intact.</li>
            <li>Got my package today,2 weeks Earlier than I was supoose to which made me extra happy!!</li>
            <li>It also came with some more vibrant colored powders along with glitter powders.</li>
            <li>Most the things looked used and the description said it was all totally new .</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>they sent out a new brush and were great with communication which is the ONLY reason I am giving a review of 3 stars!</li>
            <li>My acylic liquid was cracked open and the nail glue I would use a diffrent kind cause its super runny.</li>
            <li>, the glitters are soo cute :) , the white acrylic doesn&#x27;t really work that</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re a beginner it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>And the price was worth it.  </li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this kit,, small but because there is so much it doesn&#x27;t matter,,</li>
            <li>but other then that a good selection of colors&lt;</li>
            <li>I go the box right on time.</li>
            <li>but if you want it right away or your glitter and beads in tact I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>It did not want to lay right .</li>
            <li>Great price the package was damage but the mail guy here put the into my small mail box instead of bring it to the door</li>
            <li>It is a great dead i truly recomend it!</li>
            <li>it took kind of long to get</li>
            <li>This is worth a lot more than the actual cost.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d say about 10, in smaller containers but GREAT for mixing with regular acrylic powder!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>, nails didnt fit right, clue seemed old and have no clue what these color powders are even for....</li>
            <li>everything was just thrown into a vanilla envelopes and shipped off... will say very fast shipping and receiving  </li>
            <li>I got my package earlier than expected so that was a good thing!</li>
            <li>First off The nails that came in it</li>
            <li>It has pretty much all you need to start !</li>
            <li>It came fast and what you saw is what you got!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a first timers kit</li>
            <li>and they were pretty.</li>
            <li>Then again it was only $13 with shipping included, so I am sure you can afford to go to a beauty supply store and grab a $5 brush.</li>
            <li>Everything was packed and sealed safe and properly.</li>
            <li>I would totally buy this item again! :-)</li>
            <li>so make sure you buy extra</li>
            <li>I got exactly what the description said, but there was no primer..</li>
            <li>Okay so it took me a while to be able to post this review because i was excited about some things and disappointed with many others.</li>
            <li>This was a good kit took a while to come and the acrylic dries very fast which can be hard because it sometimes dries up before you even put it on the nail</li>
            <li>its okay, Now im just waiting for the right time when i can have good ventalation ( still bit chilly here)to do this for the primer</li>
            <li>Came but box was smashed and two things were ruined the square buffer and a blue square the rest fine</li>
            <li>when using the acrylic powder it comes out gooey and hard to use.besides that everything else is a good buy</li>
            <li>but it really is</li>
            <li>Thanks it&#x27;s everything I needed thank you.</li>
            <li>It got here fast and no problems.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Just watch out if you&#x27;re really wanting the glitter I guess.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a whole kit don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li>it shipped really fast like not even a week</li>
            <li>I like that the set came with so much variety.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>Only problem is, the nail glue is so runny and the nails are so cheap.</li>
            <li>It wasnt packaged very well.</li>
            <li>This product came on time and was better than I had expected for the price, everything was in the package</li>
            <li>Have recieved my product, early (Thumbs up):), items are as described but the only thing is that the brushes were not what i thought them to be but</li>
            <li>I lost a lot of the caviar beads, but other then that, I&#x27;m 100% satisfied :) it even came before the expected date!</li>
            <li>other than that my kit was ok.</li>
            <li>It did have a cute marble design however, and the cuticle pusher on the other side worked</li>
            <li>Came totally disorganized open containers came fast but definitely for a price good product just wish colors and stuff</li>
            <li>It came in a little box and they sent me more than i expected but over all im satisfied ...</li>
            <li>Box was slightly smashed, but that is okay.</li>
            <li>Most of the tiny jewels were mixed within their compartmentalized container.  </li>
            <li>High quality products.</li>
            <li>i would rather spend a little more money on something as with my experience</li>
            <li>I love the poduct I do have a few bones to pick.</li>
            <li>Also the finger separators are worse than the dollar store ones so dont expect good quality.</li>
            <li>I live them.</li>
            <li>Everything is new but the powder and liquid  </li>
            <li>, im not sure why  everyone is complaining about the brushes they&#x27;re good,and the glues were only half way full but everything else is good</li>
            <li>but when you open it and its all over your living room floor, and you have no vacuum to clean it up its hell.</li>
            <li>This product came pretty early and you get exactly what you see, my only thing is that the acrylic nail brush is too tiny</li>
            <li>One of the containers of decorating beads arrived mixed together from the travel, but the seller was very prompt and extremely helpful and quickly arranged for some new ones to be sent.</li>
            <li>All items were there quality wasn&#x27;t so good really disappointed;( I was excited to use it:/</li>
            <li>advise adding some clear acrylic to the glitter ones&lt;br</li>
            <li>a get a table spoon of acrylic clear powder</li>
            <li>There really isnt enough of one color to do even one nail.</li>
            <li>A professional quality</li>
            <li>Also arrived early.</li>
            <li>However, i&#x27;m not sure if its the acrylic powder or the liquid but the acrylic dries so fast that you don&#x27;t really have enough time to move it in the right places, and my kit didn&#x27;t even come with the dust brush as it is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>There is NOT much acrylic Powder enough for maybe two full sets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure ill</li>
            <li>I searched high and low before I decided to choose this nail package.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The clear powder was only filled half way and dried way too fast.</li>
            <li>Nail tips (Clear &amp; White.</li>
            <li>My biggest problem of all was the UV gel, in order to use it you have to have a UV lamp or the UV topcoat will not dry.</li>
            <li>The beads were mixed with the other colors and falling out of case, There was glitter all over the place, it was very unorganized</li>
            <li>The only problems I had with this were that my acrylic liquid was not closed all the way</li>

            <li> what&#x27;s already great is it came 3 weeks before it was supposed to</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t as great as I hoped.</li>
            <li> It all worked great except for the brush.</li>
            <li> The buffers and nail file&#x27;s did come in great condition but after using them the sand paper wears off and they begin not to work.</li>
            <li> The powders all worked great</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Love my orders!!</li>
            <li> I love everything!!</li>
            <li> It included everything in the photo and the quality of it all is very nice.</li>
            <li> Great kit my girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> is strong smelling, it included an instruction sheet which is excellent.</li>
            <li> Everything was very good quality for the the very inexpensive price, worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> On the bright side i guess i can get my reimbursement for this impulse buy.</li>
            <li> The portions are great the acrylic liquid is about 3oz which is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Fit description perfectly!</li>
            <li> So this is good considering the price.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend getting a good one.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Over all this was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Instructions would be good.</li>
            <li> I got every thing that it said I would I loved</li>
            <li> but everything else I received&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in good time and condition&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Otherwise It was a good buyfor the price.</li>
            <li> the powders are not that good lets</li>
            <li> I did n8r like the fact that it had not so good acrylic powder.</li>
            <li> Good for beginners</li>
            <li> i got all of that in good condition when it arrived</li>
            <li> This is a good starter set.</li>
            <li> I suggest you buy your own nail glue when purchasing this product and buying a power nail drill as the nail filers weren&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li> I got everything as described and the address change during shipment went very smoothly!</li>
            <li> I really love if an it works great and the acrylic powders and glitters</li>
            <li> this is a great started kit for cheap!</li>
            <li> It is amazing, the acrylic powders are gorgeous</li>
            <li> then that it a great order just make sure you have nails or get some</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I know most reviews say its not that great</li>
            <li> Good product just wish there was more of the powder acrylic and would have loved info on the slim box of glitter that it came with bc idk what do with it</li>
            <li> I love this set!</li>
            <li> Invest in something better!</li>
            <li> Love the products!</li>
            <li> I really love it ! ‚ù§</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect, shipping was much faster!</li>
            <li> An amazing product.</li>
            <li> I belive it was an amazing deal to get.</li>
            <li> pusher.&lt;br /&gt;- Cuticle oil (which works AMAZING, &amp; smells great!!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> The polymer is nice.</li>
            <li> but my sister insisted it was okay since she&#x27;s been waiting for a good month for it to come.</li>
            <li> The products are all nice</li>
            <li> Honestly i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> so make sure you have a good one on hand</li>
            <li> the sizing was good &amp; the smaller powders are great for mixing!</li>
            <li> Any way, the clear acrylic was perfect.</li>
            <li> And everything came in perfect condition,wrapped up nice &amp; neat and placed properly in the package,</li>
            <li> but the acrylic has a very cheap look to it when applying to the nail.</li>
            <li> I love glitter</li>
            <li> well id love to write a review, but mine never came</li>
            <li> it is better quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for someone that is starting out !</li>
            <li> I love everything in this kit.</li>
            <li> This kit was awesome, The sizes of the products(the glitters and caviar) was a bit smaller</li>
            <li> need more acrylic powder</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> So I would suggest you buy another jar just in case you needed more like I did.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better then</li>
            <li> I have bought product from the store that has worked better then this.</li>
            <li> and I love the colors that come in this package.</li>
            <li> this was for my daughter,she&#x27;s okay with it.</li>
            <li> So i said ok i go home to use the kit</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say ok to that.</li>
            <li> otherwise everything else was ok.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li> I suggest buying more tips off here on amazon or at sallys beauty supply.</li>
            <li> files really aren&#x27;t that good, I just went and bought my own</li>
            <li> so I was able to organize everything but the beads.</li>
            <li> The item itself is ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> (one with a really cute floral design)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was overall great!</li>
            <li> it came is okay</li>
            <li> it was ok</li>
            <li> I love this package.</li>
            <li> Many items were included in this</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for at home nails, the big file and glue</li>
            <li> love the product.</li>
            <li> All and all i love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li> I ordered my package very excited to get it, and I was also very excited when i seen what I got.</li>
            <li> when I picked my package up from the post office all of the little caviar beads were all over the box so was a good amount of the glitter I don&#x27;t think they were packaged very good so.</li>
            <li> It came with super cute glitter in it&#x27;s own kit called &amp;#34;glitter nail kit&amp;#34; which I thought was cool!</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other then that all the colors i got go on good and so far look really cute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten about 4 full sets before I needed to purchase more nail tips and acrylic powder.</li>
            <li> Everything else is just fine for the price.</li>
            <li> But besides the glue, everything works fine...</li>
            <li> but as far as I can tell the important stuff has worked amazingly!</li>
            <li> were cheap</li>
            <li> cheap quality did not even use except one time to test it.</li>
            <li> but it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> also had some cheap miss match nails</li>
            <li> but the nail are really cheap</li>
            <li> It might be more, but it is so worth your money.</li>
            <li> Shipping was timely--but I would have rather waited a day or two to ensure everything was secure in it&#x27;s package.  </li>
            <li> The powder goes on disguatingly and the nails are soo cheap.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but figured I would write the review now since I&#x27;ve never done my own acrylic before and wouldn&#x27;t really know if these are quality products or not.</li>
            <li> The glue looked used and the brush didn&#x27;t fit the kit.</li>
            <li> got all good / cute colors, got like 3 different pinks</li>
            <li> I love the beautiful colors and the glitter little jewels</li>
            <li> It ran out quick and the arcylic powder isn&#x27;t even that full!</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest opening this in a well ventilated area because the smell is strong right</li>
            <li> Was not that user friendly</li>
            <li> Materials are super cheap.  </li>
            <li> A dust brush, to clean off any excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was super excited when I got this.</li>
            <li> then i expected, still the acrylic worked great and the files and buffers did as well.</li>
            <li> Overall for the price this is a really good deal.</li>
            <li> and I thought it look cool.</li>
            <li> Overall good product for the price.</li>
            <li> The acrylic jar isn&#x27;t completely full either...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for starting out.</li>
            <li> ONE FULL SET b4</li>
            <li> Honestly, get your nails done at a salon or go to Sally&#x27;s and buy professional items.</li>
            <li> personally I received a good product</li>
            <li> fast shipping and as described love it</li>
            <li> This would be a good buy for someone who is starting out with doing nails !</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this was the gems and glitter.</li>
            <li> and I had no problems with them, def good for starters such as myself in cosmetology school.</li>
            <li> Good things about this kit is that it came earlier than i thought</li>
            <li> Overall it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> My point was for me at least this was a very good buy for so cheap.</li>
            <li> i would have returned the item but as it came from china i didnt expect a quick exchange process....</li>
            <li> and my brush was ruined quickly.</li>
            <li> but luckily everything was still intact.</li>
            <li> Got my package today,2 weeks Earlier than I was supoose to which made me extra happy!!</li>
            <li> It also came with some more vibrant colored powders along with glitter powders.</li>
            <li> Most the things looked used and the description said it was all totally new .</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> they sent out a new brush and were great with communication which is the ONLY reason I am giving a review of 3 stars!</li>
            <li> My acylic liquid was cracked open and the nail glue I would use a diffrent kind cause its super runny.</li>
            <li> , the glitters are soo cute :) , the white acrylic doesn&#x27;t really work that</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re a beginner it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> And the price was worth it.  </li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this kit,, small but because there is so much it doesn&#x27;t matter,,</li>
            <li> but other then that a good selection of colors&lt;</li>
            <li> I go the box right on time.</li>
            <li> but if you want it right away or your glitter and beads in tact I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It did not want to lay right .</li>
            <li> Great price the package was damage but the mail guy here put the into my small mail box instead of bring it to the door</li>
            <li> It is a great dead i truly recomend it!</li>
            <li> it took kind of long to get</li>
            <li> This is worth a lot more than the actual cost.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d say about 10, in smaller containers but GREAT for mixing with regular acrylic powder!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> , nails didnt fit right, clue seemed old and have no clue what these color powders are even for....</li>
            <li> everything was just thrown into a vanilla envelopes and shipped off... will say very fast shipping and receiving  </li>
            <li> I got my package earlier than expected so that was a good thing!</li>
            <li> First off The nails that came in it</li>
            <li> It has pretty much all you need to start !</li>
            <li> It came fast and what you saw is what you got!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a first timers kit</li>
            <li> and they were pretty.</li>
            <li> Then again it was only $13 with shipping included, so I am sure you can afford to go to a beauty supply store and grab a $5 brush.</li>
            <li> Everything was packed and sealed safe and properly.</li>
            <li> I would totally buy this item again! :-)</li>
            <li> so make sure you buy extra</li>
            <li> I got exactly what the description said, but there was no primer..</li>
            <li> Okay so it took me a while to be able to post this review because i was excited about some things and disappointed with many others.</li>
            <li> This was a good kit took a while to come and the acrylic dries very fast which can be hard because it sometimes dries up before you even put it on the nail</li>
            <li> its okay, Now im just waiting for the right time when i can have good ventalation ( still bit chilly here)to do this for the primer</li>
            <li> Came but box was smashed and two things were ruined the square buffer and a blue square the rest fine</li>
            <li> when using the acrylic powder it comes out gooey and hard to use.besides that everything else is a good buy</li>
            <li> but it really is</li>
            <li> Thanks it&#x27;s everything I needed thank you.</li>
            <li> It got here fast and no problems.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Just watch out if you&#x27;re really wanting the glitter I guess.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a whole kit don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> it shipped really fast like not even a week</li>
            <li> I like that the set came with so much variety.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> Only problem is, the nail glue is so runny and the nails are so cheap.</li>
            <li> It wasnt packaged very well.</li>
            <li> This product came on time and was better than I had expected for the price, everything was in the package</li>
            <li> Have recieved my product, early (Thumbs up):), items are as described but the only thing is that the brushes were not what i thought them to be but</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of the caviar beads, but other then that, I&#x27;m 100% satisfied :) it even came before the expected date!</li>
            <li> other than that my kit was ok.</li>
            <li> It did have a cute marble design however, and the cuticle pusher on the other side worked</li>
            <li> Came totally disorganized open containers came fast but definitely for a price good product just wish colors and stuff</li>
            <li> It came in a little box and they sent me more than i expected but over all im satisfied ...</li>
            <li> Box was slightly smashed, but that is okay.</li>
            <li> Most of the tiny jewels were mixed within their compartmentalized container.  </li>
            <li> High quality products.</li>
            <li> i would rather spend a little more money on something as with my experience</li>
            <li> I love the poduct I do have a few bones to pick.</li>
            <li> Also the finger separators are worse than the dollar store ones so dont expect good quality.</li>
            <li> I live them.</li>
            <li> Everything is new but the powder and liquid  </li>
            <li> , im not sure why  everyone is complaining about the brushes they&#x27;re good,and the glues were only half way full but everything else is good</li>
            <li> but when you open it and its all over your living room floor, and you have no vacuum to clean it up its hell.</li>
            <li> This product came pretty early and you get exactly what you see, my only thing is that the acrylic nail brush is too tiny</li>
            <li> One of the containers of decorating beads arrived mixed together from the travel, but the seller was very prompt and extremely helpful and quickly arranged for some new ones to be sent.</li>
            <li> All items were there quality wasn&#x27;t so good really disappointed;( I was excited to use it:/</li>
            <li> advise adding some clear acrylic to the glitter ones&lt;br</li>
            <li> a get a table spoon of acrylic clear powder</li>
            <li> There really isnt enough of one color to do even one nail.</li>
            <li> A professional quality</li>
            <li> Also arrived early.</li>
            <li> However, i&#x27;m not sure if its the acrylic powder or the liquid but the acrylic dries so fast that you don&#x27;t really have enough time to move it in the right places, and my kit didn&#x27;t even come with the dust brush as it is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> There is NOT much acrylic Powder enough for maybe two full sets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure ill</li>
            <li> I searched high and low before I decided to choose this nail package.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The clear powder was only filled half way and dried way too fast.</li>
            <li> Nail tips (Clear &amp; White.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem of all was the UV gel, in order to use it you have to have a UV lamp or the UV topcoat will not dry.</li>
            <li> The beads were mixed with the other colors and falling out of case, There was glitter all over the place, it was very unorganized</li>
            <li> The only problems I had with this were that my acrylic liquid was not closed all the way</li>
            <li> but when I tried using it for the first time the glue it came with was dried out...</li>
            <li> It was not that good and the nails are to thick to the point were you can see were the fake nail stops from your real nail and</li>
            <li> 3 Acrylic powders (Pink, Clear, &amp; White)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The acrylic powder is all goopy and icky and it doesn&#x27;t act right.</li>
            <li> , the nail file is super weak, the glue is sticky and their isn&#x27;t enough powder or liquid.</li>
            <li> One of my acrylic powders was not closed so everything in the package had powder on it, but the rest of them were closed properly.</li>
            <li> It is a smaller brush, and its a little hard to pack on the acrylic and get a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> but I didnt really mind because it was pink blue and green mixed together</li>
            <li> the colors are not as pictured and brush as cool as it may look is poor quality...out of all the nail products i have purchased</li>
            <li> I did recieve my product early, on the down side when i got the box</li>
            <li> Either way it was cheap and with a little time and effort things can be cleaned up at least.</li>
            <li> so it was almost a complete total waste.</li>
            <li> the packaging itself was not professional at all....</li>
            <li> package did not contain the glass dish, but i&#x27;m not going to try to contact them about it since it would take too long to arrive even if I got them to send one.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> The thing that other people said spilling where wraped in multiple layers of tin foil.</li>
            <li> personally, the little beads were spilt in there package , also not that big of a deal to me.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The glue I got looked like it had already been used, there was dry glue on the sides where it had dripped .</li>
            <li> im kind of disappointed about</li>
            <li> Brush gets all hard &amp; have to buy a new one now .</li>
            <li> I used this to practice before I spent money on the real expensive kind</li>
            <li> and when I finally received it half my beads and two of glitters were opened and scattered throughout the bent box</li>
            <li> came open and the little containers were loose inside the package.</li>
            <li> Also the little caviar beads came all mixed up</li>
            <li> Only thing is these dont come with the little shot glass things</li>
            <li> the real tiny small breads all mixed in with each other, and the Acrylic liquid stuff had leaked.</li>
            <li> The acrylic liquid was 1/3 of a bottle gone already, The glue was empty and the toe separators, 2 of the files and the orange sticks were glued to the box but the orange sticks were in a little envelope so that wasnt a big deal.</li>
            <li> However, if you want to do nails out of your home and stuff then this is really not what you want to get.</li>
            <li> It only comes with a few nails &amp; noneof</li>
            <li> This saved me from extra trouble of visiting salons.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected you  </li>
            <li> Everything came way before expected üëå</li>
            <li> but it came as described and sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> the other ones I bought.</li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> The acrylic liquid and powder were too small only for 3 sets of nails</li>
            <li> and it says is included other then that everything else</li>
            <li> It also arrived in half the time expected.</li>
            <li> No glitter or powder or anything else other than nail files nail clippers and other typical things.</li>
            <li> My one big complaint was the acrylic brush.</li>
            <li> just say it&#x27;s not worth 12 dollars</li>
            <li> Everyone on here complains that the product is bad but they fail to remember that 3 oz of REALLY good acrylic costs about 7-12 dollars.</li>
            <li> The tips were odd sizes and numbers of tips...</li>
            <li> It came in early but was missing some of the false nails from each one.</li>
            <li> The was a little of everything.</li>
            <li> There was powder over the stuff where some had opened a little .</li>
            <li> The glue bottle was broken and I ended up making a mess trying to open it and the powder doesn&#x27;t even form on the nail.</li>
            <li> This packet was missing the little cleaning brush and the stuff came in the packet like they just threw it in there .</li>
            <li> but clearly i was wrong.</li>
            <li> Bottles were open spilled every where things broken .</li>
            <li> You should also buy your own nail files because the ones the kit come with are horrible.</li>
            <li> It was a beat up box but thats expected since my mail survive kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> caviar beads were everywhere and it didnt even come with the brushes.. missing 5 items and glue spilled.</li>
            <li> The package was messy with glitter over it.</li>
            <li> It lost a star only because I felt the box was poorly packed and everything got tossed around in shipment</li>
            <li> Nothing is missing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m an impatient person</li>
            <li> the nail comb missing Brussels</li>
            <li> She uses the beads and a few of the accessories.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of false french tips and this pack.</li>
            <li> Speaking of packing it comes in a plain envelope.</li>
            <li> It shed and was too stiff.</li>
            <li> I could not believe I wasted my money on this!</li>
            <li> but i feel like the colored acrylics are TOO small</li>
            <li> The powders are small, but I made it work.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with the glitter acrylic powder</li>
            <li> So I got everything the description says, only when I got it, the Box was a bit crushed :(</li>
            <li> I also received the wrong brush from what was described and unable to use ANYTHING until I received the new brush.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time figuring out what to do</li>
            <li> Also the brush makes it hard to apply so</li>
            <li> , It was a little dusty</li>
            <li> The clear gel is really really Bad quality.</li>
            <li> It really sucks because I can&#x27;t use them now</li>
            <li> It sucks</li>
            <li> I got the package like 1 or 2 days late  .</li>
            <li> kinda sucks</li>
            <li> A Nail File (thick gray file,</li>
            <li> Which is frustrating when you see the package everyday!</li>
            <li> Acrylic powder was everywhere, the glue was broken, and the tips were kinda small....</li>
            <li> needless to say i did not recover half of them....</li>
            <li> The glue is actually crazy glue and took forever to dry</li>
            <li> seriously reconsidering the idea.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was the brush.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed about this kit, everything is so tiny and not good quality.</li>
            <li> It sucks!</li>
            <li> I and very disappointed about that i don&#x27;t think after 3 applications my whole brush shoulda fell apart.</li>
            <li> Everything came in a small box all smushed together!!</li>
            <li> Poor quality don&#x27;t order</li>
            <li> and I already am annoyed.</li>
            <li> To make things worse</li>
            <li> The one thing that kinda mad me sad was the nail caviar was practically empty.</li>
            <li> never will I order from this place again some stuff was missing and damage bad for business..</li>
            <li> It came in horrible packaging, and was missing a few pieces, like the nails.</li>
            <li> If youre looking for something to just get started with and practice on fake fingers</li>
            <li> This was horrible the acrylic was open and the tips were melted and so was the nail buffer and nail file</li>
            <li> was also very dirty and the brush was not very good.</li>
            <li> the powder came in broken :(</li>
            <li> WTF!?</li>
            <li> It damaged my nails so bad &amp; then breaking because of it.</li>
            <li> it was smashed really bad...</li>
            <li> But its not too Bad as a beginner Kit for that Price</li>

            <li> Packaging was horrible!</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Okay so it took me a while to be able to post this review because i was excited about some things and disappointed with many others. First off The nails that came in it were cheap and i couldnt use. They split the second i tried putting them on. Both the glitter and the colored acrylic powder had been spilled all over the package it came in because the containers broke. I love glitter but when you open it and its all over your living room floor, and you have no vacuum to clean it up its hell. Any way, the clear acrylic was perfect. The acrylic liquid was 1/3 of a bottle gone already, The glue was empty and the toe separators, 2 of the files and the orange sticks were glued to the box but the orange sticks were in a little envelope so that wasnt a big deal. The one thing that kinda mad me sad was the nail caviar was practically empty. There really isnt enough of one color to do even one nail. The jewels were all mixed together which i dont understand why because they are in a separated wheel. WTF!? Either way it was cheap and with a little time and effort things can be cleaned up at least.</li>
            <li> well id love to write a review, but mine never came so I&#x27;m hopping on that 1 star bandwagon. I thought Hong Kong would pull through on this one but clearly i was wrong. On the bright side i guess i can get my reimbursement for this impulse buy. maybe its a sign.</li>
            <li> I love this set! It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the glue. It damaged my nails so bad &amp; then breaking because of it. Other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> the acrylic is absolutly awful the nails are cheaper than dollar store nails. I could not believe I wasted my money on this!</li>
            <li> I did recieve my product early, on the down side when i got the box it was smashed really bad...but i signed for it anyways....when i opened the box all the caviar beads were everywhere...had the company not taped up the box as well as they did i would have lost all the beads...needless to say i did not recover half of them....the packaging itself was not professional at all....the acrylic liquid and glue were wrapped in what appeared to be kitchen foil...i would have returned the item but as it came from china i didnt expect a quick exchange process....the colors are not as pictured and brush as cool as it may look is poor quality...out of all the nail products i have purchased i would rather spend a little more money on something as with my experience it is better quality.</li>
            <li> So I got everything the description says, only when I got it, the Box was a bit crushed :( I lost a lot of the caviar beads, but other then that, I&#x27;m 100% satisfied :) it even came before the expected date!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for someone that is starting out ! It has pretty much all you need to start !</li>
            <li> I told all those things came on a case or something.</li>
            <li> Bottles were open spilled every where things broken . Poor quality don&#x27;t order</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this</li>
            <li> It came in a little box and they sent me more than i expected but over all im satisfied ... but i feel like the colored acrylics are TOO small, the glitters are soo cute :) , the white acrylic doesn&#x27;t really work that well, i didn&#x27;t the the sticks witch im kind of disappointed about , im not sure why  everyone is complaining about the brushes they&#x27;re good,and the glues were only half way full but everything else is good</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed about this kit, everything is so tiny and not good quality. Invest in something better!</li>
            <li> Fit description perfectly! I got everything as described and the address change during shipment went very smoothly! Thank you for the help and great product!</li>
            <li> Love the products! Great price the package was damage but the mail guy here put the into my small mail box instead of bring it to the door I guess couldn&#x27;t walk..</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this kit,, small but because there is so much it doesn&#x27;t matter,,</li>
            <li> just got this today and it came with everything it said it would. The only problems I had with this were that my acrylic liquid was not closed all the way and I only have a bout 1/4 of it left the acrylic was also very dirty and the brush was not very good. You should also buy your own nail files because the ones the kit come with are horrible.</li>
            <li> I love everything in this kit. High quality products. The portions are great the acrylic liquid is about 3oz which is amazing for the price. The polymer is nice. This is worth a lot more than the actual cost. I will purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> If youre looking for something to just get started with and practice on fake fingers then this package is great for you! However, if you want to do nails out of your home and stuff then this is really not what you want to get. Everyone on here complains that the product is bad but they fail to remember that 3 oz of REALLY good acrylic costs about 7-12 dollars. So this is good considering the price. I used this to practice before I spent money on the real expensive kind and it was great! However the brush is HORRIBLE so I would recommend getting a good one. Also the finger separators are worse than the dollar store ones so dont expect good quality. Overall for the price this is a really good deal. It is GREAT to practice with but NOT for clients and what not. Also the little caviar beads came all mixed up but I didnt really mind because it was pink blue and green mixed together and I thought it look cool. Overall good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This claims it comes with acrylic powder, glitter, acrylic liquid and all the works, but mine came in uv gel form and gel coloring. No glitter or powder or anything else other than nail files nail clippers and other typical things.</li>
            <li> This kit was awesome, The sizes of the products(the glitters and caviar) was a bit smaller then i expected, still the acrylic worked great and the files and buffers did as well.</li>
            <li> Comes with everything it says (:</li>
            <li> This was horrible the acrylic was open and the tips were melted and so was the nail buffer and nail file the acrylic powder didn&#x27;t work with what was left of the liquid I&#x27;ll never buy anything like this again I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low before I decided to choose this nail package. There is NOT much acrylic Powder enough for maybe two full sets. I also received the wrong brush from what was described and unable to use ANYTHING until I received the new brush. Which is frustrating when you see the package everyday! they sent out a new brush and were great with communication which is the ONLY reason I am giving a review of 3 stars!</li>
            <li> I really love it ! ‚ù§ This product is amazing, I know most reviews say its not that great but it really is (: but that&#x27;s just my opinion . I really love if an it works great and the acrylic powders and glitters it comes with are beautiful !</li>
            <li> Dont Get this everything where Every where in the box This was not rap good i hate it i dont but nothing from 350 buys  NEVER EVER EVER !!!!</li>
            <li> cheap quality did not even use except one time to test it.</li>
            <li> this product came with everything i need I&#x27;m pretty sure ill need more acrylic powder but everything came, also it came 11 days before it was suppose to!!! i love it.</li>
            <li> I go the box right on time. It was a beat up box but thats expected since my mail survive kinda sucks. The thing that other people said spilling where wraped in multiple layers of tin foil. The beads/sparkles were also in a seperate box in side of the box. The only bad thing was the brush. I would by this again and again</li>
            <li> To get  started on doing nails this is a great started kit for cheap! It came fast and what you saw is what you got! LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> It came with all the stuff it says it&#x27;s gonna. It&#x27;s a first timers kit I had a hard time figuring out what to do but I got it! The acrylic jar isn&#x27;t completely full either... So I would suggest you buy another jar just in case you needed more like I did.</li>
            <li> It does come with everything shown but it is so cheap. The glue bottle was broken and I ended up making a mess trying to open it and the powder doesn&#x27;t even form on the nail. It gets clumpy and falls off.</li>
            <li> Thanks it&#x27;s everything I needed thank you. It got here fast and no problems. I love it. Thanks it&#x27;s better then the other ones I bought.</li>
            <li> It has literally been a month and I have yet to receive this package.  I haven&#x27;t even gotten it and I already am annoyed. The shipping was updated once and never again.</li>
            <li> OMGGGG I love this product! It is amazing, the acrylic powders are gorgeous the glitter is glitterific and its just amazing and the best part was!!!! I ordered it April 21st And it got to my door May 1st JUST AMAZINGGGGGG</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I thought it was going to be. I have bought product from the store that has worked better then this. I&#x27;m going to give it another try later on when I have time to see if was because I was rushed.</li>
            <li> caviar beads were everywhere and it didnt even come with the brushes.. missing 5 items and glue spilled. i was looking so forward to this!! ):</li>
            <li> never will I order from this place again some stuff was missing and damage bad for business.. It was not at all what I thought I was getting</li>
            <li> This bundle is absolutely perfect for a beginner at nails and I love the colors that come in this package.</li>
            <li> Came totally disorganized open containers came fast but definitely for a price good product just wish colors and stuff weren&#x27;t mixed also had some cheap miss match nails</li>
            <li> u get what u want when u get this i like that is comes with a acrylic bottle that dose not turn ur nails yellow..</li>
            <li> It came in early but was missing some of the false nails from each one. The package was messy with glitter over it. The peals and rhinestone colors were mixed</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the price, it&#x27;s a truly great price for all the things you get. BUT the catch to that is I didn&#x27;t get all my pieces. None of the glitter came which isn&#x27;t to big of a deal for me personally, the little beads were spilt in there package , also not that big of a deal to me. Speaking of packing it comes in a plain envelope. Everything else is just fine for the price. It&#x27;s good for starting out. Just watch out if you&#x27;re really wanting the glitter I guess.</li>
            <li> the powder came in broken :( but my sister insisted it was okay since she&#x27;s been waiting for a good month for it to come.</li>
            <li> Was not that user friendly</li>
            <li> If your looking for a whole kit don&#x27;t buy this one. This one is basically for practice if your a starter. It only comes with a few nails &amp; noneof them are the same. Over all this was a good deal.</li>
            <li> When I opened my package there was colored powder and glitter everywhere there&#x27;s barley anything left in my containers it was all on the inside of the envelope the bag they were all in came open and the little containers were loose inside the package. It really sucks because I can&#x27;t use them now and they were pretty. The tips were odd sizes and numbers of tips...</li>
            <li> Instructions would be good. The clear gel is really really Bad quality. But its not too Bad as a beginner Kit for that Price</li>
            <li> I had to re do my review I received this package way before the estimated date so that was a plus. I just used this product yesterday and the acrylic powder/liquid BURNS üî•so I had to go to my local store and buy another brand, the nail file is super weak, the glue is sticky and their isn&#x27;t enough powder or liquid. I will NOT order from this seller again. Great starter and practice kit though.</li>
            <li> This became the part of my life. I bought a pack of false french tips and this pack. I live them. This saved me from extra trouble of visiting salons.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. V3ry disappOinted. Materials are super cheap.  My brush lit3rally lasted ONE FULL SET b4 it fell apart..... DO nOt RecOmend</li>
            <li> this was for my daughter,she&#x27;s okay with it.</li>
            <li> it shipped really fast like not even a week and it came with everything it said it would but the nail are really cheap but other then that it a great order just make sure you have nails or get some</li>
            <li> Packaging was horrible! Acrylic powder was everywhere, the glue was broken, and the tips were kinda small.... But besides the glue, everything works fine...</li>
            <li> I love the poduct I do have a few bones to pick. when I picked my package up from the post office all of the little caviar beads were all over the box so was a good amount of the glitter I don&#x27;t think they were packaged very good so. So i said ok i go home to use the kit and i probably  did about 3 nails and my acrylic brush fell apart now i can&#x27;t say ok to that. I and very disappointed about that i don&#x27;t think after 3 applications my whole brush shoulda fell apart. other than that my kit was ok.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this and save your money. I bought this to teach myself acrylics; NOT THE BEST WAY. The monomer smells so bad! Yuck!! The glue is actually crazy glue and took forever to dry and my brush was ruined quickly. The clear powder was only filled half way and dried way too fast. This isn&#x27;t a product I would recommend. Honestly, get your nails done at a salon or go to Sally&#x27;s and buy professional items. It might be more, but it is so worth your money.</li>
            <li> Most of the tiny jewels were mixed within their compartmentalized container.  The glitter&#x27;s leaking and as soon as I opened the package, all I could smell were the chemicals.  Shipping was timely--but I would have rather waited a day or two to ensure everything was secure in it&#x27;s package.  I bought is as a gift...seriously reconsidering the idea.</li>
            <li> I like that the set came with so much variety. The was a little of everything. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was grade A professional quality but if you&#x27;re a beginner it is definitely worth the price. Shipping was fast as well. Came in about two weeks from China! It lost a star only because I felt the box was poorly packed and everything got tossed around in shipment but luckily everything was still intact. My one big complaint was the acrylic brush. It was awful. It shed and was too stiff. Then again it was only $13 with shipping included, so I am sure you can afford to go to a beauty supply store and grab a $5 brush. Other than that I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This product came pretty early and you get exactly what you see, my only thing is that the acrylic nail brush is too tiny so I had to purchase a bigger one from China .... Still waiting on it ...</li>
            <li> This is terrible. The acrylic powder is all goopy and icky and it doesn&#x27;t act right. It&#x27;s almost plastic-like. It came in horrible packaging, and was missing a few pieces, like the nails. Save your money! Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I got every thing that it said I would I loved it came way earlier then it said it was goin to the only thing was that when it came it had a bad smell because of the heat</li>
            <li> Everything came in a small box all smushed together!! My acylic liquid was cracked open and the nail glue I would use a diffrent kind cause its super runny. otherwise everything else was ok.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal! Everything was very good quality for the the very inexpensive price, worked perfectly. One of the containers of decorating beads arrived mixed together from the travel, but the seller was very prompt and extremely helpful and quickly arranged for some new ones to be sent.</li>
            <li> This was a good kit took a while to come and the acrylic dries very fast which can be hard because it sometimes dries up before you even put it on the nail</li>
            <li> So I was super excited when I got this. Mine included everything seen in the photos! Nothing was messed up or spilt. Only thing is these dont come with the little shot glass things so you have to buy that separately. It came with super cute glitter in it&#x27;s own kit called &amp;#34;glitter nail kit&amp;#34; which I thought was cool! I suggest buying more tips off here on amazon or at sallys beauty supply. My point was for me at least this was a very good buy for so cheap.</li>
            <li> As described in picture, except mine didn&#x27;t come with the regular nail&lt;br /&gt;file but everything else I received&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in good time and condition&lt;br /&gt;I got all good / cute colors, got like 3 different pinks lol but other then that a good selection of colors&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d advise adding some clear acrylic to the glitter ones&lt;br /&gt;Other then that all the colors i got go on good and so far look really cute&lt;br /&gt;The files really aren&#x27;t that good, I just went and bought my own&lt;br /&gt;Me personally I received a good product and I&#x27;m very happy with it(:</li>
            <li> When I opened the bag it had smelled like the monomer had spilled. The beads were mixed with the other colors and falling out of case, There was glitter all over the place, it was very unorganized everything was just thrown in. Luckly Ihad gotten a box in the mail so I was able to organize everything but the beads.I&#x27;ll have to do that another time. Otherwise It was a good buyfor the price.</li>
            <li> So happy! I know people had problems with the condition but mine was great!!</li>
            <li> The item itself is ok but if you want it right away or your glitter and beads in tact I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. The product took forever and when I finally received it half my beads and two of glitters were opened and scattered throughout the bent box ~ I can&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. However it is not for professionals but if u want to do nails yourself it is perfect. One of my powders were spilled and it was immediately replaced. So i would recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. You get what you pay for. If you&#x27;re spending twenty dollars on supplies for your nails, It&#x27;s going to have its effects.</li>
            <li> It was not that good and the nails are to thick to the point were you can see were the fake nail stops from your real nail and the powders are not that good lets just say it&#x27;s not worth 12 dollars</li>
            <li> Good product just wish there was more of the powder acrylic and would have loved info on the slim box of glitter that it came with bc idk what do with it but over all this was a GREAT but thank you</li>
            <li> fast shipping and as described love it</li>
            <li> An amazing product. Came with everything. Also arrived early. The powders are small, but I made it work.</li>
            <li> just got my package. Everything was packed and sealed safe and properly. Nothing is missing. Exactly what I expected. Haven&#x27;t gotten to use so I&#x27;m rating it as a 4 for now.</li>
            <li> Got my package today,2 weeks Earlier than I was supoose to which made me extra happy!! And everything came in perfect condition,wrapped up nice &amp; neat and placed properly in the package,no problems. I cannot wait to use it then I will leave a review on the actual products. (:</li>
            <li> This is the worst acrylic nail kit ever! The powder container doesn&#x27;t  open regularly. The powder goes on disguatingly and the nails are soo cheap. Ther glue melted my brush that came with the kit. I dont recomend getting this product.</li>
            <li> I got my package earlier than expected so that was a good thing! The products are all nice but when I got the beads some of them fell out but thats alright! This would be a good buy for someone who is starting out with doing nails ! I would totally buy this item again! :-)</li>
            <li> It ran out quick and the arcylic powder isn&#x27;t even that full! It sucks</li>
            <li> This package took quite a while to get , but actually arrived well before the estimated delivery date. I immediately opened it up...then moved outside to go through it. I strongly suggest opening this in a well ventilated area because the smell is strong right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package did not contain the glass dish, but i&#x27;m not going to try to contact them about it since it would take too long to arrive even if I got them to send one. One of my acrylic powders was not closed so everything in the package had powder on it, but the rest of them were closed properly. I wiped everything of and just put it all in a ziplock bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but figured I would write the review now since I&#x27;ve never done my own acrylic before and wouldn&#x27;t really know if these are quality products or not.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t picked it up yet what&#x27;s already great is it came 3 weeks before it was supposed to and I&#x27;m an impatient person so I was really happy and satisfied!!! üëçüòÜüòä</li>
            <li> I do not reccomend purchasing this kit. It came after about a month and when I tried to use the aqurilc it just clumped up. Would not purchase.</li>
            <li> This is AWESOME! Came with everything that you need to get started. Not sure what to do with the glitter acrylic powder but I&#x27;ll figure something out lol. Can&#x27;t wait to come up with some designs to use with the gems.</li>
            <li> the nail comb missing Brussels, nails didnt fit right, clue seemed old and have no clue what these color powders are even for....the real tiny small breads all mixed in with each other, and the Acrylic liquid stuff had leaked. everything was just thrown into a vanilla envelopes and shipped off... will say very fast shipping and receiving  ordered on jan21st got on jan30th</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year-old daughter who loves doing nails but it didn&#x27;t come with any directions so it was almost a complete total waste. She uses the beads and a few of the accessories.</li>
            <li> Great kit my girlfriend loved it. I belive it was an amazing deal to get. It is a great dead i truly recomend it!</li>
            <li> I like this product because at the time it was a start. I did n8r like the fact that it had not so good acrylic powder. It did not want to lay right .</li>
            <li> The acrylic powder goes on terrible,bad brush. The product wasn&#x27;t as great as I hoped. The only good thing about this was the gems and glitter.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected you  a get a table spoon of acrylic clear powder so make sure you buy extra</li>
            <li> The acrylic liquid and powder were too small only for 3 sets of nails</li>
            <li> I love the beautiful colors and the glitter little jewels everything just surpassed what I was expecting. Love my orders!!</li>
            <li> This item was on time and I had no problems with them, def good for starters such as myself in cosmetology school. I recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This package was wonderful!! It included everything in the photo and the quality of it all is very nice. I recommend them!!</li>
            <li> Good things about this kit is that it came earlier than i thought and it comes with the basics the only things it didn&#x27;t come with is the primer and dehydrator. However, i&#x27;m not sure if its the acrylic powder or the liquid but the acrylic dries so fast that you don&#x27;t really have enough time to move it in the right places, and my kit didn&#x27;t even come with the dust brush as it is shown in the picture. Another thing is that the brush you use to apply the acrylic with was broke when it was delivered to me. Honestly i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This packet was missing the little cleaning brush and the stuff came in the packet like they just threw it in there . There was powder over the stuff where some had opened a little . The glue I got looked like it had already been used, there was dry glue on the sides where it had dripped . Most the things looked used and the description said it was all totally new . To make things worse I got the package like 1 or 2 days late  .</li>
            <li> when using the acrylic powder it comes out gooey and hard to use.besides that everything else is a good buy</li>
            <li> Good for beginners but the acrylic has a very cheap look to it when applying to the nail. Also the brush makes it hard to apply so I would recommend buying a bigger brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered my package very excited to get it, and I was also very excited when i seen what I got. It came with:&lt;br /&gt;- A Nail File (thick gray file, non-metallic)&lt;br /&gt;-  2 buffers. (one with a really cute floral design)&lt;br /&gt;- Maybe about 8oz of acrylic liquid.&lt;br /&gt;- 3 Acrylic powders (Pink, Clear, &amp; White)&lt;br /&gt;- It also came with some more vibrant colored powders along with glitter powders. (I&#x27;d say about 10, in smaller containers but GREAT for mixing with regular acrylic powder!)&lt;br /&gt;- 2 circled containers for gems and pearls.&lt;br /&gt;- toe separators.&lt;br /&gt;- Nail tips (Clear &amp; White. Mine came in a plastic separated container with the tips assorted)&lt;br /&gt;- Nail glue (I&#x27;d say about regular size of nail glue)&lt;br /&gt;- UV gel.&lt;br /&gt;- A nail brush which is also a cuticle pusher.&lt;br /&gt;- Cuticle oil (which works AMAZING, &amp; smells great!!)&lt;br /&gt;- A double bowl for powder &amp; liquid&lt;br /&gt;- A dust brush, to clean off any excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i got all of that in good condition when it arrived, It was a little dusty but everything was sealed &amp; not opened nor affected. It all worked great except for the brush. It is a smaller brush, and its a little hard to pack on the acrylic and get a smooth surface. So I&#x27;d advise you use a different brush. It did have a cute marble design however, and the cuticle pusher on the other side worked&lt;br /&gt;great! The buffers and nail file&#x27;s did come in great condition but after using them the sand paper wears off and they begin not to work. The powders all worked great the sizing was good &amp; the smaller powders are great for mixing! My biggest problem of all was the UV gel, in order to use it you have to have a UV lamp or the UV topcoat will not dry. So if you don&#x27;t have a UV lamp, you should get a self drying topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;It was overall great! Good buy, especially good for beginners!</li>
            <li> The wooden sticks didn&#x27;t come in with everything and it says is included other then that everything else it said it was going to be their it came is okay I wish is came with everything</li>
            <li> I got everything that it says and nothing was damaged. Only problem is, the nail glue is so runny and the nails are so cheap. Everything else is awesome.</li>
            <li> The glue looked used and the brush didn&#x27;t fit the kit. Overall it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I basically ordered this for the acrylic liquid plus the extra things it had.. it was ok</li>
            <li> Brush gets all hard &amp; have to buy a new one now .</li>
            <li> It didnt come with directions. And when I recieved it the onside of the envelope was covered in the acrylic liquid and glitter. It wasnt packaged very well. Everything was just thrown into one package.</li>
            <li> All items were there quality wasn&#x27;t so good really disappointed;( I was excited to use it:/</li>
            <li> It sucks! The liquid and powder is all sticky.. dislike</li>
            <li> I love this package. Works great everything came in just as described nothing damaged or open!!!!</li>
            <li> Many items were included in this and it&#x27;s perfect for at home nails, the big file and glue kinda sucks so make sure you have a good one on hand and it didn&#x27;t include any primer but as far as I can tell the important stuff has worked amazingly!</li>
            <li> Everything is new but the powder and liquid  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Box was slightly smashed, but that is okay. Everything came way before expected üëåüëåüëå This is amazing. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; work fantastically , there&#x27;s enough liquid that comes in a bottle to do up to 10 to 12 people nails ! It have everything u need if your a beginner ! And the price was worth it.  üåü</li>
            <li> The package was awesome. It came earlier than expected.  I love everything!!</li>
            <li> This is a good starter set. I&#x27;ve gotten about 4 full sets before I needed to purchase more nail tips and acrylic powder. It also arrived in half the time expected. The glitter and colored acrylic powder can&#x27;t be used as the regular acrylic powder is. Would recommend to a beginner, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This product came on time and was better than I had expected for the price, everything was in the package but when I tried using it for the first time the glue it came with was dried out... I suggest you buy your own nail glue when purchasing this product and buying a power nail drill as the nail filers weren&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li> Came but box was smashed and two things were ruined the square buffer and a blue square the rest fine</li>
            <li> I got exactly what the description said, but there was no primer.. it took kind of long to get but it was worth it. love the product.</li>
            <li> Have recieved my product, early (Thumbs up):), items are as described but the only thing is that the brushes were not what i thought them to be but its okay, Now im just waiting for the right time when i can have good ventalation ( still bit chilly here)to do this for the primer is strong smelling, it included an instruction sheet which is excellent. All and all i love it, love it, love it (this is his girlfriend, who wanted this)[[ASIN:B004MMUGY2 SASSI ACRYLIC KIT - Starter Nail kit with No burn primer/Acrylic Liquid/Powder/Brush and Instruction]]</li>
            <li> Love it! Everything was perfect, shipping was much faster! I tend to judge things by others reviews so I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t with this!</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet but it came as described and sooner than I expected. This kits does not come with no burn primer that prevents the acrylic from lifting. I have to wait to use the kit until I purchase primer.</li>
