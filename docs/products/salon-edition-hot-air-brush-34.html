            <li>So glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li>G-daughter liked it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the curl release feature often but is handy to have.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one and it is perfect for my very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>In checking with a beauty supply store it was suggested for the best deal and selection I should try good old Amazon.com and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Despite claims that this brush is tangle-free, it is very easy to get all snarled up in it</li>
            <li>This is a great hot- air brush!</li>
            <li>This brush was very good and did its job very well.  </li>
            <li>this was just what she wanted and makes doing her hair easier and faster than ever it work great and really is worth the money</li>
            <li>This has been an excellent product so far.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and never will tangle!</li>
            <li>It is a great hot air brush for the price.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush is so great.  </li>
            <li>and I could not find any brushes in retail stores, so I was happy to have found a hot air brush.</li>
            <li>The handle has a very comfortable grip and the brush moves well through my hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but this is a good find!</li>
            <li>Is good for a quick wash and go hairdo.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>And I think it will be much better</li>
            <li>It has worked for me for many many years.  </li>
            <li>Bought this because I thought it might eliminate one more step in hair styling.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you have longer hair, it would work better.</li>
            <li>This is the 6th one I have purchased and I love it for many reasons.</li>
            <li>I do not know if I need more practice or if it works better on thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Love this styling piece.</li>
            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>I like it better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PROCUCT.</li>
            <li>This one replaces the one I&#x27;ve had for many, many years that just quit on a trip to Spain.  </li>
            <li>Love this Tangle&#x3D;free product.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast service.</li>
            <li>I tried four or five times to use it correctly and found that if I wind any more than two to three inches of my hair onto the barrel, it tangles.</li>
            <li>The lower setting doesn&#x27;t seem worthwhile for me.  </li>
            <li>This 3/4 inch Salon Edition is perfect with two heat settings, also very quiet.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed and pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would work better than it did.  </li>
            <li>Most others start with a 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the Conair brand I bought at a discount store.</li>
            <li>I received this brush in mid january 2013 and was very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;m sure I will love it,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores and they do give out after a time, so was so glad to find it.  </li>
            <li>Barrel is the right size and heat is good.  </li>
            <li>Quality excellent, size is perfect for long or short hair.</li>
            <li>What more can I say but the title of this review.-----------------Any married man knows that if his wife likes it then it MUST BE GOOD.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes as they are fast and easy to use with great results.</li>
            <li>Have very fine hair and this worked out just fine for me.</li>
            <li>The bristles are perfect for my short, fine hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hot air brush as it is long-lasting and helps create great hair!</li>
            <li>The brush is wonderful for short to medium curly hair and can&#x27;t be beat for quick and easy touchups!  </li>
            <li>As a stylist, I love how easy it is to finish up my hair after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully on my hair when it is dry also.  </li>
            <li>Nicely built and heated quickly.</li>
            <li>I am surprised this received so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>I could see this being very good for giving short hair tons of volume and curls.</li>
            <li>Got this for my wife and she is quite happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>This item works great for soft curils.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily grasp with my somewhat arthritic thumb.  </li>
            <li>It is easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I like how my hair looks after using it, and I don&#x27;t burn myself like I did when  using a curling iron</li>
            <li>Place the brush part in a glass of water to soak, and the hair product that sticks to the brush cylinder plumps up and will be easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>This is a easy does it tool.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>This hot-air brush makes styling your hair so easy.</li>
            <li>The heat is not that high which is good for the hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>I already own one of these hot air brushes and bought this as a spare.  </li>
            <li>I liked everything about this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>My old one stopped working, so I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>so it holds your hair in place without tangling it, all the while blowing nice hot air on the curl.</li>
            <li>I can well imagine, however, that this would not be an ideal product for long hair.</li>
            <li>reference, I have fine hair that is almost shoulder length.</li>
            <li>i like the bristles and they hold my fine hair quite well.</li>
            <li>Initially I had some difficulty with best &amp; quickest use of the hot air brush, but once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li>It gives my fine hair a boost and helps with styling.</li>
            <li>This product works for me because I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Having used a Salon Edition hot air brush for years, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t find a better product at a better price.  </li>
            <li>I had owned the Revlon Hot Air Styler for several years and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Would start up again and seemed fine.</li>
            <li>Concept is great for easy styling of short hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Have never been very successful at using a curling iron so tried this hot air brush at the recommendation of a local hair stylist.</li>
            <li>It works great on my short fine hair.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is removable and easy to clean; this is an important feature.  </li>
            <li>They do a fabulous job and don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li>With wavy, fine AND color-treated hair, I have always been \\&quot;curling iron challenged\\&quot; and could easily burn my hair (or myself for that matter), so I have used hot air brushes as my solution to that for many years.</li>
            <li>The 2 settings are perfect, my hair is not too dried out.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold while you style.  </li>
            <li>Then this time I saw this Salon Edition one available in 3/4\\&quot; and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Gives you a smooth finish without damaging your hair</li>
            <li>Great Brush for short hair.  </li>
            <li>The brush is easy to clean (the gel builds up a bit) and there is a curl release</li>
            <li>I will go to buy it one day and it will no longer be available.</li>
            <li>But I never found a better price for the Salon Edition than right</li>
            <li>This dryer is awesome and makes curls that last for a week without wrapping or taking any particular care of my hair when I sleep.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and fairly quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Fast, easy to use; can give you many styles with practice.</li>
            <li>I never had a hot air brush before and just love it.  </li>
            <li>I found the hot air brush produces softer curls and gives my hair more body.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I have bought all kinds of hot air brushes and returned most of them.  </li>
            <li>After having burned myself one too many times with a curling iron, I decided to try the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>this is one hot air brush I love.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot brush.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered the 3/4&#x27; hot air brush from Helen of Troy, I&#x27;ve heard better things about that.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I need for my type of hair, and I am satisfied</li>
            <li>The Salon Edition Hot Air brush had better reviews than the Revlon one.</li>
            <li>The timing of delivery was more than adequate and it was the right size I needed for my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can clean it easier.  </li>
            <li>It smooth the hair and provides adequate heat.it</li>
            <li>The very first curl in the nap area tangled and it took 10 minutes for my husband to get my hair free.  </li>
            <li>My two adult daughters tried it and love it too!  </li>
            <li>I finally found this on Amazon, ordered and have a great hot air brush once again.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I like to style my hair with soft (just bent) curls to get a kind of \\&quot;Meg</li>
            <li>It does not get very hot-it does provide some lift to my hair but because it has a larger roller than my hair requires for an effective curl, it does not do what I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>This product would be good for someone with short hair.  </li>
            <li>Good for short hair.</li>
            <li>but you get a nice manageable hair style that I like because looks natural.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT FOR QUICK FIX AND SEMI WET HAIR.</li>
            <li>The hot air brush is so dependable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This hot air brush goes in your hair, and comes out easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy another one of these hot air brush stylers to keep on hand just in case the product is discontinued as so many good hot air brushes seem to have been in recent years.  </li>
            <li>I have used this hot air brush for several years and it is clearly the best out there.</li>
            <li>Adequate heat and airflow.  </li>
            <li>I was relieved to find this product, and the quality was even better than my older air brush.</li>
            <li>Still takes some time (30 minutes in my case, hair on top of my shoulder) and does not add high volume</li>
            <li>There are some definite advantages to this brush; it is tangle free, quiet, easy to handle and it does a very nice job curling the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was not sure if it would be easy to use on my own, but it is, and I just love it and the results..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product, as I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my hair and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It really puts out more hot air than the one I  am</li>
            <li>You simply can&#x27;t find a good hot air brush in every-day department stores.</li>
            <li>Would not use anything else for styling my hair, it is so fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Have been using the Hot Air Brush for well over 15 years!  </li>
            <li>so I can get a good loose curl.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great to be able to dry my hair and style it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>When I use this on my wet hair it does not pull or rip my hair out, it makes a lovely curl or fullness and only takes minutes to produce a great style.  </li>
            <li>and it takes most of the curl out of my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is short, so maybe that has something to do with how effective it is.  </li>
            <li>Have been purchasing this product for over 10 years and while they eventual wearout they are worth the value paid.</li>
            <li>My old hair brush, one of many in my lifetime, &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; so I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>The tongs on the end of the brush should be more rounded or have soft tips on the ends.</li>
            <li>This is a useful tool when styling your hair........</li>
            <li>When you are using some hair syling tools it is nice to have a extra set of hands.</li>
            <li>I picked this one, because it was the most like my old one.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold, picks up hair easily, 3/4 &amp;#34; which is very hard to find and is my MOST favorite feature.</li>
            <li>right now.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>my hair did not curl right and stay on the product.</li>
            <li>Price was right for the product.</li>
            <li>The barrel is too large and it doesn&#x27;t rotate as I&#x27;d thought!  </li>
            <li>How smart and efficient!</li>
            <li>It was exactly the right size for my hair.</li>
            <li>have only used this for a few days, but am very happy with the quality and construction, received timely and well packaged</li>
            <li>so I worried about the same problem, but it dries my hair really fast and leaves it with a nice curl.  </li>
            <li>I bought one previously and loved it</li>
            <li>Like all hot air brushes, if used all by itself, it is a slower process than a more powerful hand-held dryer.</li>
            <li>Although the shipping price was a little high, but the brush itself is great</li>
            <li>I tried the store bought Conair hot air brush</li>
            <li>The Hot Air Brush is exactly the beauty tool for which I had been looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair stylist and have used many different brands of air stylers.  </li>
            <li>The brush part eventually starts to get too hot at the handle and will begin to soften.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my wife was looking for.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted to replace my well used Salon Edition Hot Air Brush but could no longer find it for purchase  anywhere in my area.  </li>
            <li>It  doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch and works well.</li>
            <li>I thought if it was a \\&quot;rotating\\&quot; hot air brush, it would \\&quot;rotate\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>If you try to hold the hair around the brush, you end up burning your hand, head and neck, because it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>I have looked for a while for a hot air brush that works well.</li>
            <li>I thought i was ordering a vidal sasson hot air brush</li>
            <li>My first ever review - got so tangled using this product</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>but I have short hair and love the 1/2.  </li>
            <li>This is the first hot air brush I ever bought.</li>
            <li>Hot air brush has been my appliance for hair styling for 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Was expecting a hot air brush, this is not that.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush (8079R)]]  </li>
            <li>If this one outlasts the others I have used, then I will be sticking with Salon Edition hot air brushes.</li>
            <li>I use this hot air brush every day.  </li>
            <li>I knew it only had two settings, but I thought it would have more blowing power.</li>
            <li>I like this hot air brush better than a regular blow dryer because it gets IN there.</li>
            <li>Hot air brush and decided I wanted the 3/4&amp;#34; for summer months when I wear my hair shorter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Hot Air Brush for years.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot be without it!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this type of Hot Air brush for years now and for me,&lt;br /&gt;it works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a while now and because it doesn&#x27;t get so hot</li>
            <li>This hot air brush grips my hair and holds it in place.</li>
            <li>hot air brushes that I have tried.</li>
            <li>My niece who is a hairdresser bought me the first one.</li>
            <li>Use more on low.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush is the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere in the past ten years.</li>
            <li>My beautician first used this product on me</li>
            <li>UPDATE: began shutting off and motor smelled hot but nothing felt hot.</li>
            <li>Need a little more experience with it, but found it easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>This one works the best for me and my thick, short hair.  </li>
            <li>because when it says the barrel is easily removed, they mean it -- I was able to quickly and easily remove the bristle barrel, even while it was totally tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>What works best for me is to use a regular hand-held dryer until my hair is no longer sopping wet, just to the quite-damp stage.</li>
            <li>I really like this hot air styling brush.  </li>
            <li>Really like this hot air brush</li>
            <li>One review said it \\&quot;caught\\&quot; her hair, which I am sure it would do for long hair.</li>
            <li>So simple, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This was a smart buying choice.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of giving me some body without using a curling iron which is very hard on my hair.</li>
            <li>The motor is fine but the &#x27;brush&#x27; and the wand ultimately wear out.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is short and fine,  I like to use  the 3/4&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>For my fine short hair, I need one that does catch my hair, or else it just falls off.</li>
            <li>I really wish the company would consider making a 1/2 inch version of this, since my hair is short and fine.</li>
            <li>High is really hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put it in my cart and ready to order.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Deborah</li>
            <li>The results are much kinder to my hair (no burning, no frizz).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m letting  my hair grow out and this really helps put immediate body and wave into my otherwise really straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like it should be that diffficult to manufacture one of these, but there must be a real trick to getting the brush</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>They have much longer hair.  </li>
            <li>--that is how much I like this brand and model.</li>
            <li>Poor quality from the Manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;The seller worked great with me in resolving this issue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It does add body to the hair, but not as much as a 3/4 inch curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I think it was designed by someone who wants to torture people.  </li>
            <li>so I can get ready for work without wetting &amp; drying it.</li>
            <li>It works really well to control the curls and frizz on my hair.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it on my short-</li>
            <li>and they really like it.</li>
            <li>It is not making much difference on my hair styles.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>This switch is very temperamental.</li>
            <li>whole thing away-no information on how to return so wrote email in \\&quot;Contact US\\&quot;- until today no response.  </li>
            <li>Postage was too much to order another one.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li>I also have a backup in case the first one has a problem because I can&#x27;t live without this styling tool.</li>
            <li>Learned that for me it&#x27;s best to use hair dryer first to partially dry my hair prior to using the Salon hot air brush because my hair is thick and this helps with the process.</li>
            <li>Good product but my hair is not long enough for it to work properly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get so hot that you scorch your face or neck, but hot enough to produce the look of care free curls on short hair.  </li>
            <li>Could not find same kind in stores and what I bought was not as nice as my old broken one.  </li>
            <li>I might be as a result of the current style for super straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Better than average brush.  </li>
            <li>I gave it an average rating as I tend to get tangled more often than I care.</li>
            <li>So far I like using this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>It is still too early to determine if this one will perform better than the others after several months, but so far I like using it.  </li>
            <li>and she says this put fluff into your hair and makes her hair easy to do.</li>
            <li>If we can find anything that will help our hair to look halfway decent we will do anything to get it.</li>
            <li>Besides that, it&#x27;s the exact same thing as the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush 1574; it just looks fancier.</li>
            <li>I have slightly above shoulder length, fine, flat, slightly wavy colored hair with a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>this little hot air brush doesn&#x27;t get terribly hot but somehow pulls my hair into obedience quickly in the morning</li>
            <li>I will keep this product for special occasions but I am starting from square one on my search for the right blow brush to use daily.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly as it curls or gives body to the straightest or finest hair types.</li>
            <li>There is lots of power on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>About two years ago, I replaced my old hot brush with this model and it was such a dramatic improvement--I absolutely loved it!  </li>
            <li>I definitely would not recommend this hot air brush!  </li>
            <li>and I just have to figure it out, but I ripped the last hair out that I am willing to lose!  </li>
            <li>It could not grip my hair at all, though, which is surprising because I have very thick and lots of hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the Salon Edition Regular 3/4\\&quot; Tangle-free Hot Air Brush.  </li>
            <li>The cord is extra long which I also love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve traveled with them and they are small enough to fit easily into a carry-on.  </li>
            <li>Does what it states just wish it came in a smaller barrel as I have very short fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Because I have short, fine hair, there is enough power &amp; heat to style.  </li>
            <li>I have had my new air brush for a couple of months now and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I got my money&#x27;s worth out of my old Pro IV, but after 10 years, it finally died.</li>
            <li>, however, let alone do I want to go to that much effort and spend that much time daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Salon Edition 3/4 inch Hot Air Brush for several years having purchased it at a hair salon for about $35.  </li>
            <li>and I never had any problems until it died a natural death!  </li>
            <li>Now I am saying, \\&quot;Thank Goodness for Amazon because I have not only found another (found the first in a grocery store of all places)</li>
            <li>Tried a combination of regular blow dryer and a styling hot brush (a curling iron type brush without air), but that didn&#x27;t work for me either.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much daily, and it has performed well.  </li>
            <li>This is my second hot air brush in 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I had a hot air brush for several years.</li>
            <li>I had bought another hot air brush, but it was too big for my hair.</li>
            <li>: I got better results when using it on medium-high level of dampening hair and taking small portions of the hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer, which recently stopped working.</li>
            <li>I have a wedge style hair cut, with one side much longer than the other, and baby fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine and super thin.</li>
            <li>My old hot air brush had died and I couldn&#x27;t find one with a smaller diameter in stores.  </li>
            <li>Using this hot air brush eliminates the need to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have chin length fine hair with a choppy cut and use this air brush to flip up the ends.  </li>
            <li>I have chin-length hair and maybe it&#x27;s just not long enough, but I have not had success using this</li>
            <li>but it was a 1&amp;#34; and to large for the short hair do</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a smaller barrel than another one that I had, so it makes it a lot easier to style my very vine hair.</li>
            <li>This is the third Salon Edition Air Brush I&#x27;ve purchased (all three diameters), and it works really well on my shortish layered hair.  </li>
            <li>Does not work in curly hair -- only straight hair -- need to return it - how do I do that</li>
            <li>But, darn, this old one just died after a faithful run of two years, and I am replacing it with an identical model</li>
            <li>I am a professional hairstylist and use these in my salon.  </li>
            <li>Easier than my old hot&#x3D;air curler as it do not have a detangler.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been this tangled up in a hairbrush since I was six years old.</li>
            <li>It has not enough power for fast hair styling as I intented, dissapointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so my arm isn&#x27;t tired from holding it up for 15 minutes, which is good because with a regular blow dryer it would&#x27;ve taken me longer.</li>
            <li>I had a similar styler which I left at a hotel while on vacation, thought I would never find one that would work right again.</li>
            <li>See what I mean about it being my favorite?  </li>
            <li>or so dry and then use this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other round brushes in the past, and they all have more flexible bristles and never tangle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using my second hot air brush, as I gave the first one to a teenage relative.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find another one in the usual places (like drugstores), so I took a chance with Amazon, and there were several.  </li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair and use a curling iron to add body and a little wave to my hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>No more dropped dryer, brush or having to use a curling iron to smooth out the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>The Salon Edition Hot Air Brush 3/4 &amp;#34; helps give my hair volume and fluff.  </li>
            <li>I recently had my hair cut short and was unable to use my old hot air brush effectively.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine, color treated (blonde) hair that has a tendency to look dried out.</li>
            <li>It would take much longer for it to dry hair.</li>
            <li>It really dosen&#x27;t put out alot of air to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more difficult to find the hot air brushes that are 3/4\\&quot;, so I continued to use the same brand.  </li>
            <li>I use a regular hair dryer to almost dry my hair and then use this hot air brush to style it.  </li>
            <li>but, if set on high for too long, it stops.  </li>
            <li>This tangles your hair up so much you&#x27;ll never get loose!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;OK, it&#x27;s nearly 2 years later.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I do not like about it is that it is loud when it is turned on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an airbrush to style my hair for years, but recently, the motor on my old appliance burned out.</li>
            <li>(my old one occasionally tangled if I wrapped it too closely to the roots).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one of these brushes for years, but my old one finally quit.  </li>
            <li>Barely lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t too large for a women&#x27;s hand as are some of the other ones offered are.  </li>
            <li>With these &#x27;Salon Edition&#x27; hot air brushes (which are very hard to find) I blow my hair roots with the hair dryer until my hair is just alittle damp and then use the hot air brush to give it body.  </li>
            <li>Not effective for short of fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is a little guy, by the way... very petite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had trouble with another brand of hot air brush, so thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl.  </li>
            <li>In a few months I plan on buying another hot air brush and this one can become my backup dryer.</li>
            <li>In addition, other hot air burshes have been either too small or too large.</li>
            <li>I can naturally air dry my hair and finish it off with the air brush adding body and cur.  </li>
            <li>I have actually been using hot air brushes everyday for years</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I would have liked a one inch, but this is great!</li>
            <li> A hot-air brush is a great styling tool for those of us that are too uncoordinated to hold a hair dryer in one hand and a styling brush in another.  </li>

            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> So glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> G-daughter liked it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the curl release feature often but is handy to have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one and it is perfect for my very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> In checking with a beauty supply store it was suggested for the best deal and selection I should try good old Amazon.com and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Despite claims that this brush is tangle-free, it is very easy to get all snarled up in it</li>
            <li> This is a great hot- air brush!</li>
            <li> This brush was very good and did its job very well.  </li>
            <li> this was just what she wanted and makes doing her hair easier and faster than ever it work great and really is worth the money</li>
            <li> This has been an excellent product so far.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and never will tangle!</li>
            <li> It is a great hot air brush for the price.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is so great.  </li>
            <li> and I could not find any brushes in retail stores, so I was happy to have found a hot air brush.</li>
            <li> The handle has a very comfortable grip and the brush moves well through my hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but this is a good find!</li>
            <li> Is good for a quick wash and go hairdo.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> And I think it will be much better</li>
            <li> It has worked for me for many many years.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because I thought it might eliminate one more step in hair styling.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you have longer hair, it would work better.</li>
            <li> This is the 6th one I have purchased and I love it for many reasons.</li>
            <li> I do not know if I need more practice or if it works better on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Love this styling piece.</li>
            <li> I love this tool.</li>
            <li> I like it better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PROCUCT.</li>
            <li> This one replaces the one I&#x27;ve had for many, many years that just quit on a trip to Spain.  </li>
            <li> Love this Tangle&#x3D;free product.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast service.</li>
            <li> I tried four or five times to use it correctly and found that if I wind any more than two to three inches of my hair onto the barrel, it tangles.</li>
            <li> The lower setting doesn&#x27;t seem worthwhile for me.  </li>
            <li> This 3/4 inch Salon Edition is perfect with two heat settings, also very quiet.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed and pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I just love it.  </li>
            <li> Thought it would work better than it did.  </li>
            <li> Most others start with a 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the Conair brand I bought at a discount store.</li>
            <li> I received this brush in mid january 2013 and was very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;m sure I will love it,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores and they do give out after a time, so was so glad to find it.  </li>
            <li> Barrel is the right size and heat is good.  </li>
            <li> Quality excellent, size is perfect for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> What more can I say but the title of this review.-----------------Any married man knows that if his wife likes it then it MUST BE GOOD.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes as they are fast and easy to use with great results.</li>
            <li> Have very fine hair and this worked out just fine for me.</li>
            <li> The bristles are perfect for my short, fine hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hot air brush as it is long-lasting and helps create great hair!</li>
            <li> The brush is wonderful for short to medium curly hair and can&#x27;t be beat for quick and easy touchups!  </li>
            <li> As a stylist, I love how easy it is to finish up my hair after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderfully on my hair when it is dry also.  </li>
            <li> Nicely built and heated quickly.</li>
            <li> I am surprised this received so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I could see this being very good for giving short hair tons of volume and curls.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she is quite happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> This item works great for soft curils.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can easily grasp with my somewhat arthritic thumb.  </li>
            <li> It is easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and I like how my hair looks after using it, and I don&#x27;t burn myself like I did when  using a curling iron</li>
            <li> Place the brush part in a glass of water to soak, and the hair product that sticks to the brush cylinder plumps up and will be easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> This is a easy does it tool.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> This hot-air brush makes styling your hair so easy.</li>
            <li> The heat is not that high which is good for the hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> I already own one of these hot air brushes and bought this as a spare.  </li>
            <li> I liked everything about this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> My old one stopped working, so I was thrilled!</li>
            <li> so it holds your hair in place without tangling it, all the while blowing nice hot air on the curl.</li>
            <li> I can well imagine, however, that this would not be an ideal product for long hair.</li>
            <li> reference, I have fine hair that is almost shoulder length.</li>
            <li> i like the bristles and they hold my fine hair quite well.</li>
            <li> Initially I had some difficulty with best &amp; quickest use of the hot air brush, but once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li> It gives my fine hair a boost and helps with styling.</li>
            <li> This product works for me because I have fine hair</li>
            <li> Having used a Salon Edition hot air brush for years, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t find a better product at a better price.  </li>
            <li> I had owned the Revlon Hot Air Styler for several years and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Would start up again and seemed fine.</li>
            <li> Concept is great for easy styling of short hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Have never been very successful at using a curling iron so tried this hot air brush at the recommendation of a local hair stylist.</li>
            <li> It works great on my short fine hair.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is removable and easy to clean; this is an important feature.  </li>
            <li> They do a fabulous job and don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> With wavy, fine AND color-treated hair, I have always been \\&quot;curling iron challenged\\&quot; and could easily burn my hair (or myself for that matter), so I have used hot air brushes as my solution to that for many years.</li>
            <li> The 2 settings are perfect, my hair is not too dried out.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold while you style.  </li>
            <li> Then this time I saw this Salon Edition one available in 3/4\\&quot; and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Gives you a smooth finish without damaging your hair</li>
            <li> Great Brush for short hair.  </li>
            <li> The brush is easy to clean (the gel builds up a bit) and there is a curl release</li>
            <li> I will go to buy it one day and it will no longer be available.</li>
            <li> But I never found a better price for the Salon Edition than right</li>
            <li> This dryer is awesome and makes curls that last for a week without wrapping or taking any particular care of my hair when I sleep.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and fairly quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Fast, easy to use; can give you many styles with practice.</li>
            <li> I never had a hot air brush before and just love it.  </li>
            <li> I found the hot air brush produces softer curls and gives my hair more body.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought all kinds of hot air brushes and returned most of them.  </li>
            <li> After having burned myself one too many times with a curling iron, I decided to try the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> this is one hot air brush I love.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot brush.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered the 3/4&#x27; hot air brush from Helen of Troy, I&#x27;ve heard better things about that.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I need for my type of hair, and I am satisfied</li>
            <li> The Salon Edition Hot Air brush had better reviews than the Revlon one.</li>
            <li> The timing of delivery was more than adequate and it was the right size I needed for my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can clean it easier.  </li>
            <li> It smooth the hair and provides adequate heat.it</li>
            <li> The very first curl in the nap area tangled and it took 10 minutes for my husband to get my hair free.  </li>
            <li> My two adult daughters tried it and love it too!  </li>
            <li> I finally found this on Amazon, ordered and have a great hot air brush once again.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> I like to style my hair with soft (just bent) curls to get a kind of \\&quot;Meg</li>
            <li> It does not get very hot-it does provide some lift to my hair but because it has a larger roller than my hair requires for an effective curl, it does not do what I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> This product would be good for someone with short hair.  </li>
            <li> Good for short hair.</li>
            <li> but you get a nice manageable hair style that I like because looks natural.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT FOR QUICK FIX AND SEMI WET HAIR.</li>
            <li> The hot air brush is so dependable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This hot air brush goes in your hair, and comes out easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy another one of these hot air brush stylers to keep on hand just in case the product is discontinued as so many good hot air brushes seem to have been in recent years.  </li>
            <li> I have used this hot air brush for several years and it is clearly the best out there.</li>
            <li> Adequate heat and airflow.  </li>
            <li> I was relieved to find this product, and the quality was even better than my older air brush.</li>
            <li> Still takes some time (30 minutes in my case, hair on top of my shoulder) and does not add high volume</li>
            <li> There are some definite advantages to this brush; it is tangle free, quiet, easy to handle and it does a very nice job curling the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if it would be easy to use on my own, but it is, and I just love it and the results..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product, as I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my hair and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It really puts out more hot air than the one I  am</li>
            <li> You simply can&#x27;t find a good hot air brush in every-day department stores.</li>
            <li> Would not use anything else for styling my hair, it is so fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Hot Air Brush for well over 15 years!  </li>
            <li> so I can get a good loose curl.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great to be able to dry my hair and style it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> When I use this on my wet hair it does not pull or rip my hair out, it makes a lovely curl or fullness and only takes minutes to produce a great style.  </li>
            <li> and it takes most of the curl out of my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, so maybe that has something to do with how effective it is.  </li>
            <li> Have been purchasing this product for over 10 years and while they eventual wearout they are worth the value paid.</li>
            <li> My old hair brush, one of many in my lifetime, &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; so I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> The tongs on the end of the brush should be more rounded or have soft tips on the ends.</li>
            <li> This is a useful tool when styling your hair........</li>
            <li> When you are using some hair syling tools it is nice to have a extra set of hands.</li>
            <li> I picked this one, because it was the most like my old one.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold, picks up hair easily, 3/4 &amp;#34; which is very hard to find and is my MOST favorite feature.</li>
            <li> right now.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> my hair did not curl right and stay on the product.</li>
            <li> Price was right for the product.</li>
            <li> The barrel is too large and it doesn&#x27;t rotate as I&#x27;d thought!  </li>
            <li> How smart and efficient!</li>
            <li> It was exactly the right size for my hair.</li>
            <li> have only used this for a few days, but am very happy with the quality and construction, received timely and well packaged</li>
            <li> so I worried about the same problem, but it dries my hair really fast and leaves it with a nice curl.  </li>
            <li> I bought one previously and loved it</li>
            <li> Like all hot air brushes, if used all by itself, it is a slower process than a more powerful hand-held dryer.</li>
            <li> Although the shipping price was a little high, but the brush itself is great</li>
            <li> I tried the store bought Conair hot air brush</li>
            <li> The Hot Air Brush is exactly the beauty tool for which I had been looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and have used many different brands of air stylers.  </li>
            <li> The brush part eventually starts to get too hot at the handle and will begin to soften.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my wife was looking for.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted to replace my well used Salon Edition Hot Air Brush but could no longer find it for purchase  anywhere in my area.  </li>
            <li> It  doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch and works well.</li>
            <li> I thought if it was a \\&quot;rotating\\&quot; hot air brush, it would \\&quot;rotate\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If you try to hold the hair around the brush, you end up burning your hand, head and neck, because it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> I have looked for a while for a hot air brush that works well.</li>
            <li> I thought i was ordering a vidal sasson hot air brush</li>
            <li> My first ever review - got so tangled using this product</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> but I have short hair and love the 1/2.  </li>
            <li> This is the first hot air brush I ever bought.</li>
            <li> Hot air brush has been my appliance for hair styling for 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Was expecting a hot air brush, this is not that.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush (8079R)]]  </li>
            <li> If this one outlasts the others I have used, then I will be sticking with Salon Edition hot air brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this hot air brush every day.  </li>
            <li> I knew it only had two settings, but I thought it would have more blowing power.</li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush better than a regular blow dryer because it gets IN there.</li>
            <li> Hot air brush and decided I wanted the 3/4&amp;#34; for summer months when I wear my hair shorter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hot Air Brush for years.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot be without it!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this type of Hot Air brush for years now and for me,&lt;br /&gt;it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a while now and because it doesn&#x27;t get so hot</li>
            <li> This hot air brush grips my hair and holds it in place.</li>
            <li> hot air brushes that I have tried.</li>
            <li> My niece who is a hairdresser bought me the first one.</li>
            <li> Use more on low.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere in the past ten years.</li>
            <li> My beautician first used this product on me</li>
            <li> UPDATE: began shutting off and motor smelled hot but nothing felt hot.</li>
            <li> Need a little more experience with it, but found it easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> This one works the best for me and my thick, short hair.  </li>
            <li> because when it says the barrel is easily removed, they mean it -- I was able to quickly and easily remove the bristle barrel, even while it was totally tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> What works best for me is to use a regular hand-held dryer until my hair is no longer sopping wet, just to the quite-damp stage.</li>
            <li> I really like this hot air styling brush.  </li>
            <li> Really like this hot air brush</li>
            <li> One review said it \\&quot;caught\\&quot; her hair, which I am sure it would do for long hair.</li>
            <li> So simple, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was a smart buying choice.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of giving me some body without using a curling iron which is very hard on my hair.</li>
            <li> The motor is fine but the &#x27;brush&#x27; and the wand ultimately wear out.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is short and fine,  I like to use  the 3/4&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> For my fine short hair, I need one that does catch my hair, or else it just falls off.</li>
            <li> I really wish the company would consider making a 1/2 inch version of this, since my hair is short and fine.</li>
            <li> High is really hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put it in my cart and ready to order.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Deborah</li>
            <li> The results are much kinder to my hair (no burning, no frizz).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting  my hair grow out and this really helps put immediate body and wave into my otherwise really straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like it should be that diffficult to manufacture one of these, but there must be a real trick to getting the brush</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> They have much longer hair.  </li>
            <li> --that is how much I like this brand and model.</li>
            <li> Poor quality from the Manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;The seller worked great with me in resolving this issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It does add body to the hair, but not as much as a 3/4 inch curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I think it was designed by someone who wants to torture people.  </li>
            <li> so I can get ready for work without wetting &amp; drying it.</li>
            <li> It works really well to control the curls and frizz on my hair.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it on my short-</li>
            <li> and they really like it.</li>
            <li> It is not making much difference on my hair styles.</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> This switch is very temperamental.</li>
            <li> whole thing away-no information on how to return so wrote email in \\&quot;Contact US\\&quot;- until today no response.  </li>
            <li> Postage was too much to order another one.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li> I also have a backup in case the first one has a problem because I can&#x27;t live without this styling tool.</li>
            <li> Learned that for me it&#x27;s best to use hair dryer first to partially dry my hair prior to using the Salon hot air brush because my hair is thick and this helps with the process.</li>
            <li> Good product but my hair is not long enough for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get so hot that you scorch your face or neck, but hot enough to produce the look of care free curls on short hair.  </li>
            <li> Could not find same kind in stores and what I bought was not as nice as my old broken one.  </li>
            <li> I might be as a result of the current style for super straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Better than average brush.  </li>
            <li> I gave it an average rating as I tend to get tangled more often than I care.</li>
            <li> So far I like using this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> It is still too early to determine if this one will perform better than the others after several months, but so far I like using it.  </li>
            <li> and she says this put fluff into your hair and makes her hair easy to do.</li>
            <li> If we can find anything that will help our hair to look halfway decent we will do anything to get it.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it&#x27;s the exact same thing as the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush 1574; it just looks fancier.</li>
            <li> I have slightly above shoulder length, fine, flat, slightly wavy colored hair with a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> this little hot air brush doesn&#x27;t get terribly hot but somehow pulls my hair into obedience quickly in the morning</li>
            <li> I will keep this product for special occasions but I am starting from square one on my search for the right blow brush to use daily.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly as it curls or gives body to the straightest or finest hair types.</li>
            <li> There is lots of power on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> About two years ago, I replaced my old hot brush with this model and it was such a dramatic improvement--I absolutely loved it!  </li>
            <li> I definitely would not recommend this hot air brush!  </li>
            <li> and I just have to figure it out, but I ripped the last hair out that I am willing to lose!  </li>
            <li> It could not grip my hair at all, though, which is surprising because I have very thick and lots of hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Salon Edition Regular 3/4\\&quot; Tangle-free Hot Air Brush.  </li>
            <li> The cord is extra long which I also love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve traveled with them and they are small enough to fit easily into a carry-on.  </li>
            <li> Does what it states just wish it came in a smaller barrel as I have very short fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Because I have short, fine hair, there is enough power &amp; heat to style.  </li>
            <li> I have had my new air brush for a couple of months now and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I got my money&#x27;s worth out of my old Pro IV, but after 10 years, it finally died.</li>
            <li> , however, let alone do I want to go to that much effort and spend that much time daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Salon Edition 3/4 inch Hot Air Brush for several years having purchased it at a hair salon for about $35.  </li>
            <li> and I never had any problems until it died a natural death!  </li>
            <li> Now I am saying, \\&quot;Thank Goodness for Amazon because I have not only found another (found the first in a grocery store of all places)</li>
            <li> Tried a combination of regular blow dryer and a styling hot brush (a curling iron type brush without air), but that didn&#x27;t work for me either.</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much daily, and it has performed well.  </li>
            <li> This is my second hot air brush in 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush for several years.</li>
            <li> I had bought another hot air brush, but it was too big for my hair.</li>
            <li> : I got better results when using it on medium-high level of dampening hair and taking small portions of the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer, which recently stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have a wedge style hair cut, with one side much longer than the other, and baby fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine and super thin.</li>
            <li> My old hot air brush had died and I couldn&#x27;t find one with a smaller diameter in stores.  </li>
            <li> Using this hot air brush eliminates the need to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have chin length fine hair with a choppy cut and use this air brush to flip up the ends.  </li>
            <li> I have chin-length hair and maybe it&#x27;s just not long enough, but I have not had success using this</li>
            <li> but it was a 1&amp;#34; and to large for the short hair do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a smaller barrel than another one that I had, so it makes it a lot easier to style my very vine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the third Salon Edition Air Brush I&#x27;ve purchased (all three diameters), and it works really well on my shortish layered hair.  </li>
            <li> Does not work in curly hair -- only straight hair -- need to return it - how do I do that</li>
            <li> But, darn, this old one just died after a faithful run of two years, and I am replacing it with an identical model</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist and use these in my salon.  </li>
            <li> Easier than my old hot&#x3D;air curler as it do not have a detangler.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been this tangled up in a hairbrush since I was six years old.</li>
            <li> It has not enough power for fast hair styling as I intented, dissapointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my arm isn&#x27;t tired from holding it up for 15 minutes, which is good because with a regular blow dryer it would&#x27;ve taken me longer.</li>
            <li> I had a similar styler which I left at a hotel while on vacation, thought I would never find one that would work right again.</li>
            <li> See what I mean about it being my favorite?  </li>
            <li> or so dry and then use this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other round brushes in the past, and they all have more flexible bristles and never tangle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using my second hot air brush, as I gave the first one to a teenage relative.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to find another one in the usual places (like drugstores), so I took a chance with Amazon, and there were several.  </li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair and use a curling iron to add body and a little wave to my hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> No more dropped dryer, brush or having to use a curling iron to smooth out the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> The Salon Edition Hot Air Brush 3/4 &amp;#34; helps give my hair volume and fluff.  </li>
            <li> I recently had my hair cut short and was unable to use my old hot air brush effectively.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine, color treated (blonde) hair that has a tendency to look dried out.</li>
            <li> It would take much longer for it to dry hair.</li>
            <li> It really dosen&#x27;t put out alot of air to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to be more difficult to find the hot air brushes that are 3/4\\&quot;, so I continued to use the same brand.  </li>
            <li> I use a regular hair dryer to almost dry my hair and then use this hot air brush to style it.  </li>
            <li> but, if set on high for too long, it stops.  </li>
            <li> This tangles your hair up so much you&#x27;ll never get loose!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;OK, it&#x27;s nearly 2 years later.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I do not like about it is that it is loud when it is turned on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an airbrush to style my hair for years, but recently, the motor on my old appliance burned out.</li>
            <li> (my old one occasionally tangled if I wrapped it too closely to the roots).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these brushes for years, but my old one finally quit.  </li>
            <li> Barely lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t too large for a women&#x27;s hand as are some of the other ones offered are.  </li>
            <li> With these &#x27;Salon Edition&#x27; hot air brushes (which are very hard to find) I blow my hair roots with the hair dryer until my hair is just alittle damp and then use the hot air brush to give it body.  </li>
            <li> Not effective for short of fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little guy, by the way... very petite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with another brand of hot air brush, so thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl.  </li>
            <li> In a few months I plan on buying another hot air brush and this one can become my backup dryer.</li>
            <li> In addition, other hot air burshes have been either too small or too large.</li>
            <li> I can naturally air dry my hair and finish it off with the air brush adding body and cur.  </li>
            <li> I have actually been using hot air brushes everyday for years</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a hot air curling brush and especially this size</li>
            <li> Also lint gets trapped in the air intake end and not easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Terrific product and would recommend it to anyone with short or long hair.  </li>
            <li> If at times your hair is hard to manage, this hot air brush might be the answer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Salon Edition hot air brushes for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much should be&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually it won&#x27;t hold a curl or be straight.</li>
            <li> I recently threw one away that was 3 years old only because it  was crusty with dried on hairspray.</li>
            <li> No need for a curling iron or flat iron follow-up either.</li>
            <li> The long cord is the only reason this gets a 4 star rating.  </li>
            <li> No different than a roller brush other than the air comes out of the small holes on the hot air part.</li>
            <li> It was only 6 inches long!  </li>
            <li> I am African-American and have finally found a one-step process to both dry and curl my hair without frying and wrecking it.</li>
            <li> and I can dry and curl it at the same time.</li>
            <li> I can dry and brush at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I always have to have one to dry my hair and style it at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have owned several and this one doesn&#x27;t dry as well as the others.</li>
            <li> Let the part dry, replace, and you are back in business.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it would work well for someone with long thick hair without first drying hair to the damp stage.</li>
            <li> It works so well on short, layered, thinner hair - when other similar products can not come close.  </li>
            <li> My hair has no body and is so thin and baby fine that I cannot use a curling iron, it ruins my hair.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m careful with this one and it does have a low setting.  </li>
            <li> The rotating brush makes it harder to use on short hair.</li>
            <li> about long?</li>
            <li> I guess you have to have medium or long hair for</li>
            <li> Has long swivel cord and a button for detangling.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of wrapping small sections of my (fine, thin, shoulder-length) hair loosely around it and NOT pulling the curl tighter at all, this product left me with a head of big bouncy curls that stayed all day without hairspray.</li>
            <li> I usually blow dry it until it is just a little damp then use the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, short hair which is really frustrating to style.  </li>
            <li> The brush works very well, get much hotter than the less expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I put styling product in my hair, then let it air dry</li>
            <li> I dry my hair to dampness and then style with the brush.  </li>
            <li> I used to blow dry then curl.  </li>
            <li> What it did do that the curling iron doesn&#x27;t is dry out my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> its easier to dry and style hair and not damage it like the blow driers do</li>
            <li> plus it allows you to style as you dry.  </li>
            <li> They fixed the only complaint I had.</li>
            <li> Anyone with thin, straight hair (a curse!) knows what I am talking about.</li>
            <li> But I like to style my hair with some bend and loose curls and this brush does the trick for a flattering look.</li>
            <li> Helps to dry, add lift and curl all while helping save time and electrical outlets!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and short and normally I would use curling irons.  </li>
            <li> They either conk out, get tangled, blow too softly, get too hot, or are awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> I have to wet it and blow it dry if I want to look like I didn&#x27;t crawl out of the dumpster.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; they are very firm and don&#x27;t bend much at all, and the round ball on the end of each bristle guarantees it will grab on to</li>
            <li> It is probably easier to use a regular hairdryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only recommend this for short, thick</li>
            <li> The only negative is it is it takes a long time to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews of the Salon Edition, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I do say it works for short hair not sure</li>
            <li> What a big waste of money!</li>
            <li> One because it moves air and the other</li>
            <li> Had other ones that were cheaper and there is a reason they were cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It works so well, and doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair like other products.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands.</li>
            <li> Only negative:  </li>
            <li> But this one is definitely a BIG negative.  </li>
            <li> and I also need to buy one for my mother to replace the worthless one I gifted her years ago.</li>
            <li> I have short and thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It will start again after it cools down.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to brush and dry my hair with a heavy blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other.  </li>
            <li> my hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t wind the hair tightly on the styler</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that little detail while purchasing.  </li>
            <li> I have very hard to curl hair and this brush can actually curl it.</li>
            <li> But, be careful not to drop it on a hard tile floor.</li>
            <li> I have used it nearly everyday and now the piece at the end that covers the cord and let&#x27;s it swivel has cracked and won&#x27;t hold together any longer.</li>
            <li> This type of styling brush with the 3/4 &amp;#34; curl is not available everywhere.</li>
            <li> Fluffy and a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> It just take a few minutes and my hair does not stick out and look messy from sleeping.</li>
            <li> , I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like curling irons and can&#x27;t manage to manipulate dryers and round brushes.  </li>
            <li> I use one everyday in my salon</li>
            <li> But I will settle for that rather than have to hold a round brush and hair dryer.</li>
            <li> rotate curling tools so I have not used it everyday since that</li>
            <li> Then I switch to the Salon Edition with a little mousse or gel and style away!</li>
            <li> Very little air comes out of brush and heat is so-so.</li>
            <li> Was not sure how this would work.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small the roller would be and it doesn&#x27;t work well for me for that reason.</li>
            <li> It is too slick, and your hair will not stay wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li> Usually my hair can&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li> At 3/4\\&quot;, the circumference is a bit too small for my liking.</li>
            <li> So just to test it out, I tried a small section of shorter hair in front.  </li>
            <li> It was NOT a hot air brush - did not &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; any air at all - falsely advertised,  I returned it</li>
            <li> and I am not very good at using a blow dryer and brush.  </li>
            <li> However, this keeps cutting out on me--is there a short in it?</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the curl release switch.</li>
            <li> to medium thick hair.sturdy piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with product or service for returning-most times</li>
            <li> but unfortunately mine have typically quit working after about one year of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 10 at this point!</li>
            <li> Had broken piece in box when arrived-could not figure where it was supposed to go so threw</li>
            <li> Seems unnecessary and cumbersome at times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It loses the other three stars because I can&#x27;t use it without tangling it terribly my hair.</li>
            <li> but I guess I ordered the wrong one.</li>
            <li> I answered yes which was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not keep the box for this item, so I cannot return it.</li>
            <li> So this product failed that test with me.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> disappointed, I thought it should have lated</li>
            <li> and I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> it can get terribly tangled despite the barrel release and after a while the barrel may tend to release all by itself.</li>
            <li> It was a terrible purchase, and I will be returning it immediately!</li>

            <li> Use every day.  Good tool for the money</li>
            <li> The brush works very well, get much hotter than the less expensive ones.  I did have a cheaper Helen of Troy brush that worked for about one year and then it over heated and singed my hair.  So I&#x27;m careful with this one and it does have a low setting.  I have very hard to curl hair and this brush can actually curl it.</li>
            <li> It is a great hot air brush for the price. Shipping was fast and I love it. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Salon Edition 3/4 inch Hot Air Brush for several years having purchased it at a hair salon for about $35.  The bristles are perfect for my short, fine hair and I never had any problems until it died a natural death!  I tried the store bought Conair hot air brush and it was wimpy so I returned it for money back.  In checking with a beauty supply store it was suggested for the best deal and selection I should try good old Amazon.com and am I glad I did.  I&#x27;ve put it in my cart and ready to order.  I love Amazon.com!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nana</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is really wonderful.  It&#x27;s got a smaller barrel than another one that I had, so it makes it a lot easier to style my very vine hair.</li>
            <li> Was not sure how this would work.  But it meets all my expectations.....it will be one of my favorite tools!</li>
            <li> I never had a hot air brush before and just love it.  My hair is thin and short and normally I would use curling irons.  I found the hot air brush produces softer curls and gives my hair more body.  I ordered another one to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> What more can I say but the title of this review.-----------------Any married man knows that if his wife likes it then it MUST BE GOOD.</li>
            <li> I am African-American and have finally found a one-step process to both dry and curl my hair without frying and wrecking it. This dryer is awesome and makes curls that last for a week without wrapping or taking any particular care of my hair when I sleep. The only reason I gave it four-stars instead of five is if your hair is a bit longer than the barrel size can handle it can get terribly tangled despite the barrel release and after a while the barrel may tend to release all by itself. Those issues aside, this is still hands-down the best hair styling aid I have ever used. Now I am saying, \\&quot;Thank Goodness for Amazon because I have not only found another (found the first in a grocery store of all places) but I have found the larger barrel now that my hair has gotten longer!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I have chin length fine hair with a choppy cut and use this air brush to flip up the ends.  I love it so much I always keep two spares in reserve just in case the model is discontinued.  It has proved to be a workhorse. I recently threw one away that was 3 years old only because it  was crusty with dried on hairspray. I appreciate the smaller 3/4\\&quot; diameter. It also has enough blowing power to add volume to my hair. My only regret is that there is no dual voltage model so I can take it overseas.</li>
            <li> I received my Hot Air Brush in excellent condition.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product, as I needed a new one.  Thanks, Deborah</li>
            <li> not enough heat to help do anything with my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the third Salon Edition Air Brush I&#x27;ve purchased (all three diameters), and it works really well on my shortish layered hair.  It&#x27;s not for everybody, but perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Salon Edition hot air brushes for at least 5 years. They do a fabulous job and don&#x27;t damage your hair. Great to be able to purchase these without paying salon prices!</li>
            <li> I really like the hot air brush.  I like the fact that you can clean it easier.  Although the shipping price was a little high, but the brush itself is great</li>
            <li> The Hot Air Brush is exactly the beauty tool for which I had been looking.  I had been using one made by Helen of Troy, but the Conair does not have a rotating brush which the Helen of Troy does.  The rotating brush makes it harder to use on short hair.</li>
            <li> I had a similar styler which I left at a hotel while on vacation, thought I would never find one that would work right again. I purchased this one and it is perfect for my very fine, straight hair. It does a great job of giving me some body without using a curling iron which is very hard on my hair. I have had it a month and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and have used many different brands of air stylers.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for about 2 weeks and it works great.  Has all the features you need, doesn&#x27;t tangle in the hair and the end comes off for cleaning which is a great feature.</li>
            <li> There are some definite advantages to this brush; it is tangle free, quiet, easy to handle and it does a very nice job curling the ends of my hair.  The only negative is it is it takes a long time to dry my hair.  I usually blow dry it until it is just a little damp then use the hot air brush.  So far I have been very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Better than average brush.  Can&#x27;t find 3/4\\&quot; in local stores anymore.   I use mine every day and lasts about a year.  The brush part eventually starts to get too hot at the handle and will begin to soften. Also lint gets trapped in the air intake end and not easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Sometime my hair get suck but in does make get waves in my hair and my hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li> Styles well. Doesn&#x27;t snarl your hair. Easy to use. Only thing I would watch for is that the tip sometimes goes around and around when you don&#x27;t want it to. Hasn&#x27;t happened but only once.</li>
            <li> My hair has no body and is so thin and baby fine that I cannot use a curling iron, it ruins my hair.  With these &#x27;Salon Edition&#x27; hot air brushes (which are very hard to find) I blow my hair roots with the hair dryer until my hair is just alittle damp and then use the hot air brush to give it body.  They are perfect at 250 watts and I hope you carry them forever.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I find it hard to brush and dry my hair with a heavy blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other.  This hot air brush is so great.  It&#x27;s gentle on my hair and so easy to use.  No more dropped dryer, brush or having to use a curling iron to smooth out the frizzies.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It was NOT a hot air brush - did not &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; any air at all - falsely advertised,  I returned it</li>
            <li> With wavy, fine AND color-treated hair, I have always been \\&quot;curling iron challenged\\&quot; and could easily burn my hair (or myself for that matter), so I have used hot air brushes as my solution to that for many years. I got my money&#x27;s worth out of my old Pro IV, but after 10 years, it finally died. My next experiment with a Jilbere de Paris was a disaster. Not enough power and it tangled my hair every time. Tried a combination of regular blow dryer and a styling hot brush (a curling iron type brush without air), but that didn&#x27;t work for me either. Results were always frizzy. After reading other reviews of the Salon Edition, I decided to give it a try. Nice! Good power, (2 speeds even!) flexible and with occasional use of the release button, my hair does not get tangled in it. Like all hot air brushes, if used all by itself, it is a slower process than a more powerful hand-held dryer. I don&#x27;t get enough control with that and it takes most of the curl out of my naturally wavy hair. What works best for me is to use a regular hand-held dryer until my hair is no longer sopping wet, just to the quite-damp stage. Then I switch to the Salon Edition with a little mousse or gel and style away! No need for a curling iron or flat iron follow-up either. The results are much kinder to my hair (no burning, no frizz). I hope I don&#x27;t have to shop again for another 10 years! But I never found a better price for the Salon Edition than right here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, it&#x27;s nearly 2 years later. I have used it nearly everyday and now the piece at the end that covers the cord and let&#x27;s it swivel has cracked and won&#x27;t hold together any longer. It does not seem to have affected the way it works, but I am not taking any chances and will buy a replacement. I don&#x27;t think I dropped it, but who knows? I dragged it all over the world with me traveling and never had a problem with it, so I am still a fan! March 21, 2013.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever had. Quality excellent, size is perfect for long or short hair. I recommend this product highly as it curls or gives body to the straightest or finest hair types. The 2 settings are perfect, my hair is not too dried out. What can I say, would buy again or recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite some time.  It needs to be replaced periodically.  (I use it every day!)  I can&#x27;t always find it in the stores and I always like to have an extra in my home and workplace.  The brush is wonderful for short to medium curly hair and can&#x27;t be beat for quick and easy touchups!  Finding a supply source through my Amazon account               put the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> It really puts out more hot air than the one I  am&lt;br /&gt;using right now. And I think it will be much better&lt;br /&gt;for my hair than a Curling Iron. Thank you for&lt;br /&gt;carrying it. One thing I wish it would of come with&lt;br /&gt;an instruction booklet. Not sure how much should be&lt;br /&gt;dried before using it. All in All a very good Brush&lt;br /&gt;Iron.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine, color treated (blonde) hair that has a tendency to look dried out. This product is great! I put styling product in my hair, then let it air dry so it&#x27;s 90% or so dry and then use this hot air brush. It&#x27;s a great finisher and makes my ends look healthy. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I already own one of these hot air brushes and bought this as a spare.  As a stylist, I love how easy it is to finish up my hair after blow drying.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Not effective for short of fine hair. The barrel is too large and it doesn&#x27;t rotate as I&#x27;d thought!  Received refund!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my wife was looking for. This type of styling brush with the 3/4 &amp;#34; curl is not available everywhere.</li>
            <li> Ist im Grossen und Ganzen gut,nur manchmal verfangen sich die Haare und es ist nicht einfach diese wieder abzurollen. Zum Glueck ist es nicht allzuoft passiert . Bin zufrieden</li>
            <li> Hair gets tangled in brush.</li>
            <li> I have bought all kinds of hot air brushes and returned most of them.  This one works the best for me and my thick, short hair.  I like to style my hair with soft (just bent) curls to get a kind of \\&quot;Meg Ryan\\&quot; look.  Fluffy and a bit messy.  Even though my hair is a bit coarse, this styling tool works well for me.  It doesn&#x27;t get so hot that you scorch your face or neck, but hot enough to produce the look of care free curls on short hair.  I bought the 3/4\\&quot; inch size but I don&#x27;t wind the hair tightly on the styler so I can get a good loose curl.  The handle is well designed and very good.  It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t too large for a women&#x27;s hand as are some of the other ones offered are.  It is comfortable to hold while you style.  I&#x27;ll buy another one of these hot air brush stylers to keep on hand just in case the product is discontinued as so many good hot air brushes seem to have been in recent years.  I might be as a result of the current style for super straight hair.  But I like to style my hair with some bend and loose curls and this brush does the trick for a flattering look.</li>
            <li> Relatively easy to use. I can easily grasp with my somewhat arthritic thumb.  Only negative:  The release button for the roller does not work well all the time.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, short hair which is really frustrating to style.  The Salon Edition Hot Air Brush 3/4 &amp;#34; helps give my hair volume and fluff.  It has worked for me for many many years.  I dry my hair to dampness and then style with the brush.  It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting  my hair grow out and this really helps put immediate body and wave into my otherwise really straight hair.  Is good for a quick wash and go hairdo.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted to replace my well used Salon Edition Hot Air Brush but could no longer find it for purchase  anywhere in my area.  It works so well on short, layered, thinner hair - when other similar products can not come close.  Easy to use and never will tangle!</li>
            <li> Bought this because I thought it might eliminate one more step in hair styling.  My hair is short, so maybe that has something to do with how effective it is.  It does not get very hot-it does provide some lift to my hair but because it has a larger roller than my hair requires for an effective curl, it does not do what I would have liked.  Maybe if you have longer hair, it would work better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for hair styling and easy to handle. Have been purchasing this product for over 10 years and while they eventual wearout they are worth the value paid. Diane</li>
            <li> Yes I have a short hair cut and I can dry and curl it at the same time. It is easy. I do say it works for short hair not sure about long? It just take a few minutes and my hair does not stick out and look messy from sleeping.</li>
            <li> This was a smart buying choice. I liked everything about this hot air brush.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this hot air styling brush.  It  doesn&#x27;t get hot to the touch and works well. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the 6th one I have purchased and I love it for many reasons. Easy to hold, picks up hair easily, 3/4 &amp;#34; which is very hard to find and is my MOST favorite feature., the price is always right, and on and on...  Please keep it on the market!!!!  But just in case your phasing it out,,,,, I purchased two at a time this last order..  See what I mean about it being my favorite?  I can&#x27;t be the only consumer that has tried just about every one on the shelves to buy and then return them as they just don&#x27;t &amp;#34;measure up&amp;#34; to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This product would be good for someone with short hair.  I didn&#x27;t realize how small the roller would be and it doesn&#x27;t work well for me for that reason.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. It has two settings which is perfect. . It does a very good job. Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I thought if it was a \\&quot;rotating\\&quot; hot air brush, it would \\&quot;rotate\\&quot;. NOT the case. It does rotate if I rotate it. No different than a roller brush other than the air comes out of the small holes on the hot air part. It would take much longer for it to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I like this brush but it doesn&#x27;t curls enough for me even though, I use it everyday I still need to us a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Does what it states just wish it came in a smaller barrel as I have very short fine hair.  Now that I have used the Air Brush will not go back to blow drier and brush.</li>
            <li> I like that I can dry and brush at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;With my fine hair is should be ideal. I gave it an average rating as I tend to get tangled more often than I care. I do not know if I need more practice or if it works better on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Because I have short, fine hair, there is enough power &amp; heat to style.  Don&#x27;t think it would work well for someone with long thick hair without first drying hair to the damp stage.</li>
            <li> I received my order in two days.  I was so happy because I didn&#x27;t expect it that soon.  My old one stopped working, so I was thrilled!</li>
            <li> Does not work in curly hair -- only straight hair -- need to return it - how do I do that</li>
            <li> I used to blow dry then curl.  Now I just use this.  Easy to use.  Great results.  I have shoulder-length hair.  Love this styling piece.</li>
            <li> I have used this styling brush for years.  I have short hair and it is the only styling tool that I need to do my hair every morning.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I definitely would not recommend this hot air brush!  It is too slick, and your hair will not stay wrapped around it.  If you try to hold the hair around the brush, you end up burning your hand, head and neck, because it gets too hot.  It was a terrible purchase, and I will be returning it immediately!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with another brand of hot air brush, so thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl.  I use it pretty much daily, and it has performed well.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this tool. I always have to have one to dry my hair and style it at the same time. How smart and efficient! It does a wonderful job, and quickly. I was so happy to find it here because I had been looking for one for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I have looked for a while for a hot air brush that works well. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it should be that diffficult to manufacture one of these, but there must be a real trick to getting the brush just right so it holds your hair in place without tangling it, all the while blowing nice hot air on the curl. You simply can&#x27;t find a good hot air brush in every-day department stores. This brush works great; now I can get rid of the substandard ones I bought and I also need to buy one for my mother to replace the worthless one I gifted her years ago.</li>
            <li> I use a regular hair dryer to almost dry my hair and then use this hot air brush to style it.  I like it better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and I like how my hair looks after using it, and I don&#x27;t burn myself like I did when  using a curling iron</li>
            <li> I thought i was ordering a vidal sasson hot air brush but I guess I ordered the wrong one. It works great. just used to the vidal sasson one it had a smaller brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/10 someone just asked me if the brush spins. I answered yes which was wrong. The brush does not spin</li>
            <li> My first ever review - got so tangled using this product I had no choice but to CUT my hair off!</li>
            <li> I wanted this product to work for me but it just did not I have short hair and this product my hair did not curl right and stay on the product. I was disappointed so I returned it it was a costly transaction and they had a return product fee which if I had known would not have purchased it. But, Amazon came thru and offered me a credit for the fee. Thanks Amazon I know I can depend on them to handle things that is why I buy from them and their sellers,</li>
            <li> Concept is great for easy styling of short hair.  However, this keeps cutting out on me--is there a short in it?</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PROCUCT. WORKS GREAT FOR QUICK FIX AND SEMI WET HAIR.</li>
            <li> I guess you have to have medium or long hair for this to work well.  I have short hair and it was a disaster. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> My old hair brush, one of many in my lifetime, &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; so I ordered this one.  To my joyous surprise, it is the best air brush I have ever owned!  I have a wedge style hair cut, with one side much longer than the other, and baby fine blonde hair.  When I use this on my wet hair it does not pull or rip my hair out, it makes a lovely curl or fullness and only takes minutes to produce a great style.  It works wonderfully on my hair when it is dry also.  I plan on ordering another one for our guest bathroom.  My two adult daughters tried it and love it too!  They have much longer hair.  We all agreed, it is a winner!</li>
            <li> I really like the Salon Edition Regular 3/4\\&quot; Tangle-free Hot Air Brush.  About two years ago, I replaced my old hot brush with this model and it was such a dramatic improvement--I absolutely loved it!  But, darn, this old one just died after a faithful run of two years, and I am replacing it with an identical model--that is how much I like this brand and model.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t hold the hair. The barrel is too short and spins.Doesn&#x27;t engage with the lock. Poor quality from the Manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;The seller worked great with me in resolving this issue.I wouldn&#x27;t be hesitant in buying anything from Cache Beauty.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  The timing of delivery was more than adequate and it was the right size I needed for my hair.</li>
            <li> I wish salon edition would start making this model in 1/2 like they used to .  I believe I have bought everyone of the last that they made.  I am a professional hairstylist and use these in my salon.  I have one of every size but I have short hair and love the 1/2.  That you can no longer get.</li>
            <li> This is the first hot air brush I ever bought. It&#x27;s reasonably priced. It works well. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> After having burned myself one too many times with a curling iron, I decided to try the hot air brush.  I have short, fine hair and use a curling iron to add body and a little wave to my hairstyle.  It does add body to the hair, but not as much as a 3/4 inch curling iron.  What it did do that the curling iron doesn&#x27;t is dry out my hair and scalp.  So I&#x27;ve returned to using the curling iron.</li>
            <li> Hot air brush has been my appliance for hair styling for 30 years.  Don&#x27;t like curling irons and can&#x27;t manage to manipulate dryers and round brushes.  I can naturally air dry my hair and finish it off with the air brush adding body and cur.  This one replaces the one I&#x27;ve had for many, many years that just quit on a trip to Spain.  This one works great, and I am satisfied. Adequate heat and airflow.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> this is one hot air brush I love.  Have bought for me and clients.  I use one everyday in my salon</li>
            <li> Love this Tangle&#x3D;free product.  Easier than my old hot&#x3D;air curler as it do not have a detangler. Great price and fast service.</li>
            <li> Seems like all items you look at have mixed reviews and I try to wade through them all and make an informed decision. But this one is definitely a BIG negative.  This tangles your hair up so much you&#x27;ll never get loose!  I kept thinking there is a trick to it and I just have to figure it out, but I ripped the last hair out that I am willing to lose!  I think it was designed by someone who wants to torture people.  What a big waste of money!</li>
            <li> Two stars. One because it moves air and the other because when it says the barrel is easily removed, they mean it -- I was able to quickly and easily remove the bristle barrel, even while it was totally tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It loses the other three stars because I can&#x27;t use it without tangling it terribly my hair. The bristles are not &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; they are very firm and don&#x27;t bend much at all, and the round ball on the end of each bristle guarantees it will grab on to and then not release my hair. With the &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; button pressed, the barrel will spin, but if my hair is already tangled on it there&#x27;s no way to spin it loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just lost 30 minutes of my life to this contraption, and a lot of hair. My scalp still hurts from pulling as I write this. I tried four or five times to use it correctly and found that if I wind any more than two to three inches of my hair onto the barrel, it tangles. I&#x27;d only recommend this for short, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have fine hair that is almost shoulder length. I&#x27;ve used many other round brushes in the past, and they all have more flexible bristles and never tangle. I haven&#x27;t been this tangled up in a hairbrush since I was six years old.</li>
            <li> did not like this item.  Was expecting a hot air brush, this is not that.  Very little air comes out of brush and heat is so-so.</li>
            <li> This brush was very good and did its job very well.  Keep up the good works.  It will be used.</li>
            <li> I like that the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; barrel comes off for cleaning.  There is lots of power on the high setting.  The lower setting doesn&#x27;t seem worthwhile for me.  I really wish the company would consider making a 1/2 inch version of this, since my hair is short and fine.</li>
            <li> I received the product within a couple of days of ordering it. The air brush is just what I was looking for. Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> this was just what she wanted and makes doing her hair easier and faster than ever it work great and really is worth the money</li>
            <li> Wanted a smaller air brush as I have short hair and needed it for lift.  Bigger brushes just won&#x27;t work.  This 3/4 inch Salon Edition is perfect with two heat settings, also very quiet.  When I need to replace I would definitely buy this air brush again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and years.  Why they stopped selling it in retail stores is a mystery to me.  I purchased this after searching everywhere and finding it online.  It does the job but, if set on high for too long, it stops.  It will start again after it cools down.  I have short hair so I just keep it on low.  I also have a backup in case the first one has a problem because I can&#x27;t live without this styling tool.</li>
            <li> I have chin-length hair and maybe it&#x27;s just not long enough, but I have not had success using this; my hair falls out of the teeth. Relegated to the back of the bathroom closet.</li>
            <li> .[[ASIN:B000GZD1JG Salon Edition Regular 3/4\\&quot; Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush (8079R)]]  I ordered this product on Monday, it arrived on Thursday.  Great service, great product.  Good for short hair.</li>
            <li> So far I like using this hot air brush.  I have actually been using hot air brushes everyday for years and I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them.  I was using a different brand (Helen of Troy) and after several months, it would gradually start to burn some of the plastic off and as a result it would start burning my hair as well.  Sometimes they would just burn up and stop working.  It seems to be more difficult to find the hot air brushes that are 3/4\\&quot;, so I continued to use the same brand.  Then this time I saw this Salon Edition one available in 3/4\\&quot; and decided to try it.  I have heard good things about Salon Edition before.  It is still too early to determine if this one will perform better than the others after several months, but so far I like using it.  If this one outlasts the others I have used, then I will be sticking with Salon Edition hot air brushes.</li>
            <li> Great for styling your hair. Works well with hair that is damp. Gives you a smooth finish without damaging your hair</li>
            <li> I use this hot air brush every day.  I have used this style for years now and don&#x27;t plan on changing.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that the hot air brush I recently purchased didn&#x27;t have more  power. I knew it only had two settings, but I thought it would have more blowing power. I have owned several and this one doesn&#x27;t dry as well as the others. The tongs on the end of the brush should be more rounded or have soft tips on the ends. The price was good and I could not find any brushes in retail stores, so I was happy to have found a hot air brush.</li>
            <li> Great Brush for short hair.  I had one when my hair was longer but it was a 1&amp;#34; and to large for the short hair do</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush.  Had other ones that were cheaper and there is a reason they were cheaper.  Love it</li>
            <li> It is probably easier to use a regular hairdryer and a round brush. It really dosen&#x27;t put out alot of air to dry your hair. I have very short hair and it took forever.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair cut short and was unable to use my old hot air brush effectively. This brush is perfect and is very easy to use. It does not become entangled in my hair but if your hair is a bit longer there are 2 types of releases to help. It is not a continuous roller but has a release to let it roll if needed to untangle hair. The cord is extra long which I also love.</li>
            <li> Love this! Helps to dry, add lift and curl all while helping save time and electrical outlets! Helps immensely in a home with only one bathroom!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she is quite happy with it so far. She is a happy person anyway.</li>
            <li> Despite claims that this brush is tangle-free, it is very easy to get all snarled up in it and then the curl release simply does not function. It is a little guy, by the way... very petite! Once I got the hang of wrapping small sections of my (fine, thin, shoulder-length) hair loosely around it and NOT pulling the curl tighter at all, this product left me with a head of big bouncy curls that stayed all day without hairspray. Usually my hair can&#x27;t hold a curl. That is not how I want to wear my hair every day, however, let alone do I want to go to that much effort and spend that much time daily. I could see this being very good for giving short hair tons of volume and curls. I will keep this product for special occasions but I am starting from square one on my search for the right blow brush to use daily. I&#x27;ve tried at least 10 at this point! They either conk out, get tangled, blow too softly, get too hot, or are awkward to handle. Sigh.</li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush better than a regular blow dryer because it gets IN there. it separates the hair and dries it up close. very easy to clean and maintain. it&#x27;s lightweight too so my arm isn&#x27;t tired from holding it up for 15 minutes, which is good because with a regular blow dryer it would&#x27;ve taken me longer.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 1&amp;#34; Hot air brush and decided I wanted the 3/4&amp;#34; for summer months when I wear my hair shorter. I love these brushes as they are fast and easy to use with great results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but this is a good find! I have slightly above shoulder length, fine, flat, slightly wavy colored hair with a mind of its own. Usually it won&#x27;t hold a curl or be straight. I have to wet it and blow it dry if I want to look like I didn&#x27;t crawl out of the dumpster. this little hot air brush doesn&#x27;t get terribly hot but somehow pulls my hair into obedience quickly in the morning so I can get ready for work without wetting &amp; drying it. it&#x27;s easy to use and fairly quick. i like the bristles and they hold my fine hair quite well.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair in a very simple chin-length bob. Have never been very successful at using a curling iron so tried this hot air brush at the recommendation of a local hair stylist. Love it!  So simple, easy to use. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Initially I had some difficulty with best &amp; quickest use of the hot air brush, but once I got the hang of it I was amazed and pleased with the results. Learned that for me it&#x27;s best to use hair dryer first to partially dry my hair prior to using the Salon hot air brush because my hair is thick and this helps with the process. Good, good product! So glad I ordered it! Would recommend it to my daughter and daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> Need a little more experience with it, but found it easy to handle.  Have very fine hair and this worked out just fine for me.</li>
            <li> This curling brush is one my hairdresser uses, and she recommended it to me. It works really well to control the curls and frizz on my hair. Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using my second hot air brush, as I gave the first one to a teenage relative.  The hot air brush is so dependable and easy to use.  I&#x27;ve traveled with them and they are small enough to fit easily into a carry-on.  I use it daily with gel to get body and volume in my short hair.  The brush is easy to clean (the gel builds up a bit) and there is a curl release so I don&#x27;t have to keep brushing as I go unless I want a bit straighter style.  I highly recommend this hot air brush as it is long-lasting and helps create great hair!</li>
            <li> Anyone with thin, straight hair (a curse!) knows what I am talking about. If we can find anything that will help our hair to look halfway decent we will do anything to get it. That is why I order this item TWO at a time (one in reserve) - for fear I will go to buy it one day and it will no longer be available. This is not to say it does not last. It does. I just literally wear mine out from daily use. The motor is fine but the &#x27;brush&#x27; and the wand ultimately wear out. Please, never discontinue this item! You do not want to see me with unstyled hair! Even though the item is touted as a dryer, it works best as a styler on damp hair.</li>
            <li> This item works great for soft curils. The added blow dryer works good on damp hair.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out and have used this tool to help keep my hair under control.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  Wish I has purchased it sooner.</li>
            <li> This is my second hot air brush in 20 years.  They are virtually indestructible.  I just love it.  It works so well, and doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair like other products.</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I have owned.  I found it to last a number of years, worked well all the time and it&#x27;s great to be able to dry my hair and style it at the same time.  dmn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hot Air Brush for years.  I absolutely cannot be without it!  I have to perm my hair and this softens the over-all look.  Fast, easy to use; can give you many styles with practice.</li>
            <li> Thought it would work better than it did.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> I have had my new air brush for a couple of months now and it works like a charm. They fixed the only complaint I had. I can now turn the air brush off and it will re-start immediately when turned back on. The brush itself is removable and easy to clean; this is an important feature.  Twist off the cap at the tip and remove the plastic cylinder from the unit.  Place the brush part in a glass of water to soak, and the hair product that sticks to the brush cylinder plumps up and will be easy to rinse off. Let the part dry, replace, and you are back in business. This is a great hot- air brush!</li>
            <li> have only used this for a few days, but am very happy with the quality and construction, received timely and well packaged</li>
            <li> I had one of these &amp; loved it but then it finally broke.So I found another one just like the otherone.It arrived quickly and works great! Yes, I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this brush works with my short hair.  Most others start with a 1&amp;#34; diameter and go up from these which was my deciding factor in choosing this one. It gives my fine hair a boost and helps with styling.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling brush I have ever used. My hair is baby fine and super thin. Somehow this creates a fullness and volume that I have never had before. Will not use anything else ever again!</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve seen that it was by Helen of Troy, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it because I already tried their product. Besides that, it&#x27;s the exact same thing as the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush 1574; it just looks fancier. It could not grip my hair at all, though, which is surprising because I have very thick and lots of hair.</li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush for several years. It was on it&#x27;s way out.  I was delighted when I found this brush and it was just like the one I had. It works great on my short fine hair.</li>
            <li> Really like this hot air brush but it crapped out on me after only a week of use. I just ordered the 3/4&#x27; hot air brush from Helen of Troy, I&#x27;ve heard better things about that.</li>
            <li> My hair was too short so gave it away.  Nicely built and heated quickly. G-daughter liked it.  To problem with selling or mailing.</li>
            <li> This is a useful tool when styling your hair........all alone.When you are using some hair syling tools it is nice to have a extra set of hands.This is a easy does it tool. It smooth the hair and provides adequate heat.it is a hair blower, there is a bit of noise.same as if you are using a hair dryer. I enjoy using it on my short- to medium thick hair.sturdy piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> This product works for me because I have fine hair and I am not very good at using a blow dryer and brush.  With this product I can&lt;br /&gt;dry and curl each section of my hair and then style as I wish.  I have been using this type of Hot Air brush for years now and for me,&lt;br /&gt;it works well.</li>
            <li> She said the only thing that she wished it didn&#x27;t do was tangle sometimes.  She didn&#x27;t think it was supposed to do that.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I had bought a Vidal Sassoon one about a year ago which did not have enough power.  When I turned this one on it was quiet so I worried about the same problem, but it dries my hair really fast and leaves it with a nice curl.  I have a medium length bob with light bangs and it works perfectly.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought one previously and loved it so I bought this second one for our second home at the shore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a while now and because it doesn&#x27;t get so hot its easier to dry and style hair and not damage it like the blow driers do plus it allows you to style as you dry.  I also use a styling mouse with it and something for volume because of the chemo damage to hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and they really like it. Not what I was actually looking to purchase, but it works just as well as the one I was looking for. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I had bought another hot air brush, but it was too big for my hair. I tried this one and I love it!! I have short and thick wavy hair. If I do not style my hair, it will stick out everywhere.This hot air brush grips my hair and holds it in place. I used to use a brush and hairdryer, but the brush would be tangled in my hair and it hurt when I had to pull it out.  This hot air brush goes in your hair, and comes out easily. The only thing that I do not like about it is that it is loud when it is turned on. But I will settle for that rather than have to hold a round brush and hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an airbrush to style my hair for years, but recently, the motor on my old appliance burned out. I was relieved to find this product, and the quality was even better than my older air brush. It styles my hair well and has 2 heat settings. The handle has a very comfortable grip and the brush moves well through my hair (my old one occasionally tangled if I wrapped it too closely to the roots).</li>
            <li> I buy two of these at a time because I never want to be without one. Great styling tool, but unfortunately mine have typically quit working after about one year of use.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is short and fine,  I like to use  the 3/4&amp;#34;.  Using this hot air brush eliminates the need to use a flat iron.  It is also a good styling tool.  If at times your hair is hard to manage, this hot air brush might be the answer.</li>
            <li> It is not making much difference on my hair styles. It does not work for my type of hair I think. It has not enough power for fast hair styling as I intented, dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update: I got better results when using it on medium-high level of dampening hair and taking small portions of the hair. Still takes some time (30 minutes in my case, hair on top of my shoulder) and does not add high volume but you get a nice manageable hair style that I like because looks natural. I am upgrading to three stars.</li>
            <li> This is a superior item for my hair that sits just below my ears.  One review said it \\&quot;caught\\&quot; her hair, which I am sure it would do for long hair. For my fine short hair, I need one that does catch my hair, or else it just falls off. Much better than the Conair brand I bought at a discount store. I can well imagine, however, that this would not be an ideal product for long hair. I use this to give my hair body at the roots and curl under the ends, and it&#x27;s perfect. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> My old hot air brush had died and I couldn&#x27;t find one with a smaller diameter in stores.  I saw this online and tried it and am very pleased with it.  It was exactly the right size for my hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I had been looking for. It is hard to find a hot air curling brush and especially this size</li>
            <li> This has been an excellent product so far. It is exactly what I need for my type of hair, and I am satisfied&lt;br /&gt; with the results of using it.</li>
            <li> It is just what I have been looking for.  The brush is substantial enough to hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li> perfect size and works great</li>
            <li> Awesome Air Brush. Very durable. My wife uses this to do her hair and she simply loves it. She has short hair and she says this put fluff into your hair and makes her hair easy to do. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Perfectly suited for the length of my hair. The control switch does not interfer with the operation.I have not accidentally turned the brush off while I was using it as I have with others hot air brushes that I have tried. In addition, other hot air burshes have been either too small or too large.</li>
            <li> Having used a Salon Edition hot air brush for years, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t find a better product at a better price.  My niece who is a hairdresser bought me the first one.</li>
            <li> Met all my requirements.  Barrel is the right size and heat is good.  Easy to handle.  Price was right for the product.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Hot Air Brush for well over 15 years!  Would not use anything else for styling my hair, it is so fast and easy. The only problem is trying to find the 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I still have problem with curling my hair then let it go.  Probably, the automatic system doesn&#x27;t work that well.  The heat is not that high which is good for the hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> I am surprised this received so many great reviews. I bought this to replace my Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer, which recently stopped working. I had owned the Revlon Hot Air Styler for several years and was very happy with it. However, according to some of the Amazon reviews, it had been redesigned. The Salon Edition Hot Air brush had better reviews than the Revlon one. So, I decided to order this one. At 3/4\\&quot;, the circumference is a bit too small for my liking. Also, occasionally the brush part falls off while in use.  My biggest complaint is the curl release switch. This switch is very temperamental. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work. It often gets stuck, causing my hair to become tangled in the brush. Unfortunately, I did not keep the box for this item, so I cannot return it. In a few months I plan on buying another hot air brush and this one can become my backup dryer. Do not be fooled by the name of this item. It is NOT salon quality.</li>
            <li> Learning to use it. High is really hot. Use more on low. Does do a good job. I don&#x27;t use the curl release feature often but is handy to have.</li>
            <li> I received this brush in mid january 2013 and was very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rotate curling tools so I have not used it everyday since that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has stopped working, it will not turn on even after hitting the re set button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed, I thought it should have lated longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent E-mail to seller for options of replacement, will see how that goes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use it without it getting tangled in my hair..wish I had found a retractable one in a 3/4&amp;#34; barrel. I&#x27;m going to have my hairdresser show me how it works and then I&#x27;m sure I will love it,</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere in the past ten years. I&#x27;ve looked everywhere, every website and gone to every supply store. This one is the only one that works! I would have liked a one inch, but this is great!</li>
            <li> I have used this hot air brush for several years and it is clearly the best out there. I see the vendor is no longer manufacturing this and I am so disappointed. Please bring it back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these brushes for years, but my old one finally quit.  I have not been able to find another one in the usual places (like drugstores), so I took a chance with Amazon, and there were several.  I picked this one, because it was the most like my old one.  A hot-air brush is a great styling tool for those of us that are too uncoordinated to hold a hair dryer in one hand and a styling brush in another.  This hot-air brush makes styling your hair so easy.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands. This one is the best. Has long swivel cord and a button for detangling. I have one put away for security. I couldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Good product but my hair is not long enough for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> Had broken piece in box when arrived-could not figure where it was supposed to go so threw whole thing away-no information on how to return so wrote email in \\&quot;Contact US\\&quot;- until today no response.  Postage was too much to order another one.  Not very happy with product or service for returning-most times I have ordered there has been a return slip in box-none in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also received 2 boxes of Hazelnut creamer when I only ordered one.  Why?</li>
            <li> The very first curl in the nap area tangled and it took 10 minutes for my husband to get my hair free.  It was only 6 inches long!  The curl release did NOT work. I was looking for a product that wouldn&#x27;t leave my ends frizzy like my bristle one does.  So just to test it out, I tried a small section of shorter hair in front.  FRIZZ!  My hair is naturally straight and I have no problems with it.  So this product failed that test with me.  I think the all plastic barrel doesn&#x27;t help. I didn&#x27;t notice that little detail while purchasing.  I want something that has metal so it will curl like a curling iron while blow drying at the same time like my hair dresser uses.  A plastic barrel isn&#x27;t going to work.</li>
            <li> My beautician first used this product on me and I loved the volume I got.  She sells this in her shop for double the price (understandably).  I was not sure if it would be easy to use on my own, but it is, and I just love it and the results..</li>
            <li> The long cord is the only reason this gets a 4 star rating.  Seems unnecessary and cumbersome at times.  Otherwise, feels like a quality product and I have no complaints!  My go-to Vidal Sassoon air brush must be out of production and I&#x27;d have to say this is a superior product anyway. UPDATE: began shutting off and motor smelled hot but nothing felt hot. Would start up again and seemed fine. Then it singed off my hair so I threw it away. Barely lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores and they do give out after a time, so was so glad to find it.  I am going to order another one for reserve.</li>
            <li> (Wife&#x27;s evaluation - not mine) Bought one of these several years ago at WalMart.  Really loved it.  Dropped it and broke.  Could not find same kind in stores and what I bought was not as nice as my old broken one.  I finally found this on Amazon, ordered and have a great hot air brush once again.  But, be careful not to drop it on a hard tile floor.</li>
            <li> Terrific product and would recommend it to anyone with short or long hair.  Five star rating.  A very solid product !!</li>
