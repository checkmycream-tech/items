            <li>Great Product, shipped really fast!</li>
            <li>Feels like satin on your skin, very light.</li>

            <li>Thank you very much kudos!!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, feels like you are wearing nothing on your face and keeps your foundation in place.  </li>
            <li>This went on silky smooth .</li>
            <li>really makes the foundation come on real smoothly</li>
            <li>Made skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>it makes your face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>The primer goes on smoothly and feels almost like powder, but it&#x27;s a gel.</li>
            <li>This item was what I was looking for it makes my face looks smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and kinda blurs out imperfections.</li>
            <li>It made my foundation go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and allows to foundation to as well.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.  </li>
            <li>It just glides lightly over your skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin smooth before putting makeup on.</li>
            <li>I put it on and my skin is so silky smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Coverage is great and overall</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about it, I had tried better primers before</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and holds my make up well.  </li>
            <li>I had tried a relative&#x27;s and knew that it would be a great product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin feels after applying.  </li>
            <li>I apply right after my moisturizer and it does add more of a  radiant glow to my face.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and has a clean feel on my face.</li>
            <li>However, for work, I like to put on CC cream for light coverage and a clean look.  </li>
            <li>I like the way this one absorbs however it would not be my first choice for wearing to make my skin look better without foundation.</li>
            <li>Just apply first and then use your favorite foundation.</li>
            <li>Amazing, leaves skin so soft and makeup on all day!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t apply it too much</li>
            <li>A good lightweight basic primer.  </li>
            <li>so sweating it off is a nightmare come true for me.</li>
            <li>It really keeps makeup on longer with much better coverage.</li>
            <li>I love the product, thank you so much.</li>
            <li>On non-work days, I just wear this for sunscreen, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this and feel that its a MAIN step in your foundation.</li>
            <li>It has a super silky texture, it&#x27;s lightweight.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day I was covered in hives all over my face, difficulty breathing and in tremendous pain.</li>
            <li>I have mildly oily skin</li>
            <li>my skin is super oily, and this helps it my concealer, and eyemakeup stay intact.</li>
            <li>texture threw me off at first, but I use it any time that I apply full make-up for special events (weddings etc)</li>
            <li>Perhaps  this will be good if you used a cream to powder foundation or you have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite from all Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li>, i can honestly believe it works properly on all skin</li>
            <li>Wow, this maybe better than Roc primer.</li>
            <li>BUT I love that this primer has a SPF, very light and does not make my face oily like every other SPF cream out</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure this is the best product for me as far as primer.</li>
            <li>I was leary of using this because my skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>Makes your face super soft and smooth and minimized the appearance of pores</li>
            <li>I was lucky to be able to get medical help when I needed it.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>I have used other primers that seem to smooth better.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used a primer</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this</li>
            <li>Start with just a tiny bit and add more if you feel the need.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and feels nice, but no hiding even small imperfections.</li>
            <li>Ok, so of course not everyone&#x27;s skin is the same.</li>
            <li>I like it but every time I order the price gets higher and higher , but it&#x27;s still lower than the MK site.</li>
            <li>I used this product the first time on the day it arrived.</li>
            <li>I want people to be aware of what happened to me.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I don&#x27;t plan on trying any different primers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same stuff you get from the Mary Kay Lady - with out the pressure to buy more product than you planed on.</li>
            <li>I really like this primer!</li>
            <li>Doesnt hold up too well if you sweat a lot or in extremely hot climates.</li>
            <li>love that I can find Mary Kay at a low price..</li>
            <li>Make my skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It went on light and my skin felt so soft all day.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with primer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found a primer I love...</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it smells kind of funky, though it&#x27;s not bad enough to make me stop using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so extremely silky, feels so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a primer that really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>(for real).</li>
            <li>I use this primer every time before I put on foundation and it really helps the makeup glide on.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I was very plese with it, and I will probably order it again.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much either.</li>
            <li>Use prior to makeup for  smooth, even coverage.</li>
            <li>I want others to know of the possibility of a very severe allergic reaction to this foundation primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my skin feel after using it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps makeup on for much longer.</li>
            <li>I will order again very soon..</li>
            <li>Thanks ..</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of this foundation primer to cover my whole face.  </li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It only takes a tiny amount and leaves your face smooth and ready for foundation or just a light dusting of powder.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell very goof</li>
            <li>Your foundation will look clearer, more natural and last longer.</li>
            <li>Way better than other primers</li>
            <li>This certainly does make your skin feel silky smooth and soft, but frankly I have not noticed a big difference in the smoothness of my skin after using this product and then applying foundation or using mineral powder.  </li>
            <li>Goes on evenly and silky smooth, maintains a matte finish all day long.</li>
            <li>i used my primer this morning for the first time since i receive it inthe mail i had wanted a natural look today no make up,</li>
            <li>give your skin a nice smooth base to apply makeup on top.</li>
            <li>I been used for 3 years now, and I don&#x27;t have any reason to change this foundation primer for some other!:)</li>
            <li>I also like Miracle Blur by Loreal, but it is more expensive than Avon and not any better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it has a little bit of sun protection in it too.</li>
            <li>I am very self conscious about my appearance without makeup</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>cant live without the oil mattifier from Mary kay.</li>
            <li>I live in FLORIDA and this primer does stand up to the FLORIDa heat.  </li>
            <li>This primer is very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to break outs</li>
            <li>I can put my makeup on in the morning and still look pretty much exactly the same 12+ hours later</li>
            <li>Then when I apply my L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Naturale Mineral Foundation it makes any dry lines or wrinkles disappear!!</li>
            <li>This primer does not work miracles but it does help foundation to go on more evenly; slightly reduces lines and my foundation does seem to last longer.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and it certainly works for me as it gives my face a mini-facelift appearance when used under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, when I want light coverage, I mix a little foundat ion with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps to keep my skin shine free for few extra hours, gives a nice matte touch plus it evens my skin (makes my enlarged pores and wrinkles between my eye brows less visible).  </li>
            <li>I work long hours and have been searching high and low for a primer that helped diminish the oils that build up during the day and help maintain makeup looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>I really havent noticed it making my make up last any longer though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It gives your skin a naturally luminous finish without looking shiny or anything</li>
            <li>This primer so far is working at diminishing the oily residue that can result from makeup</li>
            <li>I have no vested interest in Neutrogena, but I far prefer the oily skin primer I bought at the grocery store for $11 to this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am 32 years old</li>
            <li>No breakout from it so far.</li>
            <li>My make up lasts so much longer when I moisterize and then apply this prior to putting on my make up.</li>
            <li>Having only used Bare Minerals primer i expected it to be about the same or better.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent buy.</li>
            <li>If it gets half empty, I go to Amazon for more.  </li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount and it makes your skin feel so velvety and protects your skin from the sun as well, which you can&#x27;t find very often in a primer.</li>
            <li>I awoke in the morning with eyes red, and swollen nearly shut.</li>
            <li>I was using bare minerals&#x27; primer before this</li>
            <li>and i use it at least twice a week, and its still half full, worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other expensive primers but this one is my favorite thus far!!!!  </li>
            <li>It has spf 15, it&#x27;s reasonably priced, and a little bit goes a looooong way.</li>
            <li>As a previous Mary Kay consultant, I cannot live without this stuff!</li>

            <li> This went on silky smooth .</li>
            <li> really makes the foundation come on real smoothly</li>
            <li> Made skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> it makes your face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> The primer goes on smoothly and feels almost like powder, but it&#x27;s a gel.</li>
            <li> This item was what I was looking for it makes my face looks smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and kinda blurs out imperfections.</li>
            <li> It made my foundation go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and allows to foundation to as well.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.  </li>
            <li> It just glides lightly over your skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin smooth before putting makeup on.</li>
            <li> I put it on and my skin is so silky smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Coverage is great and overall</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about it, I had tried better primers before</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and holds my make up well.  </li>
            <li> I had tried a relative&#x27;s and knew that it would be a great product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin feels after applying.  </li>
            <li> I apply right after my moisturizer and it does add more of a  radiant glow to my face.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and has a clean feel on my face.</li>
            <li> However, for work, I like to put on CC cream for light coverage and a clean look.  </li>
            <li> I like the way this one absorbs however it would not be my first choice for wearing to make my skin look better without foundation.</li>
            <li> Just apply first and then use your favorite foundation.</li>
            <li> Amazing, leaves skin so soft and makeup on all day!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t apply it too much</li>
            <li> A good lightweight basic primer.  </li>
            <li> so sweating it off is a nightmare come true for me.</li>
            <li> It really keeps makeup on longer with much better coverage.</li>
            <li> I love the product, thank you so much.</li>
            <li> On non-work days, I just wear this for sunscreen, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this and feel that its a MAIN step in your foundation.</li>
            <li> It has a super silky texture, it&#x27;s lightweight.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day I was covered in hives all over my face, difficulty breathing and in tremendous pain.</li>
            <li> I have mildly oily skin</li>
            <li> my skin is super oily, and this helps it my concealer, and eyemakeup stay intact.</li>
            <li> texture threw me off at first, but I use it any time that I apply full make-up for special events (weddings etc)</li>
            <li> Perhaps  this will be good if you used a cream to powder foundation or you have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite from all Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> , i can honestly believe it works properly on all skin</li>
            <li> Wow, this maybe better than Roc primer.</li>
            <li> BUT I love that this primer has a SPF, very light and does not make my face oily like every other SPF cream out</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure this is the best product for me as far as primer.</li>
            <li> I was leary of using this because my skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> Makes your face super soft and smooth and minimized the appearance of pores</li>
            <li> I was lucky to be able to get medical help when I needed it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> I have used other primers that seem to smooth better.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used a primer</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this</li>
            <li> Start with just a tiny bit and add more if you feel the need.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and feels nice, but no hiding even small imperfections.</li>
            <li> Ok, so of course not everyone&#x27;s skin is the same.</li>
            <li> I like it but every time I order the price gets higher and higher , but it&#x27;s still lower than the MK site.</li>
            <li> I used this product the first time on the day it arrived.</li>
            <li> I want people to be aware of what happened to me.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I don&#x27;t plan on trying any different primers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same stuff you get from the Mary Kay Lady - with out the pressure to buy more product than you planed on.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer!</li>
            <li> Doesnt hold up too well if you sweat a lot or in extremely hot climates.</li>
            <li> love that I can find Mary Kay at a low price..</li>
            <li> Make my skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It went on light and my skin felt so soft all day.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with primer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a primer I love...</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it smells kind of funky, though it&#x27;s not bad enough to make me stop using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so extremely silky, feels so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a primer that really works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> (for real).</li>
            <li> I use this primer every time before I put on foundation and it really helps the makeup glide on.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I was very plese with it, and I will probably order it again.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much either.</li>
            <li> Use prior to makeup for  smooth, even coverage.</li>
            <li> I want others to know of the possibility of a very severe allergic reaction to this foundation primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my skin feel after using it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps makeup on for much longer.</li>
            <li> I will order again very soon..</li>
            <li> Thanks ..</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of this foundation primer to cover my whole face.  </li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny amount and leaves your face smooth and ready for foundation or just a light dusting of powder.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very goof</li>
            <li> Your foundation will look clearer, more natural and last longer.</li>
            <li> Way better than other primers</li>
            <li> This certainly does make your skin feel silky smooth and soft, but frankly I have not noticed a big difference in the smoothness of my skin after using this product and then applying foundation or using mineral powder.  </li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and silky smooth, maintains a matte finish all day long.</li>
            <li> i used my primer this morning for the first time since i receive it inthe mail i had wanted a natural look today no make up,</li>
            <li> give your skin a nice smooth base to apply makeup on top.</li>
            <li> I been used for 3 years now, and I don&#x27;t have any reason to change this foundation primer for some other!:)</li>
            <li> I also like Miracle Blur by Loreal, but it is more expensive than Avon and not any better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it has a little bit of sun protection in it too.</li>
            <li> I am very self conscious about my appearance without makeup</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> cant live without the oil mattifier from Mary kay.</li>
            <li> I live in FLORIDA and this primer does stand up to the FLORIDa heat.  </li>
            <li> This primer is very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to break outs</li>
            <li> I can put my makeup on in the morning and still look pretty much exactly the same 12+ hours later</li>
            <li> Then when I apply my L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Naturale Mineral Foundation it makes any dry lines or wrinkles disappear!!</li>
            <li> This primer does not work miracles but it does help foundation to go on more evenly; slightly reduces lines and my foundation does seem to last longer.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it certainly works for me as it gives my face a mini-facelift appearance when used under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, when I want light coverage, I mix a little foundat ion with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to keep my skin shine free for few extra hours, gives a nice matte touch plus it evens my skin (makes my enlarged pores and wrinkles between my eye brows less visible).  </li>
            <li> I work long hours and have been searching high and low for a primer that helped diminish the oils that build up during the day and help maintain makeup looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> I really havent noticed it making my make up last any longer though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It gives your skin a naturally luminous finish without looking shiny or anything</li>
            <li> This primer so far is working at diminishing the oily residue that can result from makeup</li>
            <li> I have no vested interest in Neutrogena, but I far prefer the oily skin primer I bought at the grocery store for $11 to this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am 32 years old</li>
            <li> No breakout from it so far.</li>
            <li> My make up lasts so much longer when I moisterize and then apply this prior to putting on my make up.</li>
            <li> Having only used Bare Minerals primer i expected it to be about the same or better.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent buy.</li>
            <li> If it gets half empty, I go to Amazon for more.  </li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount and it makes your skin feel so velvety and protects your skin from the sun as well, which you can&#x27;t find very often in a primer.</li>
            <li> I awoke in the morning with eyes red, and swollen nearly shut.</li>
            <li> I was using bare minerals&#x27; primer before this</li>
            <li> and i use it at least twice a week, and its still half full, worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other expensive primers but this one is my favorite thus far!!!!  </li>
            <li> It has spf 15, it&#x27;s reasonably priced, and a little bit goes a looooong way.</li>
            <li> As a previous Mary Kay consultant, I cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Cruelty-free, lovely texture, covers large pores and other unhappy complexion problems.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really helps with keeping my foundation on all day</li>
            <li> Primer arrived earlier than expected and packaged well.</li>
            <li> The only one I cannot replace with any other brand.</li>
            <li> but if I have some extra cash, I go for the other brand.</li>
            <li> And it Kast all day long you don&#x27;t have to reapply your makeup!</li>
            <li> But it makes me dry skin look fab</li>
            <li> So far been going on 2 months and still have plenty in the bottle, but I always like to use as little as possible to get the job done, and a little does get the job done for me.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> beware and read the product ingredients carefully before purchasing.</li>
            <li> This primer doesn&#x27;t control oil as I expected</li>
            <li> You only needs a little, a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and I have had bad reactions to different products in the past (breakouts), but I had no reactions to this one.</li>
            <li> Its not oily like any of those other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out like the OTHER brands</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li> I will probably try other primers in order to compare</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> But TRUST ME a little goes a long the way i mean, it will last AGES</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but a little goes a long way here.</li>
            <li> I bought black.</li>
            <li> A little to greasy for priming underneath foundation.</li>
            <li> A little too oily feeling for me</li>
            <li> (if you want to hide some imperfections) - it will not &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; on your skin even after few hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using this under my make up for a few years now.</li>
            <li> This has sunscreen without a heavy feel to it at all.</li>
            <li> It never makes any skin trouble.</li>
            <li> Like a few people said, you can almost just wear it by itself if you wanted to go for a no makeup look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little goes a long the way, seriously!</li>
            <li> I tend to be a little dry in some areas and this product made it worse.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer, wait for it to dry out</li>
            <li> : Its very expensive but it will also last for a long time!</li>
            <li> I am 33 y/o, have a very oily skin plus few wrinkles :-(.</li>
            <li> I do my make-up every day, and this usually lasts me about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> My makeup lasted not more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> So when it arrived i was just so worried about how small it was for the PRICE amount of course.</li>
            <li> helps make-up last all day without smudging or getting weird looking.</li>
            <li> It glides on quickly and it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible.</li>
            <li> However, maybe I was just told wrong, but when I go to wipe my face, or my nose</li>
            <li> Plus It gives me small bumps on my face:( No bueno.</li>
            <li> I thought wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case at all...</li>
            <li> I have no idea; maybe my skin is just weird.  </li>
            <li> I hate wearing a lot of heavy makeup.  </li>
            <li> and I felt uncomfortable all day</li>
            <li> Give it a try and you won&#x27;t go wrong, even in Florida heat.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> no color at all  verygood one</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay products but this is definitely not for all skin types. I have combination skin. I tend to be a little dry in some areas and this product made it worse. It might work betters if you have oily skin. Be careful.</li>
            <li> I always use Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> I find that primer is a must have when wearing make up.  I tried this Mary Kay foundation primer and was quite impressed.  A little goes a long way.  The texture of this product is like silk.  It goes on smoothly, feels like you are wearing nothing on your face and keeps your foundation in place.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This helps keep the mineral powder on your face and not on your clothes, like it has been for years and years.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this as a birthday present and I thought I would give it a try. I absolutely love this. I use this first and it makes your skin feel great! Then when I apply my L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Naturale Mineral Foundation it makes any dry lines or wrinkles disappear!! I&#x27;m in love with this and feel that its a MAIN step in your foundation. I don&#x27;t think I could go without it now!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality product. This is the first time I used a primer so I really can&#x27;t compare. But it makes me dry skin look fab</li>
            <li> love the silky feel of this going on and it doesn&#x27;t take much. A little goes a very long way. It does an excellent job allowing the foundation to be applied with a smoother look and ease.</li>
            <li> Love how creamy and even my skin looks when I wear this foundation and adore the coverage it provides. My favorite!!!</li>
            <li> This product feels so good going on and makes makeup glide on easily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover the lines &amp; wrinkles as well as others</li>
            <li> This went on silky smooth . Strongly recommend. This was my first time using this and I strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it certainly works for me as it gives my face a mini-facelift appearance when used under my makeup.  WIll always have it on hand!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! It is by far my favorite from all Mary Kay products. The only one I cannot replace with any other brand.</li>
            <li> I just love MK prouducts,love love love[it works for me] i used my primer this morning for the first time since i receive it inthe mail i had wanted a natural look today no make up,after i use my miracle set i just apply the foundation primer it appy smooth on my face, looks and feel great on my face too[love that it make my face look puttogether]</li>
            <li> This is a great product, easily applied and leaves face feeling soft and I can rest assured knowing that my face is protected! :)</li>
            <li> I love the way this foundation blends with the color of my skin.  Have been using it for a number of years.</li>
            <li> I like it as a primer. It is smooth and has a clean feel on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this primer. It makes foundation go on smoother and with better coverage. I think my makeup stays on longer with it also. Would never be without it.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff... gives my skin a smoother more even skin tone with the bonus of containing sunscreen. I rarely use foundation, but this is perfect with or without. I&#x27;ve had none of the issues that others have mentioned like cracking, wrinkling, turning white, etc. Start with just a tiny bit and add more if you feel the need.</li>
            <li> Feels like silk! Way better than other primers and i have tried many. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. I started using it 3 years ago and am hooked for life. It smoothes wonderfully and often times I wear it without even putting foundation on because it makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> this primer is really good and has spf in it..really makes the foundation come on real smoothly</li>
            <li> It did not extend my foundation as I had hoped.  It is going back.  Still looking for a primer that really works.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Very happy with the purchase.  I have been applying it before make up. I apply a thin layer, wait for it to dry out (it takes 2-3 min) and then I start putting on make up. I am 33 y/o, have a very oily skin plus few wrinkles :-(. It definitely helps to keep my skin shine free for few extra hours, gives a nice matte touch plus it evens my skin (makes my enlarged pores and wrinkles between my eye brows less visible).  SPF15 doesn&#x27;t hurt either.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t apply it too much (if you want to hide some imperfections) - it will not &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; on your skin even after few hours.</li>
            <li> Great Product, shipped really fast!</li>
            <li> It was really nice the first day. It did make my face break out starting on day 2, so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this under my make up for a few years now. Even if I prime and conceal and nothing more</li>
            <li> Seems to do it&#x27;s job, I like it, but there are definitely better ones out there... Smashbox is the way to go but much more expensive. So when I&#x27;m pinching pennies, I go with this one but if I have some extra cash, I go for the other brand. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Having only used Bare Minerals primer i expected it to be about the same or better. For i would go with the BM. But i do loveMK products and continue to use this.</li>
            <li> It glides on quickly and it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible. I&#x27;m glad it has a little bit of sun protection in it too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my very sensitive skin. Feels likes silk. Makes my makeup last longer. Love that it has a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product, like all of the otherMary Kay products! However, maybe I was just told wrong, but when I go to wipe my face, or my nose some of the makeup comes off with and I thought the lady who works for mary kay said having the primer would help with it. I do like this product though, it just melts into your skin!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation primer. Its not oily like any of those other brands. If you have oily skin this is definitely for you.</li>
            <li> I have used other primers that seem to smooth better. I like the way this one absorbs however it would not be my first choice for wearing to make my skin look better without foundation. I was trying to utilize it as a sunscreen and it&#x27;s the reason I bought it besides I&#x27;m a fan of MK products. When I did perspire it stung my eyes.</li>
            <li> A good lightweight basic primer.  SPF 15 is a plus.</li>
            <li> I been used for 3 years now, and I don&#x27;t have any reason to change this foundation primer for some other!:)</li>
            <li> This does not cover imperfections. It goes on smooth and feels nice, but no hiding even small imperfections. Have already gone back to my Avon Max Face Perfector. I happens to be on sale now so I got 2 for $15.00.  I also like Miracle Blur by Loreal, but it is more expensive than Avon and not any better.</li>
            <li> The best primer on the market! Make up stays all day. Made skin feel smooth and silky. Great value for price.</li>
            <li> Great primer, I recommend it &amp; it&#x27;s great for oily skin. Use after moisturizer from greet result.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold my makeup like it should feels a bit more oily that I thought it would so ya li</li>
            <li> Great product - makes your face feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I love this. It has a super silky texture, it&#x27;s lightweight. It goes on nicely, it absorbs into my skin quickly. It makes my skin look great. It makes my foundation look great. &amp; my make up stays on longer. Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> It is an ok primer in terms of it helps to glide on makeup better but I cant stand the chemically smell of it from the sunscreen. It also makes my skin itch at times. Plus It gives me small bumps on my face:( No bueno.</li>
            <li> I love this primer it makes your face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this primer!! Primer arrived earlier than expected and packaged well. The primer goes on smoothly and feels almost like powder, but it&#x27;s a gel. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I do my make-up every day, and this usually lasts me about 6 months.  This is a great buy for the right price!!</li>
            <li> Love this products. Makes your face super soft and smooth and minimized the appearance of pores</li>
            <li> This is the makeup I use so there were no surprises.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation primer I have ever used! You only need a tiny amount and it makes your skin feel so velvety and protects your skin from the sun as well, which you can&#x27;t find very often in a primer. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used Mary K since I was a teenager and now well into my 50&#x27;s it is still an amazing product and now to be able to get it from Amazon.....Wondabar</li>
            <li> This item was what I was looking for it makes my face looks smooth and not oily.I recommend this to all mary Kay users.</li>
            <li> i love this product&lt;br /&gt;The primer keeps sunday church makeup looking fresh until sunday dinner without any touchups - magical!</li>
            <li> Amazing, leaves skin so soft and makeup on all day!</li>
            <li> Helps makeup application nice and smooth and good protection from sun rays.</li>
            <li> A little to greasy for priming underneath foundation. Sometimes, when I want light coverage, I mix a little foundat ion with my moisturizer. This did not work well for that. Perhaps  this will be good if you used a cream to powder foundation or you have very dry skin.  I used it once. Won&#x27;t use it again</li>
            <li> give your skin a nice smooth base to apply makeup on top. doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and its a good size bottle. Ive had it for 4 months now and i use it at least twice a week, and its still half full, worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use all Mary Kay products. This is one of the newer products it is as great as all the others I use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  If it gets half empty, I go to Amazon for more.  Try it.  You will like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and speedy customer service!</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. Keeps make up in place and from settling in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is nice stuff. However it reminds me of a foggy pretroleum jelly, lol. Goes on smooth and kinda blurs out imperfections. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> love! I think it&#x27;s perfect size doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, perfect!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out like the OTHER brands&lt;br /&gt;that I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It also makes my make up last&lt;br /&gt;LONGER (for real).</li>
            <li> I use this primer every time before I put on foundation and it really helps the makeup glide on. My only problem is that it smells kind of funky, though it&#x27;s not bad enough to make me stop using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It made my foundation go on smoothly. I was very plese with it, and I will probably order it again.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and allows to foundation to as well. I like the consistency...not watery like some primers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product but i&#x27;m not a fan of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a... moist person. I have a tendency to sweat off my makeup, but not with this stuff. I am very self conscious about my appearance without makeup so sweating it off is a nightmare come true for me. I would even wear deodorant on my face to keep my makeup intact. I don&#x27;t have to any more. I can put my makeup on in the morning and still look pretty much exactly the same 12+ hours later and I wear drugstore brands. I don&#x27;t have to touch up or reapply powder or anything. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This certainly does make your skin feel silky smooth and soft, but frankly I have not noticed a big difference in the smoothness of my skin after using this product and then applying foundation or using mineral powder.  (A co-worker told me she uses Monostat on her skin to achieve the primer effect this product is used for at a fraction of the cost!  Her mature skin does appear pore-free and flawless).  If it works for you great.  But for the price, I would pass.</li>
            <li> I love this primer of mary kay!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. A friend gave it to me try and it does wonders  to minimize my pores.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.  It makes your powder or foundation go on flawless even when you sweat your makeup doesn&#x27;t run! And it Kast all day long you don&#x27;t have to reapply your makeup!</li>
            <li> Cant do without it !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price and nice to wear alone for some protection or to smooth out your skin prior to application.  I really havent noticed it making my make up last any longer though.</li>
            <li> Ok, so of course not everyone&#x27;s skin is the same. I thought it would be fine since it said it was for &#x27;all skin types&#x27;. I thought wrong. I have combination skin but more on the oily side. My makeup lasted not more than a couple hours. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Feels like satin on your skin, very light. It just glides lightly over your skin. I like using an under-make-up moisturizer with sunscreen. This has sunscreen without a heavy feel to it at all. Your foundation will look clearer, more natural and last longer. I&#x27;ve never used it before but am glad I paid attention to a reviewer that recommended it. You don&#x27;t need to use much either. Try it next time you order Mary Kay&#x27;s mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use prior to makeup for  smooth, even coverage.</li>
            <li> great product and excellent coverage</li>
            <li> I like it but every time I order the price gets higher and higher , but it&#x27;s still lower than the MK site.</li>
            <li> Ok. so let me start saying this primer is just TOO GOOD to be true! Here are my thoughts on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Velvety, smooth, wonderful finish&lt;br /&gt;-It absorbs rapidly, so you can continue with your makeup routine easily&lt;br /&gt;-Soft texture, lightweight as it can be.&lt;br /&gt;-Worked for my combination skin type so good, i can honestly believe it works properly on all skin types!&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long the way, seriously! you won&#x27;t even believe the tiny amount you need.&lt;br /&gt;-It gives your skin a naturally luminous finish without looking shiny or anything&lt;br /&gt;-Has sunscreen protection SPF 15, which allows you to skip the sunscreen step in the morning cause this product gives you a two in one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m not even sure this is a Con but, It happened to me that when i bought it i didn&#x27;t read the description about the size of the product. So when it arrived i was just so worried about how small it was for the PRICE amount of course. But TRUST ME a little goes a long the way i mean, it will last AGES and i love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it more than 5 stars again and again. it is beyond wonderful!</li>
            <li> This primer is very soft. It is protecting face skin for days and before make up your face it helps good make up. It never makes any skin trouble. So I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I used this product the first time on the day it arrived. Within a few hours my face was swelling, I didn&#x27;t give it too much thought till the next day. I awoke in the morning with eyes red, and swollen nearly shut. By the end of the day I was covered in hives all over my face, difficulty breathing and in tremendous pain. Today it&#x27;s been 1 week since I tried the primer and I&#x27;m still under a Dr&#x27;s care for anaphylactic shock. Currently I&#x27;m taking Benedryl, Claratin D, Rx anti-biotics drops for my eyes and Rx steroids to decrease the swelling in my eyes, face, throat.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had an allergic reaction to anything quite like this before. Since the swelling and hives are only on my face, where the primer was used, we do believe it the primer to be the cause of the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I have been in touch with Mary Kay Co, they&#x27;ve been very nice but I have no interest in getting $14 refund I want people to be aware of what happened to me. The medical bills may end up in the $1000&#x27;s of dollars before this is all over. I want others to know of the possibility of a very severe allergic reaction to this foundation primer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Mary Kay products before so I was not excepting any problems.&lt;br /&gt;Please beware and read the product ingredients carefully before purchasing. I was lucky to be able to get medical help when I needed it.</li>
            <li> I like Mary Kay products.  This one is no exception.  Works like you&#x27;d imagine.  Keeps skin smooth before putting makeup on.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is very smooth in texture and light-weighted.  Makes my make up stays and last longer too.</li>
            <li> I work long hours and have been searching high and low for a primer that helped diminish the oils that build up during the day and help maintain makeup looking fresh.  This primer so far is working at diminishing the oily residue that can result from makeup and I feel like it helps my makeup set and stay put throughout the day. I apply right after my moisturizer and it does add more of a  radiant glow to my face. I like it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve never used a face primer and decided to try this one because of its reviews on amazon. I thought the tube would be bigger, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that it isn&#x27;t. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s so extremely silky, feels so nice on my skin. It really keeps makeup on longer with much better coverage. I love this stuff, I don&#x27;t plan on trying any different primers. I&#x27;m going to stick with this one and buy more when mine is gone.</li>
            <li> I got hooked when I started using this. It&#x27;s just sooooo good! It makes my face look like a dream! I will never ever change brands/products. This is already perfect.</li>
            <li> Smells like chemicals...yuck.</li>
            <li> nice helps the foundation say on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same stuff you get from the Mary Kay Lady - with out the pressure to buy more product than you planed on.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer! I put it on and my skin is so silky smooth and even. Like a few people said, you can almost just wear it by itself if you wanted to go for a no makeup look. My skin is pretty sensitive and I have had bad reactions to different products in the past (breakouts), but I had no reactions to this one.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my skin feel after using it.  I  would recommend this for all women to use under their makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this skin care product. Not as fond of their make up line but skin care line I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Keeps makeup on for much longer. Doesnt hold up too well if you sweat a lot or in extremely hot climates. Overall a decent buy.</li>
            <li> Pros: Its&#x27; Mary Kay so the product is great!. The shipping was very fast also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Its very expensive but it will also last for a long time!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it is excellent. Takes away the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; look on my skin and protects my skin from breakouts when putting foundation and makeup on. The bottle is small, but a little goes a long way here. Coverage is great and overall just makes my skin look and feel better. Will definitely buy this again. So far been going on 2 months and still have plenty in the bottle, but I always like to use as little as possible to get the job done, and a little does get the job done for me.</li>
            <li> This was touted to me by an acquaintance who sells Mary Kay as something that would keep my oily skin under control.  Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case at all...in fact, I noticed oil breaking through almost immediately!  I have no idea; maybe my skin is just weird.  I have no vested interest in Neutrogena, but I far prefer the oily skin primer I bought at the grocery store for $11 to this stuff.  It worked a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> I will order again very soon.. best prices.. product in good shape upon arrival..  love that I can find Mary Kay at a low price..Thanks ..</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about it, I had tried better primers before BUT I love that this primer has a SPF, very light and does not make my face oily like every other SPF cream out there.&lt;br /&gt;I cant live without the oil mattifier from Mary kay. I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I read a favorable review of this Mary Kay make-up primer in a magazine.  Since I don&#x27;t have a Mary Kay store/rep, I decided to order it online from Amazon.  I found that it is just as good as the magazine review indicated and I&#x27;ve been happily using it.  Using a tip from a make-up artist, I apply primers with a foundation brush - works much better than fingers - LOL!!</li>
            <li> This primer doesn&#x27;t control oil as I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the smoothest primer,  so lightweight.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Make my skin so soft and smooth.  Love this primer.</li>
            <li> helps make-up last all day without smudging or getting weird looking. texture threw me off at first, but I use it any time that I apply full make-up for special events (weddings etc)</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference with keeping my foundation or blush from coming off. I have mildly oily skin and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. I use good quality make up too.</li>
            <li> smooth, non-greasy, odorless and goes on easily.  Keeps my foundation looking good all day.</li>
            <li> Made me break out all over.</li>
            <li> A little too oily feeling for me</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and silky smooth, maintains a matte finish all day long. I love the product, thank you so much.</li>
            <li> As a previous Mary Kay consultant, I cannot live without this stuff! It is absolutely amazing. Won&#x27;t make your skin greasy, helps keep make up in place throughout the day! Strongly recommend for all skin types... even if you don&#x27;t wear foundation, it has a sunscreen to help protect your skin!</li>
            <li> This product was just as advertised.  It went on light and my skin felt so soft all day.  My make-up actually stayed in place all day.  I love this primer!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other expensive primers but this one is my favorite thus far!!!!  It glides on smoothly and holds my make up well.  I am quite impressed with the quality of this product.  Definitely worth a try! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does giveMe the smooth, fine face texture, sometimes just wear just that without make up and my face well still be looking nice. Great for the price also. Definitely will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I love how this MK primer glides on and then my makeup feels very smooth going on top.  I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use the primer.  Continuing to purchase when my primer is low.  The price on Amazon is amazing compared to ordering it through a rep and then getting hassled to purchase more stuff.</li>
            <li> Cruelty-free, lovely texture, covers large pores and other unhappy complexion problems. I love this product</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily and acne prone. This is by far the best primer ever, has SPF, and helps so that my makeup doesn&#x27;t melt off in the summer heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff.  I hate wearing a lot of heavy makeup.  I would wear nothing if that kept my skin looking uniform.  However, for work, I like to put on CC cream for light coverage and a clean look.  It doesn&#x27;t take much of this foundation primer to cover my whole face.  The texture is velvety and wonderful feeling!  It has sunscreen too which I love!  On non-work days, I just wear this for sunscreen, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  Will be buying this again</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product that quells wrinkles a bit, and allows makeup to glide on.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with primer.  I am 32 years old and I have deep lines for my age.  This primer does not work miracles but it does help foundation to go on more evenly; slightly reduces lines and my foundation does seem to last longer.  I will probably try other primers in order to compare but I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good primer that seems to keep make-up on for a while.  It also doesn&#x27;t cause break outs which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time it is very good stuff.I really like it a lot.Thank you very much kudos!!</li>
            <li> This is great mascara. I bought black. I love the way the mascara does not cake on the wand, and I love the shape of the wand. The mascara actually comes out on the sparse side so you have better control over your coats. Has no odor at all, the handle is easy to grip and this mascara stays put until you take it off. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I had tried a relative&#x27;s and knew that it would be a great product.  I will be ordering more when I get close to running out.  It makes all makeup look so much better...it smoothens the skin in preparation for the foundation or bronzer.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! I was using bare minerals&#x27; primer before this and I like this much better! It has spf 15, it&#x27;s reasonably priced, and a little bit goes a looooong way.</li>
            <li> Works great, keeps make-up on longer, helps with oiliness of skin. No breakout from it so far.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really helps with keeping my foundation on all day but it does help with putting it on. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to break outs and I&#x27;m not sure this is the best product for me as far as primer. I use MK skincare, but I think I need to continue my search for primer elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but sometimes I think that the silicone feel after application may not be so great for acne prone skin (which I have)</li>
            <li> Simply Superb on oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a primer I love...This goes on smoothly on my skin and very light weight.It has a satin effect and my foundation stays on longer.This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> Skin appear to be smoother under makeup.</li>
            <li> primer keeps mk ctopowder ON</li>
            <li> Great primer!  I always get compliments that my skin and/or makeup looks great when I use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. wonderful exactly what i needed. Great quality will use over and over, for many years to come</li>
            <li> Works beautifully!! makeup stays put!  my skin is super oily, and this helps it my concealer, and eyemakeup stay intact.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mary Kay primer for about two years now and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  It only takes a tiny amount and leaves your face smooth and ready for foundation or just a light dusting of powder.  I’ve tried several primers and this is the lightest and hardest working one I have found.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My make up lasts so much longer when I moisterize and then apply this prior to putting on my make up. Doesn&#x27;t smell very goof but you can&#x27;t tell once its kind of soaked in.</li>
            <li> Since I had not used primer before (except of course on walls when I am painting) I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  However, having now used it, I wish I had been using it all along.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin feels after applying.  Great for minimization wrinkles.  Just apply first and then use your favorite foundation.</li>
            <li> I was leary of using this because my skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily. But I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month and have had no issues. It provides a nice lightweight primer for my pressed foundation and also improves the look of my skin without makeup.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face and in the middle of the day it looked like someone had poured baby oil on my face. All my make up just slid of my face and I felt uncomfortable all day</li>
            <li> Wow, this maybe better than Roc primer. This primer is a nice clear gel that glides on nicely.  You only needs a little, a little goes a long ways.  I live in FLORIDA and this primer does stand up to the FLORIDa heat.  You can also use this primer alone with your favorite  powder. Give it a try and you won&#x27;t go wrong, even in Florida heat.</li>
