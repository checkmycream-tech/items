            <li>This is a wonderful precursor to moisturizer application.  </li>
            <li>Great value for the price!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t very happy with that.</li>
            <li>Dermalogica has the best products.</li>
            <li>Also great to set your make up.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Dermalogica is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This product smells and feels great on my face.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, my wife loves this.</li>
            <li>It just feels so good to use.</li>
            <li>I use it to hydrate my skin before applying a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Amazing price.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I liked this product was the lovely fragrance</li>
            <li>While I love the product, this bottle seems to be a weaker formulation.</li>
            <li>I always end up breathing it in and even my nasal passages and sinuses feel fresher and more hydrated afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love the product though and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have never found another toner that I like better</li>
            <li>and I have tried many...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>feels nice and a fresh feeling on your face!</li>
            <li>Awesome to have a larger size available.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and feels very hydrating when I spritz it on, my skin seems to accept the follow on products more readily, evenly and allows me to use the products more sparingly.</li>
            <li>I Love this toner, I use it twice a day after using the Age Smart Skin Resurfacing Cleanser.</li>
            <li>In the evening I wash my face with the Dermalogica Skin Resurfacing Cleanser, spray on the Dermalogica Hydramist and use the Dermalogica Super Rich Repair and an eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, very hydrating</li>
            <li>but this is first time buying it via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment, product as advertised--thank you!</li>
            <li>I am seventy five years old and most people are surprised that I am this age.  </li>
            <li>The Dermalogica Hydramist leaves my face feeling refreshed and moist and ready for my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the real product inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>Normally I pay that for the 5 oz.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It has made my skin look so much better, soft and no more blemishes.</li>
            <li>Seems to be watered down compared to the first one I purchased at a beauty supply.  </li>

            <li> As soon as you pat your face dry</li>
            <li> It does smell odd and it does not seem to work the same.</li>
            <li> I spray my face after a shower or whenever it is feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> and it starts to get that tight dry feeling, a couple of sprays of this</li>
            <li> but it did make me wonder if it had been watered down at all.</li>
            <li> Well and a few other dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but 12 oz. lasts me a year.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and I feel ripped-off because it was the same price as the product was in the store.  </li>
            <li> It seems watery - not as fragrant as my usual bottles and not as dewey.  </li>
            <li> Condition not perfect, it came open without the factory seal.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed that this bottle barely has any at all.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to this spray.</li>

            <li> I like this product!.... feels nice and a fresh feeling on your face! I will buy it again next time!</li>

One of the reasons I liked this product was the lovely fragrance and I&#x27;m disappointed that this bottle barely has any at all.

            <li> This is a wonderful precursor to moisturizer application.  Also great to set your make up.  Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Realy makes a difference in fresher lookin makeup thru out day</li>
            <li> It just feels so good to use. I spray my face after a shower or whenever it is feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Awesome to have a larger size available. I have used it for years but this is first time buying it via Amazon.  While I love the product, this bottle seems to be a weaker formulation. It seems watery - not as fragrant as my usual bottles and not as dewey.  I don&#x27;t know if that would be from the larger size but it did make me wonder if it had been watered down at all.</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is a great product.  I don&#x27;t use anything else.  It has made my skin look so much better, soft and no more blemishes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, product as advertised--thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this product, very hydrating</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I am seventy five years old and most people are surprised that I am this age.  I do take care of my skin and I stay out of the sun.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this spray. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of years now. I can&#x27;t wash my face now without following up with 2 sprays of this. As soon as you pat your face dry and it starts to get that tight dry feeling, a couple of sprays of this and it feels so hydrated. The scent is heavenly too. I always end up breathing it in and even my nasal passages and sinuses feel fresher and more hydrated afterwards. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but 12 oz. lasts me a year. I decant it into a smaller sprayer I have. It&#x27;s so essential to my beauty routine, I don&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li> Condition not perfect, it came open without the factory seal.  Wasn&#x27;t very happy with that. I love the product though and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  In the morning I wash my face with Cetaphil, spray on the Dermalogica Hydramist and use the Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery with SPF 30.  In the evening I wash my face with the Dermalogica Skin Resurfacing Cleanser, spray on the Dermalogica Hydramist and use the Dermalogica Super Rich Repair and an eye cream.  The Dermalogica Hydramist leaves my face feeling refreshed and moist and ready for my moisturizer.  I am approaching 40, so I am starting to need the extra moisture.  This product smells and feels great on my face.  I have never found another toner that I like better and I have tried many...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of pre-moisturizer products, including B5 gel, and I always return to this.  I use it to hydrate my skin before applying a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Amazing price. Normally I pay that for the 5 oz.&lt;br /&gt;This is 12oz. Everything was as promised.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, my wife loves this. Well and a few other dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s a toner that conditions the face to prepare it for daily moisturizer. It has a light scent and feels very hydrating when I spritz it on, my skin seems to accept the follow on products more readily, evenly and allows me to use the products more sparingly. I use it every morning as part of my skin care ritual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It does smell odd and it does not seem to work the same. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the real product inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> I Love this toner, I use it twice a day after using the Age Smart Skin Resurfacing Cleanser. Dermalogica has the best products.</li>
            <li> Use this every day before moisturizing and spray on after make-up.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
