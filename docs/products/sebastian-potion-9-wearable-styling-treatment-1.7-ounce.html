            <li>I have not found anything that is as good as this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it holds hair very lightly after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any earth shattering differences, but the product smelled good and was nice and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>Helped smooth hair but nothing too great for the price.</li>

            <li>Love the feel of my hair after drying.</li>
            <li>but again, it smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>my hair frizz free all day and leaves a nice shine also</li>
            <li>I hope they haven&#x27;t changed the formula and that ordering on Amazon delivers the authentic product.  </li>
            <li>Conditions better than Purology.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that the style STAYS THAT WAY all day</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Like this, but I like the light version better.</li>
            <li>I had already used this product before, it ready maintains a good hair condition.</li>
            <li>I loved the straight look but no longer wanted to use relaxers as they damaged my scalp.  </li>
            <li>my hair stayed straight for a good 3 weeks even after I washed it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, this is 4th bottle.  </li>
            <li>My fine hair has wonderful volume without being weighed down and is straight(frizz free).  </li>
            <li>I use it as a light holding gel for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Fit well into my 1 quart zip lock with the rest of my products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to use in the wintertime when hot, dry heating gives me flyaway tresses.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to find it there, although it has increased in price quite a bit since I first started using it.  </li>
            <li>It does leave the hair very silky soft and smelling great but doesn&#x27;t do a lot for styling in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I am super excited to have found this product.</li>
            <li>It is not a bad product, but it just does not perform on my hair the way it use to.</li>
            <li>I seriously can&#x27;t believe how great this stuff works!  </li>
            <li>Mitchell Super Skinny Serum</li>
            <li>like the packaging of this better than the old tube.</li>
            <li>Well, it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>, just right.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick service</li>
            <li>pop so much!</li>
            <li>This has become a product that I always order more of when I am running low.</li>
            <li>I have mature (grey) hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>this stuff makes dry straw hair look healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I can finally find it where I live.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s pretty long and gets tangled even just out of the shower.</li>
            <li>and I have straight, product adds thickness and style to both types of hair.</li>
            <li>No accidentally squirting way too much out and wasting it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really feel like it did anything.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out, it doesn&#x27;t really do that.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need to much .Keeps</li>
            <li>I really like Potion 9 and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair dry for a while, then I put some Potion 9 and brush my hair out easily.</li>
            <li>live without Potion 9!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Even over high end brands at twice the price.  </li>
            <li>I get frizzy dry hair a lot and have and am still trying different products I love the results after using this</li>
            <li>I apply this right after I wash my short hair and my curls</li>
            <li>I love it-not too greasy, heavy but soft.</li>
            <li>Not stiff at all or too soft</li>
            <li>Although I always use a rich quick-acting mask after I shampoo, sometimes it&#x27;s not enough moisture for my very long hair.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural hair wearing African-American woman, and this product was recommended to me by my sister in law.</li>
            <li>and I use frequently.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after it wash my hair-on wet hair before blow</li>
            <li>I use it on damp hair and blow my hair dry straight.  </li>
            <li>(Now obviously everyone will not get the exact same results for instance my daughters hair stayed straight for a week and a half).</li>
            <li>I have natural hair (African American hair).  </li>
            <li>the only down side is it makes it look greasy if you put too much in</li>

            <li> I have used several styling products for my hair the past few years.</li>
            <li> We still need other products to create the style we want!</li>

            <li> I have been having trouble finding Sebastien Potion #9 in the stores.</li>
            <li> I apply to damp hair and style as usual.</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle</li>
            <li> I was hoping to tame flyaways and get some body and control, but my hair seemed lifeless and dull.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is very hard to hold, I use the iron on the hottest setting.  </li>
            <li> I used this treatment for years and then it became increasingly hard to find and expensive.  </li>
            <li> My hait is curly and thin.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my secret weapon!</li>

            <li> Excelente producto...</li>
            <li> I like this product. It helps over treated hair; the ends especially. I recommend this to anyone looking to put something in their hair and not have the time to style. It works well with styling too.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day.  I recently traveled and didn&#x27;t want to check my luggage.  I ordered this travel size bottle and it worked great.  Fit well into my 1 quart zip lock with the rest of my products.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing but make your hair feel slippery.</li>
            <li> I read that this treatment would help with giving some volume to your hair. I tried it once and couldn&#x27;t tell if it helped. I guess I&#x27;ll continue to use it to see if it works.</li>
            <li> Really bad product.  Not helpful at all. Makes your hair frizzy and not helpful. Iwould never reccomend tjis product. d</li>
            <li> Love the product and love this size for travel. Couldn&#x27;t go on the road without it - under 3 oz for carry on. Good price and prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Received a free sample and loved it. I have used several styling products for my hair the past few years. Love the feel of my hair after drying. I apply to damp hair and style as usual. Not stiff at all or too soft, just right. I was so happy I was able to find on Amazon for such a great price. I bought 3 bottles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Potion 9 for years. I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s pretty long and gets tangled even just out of the shower. I let my hair dry for a while, then I put some Potion 9 and brush my hair out easily. You can also put it on already dry hair, or when you get out of a pool and it detangles well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging of this better than the old tube. No accidentally squirting way too much out and wasting it. I&#x27;ll definitely continue buying this.</li>
            <li> Great marketing ploy.  Didn&#x27;t really feel like it did anything.  I wouldnt buy it again or reccomend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo by Sebastian and as I was searching I came across this product. It is a small bottle but you don&#x27;t need alot. It smells great.</li>
            <li> a good styling treatment/ cream.  It smells great.  I got it because something on pinterest said that if you put this in your hair, it will give you beachy waves.  Well, it was worth a try.  We thought it might texturize my daughters long hair and give her some beachy waves.  As it turns out, it doesn&#x27;t really do that.  It does leave the hair very silky soft and smelling great but doesn&#x27;t do a lot for styling in my opinion.  We still need other products to create the style we want! but again, it smells fantastic!  I would buy it again for the smell and the softness....but not for &amp;#34;styling.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This works great in my hair I get frizzy dry hair a lot and have and am still trying different products I love the results after using this I put it on my wet hair and air dry you don&#x27;t need to much .Keeps my hair frizz free all day and leaves a nice shine also the scent is so nice.This is 1.7 ounces but should last a month .Compared to more expensive brands this gets a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> I used this treatment for years and then it became increasingly hard to find and expensive.  It&#x27;s great as a leave-in conditioner and now that my hair has become coarser in texture, it controls it beautifully.  I hope they haven&#x27;t changed the formula and that ordering on Amazon delivers the authentic product.  I now have an Ulta in my town and I&#x27;ve been able to find it there, although it has increased in price quite a bit since I first started using it.  It has numerous nutrients and oils that condition the hair and never leave it feeling greasy or weighed down. Just a little is all it takes.  It imparts quite a bit of shine, although it does nothing for frizz (the frizz factor in Florida is off the charts).  I have to use a separate silicone serum for that.  Although I always use a rich quick-acting mask after I shampoo, sometimes it&#x27;s not enough moisture for my very long hair.  I limit using heated styling tools, preferring instead to let my hair dry overnight and use a curling iron in the morning.  Because my hair is very hard to hold, I use the iron on the hottest setting.  This in turn tends to make my hair staticky and dry and this potion helps to alleviate that problem.  It&#x27;s perfect to use in the wintertime when hot, dry heating gives me flyaway tresses.  I really like Potion 9 and will continue to use it.  I&#x27;m just glad I can finally find it where I live.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Daughter used product hasn&#x27;t ask for anymore.</li>
            <li> Helped smooth hair but nothing too great for the price. Way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this product!  Even over high end brands at twice the price.  I have used it for over 30 years.  But just switched to the wearable styling a year ago.  Conditions better than Purology.  I have curly hair so I like the wearable styling feature.  When I straightened my hair, colored it and/or permed it, it was the only product out of the dozens I tried that kept my hair from feeling like straw.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe how great this stuff works!  I use it on damp hair and blow my hair dry straight.  The results are incredible!  My fine hair has wonderful volume without being weighed down and is straight(frizz free).  What&#x27;s even better is that the style STAYS THAT WAY all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without Potion 9!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but this product does not seem to be as good as it use to be.  It is not a bad product, but it just does not perform on my hair the way it use to.</li>
            <li> I really love this!! Put it in when out of the shower and it helps (or if you&#x27;ve been swimming, my hairs always dry after swimming and it helps) the only down side is it makes it look greasy if you put too much in</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years. I have not found anything that is as good as this product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great Hair Product - Saw a difference in hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier with results. Definitely recommend. This has become a product that I always order more of when I am running low. It&#x27;s my secret weapon!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is perfect for my curly hair. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Like this, but I like the light version better.</li>
            <li> I love it-not too greasy, heavy but soft.</li>
