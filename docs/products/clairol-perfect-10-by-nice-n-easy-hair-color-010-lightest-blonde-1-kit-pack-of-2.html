            <li>Been buying this for years and always matches great</li>
            <li>:) The texture of the hair mixture is not liquid, not too tick...just perfect.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was good that I didn&#x27;t have orange hair with a boxed blondish color...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hunting, but at an amazingly good price.</li>
            <li>Loved this product....</li>

            <li>I have received compliments by strangers asking if this is my own color.  </li>
            <li>Biggest gripe of all about dying my own hair</li>
            <li>People at work liked it, some didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>IT IS TOO GOOD OF PRODUCT TO NOT BE MORE EASILY AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li>Thank you for prompt delivery and appropriate packaging.</li>
            <li>I have always used this color for my mother who can not stand to have color on for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE HAIR COLOR EVER.</li>
            <li>only requires 10 minutes and results are excellent.  </li>
            <li>I am more satisfied with this color than when I go to the beauty shop, this is nicer.</li>
            <li>thanks so much...a happy customer.  </li>
            <li>I used Perfect 10 4 or 5 years ago and stopped because it was hard to get a good choice of colors and tones in store.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Easy &amp; Perfect\\&quot; for sure.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels as good as when I pay 10 times more to have it done professionally.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to apply,  </li>
            <li>Love it, so easy and quick.</li>
            <li>I refer them to Clairol Perfect 10 - Color 10, but have learned that Color 10 is not readily available in beauty or drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most dyes, and admittedly enjoy doing it myself (as does my wallet), but this is consistently great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but still worth it!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product though.</li>
            <li>Fabulous Best blonde color ever in only 10 minutes</li>
            <li>So easy and fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old, I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have used the perfect 10 golden blonde before and it worked perfectly, maybe it is just my pale skin in contrast with the jet black.</li>
            <li>It gave me a very natural look, shiny hair and more volume.</li>
            <li>Although the price of Perfect 10 is high (what I don&#x27;t like), at least I can get it.  </li>
            <li>burned, I should&#x27;ve stopped right there</li>
            <li>A bold, bright blonde, yet natural and on the cooler</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong though- use in a well ventilated area- outside?</li>
            <li>it did exactly what I wanted to do with the color...</li>
            <li>I love this, only need for touch ups.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and wanted.</li>
            <li>and it covers the gray very well!  </li>
            <li>It takes only 10 minutes and Amazon has a program that will send it to me on a schedule that I select, at an even greater discount.</li>
            <li>I love this hair color because it only takes 10 minutes to process which alot easier on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I also love the blonde color it gives me.</li>
            <li>so this isn&#x27;t my first dye</li>
            <li>Going to buy Color Oops straight after work!</li>
            <li>This hair color is perfect for my skin coloring, but it&#x27;s suddenly become hard to find.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as most hair colors, and I always think the color comes out beautiful.</li>
            <li>Lasts, not harsh on hair, very fast!</li>
            <li>and I must say no dye I have ever used has fried my hair this much.</li>
            <li>I used the medium brown on my light blonde hair and the results were despicable.</li>
            <li>This color makes me feel less confident about myself.</li>
            <li>Have used for several years and when no longer available at local stores found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So I turned to Amazon and not only found the exact color</li>
            <li>I have tried other products because I was unable to locate this one, and by far, this is the best hair color I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Everyone comments on how natural my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Covers gray nicely with subtle blonde color!!  </li>
            <li>It was hard to apply and I left it on for more than ten minutes, so I knew that my color would come out darker.</li>
            <li>They usually have a coupon to use when ordering and if you order two packages (total of 4 boxes) you get free shipping.</li>
            <li>This turned my hair a couple shades lighter and I have pretty dark brown hair...</li>
            <li>and if I want a little volume, I really need amonia in my hair color.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a ash, not a honey, not a golden blond: it&#x27;s a natural blond.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had a short pixie cut for years and have dyed my hair for the past 15), is the brassiness that comes with it, and I&#x27;m naturally a dishwater blonde.  </li>
            <li> But I had some grey hairs...</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t give a 5 star because some grey hairs popped up still.</li>
            <li> and it just doesn&#x27;t cover the grey in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> It looked so harsh on me after dying my hair blonde that I am going back to blonde.</li>
            <li> I am 75% white with a few &amp;#34;skunk&amp;#34; line patches.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I tried a non-amonia &amp;#34;natural hair color&amp;#34; and turned yellowish with a dull texture in my hair.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t know was that it would be an unnatural jet black color.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE WHY IT IS DIS-CONTINUED IN STORES.</li>
            <li> My hair also feels really damaged :(</li>
            <li> It has faded after a week and a half to a medium brown but did not cover some blonde, so the color is very awkward.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> color is uneven and looks awful</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. :(</li>
            <li> awful!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not turn my hair orange...thank goodness!!  But I had some grey hairs...which defeats the purpose of dying my hair so I went to a darker shade. This turned my hair a couple shades lighter and I have pretty dark brown hair...so I thought it was good that I didn&#x27;t have orange hair with a boxed blondish color...it did exactly what I wanted to do with the color...I just didn&#x27;t give a 5 star because some grey hairs popped up still. Overall a good product though.</li>
            <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Good price too.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products because I was unable to locate this one, and by far, this is the best hair color I have ever used.  The coverage is spot on and the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Best hair color ever!  Lasts, not harsh on hair, very fast!</li>
            <li> I love this, only need for touch ups. Very easy to use and works great on my hair. No orangy color</li>
            <li> Fabulous Best blonde color ever in only 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Was not really a believer until I tried this product and wow 10 minutes is all it takes.color does not fade or turn brassy as the month goes on. I was using John Frieda hair foam and it just doesn&#x27;t cover the grey in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> All arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Although the price of Perfect 10 is high (what I don&#x27;t like), at least I can get it.  It has disappeared from drugstore shelves; why is that.  Thank you for prompt delivery and appropriate packaging.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and wanted. 😁</li>
            <li> Looks and feels as good as when I pay 10 times more to have it done professionally.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it covers the gray very well!  May need to leave it on longer than the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair colors I have used, and I have used a lot. The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as most hair colors, and I always think the color comes out beautiful. I&#x27;ve used both the 10 Lightest Blonde kit, and several of the browns in the 4-6 range. They are always really beautiful colors too. I think that this will be my forever hair color brand.</li>
            <li> Best hair color on the market. I will never use anything else. Color always turns out perfect and very beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have always used this color for my mother who can not stand to have color on for more than 10 minutes. It is a beautiful rich color that lasts for well over 6 weeks. Since you can no longer find this in stores, I am thankful that Amazon carried it.</li>
            <li> This hair color is perfect for my skin coloring, but it&#x27;s suddenly become hard to find. In desperation, I tried something else: awful! So I turned to Amazon and not only found the exact color I&#x27;ve been hunting, but at an amazingly good price. It takes only 10 minutes and Amazon has a program that will send it to me on a schedule that I select, at an even greater discount. \\&quot;Easy &amp; Perfect\\&quot; for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this hair color because it only takes 10 minutes to process which alot easier on my hair.  I also love the blonde color it gives me.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE HAIR COLOR EVER. NOT SURE WHY IT IS DIS-CONTINUED IN STORES. IT IS TOO GOOD OF PRODUCT TO NOT BE MORE EASILY AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to apply.  I am 75% white with a few &amp;#34;skunk&amp;#34; line patches.  I focus on the roots and after 10-15 minutes comb through the rest of the hair (shoulder length).  I have received compliments by strangers asking if this is my own color.  I refer them to Clairol Perfect 10 - Color 10, but have learned that Color 10 is not readily available in beauty or drug stores.  I purchase mine via Amazon subscription.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.....only requires 10 minutes and results are excellent.  Have used for several years and when no longer available at local stores found it on Amazon.  They usually have a coupon to use when ordering and if you order two packages (total of 4 boxes) you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Covers gray nicely with subtle blonde color!!  Easy to apply,  definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Great, great product. So easy and fast! Best results I have ever had from a color product. Hope they never change it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for 10yrs now so this isn&#x27;t my first dye and I must say no dye I have ever used has fried my hair this much. My hair is like stretchy string and we all know what that means. I&#x27;m so upset.&lt;br /&gt;My color is uneven and looks awful so no points even on color. While applying it my eyes and throat burned, I should&#x27;ve stopped right there but stupidly I left it in for all of FIVE MINUTES, not ten. I had to write this review and try and spare others my horrid fate.</li>
            <li> I use the lightest blonde and i have some gray so it covers it well. I can not find this in the stores here anymore so I was happy to order it online. I hope they continue to make this product or I will have to find something else to use. I am more satisfied with this color than when I go to the beauty shop, this is nicer.</li>
            <li> I used Perfect 10 4 or 5 years ago and stopped because it was hard to get a good choice of colors and tones in store. Recently, I tried a non-amonia &amp;#34;natural hair color&amp;#34; and turned yellowish with a dull texture in my hair. I&#x27;m 50 years old, I have very fine hair and if I want a little volume, I really need amonia in my hair color. This 010 Lightest Blond is perfect! 10 min and I&#x27;m a blond :) The texture of the hair mixture is not liquid, not too tick...just perfect. It gave me a very natural look, shiny hair and more volume. The price is great because in store, it turns around 11.99...when they have your #color. So, I hope Amazon will keep up with that brand and that shade of blond. I recommend it to those who want to be blond, but not yellow. It&#x27;s not a ash, not a honey, not a golden blond: it&#x27;s a natural blond.</li>
            <li> Works the same as a salon for me! 20 times cheaper! The smell is very strong though- use in a well ventilated area- outside? I use a mask when using. Color fades a bit sooner than a salon maybe by a week- but still worth it! The conditioner is great they give with it!</li>
            <li> Biggest gripe of all about dying my own hair (I&#x27;ve had a short pixie cut for years and have dyed my hair for the past 15), is the brassiness that comes with it, and I&#x27;m naturally a dishwater blonde.  I&#x27;ve tried most dyes, and admittedly enjoy doing it myself (as does my wallet), but this is consistently great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons this is my fave:&lt;br /&gt;1) Can&#x27;t beat the 45 minutes of your life you get back by only spending 10 on dying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) Not a shred of brassiness/orange/yellow to be found, which, for short-haired ladies, especially shows up in the root area.&lt;br /&gt;3) A bold, bright blonde, yet natural and on the cooler side.&lt;br /&gt;4) Idiot-proof process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your blonde tresses!</li>
            <li> I used the medium brown on my light blonde hair and the results were despicable. It was hard to apply and I left it on for more than ten minutes, so I knew that my color would come out darker. What I didn&#x27;t know was that it would be an unnatural jet black color. It looked so harsh on me after dying my hair blonde that I am going back to blonde. This color makes me feel less confident about myself. My hair also feels really damaged :( People at work liked it, some didn&#x27;t but I can&#x27;t stand it and I want to change it ASAP. Don&#x27;t buy this. :( Note: I have used the perfect 10 golden blonde before and it worked perfectly, maybe it is just my pale skin in contrast with the jet black. It has faded after a week and a half to a medium brown but did not cover some blonde, so the color is very awkward. I will not use this again. Going to buy Color Oops straight after work!</li>
            <li> Love it, so easy and quick. Everyone comments on how natural my hair looks. Too bad it is hard to find.</li>
