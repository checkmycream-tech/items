            <li>This is a very good BB cream.</li>

            <li>The coverage is brilliant.</li>
            <li>MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream (No.13 Bright Beige)</li>
            <li>the shade I wear is No. 13 Bright Beige), matches my complexion and blends PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>This is a BEAUTIFUL BB Cream.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with the coverage I get.</li>
            <li>Also, ordering from Amazon insures that I can get my product quickly at a great price.  </li>
            <li>than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize and the SPF is great.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s also great for those with skin issues.</li>
            <li>But all in all, this is a great product for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time on makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is also great for acne prone and oily skin</li>
            <li>I have very light skin and this BB cream has offered the best color match.</li>
            <li>This foundation is perfect for the healthy glow look for summer.</li>
            <li>It was the perfect shade for my skin and went on easily and looked great.</li>
            <li>It has a perfume-y smell to it which I think smells quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Also, the bright beige could be THE PALEST shade I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t do you any good.</li>
            <li>To be fair though, my mom uses this bb cream and experiences no break outs</li>
            <li>Because I have acne, I searched for a good coverage BB cream.</li>
            <li>But I use a good moisturizer under so it doesn&#x27;t dries my face</li>
            <li>Tone was good.</li>
            <li>Not too fair for me</li>
            <li>And it feels so good on the skin</li>
            <li>After that, it is all good.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is good.</li>
            <li>--it looks so good and even with my skin that you can&#x27;t tell the difference between the end of the coverage and</li>
            <li>Not even sure if this is the real kind</li>
            <li>Any imperfection is highlighted unless I use a good primer beforehand.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s perfect, it&#x27;s medium to full because it&#x27;s buildable.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream!</li>
            <li>First, I will say that I am very happy with the color.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Missha&#x27;s bb creams, and this is one of my favourites!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I am blonde with very fair colored skin and it makes me almost very very fair.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, this has an amazing price for what you get.</li>
            <li>It is light with reddish undertones and looks great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very perfumey but excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>Missha Perfect Coveris such a great product.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply..</li>
            <li>Bright beight (no. 13) is surprisingly the slightest bit too light on me, which can easily be corrected by putting some powder over it.</li>
            <li>This BB doesn&#x27;t cover all of it, but it does an amazing job at evening out most of my redness.</li>
            <li>Excellent colour and natural looking...</li>
            <li>Since BB creams started flooding the US/Canadian market, I&#x27;ve tried nearly all of them in hopes of finding my perfect match.</li>
            <li>And I am happy it&#x27;s the right color because if skin color tone is very light.</li>
            <li>This bb cream has a pleasant scent that quickly fades and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>The cream goes on very smooth and almost dries on contact.  </li>
            <li>This goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have very, very light skin and have tried a number of BB creams.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for full coverage this is probably not quite it, but for light to maybe medium coverage it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I love this bb cream.</li>
            <li>This looks and feels significantly better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love that it has added SPF.</li>
            <li>ok, so BB cream has just been introduced to the UK, and when I seen the advert I thought &#x27;what the hell is BB cream?&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I still love it~ ^^</li>
            <li>Love the coverage.</li>
            <li>I do let the BB cream &amp;#34;dry/set&amp;#34; before I put on blush (I prefer powder blush) and use a setting spray, but my makeup looks so much better then before.</li>
            <li>Love the finish that it gives.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that Asians TEND to have more olive/yellow undertones and Caucasians tend to have more of a pink/brown undertone.</li>
            <li>I like my Stila One Step Correct primer better.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed and will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of blemishes, but I can get some red splotches and this covers it perfectly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and will use it until it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li>so makes the paled skin look healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>You can layer for more coverage.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin except that it was more oily.</li>
            <li>like missha.&lt;br /&gt;i love missha.&lt;br /&gt;ok</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but this matches really well which is great.</li>
            <li>basically, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream, the stuff we get here in the U.S. just doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>I love the things it does for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would call it medium coverage for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on quite smoothly and provides a good, light coverage.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it, but my skin did not.</li>
            <li>With primer underneath and a setting powder on top</li>
            <li>SERIOUSLY SO happy to have found this.out of all the high end foundations i own-this is DEF the one i reach for almost every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has pretty good coverage as well, and it&#x27;s buttery</li>
            <li>I know 5 hours doesn&#x27;t seem like a long time, but with skin like mine, I&#x27;m impressed if something lasts an hour without having to touch it up.</li>
            <li>The color is awesome for my pale skin, the coverage it light to medium (good for summer days).</li>
            <li>Lovely, lovely coverage that leaves my skin feeling and looking naturally light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blessed with good (though insanely sensitive) skin to begin with, but this makes it go from nice to airbrushed in one</li>
            <li>This color is very light, and it stays light.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with red undertones</li>
            <li>Firstly, I&#x27;d like to thank the company for producing this amazing BB cream; the coverage is absolutely amazing and natural, and it wears surprisingly well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It sets very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its also easy to build up if you want maximum coverage.  </li>
            <li>Both methods are easy and provide the coverage I need without any cakiness.</li>
            <li>BEAUTIFUL,natural shades,super creamy (but not oily),very easy to blend.</li>
            <li>I can get 12 hours of wear out of this easy.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty nice, it goes on rather smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 18 and have really fine wrinkles around my mouth and my eye area</li>
            <li>always be a fan of BB missha.. smooth and easy to apply,nice coverage</li>
            <li>I have this in the lightest color, excellent for very fair skin, would only recommend for dry skin, as the product is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a light light concealer on a budget, I&#x27;d recommend NYX&#x27;s concealer wand in Porcealin</li>
            <li>About 5 free samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never found a foundation, whether liquid or powder, that compared to this.</li>
            <li>Too light for me.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one with a nice texture (totally fills in and mattifies my pores) AND a perfect color for my skin.</li>
            <li>I recommended this to my coworker who has really light skin, and she bought and loves it as well.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t burned yet this spring and summer which is the great since all but one facial sunscreen irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>My grandmother ordered the 21 shade and she immediately adored it as well, which she will be wearing when she is held up at the hospital for a back surgery and wants to look her best without all of the work or primers, creams, powders, and rouges.</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive and so fair that I struggle to find any kind of makeup that is light enough not to create a dramatic difference between the colour of my face and that of my neck, and happily the Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream in #13</li>
            <li>Really good for my pale skin and has surprisingly good coverage for a bb cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pale and this shade is perfect.</li>
            <li>Nice and cream, however I don&#x27;t think it would be good for dark skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never before found makeup for such a wonderful price that could match my incredibly pale skintone-- and even better, double so wonderfully as a concealer!</li>
            <li>It is very light, great for someone like me (caucasion with pale skin, and doesn&#x27;t tan).     </li>
            <li>and it looks wonderfully flawless, I have to smile alot at my work, and I work around harsh chemicals and a jewelry steamer, this stuff has cut through it all</li>
            <li>I love it so far, it looks like a foundation, but hopefully a healthy one.</li>
            <li>Imediately after putting it on I looked in the mirror and thought &#x27;nothing special&#x27;,</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>I have searched exhaustively for a foundation that will match my skin and give me this matte, classically fair skin and this foundation definitely hits the marks.</li>
            <li>I feel like my initial happiness with the product wears off.</li>
            <li>On the whole, I love it.</li>
            <li>Good cream for multiple effects</li>
            <li>I checked the seal--looks good, but still occasionally it does not pump out a full &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of the stuff.</li>
            <li>I was really excited at first because I thought I finally found the perfect bb cream for my complexion, it&#x27;s hard for be because I have quite fair skin.</li>
            <li>Most BB cream products only come in one &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and claim to &amp;#34;fade into all skin shades&amp;#34;, but I wasn&#x27;t going to risk another item that didn&#x27;t come in more then one shade.</li>
            <li>so I like to play up my paleness even more for a classic look.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and amazingly has coverage like a typical foundation.</li>
            <li>And on areas where I would normally use some concealer, I can get away with using just a second coat of the BB, and it looks just great.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so you&#x27;re getting a good value for your money as well as a great product.</li>
            <li>Very good though if you maybe have blue undertones (i have green). :)</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love that it not only matches my fair skin, but that I also will no longer have to buy several products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my winter skin, but I often have trouble finding the right color for me due to VERY LIGHT skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have INCREDIBLY oily skin in my T-Zone area, large pores, under eye circles, dark marks, acne scars, and I have very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>and I even have a backup on stand by right now.</li>
            <li>The color is just right, and I can never find the right color foundation (or bb cream for me at the stores).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does everything I want it to do, which is provide high spf and light coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not a 100% concealer if you have bad blemishes, but it does a great job evening skin tone and giving that flawless complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only need to cover up some freckles and a little bit of redness which this product does perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned (a red-head), and it has been difficult to find a BB cream that adjusts adequately to my light complexion.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it has a super high SPF!</li>
            <li>I noticed from the very first application that the pump is very faulty; I have to press it again and again and again, up to a couple of dozen pumps, sometimes, to get the product to start flowing again.</li>
            <li>but I like the item very much.</li>
            <li>Works perfect on my pink toned, porcelain colored skin but due to its neutral coloring it should work on a variety of undertones.  </li>
            <li>This one has the faintest little shimmer, which is nice, and it dries really well, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>It is so much better than any of the american ones I have tried.</li>
            <li>This was my first bb cream.</li>
            <li>It can also be layered multiple times for more coverage (when you have lots of blemishes).</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a fluke and assumed it was just because it was the first time using the pump, but no...  </li>
            <li>This product was my second choice after my researching and I love it.</li>
            <li>It also came with different brand samples of BB creams and a lovely cherry lip stain packet as bonuses.</li>
            <li>With all the BB cream hype, I kind of expected something revolutionary.</li>
            <li>You know how sometimes your concealer gets darker throughout the day and while it matched at first, it&#x27;s a grungy orange by the time you get off work?  </li>
            <li>When I first received it, I probably pumped 50 times, nothing came out.  </li>
            <li>However, in hot and humid weather</li>
            <li>None could top this in color and overall quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives me better skin tone and just enough color to even out my skin.  </li>
            <li>, today is the first day I&#x27;ve been wearing it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also, before purchasing another tube, make sure you cut it open and scrape out the rest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people raving about them and saying that it&#x27;s much better for your skin and works better than traditional western foundations.</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite product in my entire cosmetic collection.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this shade, but I&#x27;ve been buying this product for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>At first I would have given it 5 stars, but it ended up breaking my skin out.</li>
            <li>The built-in full spectrum SPF 42 sunscreen is also awesome, one less step I have to go through in my everyday routine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plenty fair for my pale gingery self, but doesn&#x27;t wash me out at all.</li>
            <li>I can skip the moisturizer and use loose power to create a full coverage look that holds up under studio lights with minimal touchups, and it looks great on film and in photos.</li>
            <li>Good coverage, but be sure to exfoliate and moisturize well before applying the product because it will hunt down and cling to every dry spot you didn&#x27;t know you had!</li>
            <li>The makeup has moisturizer in it, but I apply my own moisturizer first to get a sheer, natural looking, dewy result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used skin 79 pink BB before and found it wasn&#x27;t enough coverage for my liking, this goes on somewhat heavier  and is great for layering to cover problem areas.</li>
            <li>thing that I like about this cream is the color: I&#x27;m quite pale with some pink undertones (I&#x27;m Caucasian), and the No. 13 color is just perfect for me</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t complete cover up the redness I have, but BB creams aren&#x27;t designed for full coverage</li>
            <li>The color is a little gray at first but it oxidizes to a nice shade that matches me well.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the BB cream will sit on top of your dry skin areas and look lighter than the rest of your face.</li>
            <li>It is the first product I&#x27;ve found that is actually light enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still staying strong 5 hours later.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t recommend this product enough if you are very fair-skinned and looking for an easy substitute for foundation in your makeup routine.</li>
            <li>Any red patches are no longer visible, spots are easily covered, and you really dont need to use much of it at all.</li>
            <li>This applies nicely however I probably could have used a little darker color.</li>
            <li>Korean skin care really is the greatest for my pale, dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does feel like nothing when you apply it.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and it does everything it claims.</li>
            <li>During winter when I&#x27;m not getting as much sun</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried working with it because I really wanted it to do</li>
            <li>This foundation has solved both of these problems and soaks into my skin very well</li>
            <li>Given the high SPF value, it actually goes on surprisingly easily</li>
            <li>I have ordered this several times and I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a sallow grey color like some light colored BB creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Most drugstore brands are too dark for me and make me look like a pumpkin.</li>
            <li>Plus, I have moved away from powders to set my under eye area, which looks a whole lot better for the appearance of the little &amp;#34;crinkles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But again, all things considered, I think this is a great product for the price, and would stand up to compettion against other more well-known and more expensive BB creams that you can typically find in Sephora or a department store counter.</li>
            <li>From the reviews, Western (American mostly) BB creams are more or less like tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I did research different brands and decided on buying an authentic Asian product.  </li>
            <li>It covers most things but big red/brown spots will need extra concelar.  </li>
            <li>PERFECTLY matches my skin tone without any weird yellow or orange tints.</li>
            <li>This particular bb cream sets to a dewy finish</li>
            <li>after all the hype, I was so excited to get this, thinking it would be the answer to my dry, blemished skin.</li>
            <li>However, the biggest difference between this and normal foundation comes when you take it off.</li>
            <li>Now I normally use Missha&#x27;s Hypoallergenic liquid foundation, but I wasn&#x27;t receiving the coverage I wanted</li>
            <li>but I compared it to the one I bought straight from them and its the exact same product.</li>
            <li>If only the American companies could produce anything remotely this good...</li>
            <li>Many mentioned that it can make you look &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34; pale.</li>
            <li>Before, whenever I wear makeup I feel guilty that I am hurting my skin, but now hopefully as the description on MISSHA&#x27;s cover it is healthy and good for the skin to reduce wrinkles, help lightening the dark spots as well as it is a sunblock.</li>
            <li>I have eczema, celiac cystic skin, VERY sensitive skin that lead to dermatitis then onset of acne like bumps.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas where it gets hot (but dry), and this BB cream stays on very well well into the night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wear time is average, cover is light.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that my skin was any more oily than usual after that length of time.</li>
            <li>I previously used #21, which did have a kind of grey undertone, but this color completely lacks this and blends in beautifully with my very very pale (too pale for all drugstore foundations) skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty light coverage, I was hoping for medium at least.</li>
            <li>I actually find the light perfume quite lovely, as it&#x27;s very subtle and smells almost luxurious as you&#x27;re putting it on.</li>
            <li>I use it with a drugstore highlighting concealer pen and True Match foundation (which I use primarily as a concealer / highlighter as well) to give myself a healthy, natural base.</li>
            <li>If anything, I think this BB cream is more hydrating, since I usually notice the most amount of oil on my face after a few hours when I use products that are drying or not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li>AND finally a BB cream that is light enough for my super pale skin (#13).</li>
            <li>I love the SPF42  which is hard to find</li>
            <li>It was like putting a clear product on my face.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, with dryness around the edge of my nostrils and between my eyebrows, but oiliness on my chin and forehead, along with some redness on my cheeks/nose.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Word of warning, however: this does include a whitening agent, which works well for my skin (old acne scars and a bit of sun damage on my nose), but may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>&#x27;n Wild Cover</li>
            <li>Even the lightest True Match concealer is just a tad too dark for me.</li>
            <li>Even when I use this right after exfoliating and moisturizing, my skin still looks very dry and flakey after using this.</li>
            <li>I also have a slight pinkish undertone and small acne scars, so finding something with good coverage was tricky without the makeup being too cakey.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this colour on my pale white skin, and usually I have a hard time matching my pale white to ANYTHING, but this does the trick, without drying me out, looks awesome every day, and like I said, this ONE BOTTLE has lasted over a year....!</li>
            <li>it feels just a little sticky after the application, and I always top the BB cream with loose setting powder, which I then complete with a spray of spring water.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sad about it as I otherwise love the product.</li>
            <li>it made me broke out because this is made for older skin, for bigger wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It actually gives substantial coverage too, I was very surprised!  </li>
            <li>have not had any irritation on my skin after changing to this product, which was something I was initially worried about given the high SPF</li>
            <li>I wear a good primer underneath (or at least I haven&#x27;t yet tried the BB cream without it), and combined with a tiny bit of concealer for the occasional spot and finishing powder, it&#x27;s all I need to last the day looking flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, what I liked about it is that in the past when I used other foundations, I had to use a powder after, because my face looks so shinny and oily (not natural looking at all), but with this product I really don&#x27;t need a powder, I think it looks as natural as it can be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s grey looking and doesn&#x27;t have much coverage, even for a BB cream.</li>
            <li>I did buy a BB cream from another company, but returned it because it was too dark even after it &amp;#34;oxidized&amp;#34; (which BB creams do in order to be absorbed into the skin).</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had go back to normal foundation.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to touch up with powder at all during the day like I normally do with traditional foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always had trouble finding foundations and concealers that are light enough for me.</li>
            <li>I bought a combination BB Cream set as well (I really should not have, but I wanted to try different ones) and of that set only one (the \\&quot;pearl\\&quot;) matches</li>
            <li>I have pale and neutral/slightly pink skin and most bb creams and foundations lean towards orange.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cover major skin problems, but it will even your skin and make you have a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that, on its own, on really hot muggy days, it tends to melt and slide.</li>
            <li>I am a Caucasian with yellow undertones very similar to a ridiculously pale (I always have to use the palest foundation shade) Asian girl, and found this to be so lovely with my tones!&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a few hours, it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing any makeup at all (and I like the clean coverage and refined look that it has initially).</li>
            <li>--I did mention that it&#x27;s a little thick, but all things considered (the decent coverage and sun protection), it&#x27;s pretty darn light for what it actually does.</li>
            <li>Only issue is the grey undertone causes a very \\&quot;dead\\&quot; look...</li>
            <li>pea-size amount for the face, and covers so well that even my natural blush on my cheeks ends up being the same color as the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>The product arrived a couple of weeks early (which is just as well, as it said it would take over a month to arrive) and it is cheaper than the same product on the MISSHA website.</li>
            <li>Much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Smashbox, Maybelline, Garnier, Stila, and Dior, and while the Smashbox came very close, ever since my Missha BB Cream arrived in the post I have to say there is absolutely no</li>
            <li>Smells kind of weird too.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel as if I am wearing anything at all!&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this product that were advertised (such as whitening, anti-wrinkle, and SPF 42) are hard for me to shed some light on since I live in Washington state and only received this product today, however, I can say that this product does even out my skin tone</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this seems to hide oil and went smoothly over a few dry patches.</li>
            <li>when I put it on, it looks very cakey and collects on my dry patches and looks really gross.</li>
            <li>I tried this BB cream in a sample from MISSHA previously, so I was already aware of the color that would match my complexion (the lightest No. 13).</li>
            <li>My skin is normal - not too dry and not breakout prone.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pale and have a hard time finding something that is not too pink,  this color is a perfect pale neutral and evens out any redness on my skin.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m caucasian, I sun burn very easily and it&#x27;s difficult for me to tan</li>
            <li>I am a very pale causation woman with dark circles, large pores and skin that is prone to acne which leaves spots that don&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin normally does not have too many issues (a bit dry in winter, a little oily in T zone), but this product made my skin a little oily (with a strange powdery texture) and I had some clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Barely covers any red spots.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin and this moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which makes it a win-win in my book.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super oily and thick.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a very good BB cream.</li>

            <li> The coverage is brilliant.</li>
            <li> MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream (No.13 Bright Beige)</li>
            <li> the shade I wear is No. 13 Bright Beige), matches my complexion and blends PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> This is a BEAUTIFUL BB Cream.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really happy with the coverage I get.</li>
            <li> Also, ordering from Amazon insures that I can get my product quickly at a great price.  </li>
            <li> than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize and the SPF is great.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s also great for those with skin issues.</li>
            <li> But all in all, this is a great product for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time on makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is also great for acne prone and oily skin</li>
            <li> I have very light skin and this BB cream has offered the best color match.</li>
            <li> This foundation is perfect for the healthy glow look for summer.</li>
            <li> It was the perfect shade for my skin and went on easily and looked great.</li>
            <li> It has a perfume-y smell to it which I think smells quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Also, the bright beige could be THE PALEST shade I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t do you any good.</li>
            <li> To be fair though, my mom uses this bb cream and experiences no break outs</li>
            <li> Because I have acne, I searched for a good coverage BB cream.</li>
            <li> But I use a good moisturizer under so it doesn&#x27;t dries my face</li>
            <li> Tone was good.</li>
            <li> Not too fair for me</li>
            <li> And it feels so good on the skin</li>
            <li> After that, it is all good.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is good.</li>
            <li> --it looks so good and even with my skin that you can&#x27;t tell the difference between the end of the coverage and</li>
            <li> Not even sure if this is the real kind</li>
            <li> Any imperfection is highlighted unless I use a good primer beforehand.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s perfect, it&#x27;s medium to full because it&#x27;s buildable.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream!</li>
            <li> First, I will say that I am very happy with the color.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Missha&#x27;s bb creams, and this is one of my favourites!</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> I am blonde with very fair colored skin and it makes me almost very very fair.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, this has an amazing price for what you get.</li>
            <li> It is light with reddish undertones and looks great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very perfumey but excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> Missha Perfect Coveris such a great product.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply..</li>
            <li> Bright beight (no. 13) is surprisingly the slightest bit too light on me, which can easily be corrected by putting some powder over it.</li>
            <li> This BB doesn&#x27;t cover all of it, but it does an amazing job at evening out most of my redness.</li>
            <li> Excellent colour and natural looking...</li>
            <li> Since BB creams started flooding the US/Canadian market, I&#x27;ve tried nearly all of them in hopes of finding my perfect match.</li>
            <li> And I am happy it&#x27;s the right color because if skin color tone is very light.</li>
            <li> This bb cream has a pleasant scent that quickly fades and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on very smooth and almost dries on contact.  </li>
            <li> This goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have very, very light skin and have tried a number of BB creams.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for full coverage this is probably not quite it, but for light to maybe medium coverage it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream.</li>
            <li> This looks and feels significantly better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love that it has added SPF.</li>
            <li> ok, so BB cream has just been introduced to the UK, and when I seen the advert I thought &#x27;what the hell is BB cream?&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I still love it~ ^^</li>
            <li> Love the coverage.</li>
            <li> I do let the BB cream &amp;#34;dry/set&amp;#34; before I put on blush (I prefer powder blush) and use a setting spray, but my makeup looks so much better then before.</li>
            <li> Love the finish that it gives.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that Asians TEND to have more olive/yellow undertones and Caucasians tend to have more of a pink/brown undertone.</li>
            <li> I like my Stila One Step Correct primer better.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed and will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of blemishes, but I can get some red splotches and this covers it perfectly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and will use it until it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> so makes the paled skin look healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> You can layer for more coverage.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin except that it was more oily.</li>
            <li> like missha.&lt;br /&gt;i love missha.&lt;br /&gt;ok</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but this matches really well which is great.</li>
            <li> basically, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream, the stuff we get here in the U.S. just doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I love the things it does for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would call it medium coverage for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It goes on quite smoothly and provides a good, light coverage.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but my skin did not.</li>
            <li> With primer underneath and a setting powder on top</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY SO happy to have found this.out of all the high end foundations i own-this is DEF the one i reach for almost every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has pretty good coverage as well, and it&#x27;s buttery</li>
            <li> I know 5 hours doesn&#x27;t seem like a long time, but with skin like mine, I&#x27;m impressed if something lasts an hour without having to touch it up.</li>
            <li> The color is awesome for my pale skin, the coverage it light to medium (good for summer days).</li>
            <li> Lovely, lovely coverage that leaves my skin feeling and looking naturally light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blessed with good (though insanely sensitive) skin to begin with, but this makes it go from nice to airbrushed in one</li>
            <li> This color is very light, and it stays light.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with red undertones</li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;d like to thank the company for producing this amazing BB cream; the coverage is absolutely amazing and natural, and it wears surprisingly well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It sets very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its also easy to build up if you want maximum coverage.  </li>
            <li> Both methods are easy and provide the coverage I need without any cakiness.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL,natural shades,super creamy (but not oily),very easy to blend.</li>
            <li> I can get 12 hours of wear out of this easy.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty nice, it goes on rather smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and have really fine wrinkles around my mouth and my eye area</li>
            <li> always be a fan of BB missha.. smooth and easy to apply,nice coverage</li>
            <li> I have this in the lightest color, excellent for very fair skin, would only recommend for dry skin, as the product is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a light light concealer on a budget, I&#x27;d recommend NYX&#x27;s concealer wand in Porcealin</li>
            <li> About 5 free samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never found a foundation, whether liquid or powder, that compared to this.</li>
            <li> Too light for me.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to wear all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one with a nice texture (totally fills in and mattifies my pores) AND a perfect color for my skin.</li>
            <li> I recommended this to my coworker who has really light skin, and she bought and loves it as well.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t burned yet this spring and summer which is the great since all but one facial sunscreen irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> My grandmother ordered the 21 shade and she immediately adored it as well, which she will be wearing when she is held up at the hospital for a back surgery and wants to look her best without all of the work or primers, creams, powders, and rouges.</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive and so fair that I struggle to find any kind of makeup that is light enough not to create a dramatic difference between the colour of my face and that of my neck, and happily the Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream in #13</li>
            <li> Really good for my pale skin and has surprisingly good coverage for a bb cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pale and this shade is perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice and cream, however I don&#x27;t think it would be good for dark skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never before found makeup for such a wonderful price that could match my incredibly pale skintone-- and even better, double so wonderfully as a concealer!</li>
            <li> It is very light, great for someone like me (caucasion with pale skin, and doesn&#x27;t tan).     </li>
            <li> and it looks wonderfully flawless, I have to smile alot at my work, and I work around harsh chemicals and a jewelry steamer, this stuff has cut through it all</li>
            <li> I love it so far, it looks like a foundation, but hopefully a healthy one.</li>
            <li> Imediately after putting it on I looked in the mirror and thought &#x27;nothing special&#x27;,</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> I have searched exhaustively for a foundation that will match my skin and give me this matte, classically fair skin and this foundation definitely hits the marks.</li>
            <li> I feel like my initial happiness with the product wears off.</li>
            <li> On the whole, I love it.</li>
            <li> Good cream for multiple effects</li>
            <li> I checked the seal--looks good, but still occasionally it does not pump out a full &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of the stuff.</li>
            <li> I was really excited at first because I thought I finally found the perfect bb cream for my complexion, it&#x27;s hard for be because I have quite fair skin.</li>
            <li> Most BB cream products only come in one &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and claim to &amp;#34;fade into all skin shades&amp;#34;, but I wasn&#x27;t going to risk another item that didn&#x27;t come in more then one shade.</li>
            <li> so I like to play up my paleness even more for a classic look.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and amazingly has coverage like a typical foundation.</li>
            <li> And on areas where I would normally use some concealer, I can get away with using just a second coat of the BB, and it looks just great.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so you&#x27;re getting a good value for your money as well as a great product.</li>
            <li> Very good though if you maybe have blue undertones (i have green). :)</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love that it not only matches my fair skin, but that I also will no longer have to buy several products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my winter skin, but I often have trouble finding the right color for me due to VERY LIGHT skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have INCREDIBLY oily skin in my T-Zone area, large pores, under eye circles, dark marks, acne scars, and I have very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> and I even have a backup on stand by right now.</li>
            <li> The color is just right, and I can never find the right color foundation (or bb cream for me at the stores).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does everything I want it to do, which is provide high spf and light coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not a 100% concealer if you have bad blemishes, but it does a great job evening skin tone and giving that flawless complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only need to cover up some freckles and a little bit of redness which this product does perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned (a red-head), and it has been difficult to find a BB cream that adjusts adequately to my light complexion.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it has a super high SPF!</li>
            <li> I noticed from the very first application that the pump is very faulty; I have to press it again and again and again, up to a couple of dozen pumps, sometimes, to get the product to start flowing again.</li>
            <li> but I like the item very much.</li>
            <li> Works perfect on my pink toned, porcelain colored skin but due to its neutral coloring it should work on a variety of undertones.  </li>
            <li> This one has the faintest little shimmer, which is nice, and it dries really well, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> It is so much better than any of the american ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> This was my first bb cream.</li>
            <li> It can also be layered multiple times for more coverage (when you have lots of blemishes).</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a fluke and assumed it was just because it was the first time using the pump, but no...  </li>
            <li> This product was my second choice after my researching and I love it.</li>
            <li> It also came with different brand samples of BB creams and a lovely cherry lip stain packet as bonuses.</li>
            <li> With all the BB cream hype, I kind of expected something revolutionary.</li>
            <li> You know how sometimes your concealer gets darker throughout the day and while it matched at first, it&#x27;s a grungy orange by the time you get off work?  </li>
            <li> When I first received it, I probably pumped 50 times, nothing came out.  </li>
            <li> However, in hot and humid weather</li>
            <li> None could top this in color and overall quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives me better skin tone and just enough color to even out my skin.  </li>
            <li> , today is the first day I&#x27;ve been wearing it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, before purchasing another tube, make sure you cut it open and scrape out the rest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people raving about them and saying that it&#x27;s much better for your skin and works better than traditional western foundations.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite product in my entire cosmetic collection.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this shade, but I&#x27;ve been buying this product for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> At first I would have given it 5 stars, but it ended up breaking my skin out.</li>
            <li> The built-in full spectrum SPF 42 sunscreen is also awesome, one less step I have to go through in my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plenty fair for my pale gingery self, but doesn&#x27;t wash me out at all.</li>
            <li> I can skip the moisturizer and use loose power to create a full coverage look that holds up under studio lights with minimal touchups, and it looks great on film and in photos.</li>
            <li> Good coverage, but be sure to exfoliate and moisturize well before applying the product because it will hunt down and cling to every dry spot you didn&#x27;t know you had!</li>
            <li> The makeup has moisturizer in it, but I apply my own moisturizer first to get a sheer, natural looking, dewy result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used skin 79 pink BB before and found it wasn&#x27;t enough coverage for my liking, this goes on somewhat heavier  and is great for layering to cover problem areas.</li>
            <li> thing that I like about this cream is the color: I&#x27;m quite pale with some pink undertones (I&#x27;m Caucasian), and the No. 13 color is just perfect for me</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t complete cover up the redness I have, but BB creams aren&#x27;t designed for full coverage</li>
            <li> The color is a little gray at first but it oxidizes to a nice shade that matches me well.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the BB cream will sit on top of your dry skin areas and look lighter than the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> It is the first product I&#x27;ve found that is actually light enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still staying strong 5 hours later.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend this product enough if you are very fair-skinned and looking for an easy substitute for foundation in your makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Any red patches are no longer visible, spots are easily covered, and you really dont need to use much of it at all.</li>
            <li> This applies nicely however I probably could have used a little darker color.</li>
            <li> Korean skin care really is the greatest for my pale, dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real product</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really does feel like nothing when you apply it.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal and it does everything it claims.</li>
            <li> During winter when I&#x27;m not getting as much sun</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried working with it because I really wanted it to do</li>
            <li> This foundation has solved both of these problems and soaks into my skin very well</li>
            <li> Given the high SPF value, it actually goes on surprisingly easily</li>
            <li> I have ordered this several times and I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sallow grey color like some light colored BB creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Most drugstore brands are too dark for me and make me look like a pumpkin.</li>
            <li> Plus, I have moved away from powders to set my under eye area, which looks a whole lot better for the appearance of the little &amp;#34;crinkles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But again, all things considered, I think this is a great product for the price, and would stand up to compettion against other more well-known and more expensive BB creams that you can typically find in Sephora or a department store counter.</li>
            <li> From the reviews, Western (American mostly) BB creams are more or less like tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I did research different brands and decided on buying an authentic Asian product.  </li>
            <li> It covers most things but big red/brown spots will need extra concelar.  </li>
            <li> PERFECTLY matches my skin tone without any weird yellow or orange tints.</li>
            <li> This particular bb cream sets to a dewy finish</li>
            <li> after all the hype, I was so excited to get this, thinking it would be the answer to my dry, blemished skin.</li>
            <li> However, the biggest difference between this and normal foundation comes when you take it off.</li>
            <li> Now I normally use Missha&#x27;s Hypoallergenic liquid foundation, but I wasn&#x27;t receiving the coverage I wanted</li>
            <li> but I compared it to the one I bought straight from them and its the exact same product.</li>
            <li> If only the American companies could produce anything remotely this good...</li>
            <li> Many mentioned that it can make you look &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34; pale.</li>
            <li> Before, whenever I wear makeup I feel guilty that I am hurting my skin, but now hopefully as the description on MISSHA&#x27;s cover it is healthy and good for the skin to reduce wrinkles, help lightening the dark spots as well as it is a sunblock.</li>
            <li> I have eczema, celiac cystic skin, VERY sensitive skin that lead to dermatitis then onset of acne like bumps.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas where it gets hot (but dry), and this BB cream stays on very well well into the night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wear time is average, cover is light.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that my skin was any more oily than usual after that length of time.</li>
            <li> I previously used #21, which did have a kind of grey undertone, but this color completely lacks this and blends in beautifully with my very very pale (too pale for all drugstore foundations) skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty light coverage, I was hoping for medium at least.</li>
            <li> I actually find the light perfume quite lovely, as it&#x27;s very subtle and smells almost luxurious as you&#x27;re putting it on.</li>
            <li> I use it with a drugstore highlighting concealer pen and True Match foundation (which I use primarily as a concealer / highlighter as well) to give myself a healthy, natural base.</li>
            <li> If anything, I think this BB cream is more hydrating, since I usually notice the most amount of oil on my face after a few hours when I use products that are drying or not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> AND finally a BB cream that is light enough for my super pale skin (#13).</li>
            <li> I love the SPF42  which is hard to find</li>
            <li> It was like putting a clear product on my face.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, with dryness around the edge of my nostrils and between my eyebrows, but oiliness on my chin and forehead, along with some redness on my cheeks/nose.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Word of warning, however: this does include a whitening agent, which works well for my skin (old acne scars and a bit of sun damage on my nose), but may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> &#x27;n Wild Cover</li>
            <li> Even the lightest True Match concealer is just a tad too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Even when I use this right after exfoliating and moisturizing, my skin still looks very dry and flakey after using this.</li>
            <li> I also have a slight pinkish undertone and small acne scars, so finding something with good coverage was tricky without the makeup being too cakey.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this colour on my pale white skin, and usually I have a hard time matching my pale white to ANYTHING, but this does the trick, without drying me out, looks awesome every day, and like I said, this ONE BOTTLE has lasted over a year....!</li>
            <li> it feels just a little sticky after the application, and I always top the BB cream with loose setting powder, which I then complete with a spray of spring water.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sad about it as I otherwise love the product.</li>
            <li> it made me broke out because this is made for older skin, for bigger wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It actually gives substantial coverage too, I was very surprised!  </li>
            <li> have not had any irritation on my skin after changing to this product, which was something I was initially worried about given the high SPF</li>
            <li> I wear a good primer underneath (or at least I haven&#x27;t yet tried the BB cream without it), and combined with a tiny bit of concealer for the occasional spot and finishing powder, it&#x27;s all I need to last the day looking flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, what I liked about it is that in the past when I used other foundations, I had to use a powder after, because my face looks so shinny and oily (not natural looking at all), but with this product I really don&#x27;t need a powder, I think it looks as natural as it can be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grey looking and doesn&#x27;t have much coverage, even for a BB cream.</li>
            <li> I did buy a BB cream from another company, but returned it because it was too dark even after it &amp;#34;oxidized&amp;#34; (which BB creams do in order to be absorbed into the skin).</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had go back to normal foundation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to touch up with powder at all during the day like I normally do with traditional foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble finding foundations and concealers that are light enough for me.</li>
            <li> I bought a combination BB Cream set as well (I really should not have, but I wanted to try different ones) and of that set only one (the \\&quot;pearl\\&quot;) matches</li>
            <li> I have pale and neutral/slightly pink skin and most bb creams and foundations lean towards orange.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cover major skin problems, but it will even your skin and make you have a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that, on its own, on really hot muggy days, it tends to melt and slide.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian with yellow undertones very similar to a ridiculously pale (I always have to use the palest foundation shade) Asian girl, and found this to be so lovely with my tones!&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few hours, it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing any makeup at all (and I like the clean coverage and refined look that it has initially).</li>
            <li> --I did mention that it&#x27;s a little thick, but all things considered (the decent coverage and sun protection), it&#x27;s pretty darn light for what it actually does.</li>
            <li> Only issue is the grey undertone causes a very \\&quot;dead\\&quot; look...</li>
            <li> pea-size amount for the face, and covers so well that even my natural blush on my cheeks ends up being the same color as the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> The product arrived a couple of weeks early (which is just as well, as it said it would take over a month to arrive) and it is cheaper than the same product on the MISSHA website.</li>
            <li> Much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Smashbox, Maybelline, Garnier, Stila, and Dior, and while the Smashbox came very close, ever since my Missha BB Cream arrived in the post I have to say there is absolutely no</li>
            <li> Smells kind of weird too.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t feel as if I am wearing anything at all!&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this product that were advertised (such as whitening, anti-wrinkle, and SPF 42) are hard for me to shed some light on since I live in Washington state and only received this product today, however, I can say that this product does even out my skin tone</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this seems to hide oil and went smoothly over a few dry patches.</li>
            <li> when I put it on, it looks very cakey and collects on my dry patches and looks really gross.</li>
            <li> I tried this BB cream in a sample from MISSHA previously, so I was already aware of the color that would match my complexion (the lightest No. 13).</li>
            <li> My skin is normal - not too dry and not breakout prone.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pale and have a hard time finding something that is not too pink,  this color is a perfect pale neutral and evens out any redness on my skin.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m caucasian, I sun burn very easily and it&#x27;s difficult for me to tan</li>
            <li> I am a very pale causation woman with dark circles, large pores and skin that is prone to acne which leaves spots that don&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin normally does not have too many issues (a bit dry in winter, a little oily in T zone), but this product made my skin a little oily (with a strange powdery texture) and I had some clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Barely covers any red spots.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and this moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which makes it a win-win in my book.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super oily and thick.</li>
            <li> For reference, I am pale with freckles with combination skin that it oily in the T zone and very acne prone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick during the application, but easy enough to apply over the entire face, just like a cream would be.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to find products light enough for me.</li>
            <li> I buy it because  my last bottle is almost empty, and I like this white color, it does help me.</li>
            <li> I wear it daily and set it with a loose powder.</li>
            <li> A few other reviews have complained about the product being strongly scented or too oily, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with either of these things.</li>
            <li> but she is not nearly as acne prone as I</li>
            <li> I never have to touch it up and it wears for a really long time.</li>
            <li> It worked well but did not stay on for as long as it should have.</li>
            <li> Not too pink, not too yellow, not too orange (which is basically unheard of in my experience).</li>
            <li> All drugstore brands are too pink, yellow, or orange for me.  </li>
            <li> Color is not natural.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really no different feeling from my Wet</li>
            <li> my skin and the others are strangely grey.</li>
            <li> The shipping took long</li>
            <li> That said, this might actually be due to Bare Mineral&#x27;s Mineral Veil which I used as a finisher -- I have had trouble with Bare Minerals in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this BB cream covers actually quite well, compared to other BB creams.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin</li>
            <li> This bb cream makes my face flakey and dry looking even if I use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it was actually too pale for me (which I didnt think was possible).  </li>
            <li> I have used every single drug store, department store, and almost every foundation found at Ulta.</li>
            <li> ..doesnt make my skin dry .Thanks!</li>
            <li> It does appear to have a slight yellow cast when it comes out, but that doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin, which is pink-undertoned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am very pale and have been unable to find a bb cream that was light enough for my complexion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really different than a liquid foundation, and may actually be a little bit thicker.</li>
            <li> It was a bit worn in the corners and a little crinkled up, the actual makeup inside seemed untouched and has never been used.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed no unusual breakouts or patches of irritation.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star if I hadn&#x27;t had so much trouble pumping the cream initially.  </li>
            <li> It has pink tone</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really a drawback.</li>
            <li> I have pink undertones and this color is AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try a different finishing powder and give it a few days,</li>
            <li> The tube may seem empty</li>
            <li> I got this a few months ago because I wanted to try out an asian BB cream.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t seem so pink.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and usually once I take my make-up off my skin feels tight, but with this cream my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a really pale girl, the type that reflects sunlight like a mirror, so I&#x27;ve always had issues finding a brand of foundation that matches my neck and overall skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and almost everything is far too orange and dark for me.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I apply with just my fingers and other days</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this bb cream. It is so much better than any of the american ones I have tried. The color is a little gray at first but it oxidizes to a nice shade that matches me well.</li>
            <li> The only bb cream I use. It is the best.</li>
            <li> This might be my HG foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive to drugstore, BB creams, CC creams, lightweight foundations, etc. This looks and feels significantly better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. Pores aren&#x27;t exaggerated. I love that it has added SPF. It doesn&#x27;t feel cakey and thick (as compared to something like Laura Mercier). It sets very quickly. AND finally a BB cream that is light enough for my super pale skin (#13). As an added bonus, this has an amazing price for what you get.</li>
            <li> I credit this, along with Nia24 and BurnOut sunblock, with making my skin look flawless. I am prone to irritation from skin products (my cheeks turn red, my pores clog, and I break out), but this BB does not cause any problems. I previously used #21, which did have a kind of grey undertone, but this color completely lacks this and blends in beautifully with my very very pale (too pale for all drugstore foundations) skin. It does appear to have a slight yellow cast when it comes out, but that doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin, which is pink-undertoned. It won&#x27;t cover major skin problems, but it will even your skin and make you have a bit of a glow. I get compliments constantly on my skin, and no one thinks I&#x27;m wearing any makeup whatsoever because the BB allows my skin&#x27;s texture to show through.</li>
            <li> ok, so BB cream has just been introduced to the UK, and when I seen the advert I thought &#x27;what the hell is BB cream?&#x27;.  So, after lots of research I decided to give one a go, and after researching the biggest sellers I decided on this one.  I tried it out as soon as it arrived (which was much earlier than the delivery estimate by the way).  Imediately after putting it on I looked in the mirror and thought &#x27;nothing special&#x27;, but oh was I wrong.  The coverage is brilliant. Any red patches are no longer visible, spots are easily covered, and you really dont need to use much of it at all. Its also easy to build up if you want maximum coverage.  However, the biggest difference between this and normal foundation comes when you take it off. I have very dry skin and usually once I take my make-up off my skin feels tight, but with this cream my skin is so soft and I dont even need to use moisturiser every night.  The only thing that I would say is that I bought No.13 as I am very pale and usually I need to buy the lightest colour of foundation, but as this cream is origionally from Korea it was actually too pale for me (which I didnt think was possible).  All in all, I will defintely be buying this again, but probably in the next shade up.</li>
            <li> This was my first bb cream. It is pretty nice, it goes on rather smooth. It is very light, great for someone like me (caucasion with pale skin, and doesn&#x27;t tan).     Only issue is the grey undertone causes a very \\&quot;dead\\&quot; look...Very good though if you maybe have blue undertones (i have green). :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited at first because I thought I finally found the perfect bb cream for my complexion, it&#x27;s hard for be because I have quite fair skin. But this bb cream does nothing... doesn&#x27;t hide my blemishes or redness, not even slightly. It was like putting a clear product on my face. Don&#x27;t buy this if you have any skin imperfections whatsoever it won&#x27;t do you any good.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. It was the perfect shade for my skin and went on easily and looked great. However, it makes my skin break out horribly after I use it even though I thoroughly clean my skin after use. I&#x27;m pretty sad about it as I otherwise love the product. To be fair though, my mom uses this bb cream and experiences no break outs but she is not nearly as acne prone as I am.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I guess I&#x27;ll be sticking with my Skin79 VIP Gold bb cream for now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real product</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble finding foundations and concealers that are light enough for me. Actually, I&#x27;ve never found one. However, this Missha BB cream is a PERFECT match. I have very, very pale blue/cool toned Alaskan skin, but this totally works for me. This is a relatively sheer BB cream, but it does immediately resolve redness issues with one layer. It can also be layered multiple times for more coverage (when you have lots of blemishes). It&#x27;s definitely not a 100% concealer if you have bad blemishes, but it does a great job evening skin tone and giving that flawless complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a light light concealer on a budget, I&#x27;d recommend NYX&#x27;s concealer wand in Porcealin (CW01)... it&#x27;s basically the only thing I&#x27;ve found. Even the lightest True Match concealer is just a tad too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin and this BB cream has offered the best color match. It is buildable and I usually apply it with my fingers or with a makeup sponge. I never have to touch it up and it wears for a really long time. I will definitely repurchase this and I even have a backup on stand by right now.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;d like to thank the company for producing this amazing BB cream; the coverage is absolutely amazing and natural, and it wears surprisingly well throughout the day. I&#x27;ve never before found makeup for such a wonderful price that could match my incredibly pale skintone-- and even better, double so wonderfully as a concealer! Lovely, lovely coverage that leaves my skin feeling and looking naturally light.  However, I did have an issue that&#x27;s getting really annoying. I noticed from the very first application that the pump is very faulty; I have to press it again and again and again, up to a couple of dozen pumps, sometimes, to get the product to start flowing again. And this isn&#x27;t when I start applying the BB cream either, sometimes it strikes in the middle of my application. At first I thought it was a fluke and assumed it was just because it was the first time using the pump, but no...  I&#x27;ve been waiting for the issue to resolve itself, hoping that the pump will improve with use, but this keeps happening and I&#x27;m getting quite irritated. For that, I&#x27;m giving the product 4 stars instead of 5.  Is there anything that can be done about this? I hope that all the products aren&#x27;t like this, but I&#x27;m a bit annoyed at my bad luck.</li>
            <li> Because I have acne, I searched for a good coverage BB cream. This one&#x27;s perfect, it&#x27;s medium to full because it&#x27;s buildable. But the thing is that it dries my skin. The SPF, the color, the whitening effect and the anti-wrinkle effect was PERFECT! But it&#x27;s not that moisturizing. But I use a good moisturizer under so it doesn&#x27;t dries my face but still, I can&#x27;t wear it alone! :&#x27;(&lt;br /&gt;And I have another problem.. I&#x27;m 18 and have really fine wrinkles around my mouth and my eye area so I throught: Why not give this a try?&lt;br /&gt;But it made me broke out because this is made for older skin, for bigger wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I still use it because of the color, the SPF for some days but not daily. I still love it~ ^^</li>
            <li> love it!!! always be a fan of BB missha.. smooth and easy to apply,nice coverage..doesnt make my skin dry .Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, with dryness around the edge of my nostrils and between my eyebrows, but oiliness on my chin and forehead, along with some redness on my cheeks/nose. This BB cream works perfectly for me. It doesn&#x27;t contribute to the oiliness, and it doesn&#x27;t cause those annoying little flakes in the dry areas. It doesn&#x27;t complete cover up the redness I have, but BB creams aren&#x27;t designed for full coverage and I&#x27;m really happy with the coverage I get.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage. Tone was good. Not too fair for me</li>
            <li> It worked well but did not stay on for as long as it should have.</li>
            <li> I am a very pale causation woman with dark circles, large pores and skin that is prone to acne which leaves spots that don&#x27;t fade quickly. I also loathe foundation ( have spent a small fortune trying out every type of base out there) and tinted moisturizer is a joke. So when I heard about Asian women using BB cream, I thought I would give it a try. I did research different brands and decided on buying an authentic Asian product.  From the reviews, Western (American mostly) BB creams are more or less like tinted moisturizer. I did buy a BB cream from another company, but returned it because it was too dark even after it &amp;#34;oxidized&amp;#34; (which BB creams do in order to be absorbed into the skin). Most BB cream products only come in one &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and claim to &amp;#34;fade into all skin shades&amp;#34;, but I wasn&#x27;t going to risk another item that didn&#x27;t come in more then one shade. This product was my second choice after my researching and I love it. It is light with reddish undertones and looks great on my skin. It is very light weight and amazingly has coverage like a typical foundation. I do have to &amp;#34;layer&amp;#34; the product under my eyes and on acne spots, but that is all I basically have to use! I love it! Yes my dark circles are still visible, but that is just the way it is. Plus, I have moved away from powders to set my under eye area, which looks a whole lot better for the appearance of the little &amp;#34;crinkles&amp;#34;. I do let the BB cream &amp;#34;dry/set&amp;#34; before I put on blush (I prefer powder blush) and use a setting spray, but my makeup looks so much better then before. It doesn&#x27;t cake or get greasy, even with the &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; I do. Not to mention, it has a super high SPF! Wonderful stuff. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne and redness. This BB doesn&#x27;t cover all of it, but it does an amazing job at evening out most of my redness. It&#x27;s plenty fair for my pale gingery self, but doesn&#x27;t wash me out at all. Not too pink, not too yellow, not too orange (which is basically unheard of in my experience). Worth every penny. I use it with a drugstore highlighting concealer pen and True Match foundation (which I use primarily as a concealer / highlighter as well) to give myself a healthy, natural base.</li>
            <li> I have this in the lightest color, excellent for very fair skin, would only recommend for dry skin, as the product is very moisturizing. Love the finish that it gives. Wear time is average, cover is light.</li>
            <li> Many mentioned that it can make you look &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34; pale. It should be noted that Asians TEND to have more olive/yellow undertones and Caucasians tend to have more of a pink/brown undertone. I am a Caucasian with yellow undertones very similar to a ridiculously pale (I always have to use the palest foundation shade) Asian girl, and found this to be so lovely with my tones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does feel like nothing when you apply it. It only takes a &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; pea-size amount for the face, and covers so well that even my natural blush on my cheeks ends up being the same color as the rest of my face. The product arrived a couple of weeks early (which is just as well, as it said it would take over a month to arrive) and it is cheaper than the same product on the MISSHA website. It also came with different brand samples of BB creams and a lovely cherry lip stain packet as bonuses. About 5 free samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never found a foundation, whether liquid or powder, that compared to this. Even BareMinerals, which is considered the holy grail of makeup and with a price to match. This is wonderful. My grandmother ordered the 21 shade and she immediately adored it as well, which she will be wearing when she is held up at the hospital for a back surgery and wants to look her best without all of the work or primers, creams, powders, and rouges. Thank you, supplier! This is a BEAUTIFUL BB Cream.</li>
            <li> With all the BB cream hype, I kind of expected something revolutionary. It&#x27;s not really different than a liquid foundation, and may actually be a little bit thicker. This one has the faintest little shimmer, which is nice, and it dries really well, which is important to me. But I have to add a drop of water to it on my fingers to get the sheerness I prefer. I like my Stila One Step Correct primer better.</li>
            <li> I picked up an American BB cream a few months ago and hated it. Nothing but tinted moisturizer. This is the real deal and it does everything it claims. I have incredibly sensitive skin and I have noticed no unusual breakouts or patches of irritation. Word of warning, however: this does include a whitening agent, which works well for my skin (old acne scars and a bit of sun damage on my nose), but may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> #13 matches my very fair skin tone perfectly! Good coverage, but be sure to exfoliate and moisturize well before applying the product because it will hunt down and cling to every dry spot you didn&#x27;t know you had!</li>
            <li> I usually have to buy the lightest shade of foundation/powder and even these are often a little dark on me. I&#x27;m am very pale and have been unable to find a bb cream that was light enough for my complexion. I had previously tried Neutrogena and Garnier bb creams in their lightest shades and both were at least 3 shades too dark. Bright beight (no. 13) is surprisingly the slightest bit too light on me, which can easily be corrected by putting some powder over it. During winter when I&#x27;m not getting as much sun I think this shade will be a perfect match. This bb cream has a pleasant scent that quickly fades and it goes on very smoothly. It does everything I want it to do, which is provide high spf and light coverage. I only need to cover up some freckles and a little bit of redness which this product does perfectly. I have combination skin and this seems to hide oil and went smoothly over a few dry patches. I am very impressed and will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot recommend this enough. I&#x27;m as White as a Sheet. Ghostly pale.  Gentlemen down the block call me &amp;#34;Snowflake&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this sounds like you, this shade will match you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has cooler undertones and THERE IS NO OXIDATION! You know how sometimes your concealer gets darker throughout the day and while it matched at first, it&#x27;s a grungy orange by the time you get off work?  That&#x27;s oxidation. This has none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has pretty good coverage as well, and it&#x27;s buttery smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did expect this to take like a month to ship, but it only took like a week. I was very happy and surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the $55 foundation I bought that didn&#x27;t match my skin tone, I think I&#x27;ll just buy this forever.</li>
            <li> I never had acne in my life until I used this product. It&#x27;s super oily and thick. I had to wash my face twice just to remove it. Will never use bb cream again.</li>
            <li> I am pale as a ghost with pinkish undertones and No. 13 is my holy grail foundation. I don&#x27;t have a lot of blemishes, but I can get some red splotches and this covers it perfectly. Sometimes I apply with just my fingers and other days I use my beauty blender sponge. Both methods are easy and provide the coverage I need without any cakiness. I absolutely love this product and will use it until it&#x27;s discontinued. That will be a very sad day, indeed.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned (a red-head), and it has been difficult to find a BB cream that adjusts adequately to my light complexion. Everything I have tried in the past made me look orangey or too dark. This shade is perfect. And it feels so good on the skin, I often forget I&#x27;m even wearing makeup at all. A little bit goes a long way, so you&#x27;re getting a good value for your money as well as a great product. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This applies nicely however I probably could have used a little darker color. I am blonde with very fair colored skin and it makes me almost very very fair. Too light for me. I love the SPF42  which is hard to find and I do use a moisturizer before application.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star if I hadn&#x27;t had so much trouble pumping the cream initially.  When I first received it, I probably pumped 50 times, nothing came out.  I suspected it had something wrong inside.  Next day, I tried about same # of times, it finally squirted out.  After that, it is all good.  The cream goes on very smooth and almost dries on contact.  It is comfortable to wear all day.  It has pink tone so makes the paled skin look healthy.  I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.  I was a bit wary about using a BB cream or anything on my face when I cannot read the instructions or ingredients but I know MISSHA is a trusted brand. This goes on very smooth.  I apply it like I would lotion or sunscreen.  You can layer for more coverage.  It covers most things but big red/brown spots will need extra concelar.  I believe my skin has improved since using it as well.  This color is very light, and it stays light.  It does not oxidize, on my face anyway.  All drugstore brands are too pink, yellow, or orange for me.  For reference, I am pale with freckles with combination skin that it oily in the T zone and very acne prone.  Also, ordering from Amazon insures that I can get my product quickly at a great price.  I do recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent colour and natural looking... Very easy to apply.. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this... The best bb cream ever for all skin types</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB Cream. It&#x27;s the only one with a nice texture (totally fills in and mattifies my pores) AND a perfect color for my skin. I have pale and neutral/slightly pink skin and most bb creams and foundations lean towards orange. If you have warmer skin then this may have a grayish cast on you, but for me it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grey looking and doesn&#x27;t have much coverage, even for a BB cream. It&#x27;s like lotion but does nothing for me. I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin except that it was more oily. Smells kind of weird too.</li>
            <li> Really good for my pale skin and has surprisingly good coverage for a bb cream. Nice and cream, however I don&#x27;t think it would be good for dark skin.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate makeup for me. I love that it not only matches my fair skin, but that I also will no longer have to buy several products. I recommended this to my coworker who has really light skin, and she bought and loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Seriously I have been using this ONE BB cream for about a year now. I have always loved this colour on my pale white skin, and usually I have a hard time matching my pale white to ANYTHING, but this does the trick, without drying me out, looks awesome every day, and like I said, this ONE BOTTLE has lasted over a year....!</li>
            <li> Too thick.  Color is not natural.  It was a waste of money and I will be throwing it out.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream (No.13 Bright Beige) SPF42 PA+++ (50ml)&lt;br /&gt;good~~~~&lt;br /&gt;i like missha.&lt;br /&gt;i love missha.&lt;br /&gt;ok</li>
            <li> But this is the best. It stays on ALL day, even through sweat. I add some powder just to keep my skin from getting oily looking but other than that it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m really pale and this shade is perfect. When I put it on, it just looks like my red spots have disappeared. I&#x27;ve been using the same 20ml bottle for over a year since I don&#x27;t use it every day. It stores well, I&#x27;ll say that. It hasn&#x27;t gone bad at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very good BB cream. The color is just right, and I can never find the right color foundation (or bb cream for me at the stores).&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted it IS a little drying. However, in hot and humid weather it&#x27;s not really a drawback.</li>
            <li> after all the hype, I was so excited to get this, thinking it would be the answer to my dry, blemished skin. not exactly. it&#x27;s pretty light coverage, I was hoping for medium at least. it&#x27;s really no different feeling from my Wet &#x27;n Wild Cover All foundation from the drug store which I got for $4 I think. it&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer. I have suuuuper pale skin but this matches really well which is great. basically, it&#x27;s okay but it&#x27;s not great or anything and I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream, the stuff we get here in the U.S. just doesn&#x27;t compare. I will add this caution though...If you have dry skin like I do, you need to get the BB Boomer primer. Otherwise the BB cream will sit on top of your dry skin areas and look lighter than the rest of your face. Other than that It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this several times and I am never disappointed. It works with my sickly pale skin tone. Thank you Korea for realizing not everyone tans constantly. Also, don&#x27;t worry about this if you have oily skin.  It has only improved my skin and lasts all day. IT DIDN&#x27;T MAKE ME BREAK OUT EITHER LIKE AMERICAN BB CREAM DID. Also all of the american bb cream is almost orange on my skin. This is not. I approve of this. Please just give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream! I am extremely pale and have a hard time finding something that is not too pink,  this color is a perfect pale neutral and evens out any redness on my skin. I&#x27;ve used skin 79 pink BB before and found it wasn&#x27;t enough coverage for my liking, this goes on somewhat heavier  and is great for layering to cover problem areas. I used a moisturizer before and it works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;Highly&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> I have very, very light skin and have tried a number of BB creams. None could top this in color and overall quality. It&#x27;s not a sallow grey color like some light colored BB creams I&#x27;ve tried. After using it for a while, I could tell the difference it made to my skin. It does moisturize and the SPF is great. I&#x27;m prone to rosacea and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is a big plus for me. The coverage is good. I only have to use concealer for my under eyes. I wear it daily and set it with a loose powder. It lasts me 12+ hours. I&#x27;ve been wearing this brand for a year now, and don&#x27;t know what I would do if I couldn&#x27;t buy it anymore. I even wear it when I go out for a run and it survives sweat and heat. One tube lasted me 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even fallen asleep wearing it before and it didn&#x27;t make me break out. It&#x27;s perfect in my book.</li>
            <li> I tried this BB cream in a sample from MISSHA previously, so I was already aware of the color that would match my complexion (the lightest No. 13). I think this BB cream covers actually quite well, compared to other BB creams. And on areas where I would normally use some concealer, I can get away with using just a second coat of the BB, and it looks just great. It&#x27;s a little thick during the application, but easy enough to apply over the entire face, just like a cream would be. The color blends well also, and lasts the entire day--it feels just a little sticky after the application, and I always top the BB cream with loose setting powder, which I then complete with a spray of spring water.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I like about this cream is the color: I&#x27;m quite pale with some pink undertones (I&#x27;m Caucasian), and the No. 13 color is just perfect for me--it looks so good and even with my skin that you can&#x27;t tell the difference between the end of the coverage and my neck.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product, in my opinion, is the SPF 42. Given the high SPF value, it actually goes on surprisingly easily--I did mention that it&#x27;s a little thick, but all things considered (the decent coverage and sun protection), it&#x27;s pretty darn light for what it actually does. And it stays on throughout the day, too--I live in Texas where it gets hot (but dry), and this BB cream stays on very well well into the night.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any irritation on my skin after changing to this product, which was something I was initially worried about given the high SPF value.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for taking off one star is the packaging. While initially the product came out well out of the tube, recently the pump started misbehaving, like it&#x27;s sucking in air instead of product. I checked the seal--looks good, but still occasionally it does not pump out a full &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of the stuff. But again, all things considered, I think this is a great product for the price, and would stand up to compettion against other more well-known and more expensive BB creams that you can typically find in Sephora or a department store counter.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and the one that&#x27;s a shade darker (no. 21) for the summer.  I love the things it does for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives me better skin tone and just enough color to even out my skin.  I&#x27;m blessed with good (though insanely sensitive) skin to begin with, but this makes it go from nice to airbrushed in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: if you tend toward oily you may get a sheen by the end of the day. Also, the bright beige could be THE PALEST shade I&#x27;ve seen.  It&#x27;s perfect for my winter skin, but I often have trouble finding the right color for me due to VERY LIGHT skin tone.  Most drugstore brands are too dark for me and make me look like a pumpkin.</li>
            <li> This foundation is perfect for the healthy glow look for summer. But it&#x27;s also great for those with skin issues. I have eczema, celiac cystic skin, VERY sensitive skin that lead to dermatitis then onset of acne like bumps. Not only have I not have had any dermatitis reaction I haven&#x27;t had any acne or breakouts since using this BB cream. Also it has fully healed all of my facial acne, eczema and redness. I have also started applying it to my neck and decollate which is improving past sun damage redness.  The best thing is it has SPF 42 and I haven&#x27;t burned yet this spring and summer which is the great since all but one facial sunscreen irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used every single drug store, department store, and almost every foundation found at Ulta. They never worked for me. I have INCREDIBLY oily skin in my T-Zone area, large pores, under eye circles, dark marks, acne scars, and I have very acne prone skin. Terrible. Now I normally use Missha&#x27;s Hypoallergenic liquid foundation, but I wasn&#x27;t receiving the coverage I wanted (some of my acne and acne scars would still show through). So I tried this, today is the first day I&#x27;ve been wearing it and it looks wonderfully flawless, I have to smile alot at my work, and I work around harsh chemicals and a jewelry steamer, this stuff has cut through it all and it&#x27;s still staying strong 5 hours later. I know 5 hours doesn&#x27;t seem like a long time, but with skin like mine, I&#x27;m impressed if something lasts an hour without having to touch it up. Will buy again and for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> First, I will say that I am very happy with the color. I am a very fair skinned woman and I model so I like to play up my paleness even more for a classic look. I have searched exhaustively for a foundation that will match my skin and give me this matte, classically fair skin and this foundation definitely hits the marks. I bought a combination BB Cream set as well (I really should not have, but I wanted to try different ones) and of that set only one (the \\&quot;pearl\\&quot;) matches my skin and the others are strangely grey. I have pink undertones and this color is AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said...I feel like my initial happiness with the product wears off. After a few hours, it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing any makeup at all (and I like the clean coverage and refined look that it has initially). My skin normally does not have too many issues (a bit dry in winter, a little oily in T zone), but this product made my skin a little oily (with a strange powdery texture) and I had some clogged pores. That said, this might actually be due to Bare Mineral&#x27;s Mineral Veil which I used as a finisher -- I have had trouble with Bare Minerals in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try a different finishing powder and give it a few days, and then I&#x27;ll update my review. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect bb cream for me! I am very pale and almost everything is far too orange and dark for me.  This BB cream is perfection.  It actually gives substantial coverage too, I was very surprised!  I would call it medium coverage for sure.</li>
            <li> Not even sure if this is the real kind lol..smells just like sunscreen</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY SO happy to have found this.out of all the high end foundations i own-this is DEF the one i reach for almost every day.BEAUTIFUL,natural shades,super creamy (but not oily),very easy to blend. LOVE-LOVE-LOVE!</li>
            <li> I have just recently bought the product. I love it so far, it looks like a foundation, but hopefully a healthy one. Before, whenever I wear makeup I feel guilty that I am hurting my skin, but now hopefully as the description on MISSHA&#x27;s cover it is healthy and good for the skin to reduce wrinkles, help lightening the dark spots as well as it is a sunblock. Also, what I liked about it is that in the past when I used other foundations, I had to use a powder after, because my face looks so shinny and oily (not natural looking at all), but with this product I really don&#x27;t need a powder, I think it looks as natural as it can be. I like it.</li>
            <li> On the whole, I love it. It is the first product I&#x27;ve found that is actually light enough for my skin tone. It provides ample coverage, which can be built up to cover any problem areas. My only problem is that, on its own, on really hot muggy days, it tends to melt and slide. So use a primer, or setting powder or spray, on such days. Otherwise wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have repurchased this product twice now! Its medium coverage so some concealer may be need to cover acne scars. But all in all, this is a great product for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time on makeup in the morning. This is also great for acne prone and oily skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, before purchasing another tube, make sure you cut it open and scrape out the rest. The tube may seem empty but there&#x27;s still a ton in the bottle!</li>
            <li> Literally reached my house in less than a week. Much faster than expected. Very perfumey but excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> I got this a few months ago because I wanted to try out an asian BB cream. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people raving about them and saying that it&#x27;s much better for your skin and works better than traditional western foundations. This was one of the bb creams that was recommended to me and I&#x27;m disappointed. My skin is normal - not too dry and not breakout prone. This bb cream makes my face flakey and dry looking even if I use a moisturizer. Any imperfection is highlighted unless I use a good primer beforehand. I&#x27;ve tried working with it because I really wanted it to do it&#x27;s job but I&#x27;ve had go back to normal foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a really pale girl, the type that reflects sunlight like a mirror, so I&#x27;ve always had issues finding a brand of foundation that matches my neck and overall skin tone. I also have a slight pinkish undertone and small acne scars, so finding something with good coverage was tricky without the makeup being too cakey. This foundation has solved both of these problems and soaks into my skin very well, I don&#x27;t feel as if I am wearing anything at all!&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this product that were advertised (such as whitening, anti-wrinkle, and SPF 42) are hard for me to shed some light on since I live in Washington state and only received this product today, however, I can say that this product does even out my skin tone so it doesn&#x27;t seem so pink. I like the fact that it can do that without making me look unhealthily white.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I would say is a negative would be that when the package arrived today, the box the makeup was in seemed roughly handled. It was a bit worn in the corners and a little crinkled up, the actual makeup inside seemed untouched and has never been used.</li>
            <li> Good cream for multiple effects</li>
            <li> Best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used. I just ordered my second tube, don&#x27;t plan on switching to anything else anytime soon. I have very fair skin with red undertones, I&#x27;m caucasian, I sun burn very easily and it&#x27;s difficult for me to tan, I&#x27;m naturally blonde, and blue eyed. I have a hard time finding a foundation that isn&#x27;t too dark/too orange, but this evens out my skin tone (the shade I wear is No. 13 Bright Beige), matches my complexion and blends PERFECTLY. The makeup has moisturizer in it, but I apply my own moisturizer first to get a sheer, natural looking, dewy result. I can skip the moisturizer and use loose power to create a full coverage look that holds up under studio lights with minimal touchups, and it looks great on film and in photos. The built-in full spectrum SPF 42 sunscreen is also awesome, one less step I have to go through in my everyday routine. It lasts all day and throughout the evening. A few pumps goes a long way. One tube lasted me about 3 months, give or take, and I wear makeup just about every day. Probably my favorite product in my entire cosmetic collection. Also, the shipping always says some crazy amount of time like 17-22 days or something, but both times that I&#x27;ve ordered this, it&#x27;s gotten here within a week or so.</li>
            <li> This is the legit stuff! I am always a little skeptical when not buying direct from MISSHA but I compared it to the one I bought straight from them and its the exact same product.</li>
            <li> Missha Perfect Coveris such a great product. It covers imperfections (sometimes I apply two layers to my chicken pox and acne scars)  and I can stay outside all day with no reapplication and still avoid sunburn. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. I won&#x27;t be switching foundation any time soon!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this shade, but I&#x27;ve been buying this product for 3 years now. And once this runs out ill buy it again. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Korean skin care really is the greatest for my pale, dry, sensitive skin.  I LOVE Missha&#x27;s bb creams, and this is one of my favourites!</li>
            <li> Since BB creams started flooding the US/Canadian market, I&#x27;ve tried nearly all of them in hopes of finding my perfect match. I&#x27;ve tried Smashbox, Maybelline, Garnier, Stila, and Dior, and while the Smashbox came very close, ever since my Missha BB Cream arrived in the post I have to say there is absolutely no contest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive and so fair that I struggle to find any kind of makeup that is light enough not to create a dramatic difference between the colour of my face and that of my neck, and happily the Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream in #13 PERFECTLY matches my skin tone without any weird yellow or orange tints. A few other reviews have complained about the product being strongly scented or too oily, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with either of these things. I actually find the light perfume quite lovely, as it&#x27;s very subtle and smells almost luxurious as you&#x27;re putting it on. The coverage is superb without feeling cakey, and after 7-8 hours of wear I didn&#x27;t find that my skin was any more oily than usual after that length of time. If anything, I think this BB cream is more hydrating, since I usually notice the most amount of oil on my face after a few hours when I use products that are drying or not moisturizing enough. I didn&#x27;t need to touch up with powder at all during the day like I normally do with traditional foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough if you are very fair-skinned and looking for an easy substitute for foundation in your makeup routine. I wear a good primer underneath (or at least I haven&#x27;t yet tried the BB cream without it), and combined with a tiny bit of concealer for the occasional spot and finishing powder, it&#x27;s all I need to last the day looking flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply blown away! No wonder this product took off the way it did in Asia. If only the American companies could produce anything remotely this good...</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin and it&#x27;s difficult to find products light enough for me. I ordered this in #13, the lightest shade and it is a very good match for me. It goes on quite smoothly and provides a good, light coverage. If you are looking for full coverage this is probably not quite it, but for light to maybe medium coverage it&#x27;s great. It has a perfume-y smell to it which I think smells quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> The color is awesome for my pale skin, the coverage it light to medium (good for summer days). At first I would have given it 5 stars, but it ended up breaking my skin out. I wanted to love it, but my skin did not.</li>
            <li> I buy it because  my last bottle is almost empty, and I like this white color, it does help me.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I use it as foundation and sun block.  Feels like butter!  My skin hasn&#x27;t had any break outs and dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> The shipping took long but I like the item very much. And I am happy it&#x27;s the right color because if skin color tone is very light.</li>
            <li> Works perfect on my pink toned, porcelain colored skin but due to its neutral coloring it should work on a variety of undertones.  I find this to be medium coverage on my skin when used over a primer and applied with my fingers.  This comes in an airtight pumped tube so there is zero chance of contamination.  This particular bb cream sets to a dewy finish so if that&#x27;s not for you I recommend using a setting powder to matte it.  With primer underneath and a setting powder on top I can get 12 hours of wear out of this easy.  I&#x27;ve even made a mad dash through a rain storm and come out of it needing only a little touch up!  I have sensitive, dry skin and this moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which makes it a win-win in my book.</li>
            <li> Matches my skin tone. That&#x27;s about it. I have bad skin and a few pimples and this doesn&#x27;t cover anything. Barely covers any red spots. It&#x27;s not moisturizing so when I put it on, it looks very cakey and collects on my dry patches and looks really gross. Even when I use this right after exfoliating and moisturizing, my skin still looks very dry and flakey after using this. I find this problem with ALL makeup though, so it might just be my stupid skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have perfect skin, go ahead and try this, but for me........it just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like sunblock and baby powder. Not that bad but I wish it didn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
