    <ol>
            <li>I also use it in a diffuser and it makes the room smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>This has No reflection though on the promptness of receiving it...that was good!</li>
            <li>I guess you expect to get Rose Oil for 10 dollars too!..</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>I Love Jasmine!</li>
            <li>It arrived nicely packed.</li>
            <li>The glass bottle shipped perfectly and fast.</li>
            <li>This blend is okay</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance blend...</li>
            <li>I order more.</li>
            <li>And I cant tell u how many ppl stop me</li>
            <li>Have to use most of the bottle to smell another in the lotion I made</li>
            <li>Product is just OK.</li>
            <li>but it smells much more like the carrier oil than Jasmine.</li>
            <li>When more is needed</li>
            <li>I really love it and will be buying again when I&#x27;m about to run out.</li>
            <li>I love it. :)</li>
            <li>Beautiful lasting scent</li>
            <li>it smells ok, but not as pure as jasmine.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly, as described, well protected, competitive price.</li>
            <li>Very nice product , shipping was super fast , I would definitely buy from this seller again !</li>
            <li>I have tried Now products before and have not been all that impressed; the price seems a little high and the aroma a bit deflated...</li>
            <li>This is the third bottle of oil I have ordered and it by far superior to the others.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, packaging was adequately protective</li>
            <li>But did ship very fast.</li>
            <li>It does smell like jasmine definitely, but I used to LOVE just sniffing the bottle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Did u really think you could get Pure Jasmine Oil for&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know I cant afford tge real deal, but the oil as soon as I run out</li>
            <li>Ty for your product thats real.</li>
            <li>This one smells much stronger once you apply it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had real jasmine oil before</li>
            <li>I have bought real jasmine absolute before -</li>
            <li>this smells like the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but I expected a more vibrant aroma at 7.5%.</li>
            <li>I sprinkle a few drops of this on hot, damp towels when I&#x27;m giving facials and my clients love it.</li>
            <li>The oil turned into a really sweet, deep rich fragrance that lasted until the next morning.</li>
            <li>and I know this is far from pure</li>
            <li>Give this a few minutes after use and you&#x27;ll be in love.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I expected it to smell a little more like the jasmine flower than it did.</li>

            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell the same as I remember the last bottle I got a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive because it&#x27;s pre - mixed in a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> one smell so bad, not even close, absolutely not natural, what a waste.</li>
            <li> When I smelled the open bottle I was disappointed but decided to put some in my hair.</li>
            <li> you women are so silly!</li>
