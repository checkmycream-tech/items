            <li>it is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>I love this because there is still a nice smell, but it is more inviting than offending.</li>
            <li>and of course helps more with removing marks, smells amazing and leaves me milky smooth!-)</li>
            <li>Great item for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>It is not sticky, but very smooth.</li>
            <li>and I already love it.</li>
            <li>Compared to the lotion I had been using before, the pump on the bottle works so much better and gives so much more lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>So glad I listened.</li>
            <li>A bit of a vanilla smell to me; which is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth formula.</li>
            <li>I found that my skin is more moist and feels silky.</li>
            <li>smells really great, and moisturizes your skin very well, leaves you moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is not greasy!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>In CVS, I&#x27;d have paid about $9.00-$10.00 or more dollars for this product.</li>
            <li>; form is even better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t received mine yet, but I already know how fabulous it is!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I put it on after I shower,  before I tan under my bronzer</li>
            <li>and then after I tan, it gives me a much better glow</li>
            <li>, makes my skin look much more even</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li>what more can i say about this lotion.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it just glides on.</li>
            <li>I stumbles across this product and from the many descriptions</li>
            <li>I keep thinking I can find something better.</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Bet many people say the hell with it and toss the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion was okay</li>
            <li>I like the lotion more than the petroleum because it soaks in better and isn&#x27;t in a jar which easily contaminates from fingers.</li>
            <li>DRY SKIN AND STRETCH MARKS.VERY AFFORDABLE AND BEST OF ALL....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just perfect for people with very dry skin like me.</li>
            <li>I will still use my higher priced lotions but this is a great economical addition to my lineup.</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin feeling soft, isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells great (but not overpowering at all).</li>
            <li>i recomend this product to all who wants  a good quality moisturizer</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer, smoother, and more rich.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it is inexpensive, smells heavenly but isn&#x27;t too strong or lingering, and is quite rich for a lotion.</li>
            <li>Very mild sent.</li>
            <li>Good product I recommend it highly</li>
            <li>It is a very very mild smell, so I can still feel comfortable wear any perfume I like, without worrying that the combination will smell</li>
            <li>I am very glad I decide to give it a try as I get older</li>
            <li>I use this every day, really enjoy the smell and the smooth texture on my skin.</li>
            <li>makes your body feel like buttery smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also continue to use my aloe and cucumber too because it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and keeps skin soft and not oily!!  </li>
            <li>I love how silky my skin feels and my boyfriend commented on it when I first started using this too.</li>
            <li>The scent alone is what prompted me to try this lotion first, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>but this one, so for a peaceful life, I make sure he has his coco butter Vaseline,</li>
            <li>rich.</li>
            <li>I feel refresh and clean after every use.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is creamy but not thick, and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li>It is good  for dry hands and,of course, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I often have to follow with a more intense hand and foot cream though.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit too sweet for my nose, but after awhile you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li>As far as inexpensive lotion goes, this Cocoa Butter lotion is nice.</li>
            <li>I mix this with equal parts of Trader Joe&#x27;s Coconut Oil (they just started carrying it and it is a good deal), shake it up, maybe put in the shower or tub with me if the oil hardens so the heat can melt it, and put all over my body.</li>
            <li>This and the matching Spray and Go make my mornings a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s big but is nicely designed and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>But it do moisturize the skin and drys quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this product...makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>However the pump although excellent only goes 90% of the way, then its open the cap and shake to get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and so far am happy with the moisture it provides my skin, it has a gentle scent, it comes in a very classy plastic bottle and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>this lotion feels so wonderful on my dry skin due to pregnancy, I am so glad I found this lotion</li>
            <li>and I typically buy bath and body works lotions which I find to be of great quality although pricey.</li>
            <li>The scent stays on you for a good while and doesnt dry up</li>
            <li>THIS Vaseline Cocoa Butter has been very helpful in getting rid of the &#x27;craggy&#x27; skin appearance, and a weekly once-over works well !!</li>
            <li>This lotion works perfect for me in the spring and summer, but doesn&#x27;t work too well in the winter because its so thin.</li>
            <li>I like it better than most of the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>But I slather this stuff all over after a shower and it provides just the right amount of moisture and yummy smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been abusing my body for over forty years now - and now I HAVE TO start taking better care of the bare essentials....</li>
            <li>and my whole body is soft and velvety and smooth!</li>
            <li>definitely helps with dried skin and smells great!</li>
            <li>Wow, the fragrance is nice but mild and the feel can only be describes and silky.</li>
            <li>Especially at this price, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li>my skin gets dryer on my first try of this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first Vaseline lotion.</li>
            <li>I love that they give you various sizing options of the lotion, from 3 to 32 ounces.</li>
            <li>Great product especially for dry skin, the product in the &amp;#34;cocoa butter&amp;#34</li>
            <li>hope my skin gets super soft with time.</li>
            <li>but it also isn&#x27;t such a strong scent that it competes with my perfume.</li>
            <li>Large bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased a large pump of 32 ounces from Target at 6.69</li>
            <li>i liked the other variants for its mild smell - Total Moisture, Pure Oat Extract and Aloe .</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>residue and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Without it my skin feels really irritated.</li>
            <li>I feel so natural and fresh when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of Cocoa Butter Vaseline, so imagine my surprise when I discover Vaseline has a whole line of lotions, including their cocoa butter scent.</li>
            <li>pump is very well designed.</li>
            <li>This is really making a difference the way i feel about my skin.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Pump works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps your skin moisturized for a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>but it really did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>The next morning after my very first use my skin already felt much softer!</li>
            <li>Thankfully, unlike other product, these changes have been for the better.</li>
            <li>Ever since I quit smoking and my sense of smell has come back in full force, I&#x27;ve realized how overpowering the smell of a lot of my lotions were.</li>
            <li>The nob is loose and cream is fine.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a better glow than the previous formula.</li>
            <li>Not so here at this particular time at Amazon.</li>
            <li>you should try it highly recommended even for oily skins it works wonders.</li>
            <li>It is a very good moisture lotion for cold season.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as long as the price is right!</li>
            <li>You will wake up to wonderfully soft feet, and any calluses you have will be much easier to pumice off if you need to.</li>
            <li>It keeps skin soft and smell is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something different after using another brand for a long time and the scent titillates the senses without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need anything more for typical winter dry skin, except perhaps something a little more powerful for hands and elbows if your skin is drier or aging.</li>
            <li>New Fragrance!]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For starters, I live on a beach</li>
            <li>It really is new and improved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure of the true cocoa butter content either, because it really has an unnatural sweet scent that only has a hint of cocoa.</li>
            <li>I just received this Cocoa Butter lotion in the mail from Amazon (it was even delivered a day early!)</li>
            <li>Works better for me than all others I tried in my past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised to find my torso soft and my feet still moisturized well.</li>
            <li>It also helps to clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well into the skin and leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin soft</li>
            <li>The scent is soft and luxurious, like chocolate.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size of the bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it from my forehead to my feet and its keeping my skin moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did, this is now my favorite lotion, it cleared up the dryness around my eye brows and behind my ears within a few days.</li>
            <li>I still have a bottle that&#x27;s over half full.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it moisturizes as well as some of the more expensive brands or some of the more intense hand/foot cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only lotion I use in super dry Denver, Colorado.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and sexy.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, sinks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t grease up at all if you use one pump per each arm, each leg, torso, back, feet.</li>
            <li>It greases up on my hands if I use too much, and have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in completely if using too much on hands.</li>
            <li>I received it with a broken top but still decided to use it.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>My skin stays very dry, to the point it cracks open in some places and looks really ashy in others.  </li>
            <li>It is a light scent that isn&#x27;t harsh, artificial, or overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>and after I put it on my skin feels hydrated for the whole day and the smell is mellow enough to not offend like other cocoa products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend as a winter lotion not light enough to use in hot summer days.</li>
            <li>For a subtle sweet smell for the Summer - try combining Vaseline Body Lotion w/ a&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure if this body lotion could really help make stretch marks disappear and for me it did.</li>

            <li> This is a huge bottle of lotion and is a really great price.</li>
            <li> Yes I have stretch marks and to be honest</li>
            <li> Vile odor but effective moistener.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE the smell of this lotion!!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is an excellent product and great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> strays3 formula is wonderful, and I encourage everyone who liked the the old formula to buy this one.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels and smells good, I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion at the right time and 32ozs for $7.14, it&#x27;s was a great deal.</li>
            <li> it is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> I love this because there is still a nice smell, but it is more inviting than offending.</li>
            <li> and of course helps more with removing marks, smells amazing and leaves me milky smooth!-)</li>
            <li> Great item for such a great price.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky, but very smooth.</li>
            <li> and I already love it.</li>
            <li> Compared to the lotion I had been using before, the pump on the bottle works so much better and gives so much more lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> So glad I listened.</li>
            <li> A bit of a vanilla smell to me; which is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth formula.</li>
            <li> I found that my skin is more moist and feels silky.</li>
            <li> smells really great, and moisturizes your skin very well, leaves you moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is not greasy!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> In CVS, I&#x27;d have paid about $9.00-$10.00 or more dollars for this product.</li>
            <li> ; form is even better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received mine yet, but I already know how fabulous it is!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I put it on after I shower,  before I tan under my bronzer</li>
            <li> and then after I tan, it gives me a much better glow</li>
            <li> , makes my skin look much more even</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li> what more can i say about this lotion.</li>
            <li> and i love the way it just glides on.</li>
            <li> I stumbles across this product and from the many descriptions</li>
            <li> I keep thinking I can find something better.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Bet many people say the hell with it and toss the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion was okay</li>
            <li> I like the lotion more than the petroleum because it soaks in better and isn&#x27;t in a jar which easily contaminates from fingers.</li>
            <li> DRY SKIN AND STRETCH MARKS.VERY AFFORDABLE AND BEST OF ALL....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just perfect for people with very dry skin like me.</li>
            <li> I will still use my higher priced lotions but this is a great economical addition to my lineup.</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin feeling soft, isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells great (but not overpowering at all).</li>
            <li> i recomend this product to all who wants  a good quality moisturizer</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer, smoother, and more rich.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is inexpensive, smells heavenly but isn&#x27;t too strong or lingering, and is quite rich for a lotion.</li>
            <li> Very mild sent.</li>
            <li> Good product I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> It is a very very mild smell, so I can still feel comfortable wear any perfume I like, without worrying that the combination will smell</li>
            <li> I am very glad I decide to give it a try as I get older</li>
            <li> I use this every day, really enjoy the smell and the smooth texture on my skin.</li>
            <li> makes your body feel like buttery smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also continue to use my aloe and cucumber too because it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and keeps skin soft and not oily!!  </li>
            <li> I love how silky my skin feels and my boyfriend commented on it when I first started using this too.</li>
            <li> The scent alone is what prompted me to try this lotion first, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> but this one, so for a peaceful life, I make sure he has his coco butter Vaseline,</li>
            <li> rich.</li>
            <li> I feel refresh and clean after every use.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is creamy but not thick, and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li> It is good  for dry hands and,of course, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I often have to follow with a more intense hand and foot cream though.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit too sweet for my nose, but after awhile you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> As far as inexpensive lotion goes, this Cocoa Butter lotion is nice.</li>
            <li> I mix this with equal parts of Trader Joe&#x27;s Coconut Oil (they just started carrying it and it is a good deal), shake it up, maybe put in the shower or tub with me if the oil hardens so the heat can melt it, and put all over my body.</li>
            <li> This and the matching Spray and Go make my mornings a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s big but is nicely designed and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> But it do moisturize the skin and drys quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product...makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> However the pump although excellent only goes 90% of the way, then its open the cap and shake to get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and so far am happy with the moisture it provides my skin, it has a gentle scent, it comes in a very classy plastic bottle and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> this lotion feels so wonderful on my dry skin due to pregnancy, I am so glad I found this lotion</li>
            <li> and I typically buy bath and body works lotions which I find to be of great quality although pricey.</li>
            <li> The scent stays on you for a good while and doesnt dry up</li>
            <li> THIS Vaseline Cocoa Butter has been very helpful in getting rid of the &#x27;craggy&#x27; skin appearance, and a weekly once-over works well !!</li>
            <li> This lotion works perfect for me in the spring and summer, but doesn&#x27;t work too well in the winter because its so thin.</li>
            <li> I like it better than most of the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But I slather this stuff all over after a shower and it provides just the right amount of moisture and yummy smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been abusing my body for over forty years now - and now I HAVE TO start taking better care of the bare essentials....</li>
            <li> and my whole body is soft and velvety and smooth!</li>
            <li> definitely helps with dried skin and smells great!</li>
            <li> Wow, the fragrance is nice but mild and the feel can only be describes and silky.</li>
            <li> Especially at this price, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> my skin gets dryer on my first try of this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first Vaseline lotion.</li>
            <li> I love that they give you various sizing options of the lotion, from 3 to 32 ounces.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for dry skin, the product in the &amp;#34;cocoa butter&amp;#34</li>
            <li> hope my skin gets super soft with time.</li>
            <li> but it also isn&#x27;t such a strong scent that it competes with my perfume.</li>
            <li> Large bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased a large pump of 32 ounces from Target at 6.69</li>
            <li> i liked the other variants for its mild smell - Total Moisture, Pure Oat Extract and Aloe .</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> residue and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Without it my skin feels really irritated.</li>
            <li> I feel so natural and fresh when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of Cocoa Butter Vaseline, so imagine my surprise when I discover Vaseline has a whole line of lotions, including their cocoa butter scent.</li>
            <li> pump is very well designed.</li>
            <li> This is really making a difference the way i feel about my skin.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Pump works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps your skin moisturized for a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> but it really did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> The next morning after my very first use my skin already felt much softer!</li>
            <li> Thankfully, unlike other product, these changes have been for the better.</li>
            <li> Ever since I quit smoking and my sense of smell has come back in full force, I&#x27;ve realized how overpowering the smell of a lot of my lotions were.</li>
            <li> The nob is loose and cream is fine.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a better glow than the previous formula.</li>
            <li> Not so here at this particular time at Amazon.</li>
            <li> you should try it highly recommended even for oily skins it works wonders.</li>
            <li> It is a very good moisture lotion for cold season.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as long as the price is right!</li>
            <li> You will wake up to wonderfully soft feet, and any calluses you have will be much easier to pumice off if you need to.</li>
            <li> It keeps skin soft and smell is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different after using another brand for a long time and the scent titillates the senses without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need anything more for typical winter dry skin, except perhaps something a little more powerful for hands and elbows if your skin is drier or aging.</li>
            <li> New Fragrance!]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For starters, I live on a beach</li>
            <li> It really is new and improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the true cocoa butter content either, because it really has an unnatural sweet scent that only has a hint of cocoa.</li>
            <li> I just received this Cocoa Butter lotion in the mail from Amazon (it was even delivered a day early!)</li>
            <li> Works better for me than all others I tried in my past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised to find my torso soft and my feet still moisturized well.</li>
            <li> It also helps to clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well into the skin and leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin soft</li>
            <li> The scent is soft and luxurious, like chocolate.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it from my forehead to my feet and its keeping my skin moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did, this is now my favorite lotion, it cleared up the dryness around my eye brows and behind my ears within a few days.</li>
            <li> I still have a bottle that&#x27;s over half full.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it moisturizes as well as some of the more expensive brands or some of the more intense hand/foot cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lotion I use in super dry Denver, Colorado.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and sexy.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, sinks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t grease up at all if you use one pump per each arm, each leg, torso, back, feet.</li>
            <li> It greases up on my hands if I use too much, and have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in completely if using too much on hands.</li>
            <li> I received it with a broken top but still decided to use it.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> My skin stays very dry, to the point it cracks open in some places and looks really ashy in others.  </li>
            <li> It is a light scent that isn&#x27;t harsh, artificial, or overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> and after I put it on my skin feels hydrated for the whole day and the smell is mellow enough to not offend like other cocoa products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend as a winter lotion not light enough to use in hot summer days.</li>
            <li> For a subtle sweet smell for the Summer - try combining Vaseline Body Lotion w/ a&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure if this body lotion could really help make stretch marks disappear and for me it did.</li>
            <li> Leaves a sticky feeling, suitable for very dry skin and for people who live in really cold places...</li>
            <li> It actually keeps moisturizing your skin long after you put it on as well.</li>
            <li> B004AJ42F6 Bath &amp; Body Works Signature Collection Secret Wonderland Lotion Full Size 8 Fl.</li>
            <li> Half a pump is enough for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later after going outside briefly</li>
            <li> Usual Vaseline high quality, with a touch of cocoa scent.  </li>
            <li> I am now a believer of Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion and will continue to buy this item for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use this all season long and have no problem works well</li>
            <li> The lotion was not very creamy and the cocoa butter scent was definitely lacking.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry damaged skin.</li>
            <li> For me; this works so well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> get for dry skin individuals.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> The only downside is its maybe a little feminine smelling.</li>
            <li> For a lotion that supposedly contains vaseline it isn&#x27;t very thick and doesn&#x27;t really coat my skin the way I would expect.</li>
            <li> For the really rough parts of the body feet,elbows etc.</li>
            <li> and I felt I needed to put cream on after a couple hours , but this one has enough thick consistency that I personally like</li>
            <li> I had used other products by vaseline but not their motion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately lately I found the aloe wasn&#x27;t clearing up a few extra dry areas of my skin, so I decided to give this lotion a try.</li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and needless to say it&#x27;s very dry here</li>
            <li> No more itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin started turning black when I started using this cream</li>
            <li> Snows every other year or so in April (thanks to global warming) and school closes automatically if it gets colder than 40 or so degrees, snow or not (just to shows how ridiculously they treat cold weather here).</li>
            <li> but I got a few bumps and rashes from this product.</li>
            <li> and  i use it all over my body everyday.</li>
            <li> Creamy but not to thick where it has trouble coming out.</li>
            <li> cover your feet thickly with this lotion in the evening after a shower, wrap your feet in plastic wrap, put on your socks and go to bed.</li>
            <li> its fairly thick but not globby.</li>
            <li> It felt like I needed to add oil t it to thin it out so that it would spread evenly onto my body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ventured out for a winter lotion for this harsh cold weather, or &amp;#34;arctic blast&amp;#34; as they&#x27;re calling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expect a lotion containing vaseline to be really thick and nurturing for the skin, but this lotion was just mediocre in every way.</li>
            <li> nothing too dramatic.</li>
            <li> Winter can be brutal on your skin when you work outside</li>
            <li> Although expensive, it sets up a barrier that ensures moisture retention.</li>
            <li> its not greasy and it as a faint smell.</li>
            <li> , you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t get that cold here.</li>
            <li> I use it immediately after the shower and to touch up my hands after being in the cold.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well without that annoying overly slippery feel.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not like this as it was too sticky It felt like I needed to add oil t it to thin it out so that it would spread evenly onto my body.&lt;br /&gt;I use to like this body lotion, now it&#x27;s a no go.</li>
            <li> Vaseline cocoa butter lotion is as good as any refined cocoa butter product there is. It is good  for dry hands and,of course, easy to use. For the really rough parts of the body feet,elbows etc. It is a well known fact that cocoa butter in any form is great for the skin.</li>
            <li> For a subtle sweet smell for the Summer - try combining Vaseline Body Lotion w/ a&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004AJ42F6 Bath &amp; Body Works Signature Collection Secret Wonderland Lotion Full Size 8 Fl. Oz. New Fragrance!]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For protection during the winter - try combining Vaseline Body Lotion w/ baby oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff and a great deal on amazon!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful and moisturizes my skin luxuriously. I wanted to try something different after using another brand for a long time and the scent titillates the senses without being overwhelming. Also a great price.</li>
            <li> I just received this Cocoa Butter lotion in the mail from Amazon (it was even delivered a day early!) and I already love it. Compared to the lotion I had been using before, the pump on the bottle works so much better and gives so much more lotion. It is thick and creamy and makes my skin super soft. I love, love, LOVE the smell of this lotion!! I use this lotion in conjunction with [[ASIN:B000056W74 Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Moisturizing Body Oil with Vitamin E -- 8.5 fl oz]] all over my body, and [[ASIN:B001KYU1H2 Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Skin Therapy Oil, 5.1 Ounce]] in the areas where I have some stretch marks. This is a huge bottle of lotion and is a really great price. You won&#x27;t regret buying this.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and it is very much superior to the store brands in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No residue and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this one as a test because I actually had the suave cocoa but that one still was not creamy and I felt I needed to put cream on after a couple hours , but this one has enough thick consistency that I personally like and after I put it on my skin feels hydrated for the whole day and the smell is mellow enough to not offend like other cocoa products</li>
            <li> It works for me, I keep buying it when I run out.. tks tts</li>
            <li> I use this every day, really enjoy the smell and the smooth texture on my skin. Yes I have stretch marks and to be honest I was a little unsure if this body lotion could really help make stretch marks disappear and for me it did. I feel refresh and clean after every use. I do not use a lot because I can still feel, and smell the lotion on me after a couple of hours. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only lotion I use in super dry Denver, Colorado. It keeps my skin feeling great all day. Without it my skin feels really irritated. It&#x27;s a bit greasy for my face but it&#x27;s a perfect body lotion!</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and sexy. Ever since I quit smoking and my sense of smell has come back in full force, I&#x27;ve realized how overpowering the smell of a lot of my lotions were. I love this because there is still a nice smell, but it is more inviting than offending. I love how silky my skin feels and my boyfriend commented on it when I first started using this too. Also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or feel greasy throughout the day. Moisturizes well without that annoying overly slippery feel. Especially at this price, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really good and is a great value for the price.  I am not sure it moisturizes as well as some of the more expensive brands or some of the more intense hand/foot cream.  But I slather this stuff all over after a shower and it provides just the right amount of moisture and yummy smell.  I often have to follow with a more intense hand and foot cream though.</li>
            <li> it became a daily fixture in my life!! you should try it highly recommended even for oily skins it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I always use this lotion. I love the smell. I feel so natural and fresh when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve used, didn&#x27;t like the smell or texture. But it do moisturize the skin and drys quickly. I&#x27;d recommend as a winter lotion not light enough to use in hot summer days.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is inexpensive, smells heavenly but isn&#x27;t too strong or lingering, and is quite rich for a lotion. You don&#x27;t need anything more for typical winter dry skin, except perhaps something a little more powerful for hands and elbows if your skin is drier or aging. Here&#x27;s a tip: cover your feet thickly with this lotion in the evening after a shower, wrap your feet in plastic wrap, put on your socks and go to bed. You will wake up to wonderfully soft feet, and any calluses you have will be much easier to pumice off if you need to.</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizing lotion.  It absorbs well into the skin and leaves it soft.  I like to put this on before I go to bed.  The only thing I dislike about it is the smell.  The smell is a bit too sweet for my nose, but after awhile you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it smells great and you get a lot for the price. For it to be a Vaseline product, you&#x27;d expect it to be bomb. This lotion works perfect for me in the spring and summer, but doesn&#x27;t work too well in the winter because its so thin.</li>
            <li> Saw this recommended on YouTube. So glad I listened. Smells wonderful! A bit of a vanilla smell to me; which is my favorite scent. Large bottle. Nice smooth formula. Used it after shaving in the shower. Great!</li>
            <li> I had used other products by vaseline but not their motion. I am very glad I decide to give it a try as I get older my skin gets dryer on my first try of this product I found that my skin is more moist and feels silky. I now claim that this is a product that I will use from now on. Good product I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> My skin stays very dry, to the point it cracks open in some places and looks really ashy in others.  This product is great and the scent is not too strong.  I even put it on my hands at night, cover them with cotton gloves and this helps keep my cuticles &amp; fingertips from cracking open.  And I have not noticed any staining on my bed linens or clothing, either.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion bc cocoa butter was included. Cocoa butter helps with stretch marks so I thought, \\&quot;hey, this product should work!\\&quot;. It didn&#x27;t. It made my skin soft but I got a few bumps and rashes from this product. My skin isn&#x27;t suited for this I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been abusing my body for over forty years now - and now I HAVE TO start taking better care of the bare essentials.... like skin. THIS Vaseline Cocoa Butter has been very helpful in getting rid of the &#x27;craggy&#x27; skin appearance, and a weekly once-over works well !!</li>
            <li> For starters, I live on a beach and it doesn&#x27;t get that cold here. Snows every other year or so in April (thanks to global warming) and school closes automatically if it gets colder than 40 or so degrees, snow or not (just to shows how ridiculously they treat cold weather here). I ventured out for a winter lotion for this harsh cold weather, or &amp;#34;arctic blast&amp;#34; as they&#x27;re calling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Vaseline lotion. I really like the scent of Cocoa Butter Vaseline, so imagine my surprise when I discover Vaseline has a whole line of lotions, including their cocoa butter scent. It is a light scent that isn&#x27;t harsh, artificial, or overwhelming at all. The scent alone is what prompted me to try this lotion first, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The lotion itself is creamy but not thick, and spreads very easily. I use it immediately after the shower and to touch up my hands after being in the cold. It goes on smoothly, sinks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t grease up at all if you use one pump per each arm, each leg, torso, back, feet. It greases up on my hands if I use too much, and have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in completely if using too much on hands. Half a pump is enough for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later after going outside briefly and my whole body is soft and velvety and smooth! I&#x27;m very surprised to find my torso soft and my feet still moisturized well. I like the lotion more than the petroleum because it soaks in better and isn&#x27;t in a jar which easily contaminates from fingers. I am now a believer of Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion and will continue to buy this item for as long as I can. I love that they give you various sizing options of the lotion, from 3 to 32 ounces. I purchased a large pump of 32 ounces from Target at 6.69</li>
            <li> hubby refuse to use any lotion but this one, so for a peaceful life, I make sure he has his coco butter Vaseline, smells really great, and moisturizes your skin very well, leaves you moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> I love this product...makes my skin feel smooth and soft. I will continue to use it as long as the price is right!</li>
            <li> Vaseline body lotion is awesome! makes your body feel like buttery smooth. Smells good too. A must have for winter.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is an excellent product and great for dry skin. It also helps to clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great!  It goes on smooth and is not greasy!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. It smells So good and it&#x27;s very effective. I still have a bottle that&#x27;s over half full. This Vaseline Body Lotion with Cocoa Butter also came at a price that was great too. In CVS, I&#x27;d have paid about $9.00-$10.00 or more dollars for this product. Not so here at this particular time at Amazon. I paid only about $5.00 for it. Well worth the price, and as I said an excellent product! WILL buy again if I can get it at the same price I got it for this time!</li>
            <li> Great product especially for dry skin, the product in the &amp;#34;cocoa butter&amp;#34; form is even better than the lotion.  Although expensive, it sets up a barrier that ensures moisture retention.</li>
            <li> Vile odor but effective moistener.</li>
            <li> Good lotion for the price. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The nob is loose and cream is fine. I think it did not suite my skin. My skin started turning black when I started using this cream</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It smells really good and does its job perfectly though it&#x27;s not pricy at all. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I cannot function without this lotion. This smells so good when you don&#x27;t wear perfume but it also isn&#x27;t such a strong scent that it competes with my perfume. I am a lizard without this lotion!</li>
            <li> It is a very good moisture lotion for cold season. It keeps skin soft and smell is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;It remove dryness and keep freshness for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole family like this lotion for everyday use.</li>
            <li> As far as inexpensive lotion goes, this Cocoa Butter lotion is nice. I would compare it to St. Ives. It absorbs well and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not too slimy when putting on your skin. The scent stays on you for a good while and doesnt dry up so your skin looks hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> Usual Vaseline high quality, with a touch of cocoa scent.  Feels extravagent and is great for my skin too.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received mine yet, but I already know how fabulous it is! I mix this with equal parts of Trader Joe&#x27;s Coconut Oil (they just started carrying it and it is a good deal), shake it up, maybe put in the shower or tub with me if the oil hardens so the heat can melt it, and put all over my body. I have the softest skin because of this.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I put it on after I shower,  before I tan under my bronzer and then after I tan, it gives me a much better glow, makes my skin look much more even and of course helps more with removing marks, smells amazing and leaves me milky smooth!-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell. This and the matching Spray and Go make my mornings a little more pleasant. I like.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and keeps skin soft and not oily!!  I like it better than most of the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this.  I received it with a broken top but still decided to use it.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell, it interferred with my perfume.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good and feels so creamy. It&#x27;s just perfect for people with very dry skin like me. I will buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and so far am happy with the moisture it provides my skin, it has a gentle scent, it comes in a very classy plastic bottle and easy to use.  i recomend this product to all who wants  a good quality moisturizer</li>
            <li> So the formula has changed. Thankfully, unlike other product, these changes have been for the better. I adore this lotion. It gives my skin a better glow than the previous formula. My skin feels softer, smoother, and more rich. The scent is soft and luxurious, like chocolate. It is a very very mild smell, so I can still feel comfortable wear any perfume I like, without worrying that the combination will smell strange.&lt;br /&gt;The strays3 formula is wonderful, and I encourage everyone who liked the the old formula to buy this one. It really is new and improved.</li>
            <li> rich. luxurious. what more can i say about this lotion. its fairly thick but not globby. its not greasy and it as a faint smell. nothing too dramatic. been using it nightly and i love the way it just glides on. hope my skin gets super soft with time. the jar is hugeeeeee! pump is very well designed. not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> I only wear lotion during the cooler seasons of the year and I typically buy bath and body works lotions which I find to be of great quality although pricey. As a kid I used Jergens which I like to this day but while perusing the net I stumbles across this product and from the many descriptions, I decided to try it. Wow, the fragrance is nice but mild and the feel can only be describes and silky. Even my heels are much softer after just a few uses. I will still use my higher priced lotions but this is a great economical addition to my lineup.</li>
            <li> Bought for homemade sunscreen to use with Non-nano zinc oxide and coconut oil. Worked great and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Both my husband I use Vaseline Body Lotion, Cocoa Butter regurlary. I have tried literally dozens of lotion brands and prices, we discovered this one and have used it for years, when we could find it. Happily, Amazon Subscribe and Save keeps me supplied!</li>
            <li> The lotion you want for well maintained skin at a good price.  Recommend for anyone looking for Vaseline products.  Helps keep skin in moist condition.</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps me moisturized</li>
            <li> This lotion is most excellent. It rubbed all over my body without protest.</li>
            <li> Great item for such a great price.  I would have to pay double for this bottle size in the store.</li>
            <li> AFFORDABLE AND GOOD FOR DRY SKIN AND STRETCH MARKS.VERY AFFORDABLE AND BEST OF ALL....IT WORKS. GOOD MOISTURIZING LOTION FOR CRACKED SKIN.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels and smells good, I really enjoy using it. Seems to plump up my skin immediately when it needs it most!</li>
            <li> I always look for lotions and have never settled on one lotion. I keep thinking I can find something better. Not this time. I really love this lotion. I have extremely dry damaged skin. This is really making a difference the way i feel about my skin. No more itchy dry skin. It has a pleasant smell. It kinda gives a shine/glow to my skin.  I will definitely use this product again. Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> this lotion feels so wonderful on my dry skin due to pregnancy, I am so glad I found this lotion it is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> For me; this works so well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works better for me than all others I tried in my past.</li>
            <li> Winter can be brutal on your skin when you work outside and I like the coconut smell so gave this a try and it is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Leaves a sticky feeling, suitable for very dry skin and for people who live in really cold places...definitely not my choice ..i liked the other variants for its mild smell - Total Moisture, Pure Oat Extract and Aloe .</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price, Works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped and received in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;No complains and i especially love the sweet smell of the cocoa butter&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline Body lotions has always worked well for me&lt;br /&gt;i use this all season long and have no problem works well</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion at the right time and 32ozs for $7.14, it&#x27;s was a great deal. Of course it wouldn&#x27;t be a deal if it didn&#x27;t work but this stuff does and it works really well. I was surprised by the size of the bottle it&#x27;s big but is nicely designed and easy to hold. I&#x27;ve been using Vaseline aloe with cucumber for years and It has served me well. Unfortunately lately I found the aloe wasn&#x27;t clearing up a few extra dry areas of my skin, so I decided to give this lotion a try. I am so glad I did, this is now my favorite lotion, it cleared up the dryness around my eye brows and behind my ears within a few days. It has a very pleasant odor not overpowering just a nice light tropical scent. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and needless to say it&#x27;s very dry here so using skin moisturizer is almost mandatory. Now that I&#x27;ve discovered Vaseline Cocoa Radiant I&#x27;m using it from my forehead to my feet and its keeping my skin moisturized and soft. I&#x27;ll also continue to use my aloe and cucumber too because it smells fantastic. If you haven&#x27;t tried cocoa radiant you should give it a try, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5+ years now, and I would never use anything else! It keeps your skin feeling soft, isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells great (but not overpowering at all).</li>
            <li> Pump works very well. Creamy but not to thick where it has trouble coming out. Stops my skin from the winter itch. I just wish the Cocoa Butter sent were stronger. Very mild sent. But nice.&lt;br /&gt;Updated a year later&lt;br /&gt;Good to the last drop, re ordered it. However the pump although excellent only goes 90% of the way, then its open the cap and shake to get it out of the bottle. When will they invent a bottle that gets the last 10%, or is that by design? Bet many people say the hell with it and toss the bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your skin moisturized for a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Must get for dry skin individuals.&lt;br /&gt;Must get for Keratosis Pilaris KP individuals</li>
            <li> definitely helps with dried skin and smells great! it lasts longer then others i&#x27;ve tried and  i use it all over my body everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. It is a great price and I like the smell.  The only downside is its maybe a little feminine smelling.</li>
            <li> I had to get a really good moisturizer to use after my time in the pool, and this is just perfect! I love the smell and the feeling on my skin. It is not sticky, but very smooth. It actually keeps moisturizing your skin long after you put it on as well. The next morning after my very first use my skin already felt much softer! Very nice! Cocoa Butter is awesome!</li>
            <li> This lotion was okay but it really did not meet my expectations. The lotion was not very creamy and the cocoa butter scent was definitely lacking. For a lotion that supposedly contains vaseline it isn&#x27;t very thick and doesn&#x27;t really coat my skin the way I would expect. I&#x27;m not sure of the true cocoa butter content either, because it really has an unnatural sweet scent that only has a hint of cocoa. I expect a lotion containing vaseline to be really thick and nurturing for the skin, but this lotion was just mediocre in every way.</li>
