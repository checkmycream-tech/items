            <li>You can search my blog tinascouponswap dot com for my full review because if you are looking for awesome results, you will want to try these!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They feel amazing when you lay them against your skin.</li>
            <li>These Collagen Eye Masks are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>They go under your eyes, in a semi circle, and fit great.  </li>
            <li>Feels amazing on my eyes.</li>
            <li>Great Product!!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Item was provided as free sample.</li>
            <li>All opinions express are completely my own.</li>
            <li>but I really want to keep looking my best even at 57.</li>
            <li>I received these in exchange for an honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li>All opinions are 100% honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li>and my thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Just very moisturizing and ideal.</li>
            <li>These would be great for you new moms that get no sleep!!</li>
            <li>You will love that this product does work and continues to work.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>FOR EVEN MORE tightening and cooling keep these eye masks in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>I re-use them about three times each as well but make sure to keep them in the refrigerator for max results.</li>
            <li>It gives a cooling and refreshing sensation.</li>
            <li>so I cannot use most skin products.</li>
            <li>But I am sure you will love them.</li>
            <li>I put mine in the refrigerator a couple of hours before I use it, as this helps tighten up the skin more and makes them more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THis Mask...</li>
            <li>Upon application the Eye Masks go to work and the potent, skin loving ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid sink into the deepest layers of the dermis leaving it tighter, more hydrated and more smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great product I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Very cool and relaxing if you put it in the refrigerator for an hour before use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These Eye Masks are not only perfect for a special occasion or a night of relaxation</li>
            <li>Worked very well, it was sliding out of place at times but still a good working product</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I did receive some of these products complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>Better yet....just lay down and relax with these puppies in and you&#x27;ll be fabulous!!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The shipment was very quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to give this a better review, but the masks slid right off my face!  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product very much!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HUGE</li>
            <li>I experienced no side effects only tightened skin around my eyes!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>Feels so good against the skin, and refreshing only thing</li>
            <li>They feel great on the under eye and especially during summer - since I put them in the fridge for a little while to offer a great cooling feel when hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a lot of masks for the price which is nice and the serum soaks into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use them as a great way to de-stress after the day if you are able to lie down.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty well known by now that I am a huge skincare addict!  </li>
            <li>This product is my most favorite I gel so far</li>
            <li>Its cool</li>
            <li>leaves you looking rested and fresh.</li>
            <li>These are safe for all skin types, including sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I received this product complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li>Tightened without making my face crack when I smile.</li>
            <li>The skin under eyes tightens and makes the face look fresh.</li>
            <li>I felt my skin hydrating and look fresh and glowy.</li>
            <li>Only used once but liked it.  </li>
            <li>Eye Masks are my favorite thing to use, especially if I have a special occasion</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right after and as time goes on it continues to improve.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It diminishes puffiness and wrinkles right away,</li>
            <li>10 minutes later, my eyes not only looked better but they felt a hundred times better!</li>
            <li>But this is very gentle and did not cause any breakout or rashes on my skin.</li>
            <li>I had a very noticeable difference the first morning I put them on!</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly under my eye and stayed after my face dried a little bit.</li>
            <li>You will look so refreshed and keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>and they are even safe enough to wear the morning of your wedding!!</li>
            <li>and I want my under eye area to look puff free and dark circle free!  </li>
            <li>They stay on without sliding pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for all women and very easy\quick to use!</li>
            <li>I liked the cooling sensation and under-eye moisturizing these masks provided, but they slipped pretty quickly down my face</li>
            <li>The collagen included i in this treatment is really beneficial for the skin and is also very gentle.</li>
            <li>I bought these because the reviews were so positive.</li>
            <li>What I love the most about these eye masks is they instantly give me cooling, refreshing and tightening feeling to tired puffy</li>
            <li>I use so much concealer</li>
            <li>Very moist and skin feels hydrated after using it as directed.</li>
            <li>I tried them this morning while I got ready for work.</li>
            <li>Very cooling to your eyes.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Item was provided as free sample.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say these work great for dark under eyes, dry skin, and to tighten the skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many eye creams to help reduce the puffiness and dark circles and nothing gave me relief as fast and soothing as this product.  </li>
            <li>That is what I love about the Puffy Eyes Dark Circles Treatment Collagen Eye Mask, 5 Under Eye Patches from Beneleaf.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to sit up or walk around wearing these as they&#x27;d slide down immediately.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY</li>
            <li>I have noticed that with the mask my undereyes have appeared much brighter - pretty much instantly and wrinkles have lightened as well.</li>
            <li>I am only giving it 2 stars because it feels refreshing; it does absolutely nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it left my under eye area smooth and hydrated, looking to the results as I keep using the product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They tend to slip down even if you&#x27;re lying down but otherwise, seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred to be able to do other things while wearing the masks, but it&#x27;s just not possible with these.  </li>
            <li>I have a girlfriend that&#x27;s getting married next week</li>
            <li>I had to push one closer to my eye a couple of times the first few minutes, but I liked that I could do things rather than having to lie down for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different collagen eye masks, but most go completely around your eyes, and they seem to irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>Once we sat down and put our heads back, the eye masks stayed on just fine.</li>
            <li>Very soothing after long day.</li>
            <li>and I have found this to be true but, let me explain why:  Other products are sticky and do not have much gel or collagen in/on them and these are loaded up so it doesn&#x27;t bother me to push them up every few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally dark circles under my eyes but this lightens it up a little and makes me look more awake.</li>
            <li>I debated giving this a 3 but took a star away because they are pretty messy.</li>
            <li>one thing really bothering me is it slides off my face all the time even lie down on the bed.</li>
            <li>The dry, itchy skin under my eyes was soft and moist after use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in dark circles but my eyes were definitely refreshed after using these!</li>

            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t get your face too too wet because the eye masks will not stay in place as you move.</li>
            <li> The eye patches were so wet they kept slipping.</li>
            <li> and the results last for a few days not just a few hours!&lt;br</li>

            <li> This reduces dark circles and puffiness under eyes.</li>
            <li> did nothing for my dark circles and puffiness</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so slippery and slide down my face.  </li>
            <li> so I suggest you lay down when using these.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of hours now and my under eye area still feels tight, but hydrated, and the skin is brighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I woke up feeling miserable, with puffy, dry eyes, I applied these gooey and cool pads (one under each eye) and kicked back to relax a bit.</li>
            <li> Dark circles and puffiness disappear!</li>
            <li> When I took them off, my eye area felt moisturized, but still looked a little puffy.</li>

            <li> I enjoyed this product very much! Its so simple to use and it actually works. Its cool and I just slap it on for a few min and continue doing whatever. I noticed a difference right after and as time goes on it continues to improve. You will love that this product does work and continues to work. You will look so refreshed and keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a Girls Night Spa party. I chilled them in the refrigerator before applying.  Easy to use but they kept slipping off.  Once we sat down and put our heads back, the eye masks stayed on just fine.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It diminishes puffiness and wrinkles right away, leaves you looking rested and fresh.</li>
            <li> Good product works as advertised</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for sure!! These would be great for you new moms that get no sleep!! I get no sleep and I am not a new mom lol! I always have bags under my eyes. I had a very noticeable difference the first morning I put them on! You can search my blog tinascouponswap dot com for my full review because if you are looking for awesome results, you will want to try these!&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for a day of pampering without spending spa prices, get your self a few bath bombs, some soft music, some candles, and run a bath and stick these on and get in and soak for 15 or 20 mins, get yourself in your comfy robe, your hair should be up from your bath, and take these off and rub on a moisturizing cream and you will see a difference! I use so much concealer it is not funny, but I haven&#x27;t needed to! I have done this for the last 3 Saturdays and I am loving my results! I also use a Hyaluronic cream as my moisturizer!!&lt;br /&gt;These are one use only and I keep mine in the refrigerator, you want them cold going on under your eyes. These are safe for all skin types, including sensitive skin and they are even safe enough to wear the morning of your wedding!! HIGHLY recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product complimentary for review purposes. All opinions express are completely my own.</li>
            <li> What I love the most about these eye masks is they instantly give me cooling, refreshing and tightening feeling to tired puffy eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Each set of eye masks are individually wrapped and in a tray of liquid the patches are thick and very pliable. They feel like jelly; Itâ€™s the best way I can describe them. They feel amazing when you lay them against your skin. There is a lot of extra liquid in the bag after you place the pads on your eyes. I usually spread it all around my face and neck. I imagine I could put the eye pads back in and seal the bag and reuse them again. But, I like the over all tightening I get using the excess at the same time as the eye masks. FOR EVEN MORE tightening and cooling keep these eye masks in the refrigerator. I wear contacts and these masks did not irritate my eyes in the least. I experienced no side effects only tightened skin around my eyes!! Tightened without making my face crack when I smile. HUGE bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I might not have the time to go get a facial or head over to the spa (who are we kidding? I donâ€™t have the time or the money!) but I really want to keep looking my best even at 57. These Collagen Eye Masks are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. I did not receive cash payment to write this review.</li>
            <li> This product is my most favorite I gel so far and I have probably been through about 25+ different ones.  I read that they slide off your face and I have found this to be true but, let me explain why:  Other products are sticky and do not have much gel or collagen in/on them and these are loaded up so it doesn&#x27;t bother me to push them up every few minutes.  I re-use them about three times each as well but make sure to keep them in the refrigerator for max results.</li>
            <li> I debated giving this a 3 but took a star away because they are pretty messy.</li>
            <li> This reduces dark circles and puffiness under eyes. It gives a cooling and refreshing sensation. It is like spa at home. The collagen included i in this treatment is really beneficial for the skin and is also very gentle. The skin under eyes tightens and makes the face look fresh. I felt my skin hydrating and look fresh and glowy. I have very sensitive skin so I cannot use most skin products. But this is very gentle and did not cause any breakout or rashes on my skin. Apply it under eyes and leave it on for about 20 minutes. Afterwards peel it off and wash your face. You will notice it did not clog any pores either. You are good to apply makeup on it too. There is a 60 day money back guarantee on these. But I am sure you will love them. I received these in exchange for an honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Perfect mask! Just very moisturizing and ideal. Just ordered another one! The shipment was very quick.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice now. I followed the instructions to the T and still saw no results - not even short term results. I am only giving it 2 stars because it feels refreshing; it does absolutely nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:46babe1ac3f442ecb865aad1891359b9]] I have tried a few different collagen eye masks, but most go completely around your eyes, and they seem to irritate my eyes.  That is what I love about the Puffy Eyes Dark Circles Treatment Collagen Eye Mask, 5 Under Eye Patches from Beneleaf.  They go under your eyes, in a semi circle, and fit great.  They do not irritate my eyes at all.  I put mine in the refrigerator a couple of hours before I use it, as this helps tighten up the skin more and makes them more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I notice a big change in the puffiness under my eyes, and a considerable lightening of the dark circles.  I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on my eyes. Very cool and relaxing if you put it in the refrigerator for an hour before use. There&#x27;s enough gel left in the packet so I just put the eye pads back in there for another use! I have naturally dark circles under my eyes but this lightens it up a little and makes me look more awake. I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Very soothing after long day. Very moist and skin feels hydrated after using it as directed. Hard too keep in place because its so moist it slowly slides away from area. I just adjust it back. I will be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, it was sliding out of place at times but still a good working product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work or even change the appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this a better review, but the masks slid right off my face!  I would have preferred to be able to do other things while wearing the masks, but it&#x27;s just not possible with these.  I do like the results of the collagen and they definitely helped the puffiness!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly under my eye and stayed after my face dried a little bit. Ladies, don&#x27;t get your face too too wet because the eye masks will not stay in place as you move. Better yet....just lay down and relax with these puppies in and you&#x27;ll be fabulous!!!! I love them.</li>
            <li> Only thing they did was slide off of my face...did nothing for my dark circles and puffiness</li>
            <li> I do not like these.  They move too easily unless you are perfectly still.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THis Mask... I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so slippery and slide down my face.  If you are planning to put these on and walk around, it will not stay - so I suggest you lay down when using these.  They feel great on the under eye and especially during summer - since I put them in the fridge for a little while to offer a great cooling feel when hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a lot of masks for the price which is nice and the serum soaks into your skin quickly.  I have noticed that with the mask my undereyes have appeared much brighter - pretty much instantly and wrinkles have lightened as well. I definitely suggest this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC: I was sent these for review however I was not paid to provide my thoughts.  All opinions are 100% honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> Great product I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Although I did notice a difference I rated it a three. The eye patches were so wet they kept slipping.</li>
            <li> I received these eye masks the day before my allergies hit their peak. When I woke up feeling miserable, with puffy, dry eyes, I applied these gooey and cool pads (one under each eye) and kicked back to relax a bit. 10 minutes later, my eyes not only looked better but they felt a hundred times better! The dry, itchy skin under my eyes was soft and moist after use. They didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. I did&#x27;t notice any scent or perfumes. They are slippery, so plan to lay down or they&#x27;ll slide off your face!</li>
            <li> Feels so good against the skin, and refreshing only thing I don&#x27;t  like is how it doesn&#x27;t  stay  once placed under your eye. It keeps sliding  down.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty well known by now that I am a huge skincare addict!  Even though I am a fanatic about skincare I have only been using Eye Masks for the last year or so.  Eye Masks are my favorite thing to use, especially if I have a special occasion and I want my under eye area to look puff free and dark circle free!  I have a few favs that really help reduce puffiness, hydrate and reduce dark circles and these Collagen Eye Masks by Beneleaf are definitely one of them!&lt;br /&gt;These Eye Masks are made with cutting edge of skin care technology and contain Hydrogel that is identical in structure to our skin cells.  Upon application the Eye Masks go to work and the potent, skin loving ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid sink into the deepest layers of the dermis leaving it tighter, more hydrated and more smooth.  Dark circles and puffiness disappear! and the results last for a few days not just a few hours!&lt;br /&gt;These Eye Masks are not only perfect for a special occasion or a night of relaxation but they also make a great gift idea!  I have a girlfriend that&#x27;s getting married next week and these are going in a pre-wedding day goodie bag I am putting together for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive some of these products complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5a288d5491c6bfc9d55df1cdec302b1b]] These are soooooooooo awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it zero stars. It did not work and I was very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the reviews were so positive. I tried them this morning while I got ready for work. They stay on without sliding pretty well. I had to push one closer to my eye a couple of times the first few minutes, but I liked that I could do things rather than having to lie down for 30 minutes. When I took them off, my eye area felt moisturized, but still looked a little puffy. A few minutes later, once my eye area had dried, it felt tight. So I looked in the mirror again to see if I noticed any difference, and wow... The area was brighter and tighter. It&#x27;s been a couple of hours now and my under eye area still feels tight, but hydrated, and the skin is brighter.&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;d say these work great for dark under eyes, dry skin, and to tighten the skin!</li>
            <li> Great Product!!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Item was provided as free sample.</li>
            <li> used twice and can not see any difference yet. one thing really bothering me is it slides off my face all the time even lie down on the bed.</li>
            <li> Only used once but liked it.  Soothing, not sticky.  I&#x27;m not sure it will resolve the problem I have with puffy eyes but am hopeful.  They tend to slip down even if you&#x27;re lying down but otherwise, seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I liked the cooling sensation and under-eye moisturizing these masks provided, but they slipped pretty quickly down my face and I had to keep pushing them up. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in dark circles but my eyes were definitely refreshed after using these! I&#x27;d use them as a great way to de-stress after the day if you are able to lie down. I wasn&#x27;t able to sit up or walk around wearing these as they&#x27;d slide down immediately.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve tried so many eye creams to help reduce the puffiness and dark circles and nothing gave me relief as fast and soothing as this product.  This is a must have for all women and very easy\quick to use!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;These feel awesome! Very cooling to your eyes. They seem to work well but sometimes they slid around a bit.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wonderful Seller! Great product! :)</li>
            <li> Great masks! Great company!</li>
            <li> Works great....i even did one eye to see if there was a noticeable difference and there was...my only issue was i could not get them to stay in place...so I had to lay down while using them that&#x27;s why I only have 4 stars...</li>
            <li> Ordered and received it in a few days. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it left my under eye area smooth and hydrated, looking to the results as I keep using the product. Definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Item was provided as free sample.</li>
