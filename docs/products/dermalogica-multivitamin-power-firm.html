            <li> Amazing product! It feels so silky on my skin. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. When we saw that we could buy it in the Salon Size, we jumped at it. It is much more cost effective when buying in this size.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve experianced.</li>
            <li> Perfect for day or night. I love the way it absorbs into the skin leaving your skin soft and moist. Getting ready to buy my second tube. It last for a long time. I recommend any Dermalogica product as I use several.</li>
            <li> goes on like silk. feels grest. will order more</li>
            <li> Feel perfect and smooth! It did smooth out lines as it velvet texture but if deep lines can&#x27;t! Overall is great as it is not greasy but keep my dry skin off! Will buy again</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is an amazing skin care line... You will see results if you use it faithfully!  It put elasticity back in my 44 year old Florida tanned skin.  And Did reduce fine lines.  Been using line about a month and a half... I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This condition of this product is new as it said.  The only thing is that Aloha sold me the expired product due to they scratched off the date intentionally at the top of the tube.  There is no accident because the tube is new, no mark, no scratch.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this product!!! Love the professional size!!! Can&#x27;t find this size anywhere else. I love this product. So smooth. I use this around my eyes and it works great. This is the only product that I can see after 2 weeks that my eyes are not puffy. I got this fast and on time. Early even.</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with the tube I got.  It is watery.  It is not the consistency of the others I have bought.  I am unhappy with the supplier, very unhappy</li>
            <li> I think I got an old tube. It does not seem to work like my previous one. Very disappointed. I know it works, but the one I got is just not the same.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive eye lids.  I can&#x27;t even wear makeup.  And all eye creemes have given me a rash.  This is the ONLY product that soothes my lies and helps with wrinkles without breaking out.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product.  We always buy through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have been using it for years. It really helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles, smells sweet, and can be used on your lips as well.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is so silky on touch, feels great under my finger tips and under my eyes. It moisturises perfectly. I do not have much wrinkles under eyes and I can say I have not seen new lines for sure. I will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I have been using dermalogica for almost 10 years, and have always been happy with the results-- LOVE IT! great price, great packaging--thanks</li>
            <li> Very good for the face. I keep using this product because it works. It don&#x27;t come cheap but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is like using bondo for the eye wrinkles! Also makes the skin so soft and no irritation to the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it is a great product.</li>
