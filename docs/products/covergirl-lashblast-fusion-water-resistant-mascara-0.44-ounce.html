            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is good at either aspect.  </li>
            <li>The brush is perhaps the best part, it lays the product on just right.</li>

            <li>I absolutely Love, Love, Love....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay retail price.</li>
            <li>Even for the price, there are way better options out there.</li>
            <li>The use of mascara eyes look larger and more beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is a fine mascara, but not if you need something waterPROOF.  </li>
            <li>I use mostly drugstore brands, and I don&#x27;t think this is worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Oil Free Eye Makeup Remover to get it off</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
            <li>The brush looks cool.</li>
            <li>I have to use 2 coats to do any thickening (it doesn&#x27;t thicken much for me), but more than that causes clumping and blobs.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is really think, I normally love all the Lashblast from Covergirl</li>
            <li>Both the water resistant and regular are good.</li>
            <li>and it comes off pretty easily with eye-makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This stuff gives me super lashes and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking like a raccoon when it wears off or if I rub my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try COVERGIRL&#x27;s new mascara LashBlast Fusion.  </li>
            <li>, it is waterproof, tested it out myself a few times, it makes eyelashes look great</li>
            <li>but the price was right</li>
            <li>This mascara is okay for the sale price, but if I had to buy at full price I would opt for something different.</li>
            <li>It is less waterproof compared to the original Lashblast waterproof mascara I have to say, but it is very easy to remove, and you don&#x27;t need to sacrifice your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I prefer it more than the regular lashblast.</li>
            <li>It is pretty water proof.  </li>
            <li>received exactly what we wanted in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>, I use to use the Professional Waterproof one, tried this out as it was a special</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on as easily as I would like (but if you apply a clear coat first it works pretty well), but ti does last all day, doesn&#x27;t flake off (unless you rub your eyes a lot during the day),</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard so much about it and</li>
            <li>(: it thickens really well as well</li>
            <li>I absolutely need to use a waterproof mascara because when I yawn, my eyes tear up profusely.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is silicone or plastic for the entire head including the bristles which are lined up precisely.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real or the Revlon PhotoReady 3D Volume over this.</li>
            <li>and I really like the product.</li>
            <li>You get so much value out of them.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, very like it.</li>
            <li>Also seems gentle on the eye lashes, compared to the tube mascara which seemed to cause my eye lashes to fall out.</li>
            <li>This means I really need a mascara that lengthens, volumizes, and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes all stick together.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make them look full and seems to disappear after a short while of wear.  </li>
            <li>It comes off too easily when my eyelashes get wet.</li>
            <li>only quick sweep over each side, and I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>I ended up liking it better than the much more expensive Lancome brand that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>It has a very dry feel to it, not wet like most mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is a bit clumpy but it is better than expected and not dry as some others tend to be.</li>
            <li>but it was hot and sweaty outside and</li>
            <li>After curling my lashes, this mascara completely removed any and all curl.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself has never run or flaked for me (never use old mascara).</li>
            <li>After spending time curling my eyelashes, this mascara took the curl out completely as soon as I applied it.</li>
            <li>i thought the brush on this mascara wasnÂ´t deep enough, but it curls my lashes just prefecty and doens let too much mascara on!</li>
            <li>First, like others mentioned, the bristles are tiny and I needed several coats to look like I had any on at all.</li>
            <li>OK, applies a little clumpy so be careful</li>
            <li>I applied two coats to my top and bottom lashes and I look like I have false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Too thick and dries out quickly.</li>
            <li>It really makes my grey eyes pop by making my eyelashes look super long and thick!</li>

            <li> It really makes my grey eyes pop by making my eyelashes look super long and thick!</li>
            <li> The original Lastblast waterprooft mascara takes forever to remove, and my eyelashes would fall off due to the hard removal.</li>
            <li> I was wondering why my eye makeup was a complete mess halfway through the workday.  </li>
            <li> However, my tube seemed very dry and \\&quot;worn out\\&quot; from Day 1, and I required MULTIPLE coats to see anything.</li>
            <li> It last longer than your average mascara as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted a long wearing mascara that would not leave me with raccoon eyes after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other mascara as long as they keep making this.</li>
            <li> but the brush was a little short</li>
            <li> The brush is thick, so very difficult to use, I have a combination of other brush.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the mascara is good.</li>
            <li> This one was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Like the idea that it&#x27;s water resistant rather than waterproof which tends to be rough on the lashes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub off as some other mascaras do</li>
            <li> My other gripe is the thickness and slope and \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the wand.</li>
            <li> I have never had that problem with other waterproof mascaras.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes stay separate from each other.</li>
            <li> The brush is very short making it hard to apply mascara on eye lashes</li>
            <li> Also, I bought the waterproof version and it still smudged, leaving black marks under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have long thick eyelashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the black, black brown, and very black.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and</li>
            <li> Rubber bristles for me are the way to go for my short thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shed a few tears or perspired and it stayed in place.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively thin, short lashes.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the formula that prevents the product from applying itself too heavily to coat the lashes.</li>
            <li> I like to buy the very black version because it works well with my skin tone and eyes.</li>
            <li> The color Very Black shows up well.  </li>
            <li> Overall I was not impressed with the product, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I usually buy &#x27;waterproof&#x27; mascara...</li>
            <li> This mascara lasts long and doesn&#x27;t smudge like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes (mostly due to my bad habit of pulling on them).</li>
            <li> The fat brush makes it difficult to not get mascara on your lids or skin.</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment was that the \\&quot;water resistance\\&quot; was none existent.  </li>
            <li> However, I am extremely disappointed by the product.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> To me that was the worst part.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The mascara is alright. The fat brush makes it difficult to not get mascara on your lids or skin. It comes of very easily with make up removing cloths.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try COVERGIRL&#x27;s new mascara LashBlast Fusion.  I&#x27;d heard so much about it and the commercials are so convincing.  However, I am extremely disappointed by the product.  I had to put on layer after layer before I could even notice I had mascara on.  The brush does a good job of separating the lashes; however I didn&#x27;t look like it added any length or volume.  My biggest disappointment was that the \\&quot;water resistance\\&quot; was none existent.  The mascara literally came off with a splash of water.  Overall I was not impressed with the product, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t run, smudge, or clump. It extends and thickens my lashes and I get a lot of complements. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes me eyelashes beautiful and it does not get flakey or clumpy! It is also easier to take off for a waterproof mascara too which is nice. It last longer than your average mascara as well. I will be buying this forever unless they come out with something even better than this!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara (: it works so well and I love the color (: it thickens really well as well</li>
            <li> the mascara looks nice on but it&#x27;s not water proof at all.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The eyelash comb never clogs up and continues to separate your lashes perfectly until the bottle is emtpy and beyond.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great--only quick sweep over each side, and I&#x27;m done.  Not too heavy and the brush does a great job at separating each lash.  For work (I&#x27;m a nurse) I&#x27;ll basically use this and some lighter eyeliner, and I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li> After curling my lashes, this mascara completely removed any and all curl. I&#x27;ve used Covergirl Lashblast mascaras for several years and have never had this problem. This one was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular user of the waterproof lash blast volume (orange tube) for several years now.  I purchased this not seeing it was water *resistant* as opposed to waterproof.  I absolutely need to use a waterproof mascara because when I yawn, my eyes tear up profusely.  I was wondering why my eye makeup was a complete mess halfway through the workday.  It is a fine mascara, but not if you need something waterPROOF.  I can&#x27;t say I prefer it more than the regular lashblast.</li>
            <li> I purchase all of my makeup from Sephora, because &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; makeup doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations. with ONE exception--this mascara is my all-time favorite. I have used dozens of mascaras from every price range, but I always come back to this one. The brush is perhaps the best part, it lays the product on just right. The mascara itself has never run or flaked for me (never use old mascara). I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the Covergirl Lashblast line (my favorites are the Lashblast Volume and the ClumpCrusher). I gave this as a gift based off of recommendations from friends, and the girl I gave this too really enjoyed the product.  Rubber bristles for me are the way to go for my short thin lashes.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I use anymore. It really makes my grey eyes pop by making my eyelashes look super long and thick! I like to buy the very black version because it works well with my skin tone and eyes. My friend has a very light complexion and the gray/black color looks great on her!</li>
            <li> This mascara is okay for the sale price, but if I had to buy at full price I would opt for something different. I use mostly drugstore brands, and I don&#x27;t think this is worth the cost.  Should be like 2 dollars. The formula is supposed to both lengthen and thicken.  I don&#x27;t think it is good at either aspect.  The brush looks cool. It is silicone or plastic for the entire head including the bristles which are lined up precisely. I think that&#x27;s where the lengthening aspect comes from. The color Very Black shows up well.  I have to use 2 coats to do any thickening (it doesn&#x27;t thicken much for me), but more than that causes clumping and blobs.  It is pretty water proof.  I&#x27;ve shed a few tears or perspired and it stayed in place.  Rubbing will smear and flake it.  I use Neutrogena Oil Free Eye Makeup Remover to get it off (It is still greasy even with no oil).  I&#x27;ve also used Rimmel which does nothing to remove it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love, Love, Love....this product. I have relatively thin, short lashes. For YEARS I have been buying 25 and 30 dollar mascara&#x27;s to enhance my lashes around my almond shaped eyes. I did a google search of the 10 best mascara&#x27;s for lengthening and a version of this product came up. When I went to the drug store, I saw this version instead, which indicated it was specifically for volume AND lengthening. So I purchased it. I applied two coats to my top and bottom lashes and I look like I have false eyelashes. I will *never* spend department store money on mascara again! Go ahead...get.this.product....!</li>
            <li> Really great mascara. I loved the brush, is easy to apply, the product stays all day long and make my lashes look awesome. And it&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
            <li> I usually buy &#x27;waterproof&#x27; mascara...I was hesitant to try this one but the price was right so I had nothing to lose. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of CG Lashblast but this one was like I had nothing on. Like the idea that it&#x27;s water resistant rather than waterproof which tends to be rough on the lashes. Maybe it&#x27;s the formula that prevents the product from applying itself too heavily to coat the lashes.</li>
            <li> Constantly flaking off into my eyes. Smells like it may have been expired by the time I received it.</li>
            <li> the product meet my expectations</li>
            <li> This mascara lasts long and doesn&#x27;t smudge like crazy. The original Lastblast waterprooft mascara takes forever to remove, and my eyelashes would fall off due to the hard removal. This Lashblash Fusion is different though. It is less waterproof compared to the original Lashblast waterproof mascara I have to say, but it is very easy to remove, and you don&#x27;t need to sacrifice your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well on my eye lashes.  Didn&#x27;t make them look full and seems to disappear after a short while of wear.  Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Always been a covergirl  product person for all my stuff, it is waterproof, tested it out myself a few times, it makes eyelashes look great, I use to use the Professional Waterproof one, tried this out as it was a special and now I am hooked, will buy this again.</li>
            <li> OK, applies a little clumpy so be careful</li>
            <li> While the product doesn&#x27;t smudge, I find the brush too big to coat the lashes evenly. It comes off too easily when my eyelashes get wet. It&#x27;s not as water resistant as I would&#x27;ve liked. I prefer the Benefit They&#x27;re Real or the Revlon PhotoReady 3D Volume over this. I probably will not be purchasing this mascara again.</li>
            <li> It is a bit clumpy but it is better than expected and not dry as some others tend to be.</li>
            <li> received exactly what we wanted in a timely manner. My daughter just loves this mascara and the price is great</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t go on as easily as I would like (but if you apply a clear coat first it works pretty well), but ti does last all day, doesn&#x27;t flake off (unless you rub your eyes a lot during the day), and it comes off pretty easily with eye-makeup remover.</li>
            <li> i thought the brush on this mascara wasnÂ´t deep enough, but it curls my lashes just prefecty and doens let too much mascara on!</li>
            <li> This mascara is really think, I normally love all the Lashblast from Covergirl but I have to apply more than once to make it look good.</li>
            <li> Ironically discovered this product as Costco sells them three to a package, until recently.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off as some other mascaras do and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Just tried the Cover Girl lash blast fusion. True, the water resistance works great, AND it doesn&#x27;t clump. However, my tube seemed very dry and \\&quot;worn out\\&quot; from Day 1, and I required MULTIPLE coats to see anything. There is no lengthening element, but I don&#x27;t think they focus on that. My other gripe is the thickness and slope and \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the wand. Too fat. I feel it&#x27;s about to go flying out of my fingers at any minute. Don&#x27;t have a sense of control. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> liked it but the brush was a little short</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me. Too thick and dries out quickly. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay retail price.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever tried. First, like others mentioned, the bristles are tiny and I needed several coats to look like I had any on at all. It has a very dry feel to it, not wet like most mascaras I&#x27;ve used. After spending time curling my eyelashes, this mascara took the curl out completely as soon as I applied it. To me that was the worst part. Also, I bought the waterproof version and it still smudged, leaving black marks under my eyes. I have never had that problem with other waterproof mascaras. Finally, after wearing it only a couple hours, my eyes started to burn. It felt like the mascara was running into my eyes. I do not recommend this product. Even for the price, there are way better options out there.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and brand. Came in a timely manner and was packaged excellently. Would purchased again when needed.</li>
            <li> You get so much value out of them.I use it every day, very like it.The use of mascara eyes look larger and more beautiful.</li>
            <li> I wanted a long wearing mascara that would not leave me with raccoon eyes after only a few hours. I am a teacher and I do not have time to be fussing with my make up. This mascara is great and it does not require a nuclear explosion to remove!  I will purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Have tried several different water proof mascaras. This one worked all day at the beach. Didn&#x27;t go in the water but it was hot and sweaty outside and mascara didn&#x27;t smear. Also seems gentle on the eye lashes, compared to the tube mascara which seemed to cause my eye lashes to fall out.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.  This stuff gives me super lashes and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking like a raccoon when it wears off or if I rub my eyes.  It&#x27;s my go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> I have long thick eyelashes and this is one of the best for volume but not the best for length but its not bad :)</li>
            <li> The brush is thick, so very difficult to use, I have a combination of other brush.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the mascara is good.ï¼from:japaneseï¼</li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes (mostly due to my bad habit of pulling on them). This means I really need a mascara that lengthens, volumizes, and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes all stick together. I have tried dozens of different mascaras and none even come close to matching this one. It greatly lengthens and volumizes as it claims. In addition, I have never once experienced clumping with this mascara. My eyelashes stay separate from each other. I will never use any other mascara as long as they keep making this. Both the water resistant and regular are good. I&#x27;ve tried the black, black brown, and very black. All are great!</li>
            <li> The brush is very short making it hard to apply mascara on eye lashes</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was on sale and there was a coupon. I ended up liking it better than the much more expensive Lancome brand that I have been using for years.</li>
