            <li>great lift; easy to use</li>
            <li>Amazing in that as soon as I placed this in my shoe, my on- going hip (bursitis I think)</li>
            <li>A nice lift which I cannot detect in my shoes.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a lift for each pair of shoes I own.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I decided to try this one and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>After two months, it has contoured to the shape of my foot nicely and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to try another kind just to seek more comfort.</li>
            <li>I have tried ALL of the lifts and can tell you honestly this is the only one that works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I liked that I could adjust the height easily.</li>
            <li>all static and pressure.</li>
            <li>and I love this one for sandals.</li>
            <li>I have a leg length discrepancy of 3/8\\&quot; and had worn a lift for many years.</li>
            <li>I had to buy more shoes (besides flip flops)</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve either had a lift put on my shoe or worn lifts for many years.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve used them for many years,</li>
            <li>pain felt noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>should have read the product description better.  </li>
            <li>had severe back pain caused by the inbalance of my gait before using this wonderful heel lifter.</li>
            <li>I love that I can customize the fit!</li>
            <li>I use mine under orthotics, which makes it more tolerable.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite lifts.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need another insole on top.</li>
            <li>It is in layers that can be separated so I was able to put most of it under my orthotic in my walking shoe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>so I am very familiar with products like this</li>
            <li>Found the campion heel lift, also sold on Amazon, much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get the amount of elevation required.  </li>
            <li>Easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>Fits easily into all my shoes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to layer the pieces to get the height you need.  </li>
            <li>They come apart too easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and c.omfortable.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to switch in my shoes and works</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>It is working just fine.</li>
            <li>that I could fit these into in order to accomplish wearing them all the time.  </li>
            <li>Therefore I tried it and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable plus it did not stay aligned.  </li>
            <li>This makes the product very useful.</li>
            <li>Heel lift separates easily for quick adjustment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the first ones I purchased more than 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>am willing to order 6 more</li>
            <li>I would prefer a true size non adjusting model</li>
            <li>This has successfully aligned my left side to match my right side.  </li>
            <li>Might even buy some that I will super glue into flip flops.  </li>
            <li>I ended up super glueing the lift together to help me with this issue.</li>
            <li>These clearly adjustable lifts are easy to use, easy to adjust, don&#x27;t slip, and have a gradual decline angle for comfort.</li>
            <li>A good note is that these G&amp;W lifts are a little longer and fit in my shoe well. .</li>
            <li>(This depends upon how much room you might have available in your heel area.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle to return so it went in the trash.  </li>
            <li>Fairly good product, though some sections are harder to stick together after you have been wearing them awhile.</li>
            <li>and followed another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion of breaking them in, in tennis shoes first, and then taking them apart and Super gluing them together.</li>
            <li>Please note that you have to experiment to find the right shoe style that works with this add-on.  </li>
            <li>13mm longer than the right.</li>
            <li>Even only wearing a very light sock went to a wedding and forgot they were even there.</li>
            <li>Does the job for more comfortably than the other lifts I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The G&amp;W Heel Lift does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pull up the insole as suggested but lay it on top and my socks provide enough distance between the vinyl and my foot.</li>
            <li>I tape the lift in my shoe and then add an instep sole on top.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think they worked well b/c</li>
            <li>My heels were still not the same height, but better.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product from my doctor for about twice the price.  </li>
            <li>this being the first time I&#x27;ve gotten therm from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described in the post.</li>
            <li>This is a very helpful item - made all the difference!</li>
            <li>I will end up buying more for more of my regular shoes as well as my soccer cleats and cross trainers.</li>
            <li>The heel lift works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>my shorter leg is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Very versatile and comfy!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is absolutely a must, since I have a disparity between the lenght of my lower limbs and after attempting to compensate with several other insoles, I found out this was by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;People</li>
            <li>Exactly what they described AND it arrived in a very timely manner,  </li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re made in layers it&#x27;s also much easier to get the precise amount of lift for the short leg.</li>
            <li>Substantial material--doesn&#x27;t compress much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to move now.</li>
            <li>they have helped much, but need to install tracking device in them</li>
            <li>I really recommend these to anyone with this problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it, much to my pleasure</li>
            <li>Thanks....</li>
            <li>Has helped me so much with my balance.</li>
            <li>Makes having to use lift simple and far more convenient than having to have a shoe made.  </li>
            <li>The lift is clear so it blends right into your shoe.</li>
            <li>I ordered some other lifts on Amazon and they worked ok for some shoes</li>
            <li>When I use it in other shoes without orthotics I notice the firmness and the narrowness more, as well as it not staying in place, but it&#x27;s all manageable.</li>
            <li>I simply cut the lift around the edges a little to fit my high heels, and flats better.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get mashed down &amp; compressed like the leather ones &amp; can easily be adjusted to fit any of my gym cross trainers.</li>
            <li>Since the layers come apart easily you have to handle the lift carefully when switching it from one shoe to another.  </li>
            <li>And I had not received the others for on top of the inner sole.</li>
            <li>I was lucky not to have had any such distress until now.</li>
            <li>With stackable layers only 1mm thick, it was very easy to &amp;#34;ramp up&amp;#34; and make sure I wasn&#x27;t over adjusting or jarring my back by jumping heights too fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Overall this product does what it says and is worth the money.</li>
            <li>This lift provides easy adjustability and has eliminated lower back pain I was feeling because of extra pressure on one side of my spine.</li>
            <li>my right leg is shorter than my left leg.  </li>
            <li>My right leg is  about 1/4&amp;#34; shorter than my left</li>
            <li>My left leg is 1/2 inch shorter than my right, so</li>
            <li>What I like about it is it never squashes down and the height can easily be adjusted.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use these inserts in any open back shoes b/c they would slip out... but maybe super glue would fix that!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done so many things to reduce the hip pain, I&#x27;m not sure if this product is the key or not, but I was willing to give it a try...</li>
            <li>At first if I walked just from my bed to the bathroom without wearing shoes my back would hurt.  </li>
            <li>First of all I only received one and it stated they came in pairs.</li>
            <li>Unlike most other kinds of heel lifts on the market, these don&#x27;t compress and appear to last indefinitely!  </li>
            <li>Some of the smaller sections don&#x27;t stick to the main part anymore, but they still stack decently and they work.</li>
            <li>so I can have multiple shoes ready to go for summer.</li>
            <li>and it completely comes apart.</li>
            <li>As others have said, they are pretty hard, but my foot can deal with the hardness better than my knees, hips, and back deal with the short leg.</li>
            <li>that weren&#x27;t quite high enough.</li>
            <li>My PT had me get these when I spent 14 weeks in an air cast that was 2 inches higher than my shoe on the not injured foot.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be hard and uncomfortable when I got it in the mail, but it has been great!</li>
            <li>The trick is figuring out exactly how far down to peel the insert.</li>
            <li>This lift is too hard to be comfortable to walk on.  </li>
            <li>My left leg is shorter than my right by about 1/4\\&quot; due to arthritis and disk problems.  </li>
            <li>Although the stacking idea is great, these were painful to wear.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that the lift is clear so it is not as obvious as an opaque one.</li>
            <li>I spent  so much money to have my shoes &amp;#34;built-up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>my back pain went away completely.  </li>
            <li>No slipping, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely would recommend them.</li>
            <li>What I really love about it is I can use some layers to add a little extra to other lifts I bought</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s easy to add layers back on if you need to.</li>
            <li>I then noted slight fraying of my left trouser which reminded me that all my life I had a leg length difference, and the right was longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge lifesaver since the only people who make heel lifts in my town are rude and can&#x27;t measure.</li>
            <li>Recent knee surgery left me with a shorter leg until I can have that side fixed also . . .</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only issue I had with the heel lifter so far is when I go hiking and cross some stream of water.</li>
            <li>When I developed pain in my left hip and knee in January for no apparent reason I went to my physician.</li>
            <li>I think this means the inflammation in my back has gone down thanks to the relief of these inserts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s also very hard and didn&#x27;t fit well in my shoe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think they worked well b/c</li>
            <li> My heels were still not the same height, but better.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product from my doctor for about twice the price.  </li>
            <li> this being the first time I&#x27;ve gotten therm from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described in the post.</li>
            <li> This is a very helpful item - made all the difference!</li>
            <li> I will end up buying more for more of my regular shoes as well as my soccer cleats and cross trainers.</li>
            <li> The heel lift works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> my shorter leg is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Very versatile and comfy!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is absolutely a must, since I have a disparity between the lenght of my lower limbs and after attempting to compensate with several other insoles, I found out this was by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;People</li>
            <li> Exactly what they described AND it arrived in a very timely manner,  </li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re made in layers it&#x27;s also much easier to get the precise amount of lift for the short leg.</li>
            <li> Substantial material--doesn&#x27;t compress much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to move now.</li>
            <li> they have helped much, but need to install tracking device in them</li>
            <li> I really recommend these to anyone with this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it, much to my pleasure</li>
            <li> Thanks....</li>
            <li> Has helped me so much with my balance.</li>
            <li> Makes having to use lift simple and far more convenient than having to have a shoe made.  </li>
            <li> The lift is clear so it blends right into your shoe.</li>
            <li> I ordered some other lifts on Amazon and they worked ok for some shoes</li>
            <li> When I use it in other shoes without orthotics I notice the firmness and the narrowness more, as well as it not staying in place, but it&#x27;s all manageable.</li>
            <li> I simply cut the lift around the edges a little to fit my high heels, and flats better.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get mashed down &amp; compressed like the leather ones &amp; can easily be adjusted to fit any of my gym cross trainers.</li>
            <li> Since the layers come apart easily you have to handle the lift carefully when switching it from one shoe to another.  </li>
            <li> And I had not received the others for on top of the inner sole.</li>
            <li> I was lucky not to have had any such distress until now.</li>
            <li> With stackable layers only 1mm thick, it was very easy to &amp;#34;ramp up&amp;#34; and make sure I wasn&#x27;t over adjusting or jarring my back by jumping heights too fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Overall this product does what it says and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This lift provides easy adjustability and has eliminated lower back pain I was feeling because of extra pressure on one side of my spine.</li>
            <li> my right leg is shorter than my left leg.  </li>
            <li> My right leg is  about 1/4&amp;#34; shorter than my left</li>
            <li> My left leg is 1/2 inch shorter than my right, so</li>
            <li> What I like about it is it never squashes down and the height can easily be adjusted.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use these inserts in any open back shoes b/c they would slip out... but maybe super glue would fix that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done so many things to reduce the hip pain, I&#x27;m not sure if this product is the key or not, but I was willing to give it a try...</li>
            <li> At first if I walked just from my bed to the bathroom without wearing shoes my back would hurt.  </li>
            <li> First of all I only received one and it stated they came in pairs.</li>
            <li> Unlike most other kinds of heel lifts on the market, these don&#x27;t compress and appear to last indefinitely!  </li>
            <li> Some of the smaller sections don&#x27;t stick to the main part anymore, but they still stack decently and they work.</li>
            <li> so I can have multiple shoes ready to go for summer.</li>
            <li> and it completely comes apart.</li>
            <li> As others have said, they are pretty hard, but my foot can deal with the hardness better than my knees, hips, and back deal with the short leg.</li>
            <li> that weren&#x27;t quite high enough.</li>
            <li> My PT had me get these when I spent 14 weeks in an air cast that was 2 inches higher than my shoe on the not injured foot.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be hard and uncomfortable when I got it in the mail, but it has been great!</li>
            <li> The trick is figuring out exactly how far down to peel the insert.</li>
            <li> This lift is too hard to be comfortable to walk on.  </li>
            <li> My left leg is shorter than my right by about 1/4\\&quot; due to arthritis and disk problems.  </li>
            <li> Although the stacking idea is great, these were painful to wear.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that the lift is clear so it is not as obvious as an opaque one.</li>
            <li> I spent  so much money to have my shoes &amp;#34;built-up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> my back pain went away completely.  </li>
            <li> No slipping, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely would recommend them.</li>
            <li> What I really love about it is I can use some layers to add a little extra to other lifts I bought</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s easy to add layers back on if you need to.</li>
            <li> I then noted slight fraying of my left trouser which reminded me that all my life I had a leg length difference, and the right was longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge lifesaver since the only people who make heel lifts in my town are rude and can&#x27;t measure.</li>
            <li> Recent knee surgery left me with a shorter leg until I can have that side fixed also . . .</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only issue I had with the heel lifter so far is when I go hiking and cross some stream of water.</li>
            <li> When I developed pain in my left hip and knee in January for no apparent reason I went to my physician.</li>
            <li> I think this means the inflammation in my back has gone down thanks to the relief of these inserts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s also very hard and didn&#x27;t fit well in my shoe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Who knew such a small thing could help so much, really helped my son with back pain and the adjustable lift was the ticket, is some what flexible.</li>
            <li> If water gets between the sheets, fungus may appear, so I always get the lifter off the shoe and dry it in the sun after such events.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t wear the same shoes every day, I occasionally misplace in which shoes I left it and can tell within a few hours that I should have looked longer.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Used as it, the lift was too long and pushed my foot forward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lifts which compress in a short time.  </li>
            <li> I actually make two lifts out of this one by removing every other layer to make a another lift.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re narrow enough for me and yet have enough length to support the foot.  </li>
            <li> but i think it is the shoe that makes it difficult without a full length lift.</li>
            <li> I have less back pain now that I&#x27;m using a lift in one shoe</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust this but found it very hard and uncomfortable to wear under my inner sole.</li>
            <li> Needed a shoe lift a little bigger than 1/4 inch.  </li>
            <li> There is only one pair of shoes that the lift slides a little</li>
            <li> At some point I lost it and went a few years without it and noticed my back pain returning.</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t last 1 day before giving me trouble.  </li>
            <li> I have bought two of this insoles in 2001 and have been using it with a wide range of shoes (boots, sneakers, etc)</li>
            <li> Too wide for all my shoes.</li>
            <li> I now have minimal pain, and am ordering additional now to correct the remaining difference.</li>
            <li> As a result,  I put up with a left shoe that felt stiff and had added weight.  </li>
            <li> If you only need a little lift, you can get two lifts for the price of one!  </li>
            <li> I took out every other piece,pk</li>
            <li> I wont buy another insert ... the other adjustable ones I have used before the layers move and come apart after a while...</li>
            <li> Not so noticeable as my other lifts.</li>
            <li> well one 1 pair of my sandles...slips on my other 2.</li>
            <li> For anyone with unequal leg lengths, this product is extremely durable and provides varying degrees of lift.  </li>
            <li> I have one shorter than the other.</li>
            <li> used the other part in another shoe that I could lift the orthotic from and slide it underneath.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> one half was about two and a half inches long while the other half was about five inches</li>
            <li> He even took down the name so he could recommend them to other patients.</li>
            <li> I have one leg slightly shorter than the other.  </li>
            <li> Just follow the directions and take every other one to divide the lift in half.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is hard enough so as not to be compressible.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands but could feel the lift (not a long enough transition) and they became uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the least obvious one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This was followed by a daily reduction in pain, slowly but persistently.</li>
            <li> I tape it down with 2 sided tape</li>
            <li> Compared to all of the other heel lifts I recently purchased, this one was the worst and cost the most.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son who has a 1/2&amp;#34; leg discrepancy due to uneven</li>
            <li> Helps with uneven legs due to surgery.</li>
            <li> I had to divide it in half but that made it unequal--</li>
            <li> Now I can walk around the house a little without pain before I put on my shoes.  </li>
            <li> The shape changed little over 6 months of continuous use.  </li>
            <li> It might get a little sweaty in a sandal you wore barefoot.</li>
            <li> Runs a little wide and hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I threw these in the garbage after a few minutes of wear.</li>
            <li> everyday since then.&lt;br</li>
            <li> claiming it is not comfortable probably use it over the shoe&#x27;s EVA insole.</li>
            <li> And all I had to do was peel a few sections off to succeed with the correct thickness and place them in the shoe.</li>
            <li> I squat and lift heavy weights at the gym and the support it provides for</li>
            <li> It is incredibly stiff and slips around in the shoe.  </li>
            <li> solved my uneven foot issue in 5 seconds!</li>
            <li> I needed a small lift in one shoe</li>
            <li> not sure how this would work if you were walking on it on</li>
            <li> and I usually add one to make up for the \\&quot;shrinkige\\&quot; that I experience in the late PM.</li>
            <li> Very hard, killed my ankle in couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard on the foot, so</li>
            <li> Also this is an extremely hard plastic; like walking on a cement floor.</li>
            <li> They are hard, but when I put an insole over them, the hardness is not felt.</li>
            <li> Also late in the afternoon we are not as tall as we are in the morning, this lift can be adjusted by the mm</li>
            <li> Really hard plastic, not great.</li>
            <li> I found this to be really stiff and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed entirely.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard and uncomfortable and does not stay in place.</li>
            <li> This hard plastic lift is very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The lift is uncomfortable and overpriced !!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it just what i needed. i am very  pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My left leg is shorter than my right by about 1/4\\&quot; due to arthritis and disk problems.  I&#x27;ve tried other lifts which compress in a short time.  This lift works best for me because it holds up.  I use a velcro strip to hold it in place.  Great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have one leg slightly shorter than the other.  This heel lift fits into my shoes--all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.  It separates by layers so it&#x27;s easy to get the amount of elevation required.  Substantial material--doesn&#x27;t compress much.</li>
            <li> No sticky stuff.. all static and pressure. Adjustable before and after use. I don&#x27;t think it could be any easier. With stackable layers only 1mm thick, it was very easy to &amp;#34;ramp up&amp;#34; and make sure I wasn&#x27;t over adjusting or jarring my back by jumping heights too fast.</li>
            <li> I had this product recommended to me by a shoe specialist at a store called Gear West. It&#x27;s worked quite well for me!</li>
            <li> Really hard plastic, not great.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the lift is clear so it is not as obvious as an opaque one.</li>
            <li> This lift is great.  Easy to adjust.  Fits easily into all my shoes.  Makes having to use lift simple and far more convenient than having to have a shoe made.  Will probably buy another so I can have multiple shoes ready to go for summer.</li>
            <li> The G&amp;W Heel Lift does exactly what it is supposed to do. If you only need a little lift, you can get two lifts for the price of one!  Just follow the directions and take every other one to divide the lift in half.  I bought 3 so that all my shoes are taken care of.</li>
            <li> solved my uneven foot issue in 5 seconds!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed entirely.  It is very hard and uncomfortable and does not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my podiatrist.</li>
            <li> This has successfully aligned my left side to match my right side.  Drawback- it can slide around otherwise it is comfortabke.</li>
            <li> I needed a heel lift in one shoe.  I tried other brands but could feel the lift (not a long enough transition) and they became uncomfortable.  I actually make two lifts out of this one by removing every other layer to make a another lift.  I also superglue the layers together.  The result?  A nice lift which I cannot detect in my shoes.  I even ran a 1/2 marathon with the lift in my running shoes and could not feel it at all!  In the summer I plan to experiment with adding the lift to my sandals.  Does the job for more comfortably than the other lifts I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This will be great with my sandals and backless shoes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the heel lift daily for over two weeks...I&#x27;ve done so many things to reduce the hip pain, I&#x27;m not sure if this product is the key or not, but I was willing to give it a try...I also sent a set to my daughter...believe it or not, I wear it in my LT Teva sandle as does my daughter. The product stays put...I gave it a 4 star rather than a 5 because the tiniest piece at the very back of the heel, fell out, but that was no problem because I didn&#x27;t need that piece. I took out every other piece,pk</li>
            <li> I need a 1/4 inch lift on my left side so I am very familiar with products like this and I love this one for sandals. I tape it down with 2 sided tape and it&#x27;s the least obvious one I&#x27;ve found. I would prefer a true size non adjusting model but I have not seen one yet.</li>
            <li> I have a leg length discrepancy of 3/8\\&quot; and had worn a lift for many years. At some point I lost it and went a few years without it and noticed my back pain returning. After reading many reviews I decided to try this one and have been very pleased. Since I don&#x27;t wear the same shoes every day, I occasionally misplace in which shoes I left it and can tell within a few hours that I should have looked longer. I don&#x27;t pull up the insole as suggested but lay it on top and my socks provide enough distance between the vinyl and my foot. After two months, it has contoured to the shape of my foot nicely and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for our needs.</li>
            <li> Good idea but I need the maximum so not helpful bor me.</li>
            <li> Love love loved them!</li>
            <li> I have had a leg discrepancy for 20 years.  I spent  so much money to have my shoes &amp;#34;built-up&amp;#34;. As a result,  I put up with a left shoe that felt stiff and had added weight.  The shoes never did feel right.&lt;br /&gt;I did some reading online and read lots of reviews.  I hesitated on using this G&amp;W Heel Lift because it was made of a&lt;br /&gt;hard plastic. A good note is that these G&amp;W lifts are a little longer and fit in my shoe well. . I tape the lift in my shoe and then add an instep sole on top. (This depends upon how much room you might have available in your heel area.  Please note that you have to experiment to find the right shoe style that works with this add-on.  Buy the add-on lift and take it with you when&lt;br /&gt;you buy shoes. I ended up buying a lift for each pair of shoes I own.  It is easier than trying to re-use just (one lift). Hope this review helps someone.</li>
            <li> It is perfect as you can adjust the height as needed.  Non slip.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing a PT for my back for a while now... only to find out the problem all along is my right leg is shorter than my left leg.  I started using these inserts.  At first I didn&#x27;t think they worked well b/c I was still having pain in my back but I was also not wearing the lift 24/7.  I had to buy more shoes (besides flip flops) that I could fit these into in order to accomplish wearing them all the time.  Once I started wearing them 24/7 my back pain went away completely.  At first if I walked just from my bed to the bathroom without wearing shoes my back would hurt.  Now I can walk around the house a little without pain before I put on my shoes.  I think this means the inflammation in my back has gone down thanks to the relief of these inserts.  I plan on buying more so I can have an insert for each shoes.  Might even buy some that I will super glue into flip flops.  You can&#x27;t use these inserts in any open back shoes b/c they would slip out... but maybe super glue would fix that!</li>
            <li> Who knew such a small thing could help so much, really helped my son with back pain and the adjustable lift was the ticket, is some what flexible.</li>
            <li> This might be a great idea, but in use it was trash.  The layers moved on themselves causing it to elongate and become mispositioned.  It was a complete waste of money.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle to return so it went in the trash.  I ended up going to the foot doctor and having some quality inserts made.  This item didn&#x27;t last 1 day before giving me trouble.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This hard plastic lift is very uncomfortable.  I would not recommend. I threw these in the garbage after a few minutes of wear.</li>
            <li> All aspects of this transaction were PERFECT &#x3D; Quality, Delivery &amp; Price</li>
            <li> Exactly what they described AND it arrived in a very timely manner,  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> First of all I only received one and it stated they came in pairs. Therefore I tried it and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable plus it did not stay aligned.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Needed a shoe lift a little bigger than 1/4 inch.  Easy to adjust this but found it very hard and uncomfortable to wear under my inner sole. Found the campion heel lift, also sold on Amazon, much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Needs to be taped into sandals.</li>
            <li> Easy to layer the pieces to get the height you need.  My PT had me get these when I spent 14 weeks in an air cast that was 2 inches higher than my shoe on the not injured foot.  My heels were still not the same height, but better.</li>
            <li> I very seldom wear the same shoes everyday, which means I have to take the heel lift  out of one shoe to put it in another. The problem I was having with doing this is the lift would literally fall apart because it&#x27;s adjustable and it completely comes apart. I ended up super glueing the lift together to help me with this issue. It&#x27;s much easier to move now.</li>
            <li> Recent knee surgery left me with a shorter leg until I can have that side fixed also . . . these are perfect to help me walk on an even keel again. Sent for another one for an additional pair of shoes already!</li>
            <li> They come apart too easily.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as ones from my doctor-referred provider and 25% cheaper.</li>
            <li> The heel lift worked. It was just what needed.</li>
            <li> great lift; easy to use</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I wont buy another insert ... the other adjustable ones I have used before the layers move and come apart after a while...this one I have used daily and it is still in one piece and not crooked</li>
            <li> Used as it, the lift was too long and pushed my foot forward. However, the 1 mm. lifts can be peeled off and used separately. This makes the product very useful.</li>
            <li> warning--when you order this, you get ONE lift. I had to divide it in half but that made it unequal--one half was about two and a half inches long while the other half was about five inches long.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s also very hard and didn&#x27;t fit well in my shoe.&lt;br /&gt;I would not order this again.</li>
            <li> 8 mos. ago I underwent hip replacement which left my left leg 13mm longer than the right. I have tried ALL of the lifts and can tell you honestly this is the only one that works perfectly. It can even be worn with sandals since it is colorless and after a short use it will mold itself to your heel shape. Also late in the afternoon we are not as tall as we are in the morning, this lift can be adjusted by the mm and I usually add one to make up for the \\&quot;shrinkige\\&quot; that I experience in the late PM. PERFECT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a repeat purchaser</li>
            <li> they have helped much, but need to install tracking device in them so I wont keep misplacing them as I move them from shoe&lt;br /&gt;to shoe</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to hide the fact they were heel lifts. The lift is clear so it blends right into your shoe. I simply cut the lift around the edges a little to fit my high heels, and flats better. I thought it would be hard and uncomfortable when I got it in the mail, but it has been great!</li>
            <li> Compared to all of the other heel lifts I recently purchased, this one was the worst and cost the most.  It is incredibly stiff and slips around in the shoe.  I threw it out in disgust.</li>
            <li> This lift provides easy adjustability and has eliminated lower back pain I was feeling because of extra pressure on one side of my spine.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product from my doctor for about twice the price.  Then I saw it on Amazon.  I need to wear a lift to help with back paid and it works.  This lift is adjustable and I can velcro it to sandals.  I have bought 3 or 4 of these so I don&#x27;t have to keep changing the lifts with the shoes.  It works well.</li>
            <li> My right leg is  about 1/4&amp;#34; shorter than my left &amp; I&#x27;ve either had a lift put on my shoe or worn lifts for many years. These lifts are the best I&#x27;ve had &amp; I&#x27;ve used them for many years, this being the first time I&#x27;ve gotten therm from Amazon. They don&#x27;t get mashed down &amp; compressed like the leather ones &amp; can easily be adjusted to fit any of my gym cross trainers. Since they&#x27;re made in layers it&#x27;s also much easier to get the precise amount of lift for the short leg. A gym pal intro&#x27;d me to these because she also has a short leg. I really recommend these to anyone with this problem.</li>
            <li> Amazing in that as soon as I placed this in my shoe, my on- going hip (bursitis I think) pain felt noticeably better. The trick is figuring out exactly how far down to peel the insert. At least it&#x27;s easy to add layers back on if you need to.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s a huge lifesaver since the only people who make heel lifts in my town are rude and can&#x27;t measure. It&#x27;s a bit hard on the foot, so I&#x27;m probably going to try another kind just to seek more comfort.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described in the post.</li>
            <li> I purchased them for my mom she said it works great :)</li>
            <li> This is a very helpful item - made all the difference!</li>
            <li> I found this to be really stiff and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Have used the lifts before.  Very satisfied and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Easy to use and c.omfortable.  I have a prosthesis in my shoe and the heel lift fits underneath it without a problem</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my problem.</li>
            <li> Fairly good product, though some sections are harder to stick together after you have been wearing them awhile.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son who has a 1/2&amp;#34; leg discrepancy due to uneven hips.&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the product description better.  It goes under the insole of the shoe.  My son isn&#x27;t going to lift up the insole every time he changes shoes.  Also this is an extremely hard plastic; like walking on a cement floor.</li>
            <li> The lift is uncomfortable and overpriced !!</li>
            <li> These work . I have a discrepancy in length of legs 1/4-1/2in. and followed another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion of breaking them in, in tennis shoes first, and then taking them apart and Super gluing them together. I use them in sandals - they do not separate. Not so noticeable as my other lifts.</li>
            <li> Adjustable and lasts quite awhile. Doesnt slide around.  The shape changed little over 6 months of continuous use.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Its easy to switch in my shoes and works well one 1 pair of my sandles...slips on my other 2.</li>
            <li> These lifts are excellent.  They do not slide in my shoe.  They are hard, but when I put an insole over them, the hardness is not felt.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of this insoles in 2001 and have been using it with a wide range of shoes (boots, sneakers, etc) everyday since then.&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely a must, since I have a disparity between the lenght of my lower limbs and after attempting to compensate with several other insoles, I found out this was by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;People claiming it is not comfortable probably use it over the shoe&#x27;s EVA insole. I use this heel lifter under the EVA insole and it seems it is not there at all.&lt;br /&gt;I had severe back pain caused by the inbalance of my gait before using this wonderful heel lifter. It is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I do not hesitate to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with the heel lifter so far is when I go hiking and cross some stream of water. If water gets between the sheets, fungus may appear, so I always get the lifter off the shoe and dry it in the sun after such events.</li>
            <li> For anyone with unequal leg lengths, this product is extremely durable and provides varying degrees of lift.  My left leg is 1/2 inch shorter than my right, so I always use it with all layers attached, placing it underneath the insole in the left shoe.  Unlike most other kinds of heel lifts on the market, these don&#x27;t compress and appear to last indefinitely!  I&#x27;m still using the first ones I purchased more than 10 years ago.  The only downside is that these don&#x27;t stay in place with a backless or slingback-type shoe.</li>
            <li> I used to use a custom leather lift back when I worked but quit after I retired but have recently noticed some back pains caused by my scoliosis.  Had X-rays done and my chiropractor peeled off the amount of lift I needed.  He even took down the name so he could recommend them to other patients.</li>
            <li> I ordered some other lifts on Amazon and they worked ok for some shoes but they kept sliding toward the front of my shoe. These clearly adjustable lifts are easy to use, easy to adjust, don&#x27;t slip, and have a gradual decline angle for comfort. There is only one pair of shoes that the lift slides a little but i think it is the shoe that makes it difficult without a full length lift. Overall this product does what it says and is worth the money. I will end up buying more for more of my regular shoes as well as my soccer cleats and cross trainers.</li>
            <li> It is working just fine. My daughter will be ordering the heel lift also. We look forward to improving our posture.</li>
            <li> Works just like they are supposed to. I love that I can customize the fit!</li>
            <li> I realized these were to be placed under the inner sole of my shoes or sneakers. However the shoes I was wearing did not have a removable inner sole. And I had not received the others for on top of the inner sole. So I thought what the heck I&#x27;ll try it, much to my pleasure I could not even feel them in the shoes. Even only wearing a very light sock went to a wedding and forgot they were even there. And all I had to do was peel a few sections off to succeed with the correct thickness and place them in the shoe. No slipping, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these and have used it for years. If you have a short leg it definitely works. Some of the smaller sections don&#x27;t stick to the main part anymore, but they still stack decently and they work. As others have said, they are pretty hard, but my foot can deal with the hardness better than my knees, hips, and back deal with the short leg. I use mine under orthotics, which makes it more tolerable. When I use it in other shoes without orthotics I notice the firmness and the narrowness more, as well as it not staying in place, but it&#x27;s all manageable.</li>
            <li> My doctor approved how well it help me. I have one shorter than the other. Your product is great. Thank you</li>
            <li> These are my favorite lifts.  They&#x27;re narrow enough for me and yet have enough length to support the foot.  The plastic is hard enough so as not to be compressible.</li>
            <li> Heel lift separates easily for quick adjustment.  Since the layers come apart easily you have to handle the lift carefully when switching it from one shoe to another.  I ended up inadvertenly removing additional layers when I took it out of my shoe.</li>
            <li> I bought this lift to use for a leg length difference after hip surgery. What I like about it is it never squashes down and the height can easily be adjusted. What I really love about it is I can use some layers to add a little extra to other lifts I bought that weren&#x27;t quite high enough. Used by itself I like to put it under an existing footbed to give some cushioning.</li>
            <li> The heel lift works exactly as described. I squat and lift heavy weights at the gym and the support it provides for my shorter leg is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Very versatile and comfy!  I needed a small lift in one shoe and I&#x27;m satisfied.  Thanks....easy to use and I think they will be quite durable as well.</li>
            <li> Helps with uneven legs due to surgery.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Has helped me so much with my balance.</li>
            <li> Very hard, killed my ankle in couple of hours. Not recommended, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Runs a little wide and hard as a rock. You&#x27;ll need another insole on top. Sending back. Too wide for all my shoes.</li>
            <li> This lift is too hard to be comfortable to walk on.  I bought it to wear in a sandal (as advertised) but that will not work.  I am in the process of contacting the company for a return.</li>
            <li> Although the stacking idea is great, these were painful to wear.  I would have preferred a softer material.</li>
            <li> Its a great product, it stays in position an gives a lift&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to order 6 more G&amp;W Hell Lifts</li>
            <li> This lift was perfect for what I wanted. It is in layers that can be separated so I was able to put most of it under my orthotic in my walking shoe.&lt;br /&gt;I used the other part in another shoe that I could lift the orthotic from and slide it underneath.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how this would work if you were walking on it on it&#x27;s own. It might get a little sweaty in a sandal you wore barefoot. I liked that I could adjust the height easily. I have less back pain now that I&#x27;m using a lift in one shoe</li>
            <li> When I developed pain in my left hip and knee in January for no apparent reason I went to my physician. All he could find was a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; arthritis at the knee. For a man who just turned 80 I was lucky not to have had any such distress until now. The pain persisted daily, so he sent me to an orthopedist. He injected my hip and knee areas for tendenits/bursitis with cortisone. This was now 3 weeks into severe daily pain and limping. No benefit from cortisone. I then noted slight fraying of my left trouser which reminded me that all my life I had a leg length difference, and the right was longer. I then looked this up and found it to be a cause for pain in the longer leg. I ordered these heel lifts, and used only 1/2 correction in the left shoe. I use this lift for my sandals, but used the Warwick Adjust A Heel Lift for regular shoes. This was followed by a daily reduction in pain, slowly but persistently. I now have minimal pain, and am ordering additional now to correct the remaining difference.</li>
