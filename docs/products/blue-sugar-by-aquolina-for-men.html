            <li>Amazing stuff for this price.</li>
            <li>our bed smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I combine this with Givenchy Pi, and on my skin, it literally smells like warm, buttery maple syrup or cinnamon-swirl coffee cake.</li>
            <li>Nice breeze.</li>
            <li>but the dry-down is really nice and</li>
            <li>and i got allot of a nice complements.</li>

            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is so sexy.  </li>
            <li>and I love wearing it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Any more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a horrible scent by any means, but it can easily be sweetly overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It has hints on the Cotten candy smell but more manly.</li>
            <li>I love it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this, I read hundreds of reviews claiming that it was the best and most addictive scent offered by the brand, but I was hesitant since it was labeled as a men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li>, I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>Love LA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sprayed at 6:25pm and started writing this review at 9:25pm after giving them one more sniff.</li>
            <li>so, so, delicious that it even beats out Blue Sugar in smell but</li>
            <li>I can see why many reviewers rave about it, and I can see why some do not like it.</li>
            <li>I lean more toward not liking it</li>
            <li>give you an idea of how opposites attract, my GF chose my #5, 6 and 8 as her top three best smelling scents respectively.</li>
            <li>I buy cologne because I love the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>This is my husbands top 5 favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I personally love that-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I have received while wearing this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The first burst of spun sugar settles into a pleasant Cologne scent.</li>
            <li>In the beginning, it really reminded me of A-Men (which I don&#x27;t care for very much), but I began doing some experimenting and found a perfect mixture :)</li>
            <li>The reason i took off the one star is perhaps because I had higher expectations as surprising as that sounds.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much, one of my favorite perfume smells good</li>
            <li>am buying this cologne for my Caribbean cruise and need something light and memorable and this will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Pink Sugar for myself, my daughter and my best friend.</li>
            <li>but overall, the dry-down was also great but after such a magnificent opening</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite unique, which is why I love it.</li>
            <li>Go easy on the sprays in the heat tho.</li>
            <li>You get 6-8 hrs on the skin easily with this one and 24hrs on ur clothing.</li>
            <li>Easy on the sprayer.</li>
            <li>Do use it sparingly, because it is quite strong.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, this is a beautiful and smokey scent, can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really explain it, but love it on my man!</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of this one by Aquolina.</li>
            <li>I have tons of perfume, but Aquolina is consistently great and Blue Sugar is no exception.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what makes Blue Sugar so great -</li>
            <li>That was the sound of my panties hitting the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, it doesn&#x27;t do that, just smells soft, pleasant and slightly sweet.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this Blue Sugar is GREAT and a bargain bin special at just $17/1.7 oz .</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smell original.</li>
            <li>It is sweet and light yet doesn&#x27;t smell like women&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Unique and enticing....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incredibly powerful and has a very strong cedar/pine scent at first.</li>
            <li>OK, so I know the guys really like this.</li>
            <li>Yup, it&#x27;s sugar sweet licorice candy -</li>
            <li>I love the smell, really buy it for myself</li>
            <li>So I was dying for a sweet smelling men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather sickeningly sweet like cane sugar and lingers for hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried to pass this fragrance off on my nephew but as soon as he smelled it he said it was sweet and scrunched up his face.</li>
            <li>It smells like a room full of cotton candy and sugar cookies-</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so sweet</li>
            <li>Which explains why it&#x27;s such a unisex scent loved by all.</li>
            <li>Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet w/ a hint of pepper/musk.  </li>
            <li>It smells sweet</li>
            <li>and I really think it is more for a women than a man....</li>
            <li>At first, it&#x27;s quite strong when sprayed and the smell seems off.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend loves Pink Sugar on me, but he isn&#x27;t that thrilled with this as much, but I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a strong scent and definitely lasts, with the right amount of silage and projection for this kind of a smell.</li>
            <li>Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents.</li>
            <li>It smells like liquid candy, only better!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the original Pink Sugar &amp; after reading the reviews for Blue Sugar I decided to give a try and I almost LOVE it more than PS!</li>
            <li>You will be surprised at how it will work magic and gain you the type of attention you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my skin it smells like fresh baked gingerbread cookies AND iced lemon cookies.  </li>
            <li>it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho.</li>
            <li>scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance.</li>
            <li>but I simply smiled and told her it was called \\&quot;Blue Sugar\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Some people say this smells like freshly baked cookies.</li>
            <li>It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crazy how when I wear this how many guys comment on how good I smell or they just seem in a better mood to see me.</li>
            <li>Sweet and just a little woody undertone, very sexy for both men and women.</li>
            <li>Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper.</li>
            <li>though most people comment on how nice it smells, does not last as long as I would like for it to</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic scent and unlike other men&#x27;s colognes.&lt;br /&gt;He gets many compliments every time he wears it.</li>
            <li>It is so nice, smells sweet &amp; a little outdoorsy....</li>
            <li>I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one.</li>
            <li>Blue Sugar has depth, sensuality &amp; character, just what most woman&#x27;s sugar gourmands are lacking, imo.</li>
            <li>it really smells YUMMY!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested my suggestion would be try it on your skin before you buy it, may be it</li>
            <li>find one spray of it to be more than enough to get me through a shift at work.</li>
            <li>but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept.</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle and still looking for more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Blue Sugar!  </li>
            <li>LoL. I went to Costco, where I know a lot of people, and everyone I hugged wanted to hang on extra long just to sniff!!</li>
            <li>The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 sprays WILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day.</li>
            <li>If you like sweet smelling colognes (but not overly sweet) and receiving compliments than this cologne is definitely for you!</li>
            <li>Sweet, spicy, masculine, delicious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stay away if you think this is going to be a fresh clean scent, unless you actually like Angel, do NOT buy this.</li>
            <li>Blue Sugar is STRONG.</li>
            <li>Warm, delicious, and intoxicating with a thick cotton candy background thrown in during the dry down.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler</li>
            <li>I like it even more than Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for both sexes!</li>
            <li>My husband also loves wearing this cologne since the licorice notes really pop on his skin.</li>
            <li>Very well done for a cheapy.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before.</li>
            <li>it projects very well.</li>
            <li>This smells NOTHING at all like Pink Sugar, more like ANGEL which I think smells like body odor.</li>
            <li>This product reasonable priced....</li>
            <li>generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I had the same experience that, for the first day of using the cologne, it came out strongly hot sugar at first.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE pink Sugar, so when I saw that they made a scent for men, I bought it!</li>
            <li>then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it.</li>
            <li>Compared to A*Men by Thierry Mugler, Blue Sugar wins by cost by a landslide -- though the scents are very distinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li>The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a really classic male scent: anything with hardwood, vanilla, whiskey, citrus, grapefruit, patchouli, anything traditional, then you&#x27;d better go elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Sweet and masculine all at the same time like bubbling brown sugar with notes of vanilla.</li>
            <li>It smells like pine trees and candy, sweet but masculine enough.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes sweet smelling scents, especially if you&#x27;re a fan of Pink Sugar, Gold Sugar, or any of the other amazing Aquolina options.</li>
            <li>I have worn Pink Sugar for women for about 5 years, and was so excited to see a men&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my new go-to perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like pink sugar only what I call the more &#x27;grown up&#x27; version.</li>
            <li>I mean very strong.</li>
            <li>Clearly this is what Bella smells when she smells Edward!</li>
            <li>Perhaps good for a young kid ( under 13 yo ), way to sweet and unpleasant to my nose...</li>
            <li>/&gt;You must&#x27;nt be afraid of a strong liquorice/candy top with sandalwood and vanilla drydown.</li>
            <li>Well different it certainly is.</li>
            <li>It pairs very well with my Pink Sugar that HE loves so much on me.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Bought from Tuccini and it definitely was 100% real.</li>
            <li>Next, there&#x27;s a blast of spice followed by a very manly scent in the drydown.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to a lot of colognes and perfumes</li>
            <li>It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think is a good &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; blind buy.</li>
            <li>It takes a unique sort of man to pull this off, but if you can, you&#x27;ll have women AND men going crazy over it :)</li>
            <li>It is a little like Amen by Mugler, This gem used to be dirt cheap, but apparently they have stopped making it and the price has tripled.</li>
            <li>I tried Blue Sugar just recently for the first time</li>
            <li>Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent.</li>
            <li>For such a cheap cologne, I am shocked at how potent it is.</li>
            <li>Polo stinks so good if you like it</li>
            <li>Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.</li>
            <li>If you are the type of person who buys based on what women like, then you better try some blind tests with some women you know because you may be surprised to find out that they may like the scents you don&#x27;t and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spicy black licorice is decadent and delish, really unusual.</li>

            <li> Love LA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sprayed at 6:25pm and started writing this review at 9:25pm after giving them one more sniff.</li>
            <li> so, so, delicious that it even beats out Blue Sugar in smell but</li>
            <li> I can see why many reviewers rave about it, and I can see why some do not like it.</li>
            <li> I lean more toward not liking it</li>
            <li> give you an idea of how opposites attract, my GF chose my #5, 6 and 8 as her top three best smelling scents respectively.</li>
            <li> I buy cologne because I love the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands top 5 favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I personally love that-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I have received while wearing this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The first burst of spun sugar settles into a pleasant Cologne scent.</li>
            <li> In the beginning, it really reminded me of A-Men (which I don&#x27;t care for very much), but I began doing some experimenting and found a perfect mixture :)</li>
            <li> The reason i took off the one star is perhaps because I had higher expectations as surprising as that sounds.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much, one of my favorite perfume smells good</li>
            <li> am buying this cologne for my Caribbean cruise and need something light and memorable and this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pink Sugar for myself, my daughter and my best friend.</li>
            <li> but overall, the dry-down was also great but after such a magnificent opening</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite unique, which is why I love it.</li>
            <li> Go easy on the sprays in the heat tho.</li>
            <li> You get 6-8 hrs on the skin easily with this one and 24hrs on ur clothing.</li>
            <li> Easy on the sprayer.</li>
            <li> Do use it sparingly, because it is quite strong.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, this is a beautiful and smokey scent, can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really explain it, but love it on my man!</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of this one by Aquolina.</li>
            <li> I have tons of perfume, but Aquolina is consistently great and Blue Sugar is no exception.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what makes Blue Sugar so great -</li>
            <li> That was the sound of my panties hitting the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, it doesn&#x27;t do that, just smells soft, pleasant and slightly sweet.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this Blue Sugar is GREAT and a bargain bin special at just $17/1.7 oz .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell original.</li>
            <li> It is sweet and light yet doesn&#x27;t smell like women&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unique and enticing....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s incredibly powerful and has a very strong cedar/pine scent at first.</li>
            <li> OK, so I know the guys really like this.</li>
            <li> Yup, it&#x27;s sugar sweet licorice candy -</li>
            <li> I love the smell, really buy it for myself</li>
            <li> So I was dying for a sweet smelling men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather sickeningly sweet like cane sugar and lingers for hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried to pass this fragrance off on my nephew but as soon as he smelled it he said it was sweet and scrunched up his face.</li>
            <li> It smells like a room full of cotton candy and sugar cookies-</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so sweet</li>
            <li> Which explains why it&#x27;s such a unisex scent loved by all.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li> It smells sweet w/ a hint of pepper/musk.  </li>
            <li> It smells sweet</li>
            <li> and I really think it is more for a women than a man....</li>
            <li> At first, it&#x27;s quite strong when sprayed and the smell seems off.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loves Pink Sugar on me, but he isn&#x27;t that thrilled with this as much, but I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a strong scent and definitely lasts, with the right amount of silage and projection for this kind of a smell.</li>
            <li> Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents.</li>
            <li> It smells like liquid candy, only better!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the original Pink Sugar &amp; after reading the reviews for Blue Sugar I decided to give a try and I almost LOVE it more than PS!</li>
            <li> You will be surprised at how it will work magic and gain you the type of attention you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my skin it smells like fresh baked gingerbread cookies AND iced lemon cookies.  </li>
            <li> it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho.</li>
            <li> scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance.</li>
            <li> but I simply smiled and told her it was called \\&quot;Blue Sugar\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Some people say this smells like freshly baked cookies.</li>
            <li> It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how when I wear this how many guys comment on how good I smell or they just seem in a better mood to see me.</li>
            <li> Sweet and just a little woody undertone, very sexy for both men and women.</li>
            <li> Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper.</li>
            <li> though most people comment on how nice it smells, does not last as long as I would like for it to</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic scent and unlike other men&#x27;s colognes.&lt;br /&gt;He gets many compliments every time he wears it.</li>
            <li> It is so nice, smells sweet &amp; a little outdoorsy....</li>
            <li> I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one.</li>
            <li> Blue Sugar has depth, sensuality &amp; character, just what most woman&#x27;s sugar gourmands are lacking, imo.</li>
            <li> it really smells YUMMY!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested my suggestion would be try it on your skin before you buy it, may be it</li>
            <li> find one spray of it to be more than enough to get me through a shift at work.</li>
            <li> but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and still looking for more.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Blue Sugar!  </li>
            <li> LoL. I went to Costco, where I know a lot of people, and everyone I hugged wanted to hang on extra long just to sniff!!</li>
            <li> The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 sprays WILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day.</li>
            <li> If you like sweet smelling colognes (but not overly sweet) and receiving compliments than this cologne is definitely for you!</li>
            <li> Sweet, spicy, masculine, delicious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stay away if you think this is going to be a fresh clean scent, unless you actually like Angel, do NOT buy this.</li>
            <li> Blue Sugar is STRONG.</li>
            <li> Warm, delicious, and intoxicating with a thick cotton candy background thrown in during the dry down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler</li>
            <li> I like it even more than Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for both sexes!</li>
            <li> My husband also loves wearing this cologne since the licorice notes really pop on his skin.</li>
            <li> Very well done for a cheapy.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before.</li>
            <li> it projects very well.</li>
            <li> This smells NOTHING at all like Pink Sugar, more like ANGEL which I think smells like body odor.</li>
            <li> This product reasonable priced....</li>
            <li> generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience that, for the first day of using the cologne, it came out strongly hot sugar at first.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE pink Sugar, so when I saw that they made a scent for men, I bought it!</li>
            <li> then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it.</li>
            <li> Compared to A*Men by Thierry Mugler, Blue Sugar wins by cost by a landslide -- though the scents are very distinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li> The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a really classic male scent: anything with hardwood, vanilla, whiskey, citrus, grapefruit, patchouli, anything traditional, then you&#x27;d better go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Sweet and masculine all at the same time like bubbling brown sugar with notes of vanilla.</li>
            <li> It smells like pine trees and candy, sweet but masculine enough.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes sweet smelling scents, especially if you&#x27;re a fan of Pink Sugar, Gold Sugar, or any of the other amazing Aquolina options.</li>
            <li> I have worn Pink Sugar for women for about 5 years, and was so excited to see a men&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my new go-to perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like pink sugar only what I call the more &#x27;grown up&#x27; version.</li>
            <li> I mean very strong.</li>
            <li> Clearly this is what Bella smells when she smells Edward!</li>
            <li> Perhaps good for a young kid ( under 13 yo ), way to sweet and unpleasant to my nose...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You must&#x27;nt be afraid of a strong liquorice/candy top with sandalwood and vanilla drydown.</li>
            <li> Well different it certainly is.</li>
            <li> It pairs very well with my Pink Sugar that HE loves so much on me.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> Bought from Tuccini and it definitely was 100% real.</li>
            <li> Next, there&#x27;s a blast of spice followed by a very manly scent in the drydown.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of colognes and perfumes</li>
            <li> It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think is a good &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; blind buy.</li>
            <li> It takes a unique sort of man to pull this off, but if you can, you&#x27;ll have women AND men going crazy over it :)</li>
            <li> It is a little like Amen by Mugler, This gem used to be dirt cheap, but apparently they have stopped making it and the price has tripled.</li>
            <li> I tried Blue Sugar just recently for the first time</li>
            <li> Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap cologne, I am shocked at how potent it is.</li>
            <li> Polo stinks so good if you like it</li>
            <li> Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.</li>
            <li> If you are the type of person who buys based on what women like, then you better try some blind tests with some women you know because you may be surprised to find out that they may like the scents you don&#x27;t and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spicy black licorice is decadent and delish, really unusual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over it and so are the perfumers of the world because there are not many scents on the market like Polo&#x27;s green bottle original scent and noone is trying to mimic it anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I catch myself smelling my wrists just to breate it in and the smells seems to last a long time!</li>
            <li> Oddly, you can spray 4-5 sprays and not offend anyone because of the soft sweetness that remains throughout this scent.</li>
            <li> Personally, the dry down smells like you sprinkled salt n pepper on a grapefruit mixed with a WOOD undertone big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;m just sharing how it smelled to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry this was so long people.</li>
            <li> My review is based on the opening, dry down and projection within these last 3 hours only.</li>
            <li> Wear it with caution, two sprays go a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t stock up on a few bottles when it was more affordable.</li>
            <li> I live in the Los Angeles area and it was around 80 degrees for the past few days here in the city just to give you a visual of my surrounding temp.</li>
            <li> I hate the traditional woodsy, lumberjack scents that men are usually bombarded with in the name of smelling good.</li>
            <li> appreciate Pink Sugar, but as a 45yo woman I didn&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like cotton candy or spun sugar.</li>
            <li> I purchased this not really smelling it.</li>
            <li> I wear Pink Sugar and figured I&#x27;d get this for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> have a lot of colognes and this is among the few that stand as truly different..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that this is discontinued, but I spent $75 for this 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li> It opens like cotton candy or a slight bubble gum vibe but then drys down into a yellow cake batter or caramelized vanilla/sugar mixture.</li>
            <li> have a bias toward fragrances that I have smelled before that mimic other fragrance houses.</li>
            <li> Complain: The seal on my packaging was broken, as if it was previously used, and I ordered a NEW perfume.</li>
            <li> The 1.7 will last you at least a year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will agree with some reviewers and say this is an acquired taste so-to-speak and you will either LOVE it or HATE it.</li>
            <li> If D&amp;G 1 had the projection of Encre Noire, D&amp;G would be #1 HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> /&gt;#7 Silver by Jack Black</li>
            <li> but I wish it smelled a little bit sweeter and little less spicy.</li>
            <li> Not horrible a bad product to wear !</li>
            <li> Bottle looked like some fragrance was missing.</li>
            <li> (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Blue Sugar by Aqualina</li>
            <li> Hope it was helpful at least.</li>
            <li> Will have to go back to expensive perfumes!</li>
            <li> Seriously*</li>
            <li> When I actually smelled it I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> that sometimes I get tired of being around myself.</li>
            <li> Poor projection after 4 hrs and semi floral on the dry-down.</li>
            <li> the dry down from D&amp;G for ($52) from a deisgner house is just pathetic.</li>
            <li> I will be seriously sad if they ever got rid of this scent.</li>
            <li> had my girlfriend blind test me.</li>
            <li> I will also recommend (blind buy) or (try 1st) for those who care about stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (You can blind buy this</li>
            <li> (You can blind buy this</li>
            <li> (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it stinks so bad when you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but once they do, they will be addicted and upon knowing the price, they will be inseparable!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is so sexy.  I bought for my boyfriend and want him to wear it all the time!</li>
            <li> OK, so I know the guys really like this. But did you know that women wear this too? Yup, it&#x27;s sugar sweet licorice candy - and I love wearing it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate Pink Sugar, but as a 45yo woman I didn&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like cotton candy or spun sugar. I took a chance on Blue Sugar as an alternative &amp; bought it blind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unisex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Sugar is almost perfect on me. The spicy black licorice is decadent and delish, really unusual. The patch, cedar &amp; tonka bean present like a women&#x27;s fume on me. I&#x27;m not picking up the coriander or lavender. Blue Sugar has depth, sensuality &amp; character, just what most woman&#x27;s sugar gourmands are lacking, imo.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, really buy it for myself though most people comment on how nice it smells, does not last as long as I would like for it to but I can put up with that.&lt;br /&gt;I have never found anything that compares with it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in a one gallon container and that I could afford it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a sugar addict&#x27;s DREAM in a bottle!! For such a cheap cologne, I am shocked at how potent it is. It truly smells like cotton candy, sugar cookies, vanilla cupcakes...everything that everyone describes in their reviews. In the beginning, it really reminded me of A-Men (which I don&#x27;t care for very much), but I began doing some experimenting and found a perfect mixture :) I combine this with Givenchy Pi, and on my skin, it literally smells like warm, buttery maple syrup or cinnamon-swirl coffee cake. LoL. I went to Costco, where I know a lot of people, and everyone I hugged wanted to hang on extra long just to sniff!! I recommend this fragrance to anyone who loves sugary-sweet fragrances. It takes a unique sort of man to pull this off, but if you can, you&#x27;ll have women AND men going crazy over it :) Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell original. Bottle looked like some fragrance was missing.</li>
            <li> I tried Blue Sugar just recently for the first time and I was amazed. I like it even more than Pink Sugar. Sweet and just a little woody undertone, very sexy for both men and women. It is a little like Amen by Mugler, This gem used to be dirt cheap, but apparently they have stopped making it and the price has tripled. If you can even find it! I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t stock up on a few bottles when it was more affordable. Truly great stuff.</li>
            <li> Clearly this is what Bella smells when she smells Edward! *Seriously* I purchased this not really smelling it. I wear Pink Sugar and figured I&#x27;d get this for my boyfriend. I didn&#x27;t realize he sprayed this on and I was sniffing around in the air like, \\&quot;Wow where is that yummy smell coming from?\\&quot; I realized it was him. It smelled so so so so good on him. Sweet and masculine all at the same time like bubbling brown sugar with notes of vanilla. I will be seriously sad if they ever got rid of this scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent to own. It is sweet and light yet doesn&#x27;t smell like women&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I am buying this cologne for my Caribbean cruise and need something light and memorable and this will do the trick. Great buy!</li>
            <li> The first burst of spun sugar settles into a pleasant Cologne scent. Do use it sparingly, because it is quite strong.  Update: I had the same experience that, for the first day of using the cologne, it came out strongly hot sugar at first.  Now, it doesn&#x27;t do that, just smells soft, pleasant and slightly sweet. I highly recommend it for both sexes!</li>
            <li> Great for in the summer, very sugary, maybe a good use for parties ! Not horrible a bad product to wear !</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for about 2 years now. At first, it&#x27;s quite strong when sprayed and the smell seems off. But, once it melts into and blends with your skin it really smells YUMMY! I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a sweeter scent for men. It IS still a manly scent though!</li>
            <li> Perhaps good for a young kid ( under 13 yo ), way to sweet and unpleasant to my nose... If you&#x27;re interested my suggestion would be try it on your skin before you buy it, may be it just doesn&#x27;t work well on my skin because I have seen a lot of good reviews on it,&lt;br /&gt;reason why I bought it... I just don&#x27;t think is a good &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; blind buy.</li>
            <li> So I was dying for a sweet smelling men&#x27;s fragrance. I hate the traditional woodsy, lumberjack scents that men are usually bombarded with in the name of smelling good. So when I heard about Blue Sugar I thought I had finally found something different. Well different it certainly is. Blue Sugar is STRONG. I mean very strong. It&#x27;s rather sickeningly sweet like cane sugar and lingers for hours.&lt;br /&gt;I find one spray of it to be more than enough to get me through a shift at work. Any more and I will begin having the urge to scrub it off. I tried to pass this fragrance off on my nephew but as soon as he smelled it he said it was sweet and scrunched up his face. I suppose I&#x27;m stuck with it for now. But I will use it sparingly. It&#x27;s not a horrible scent by any means, but it can easily be sweetly overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of male knows and/or wears this cologne but once they do, they will be addicted and upon knowing the price, they will be inseparable!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells soooo good!  I get so many compliments and the hubby can&#x27;t get enough!  It smells like liquid candy, only better!</li>
            <li> The best description I can think of, YUM.&lt;br /&gt;Warm, sugar, lasts for hours, smells subtlety different each passing hour.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am female and I wear it.</li>
            <li> My husband wears it all the time. It is a fantastic scent and unlike other men&#x27;s colognes.&lt;br /&gt;He gets many compliments every time he wears it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and I love it. It has hints on the Cotten candy smell but more manly. It&#x27;s not over powering and great scent for a man.</li>
            <li> This product was grrrrrr-eat! The bottle was very nice, and it matched the scent well. It came perfectly in the box. Bought from Tuccini and it definitely was 100% real. came with the official invoice and everything. Tuccini is my jam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the scent. Starts off with mandarin, vanilla, cotton candy. Think orange cream cotton candy on a beach in the summer.Next, there&#x27;s a blast of spice followed by a very manly scent in the drydown.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars because i find no flaws whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It is very nice producte and I wish to deal with this seller again. Best of luck for all</li>
            <li> What can I say, this is a beautiful and smokey scent, can&#x27;t get enough. I love it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Unique and enticing....a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of colognes and this is among the few that stand as truly different..</li>
            <li> Sweet, spicy, masculine, delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely the best value for the haute cologne-wearing set. Compared to A*Men by Thierry Mugler, Blue Sugar wins by cost by a landslide -- though the scents are very distinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must&#x27;nt be afraid of a strong liquorice/candy top with sandalwood and vanilla drydown. You will be surprised at how it will work magic and gain you the type of attention you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sublime for mixing with heavier, woody notes like coffee, teak, tobacco, chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out! I paid 5.75 a bottle, bought 3 of them, and have had them for 4 months!</li>
            <li> This product has a amazing scent.. You will definitely be noticed!</li>
            <li> It smells like a room full of cotton candy and sugar cookies- I get compliments when I wear this but it&#x27;s so sweet that sometimes I get tired of being around myself. Even with just one spray this stuff will catch you off guard- try before you buy! Unless you want to smell like a candy shop, then just go for it!</li>
            <li> I have tons of perfume, but Aquolina is consistently great and Blue Sugar is no exception. Before purchasing this, I read hundreds of reviews claiming that it was the best and most addictive scent offered by the brand, but I was hesitant since it was labeled as a men&#x27;s cologne and I&#x27;m a girly-girl who prefers sweets. That&#x27;s what makes Blue Sugar so great - it&#x27;s the best of both worlds! Which explains why it&#x27;s such a unisex scent loved by all. On my skin it smells like fresh baked gingerbread cookies AND iced lemon cookies.  Warm, delicious, and intoxicating with a thick cotton candy background thrown in during the dry down.  My husband also loves wearing this cologne since the licorice notes really pop on his skin. This is definitely a unique scent, and it lasts up to 8 hours on my wrists which is always impressive. It&#x27;s a shame that this is discontinued, but I spent $75 for this 1.7 oz. bottle and it was worth every penny. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes sweet smelling scents, especially if you&#x27;re a fan of Pink Sugar, Gold Sugar, or any of the other amazing Aquolina options.</li>
            <li> I bought this last Christmas for my sons. It smells soooo good.  My son says when he goes to school the girls are always telling him how good he smells. When my son puts it on in the morning I can still smell it on him in the evening.  I am sensitive to a lot of colognes and perfumes but I have to say, I love the way it smells.  I purchased the Pink Sugar for myself, my daughter and my best friend. We get a lot of compliments on it. My girlfriend had me order the Blue Sugar for her sons and husband after smelling my son.</li>
            <li> I live in the Los Angeles area and it was around 80 degrees for the past few days here in the city just to give you a visual of my surrounding temp. No humidity. Nice breeze. Love LA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the fragrances being reviewed and their ranking in comparison to Blue Sugar by Aquolina. I purchased #1-7 below within the last 2 months but I&#x27;ve had the same Polo bottle for over 10 year lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut up 8 pieces of paper and sprayed each with one scent then had my girlfriend blind test me. I sprayed at 6:25pm and started writing this review at 9:25pm after giving them one more sniff. My review is based on the opening, dry down and projection within these last 3 hours only. I will also recommend (blind buy) or (try 1st) for those who care about stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 Encre Noire by Lalique&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent reminds me of something or someone from my childhood. I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it but the smell made me happy and I wanted to keep smelling it over and over. Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper.Personally, the dry down smells like you sprinkled salt n pepper on a grapefruit mixed with a WOOD undertone big time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with some reviewers and say this is an acquired taste so-to-speak and you will either LOVE it or HATE it. It is somewhat aggressive but a wonderful scent in order to beat out Hanae Mori. It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title. Simply divine smell. (Try a sampler of this 1st)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 Hanae Mori by Hanae Mori&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening to this scent is #1 on this list without a doubt but overall, the dry-down was also great but after such a magnificent opening, I felt cheated. DO NOT BE FOOLED. This parfum version is very potent and 100% authentic. The opening smelled to me like a caramelized pineapple dipped in chocolate with a hint of musk orpepper then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it. The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho. I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;m just sharing how it smelled to me. Ironicaly, I meant to buy Him by Hanae Mori but ordered this one by mistake. VERY PLEASED in my error but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this? It&#x27;s my next purchase. Great fragrance. Must buy. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 Uomo Maschino by Moschino&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A close friend recommended this one for me as he swore by it for the last 15 yrs. I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one. Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent. Good projection on this one too. Oddly, you can spray 4-5 sprays and not offend anyone because of the soft sweetness that remains throughout this scent. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Blue Sugar by Aqualina&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance. Anyway, this Blue Sugar is GREAT and a bargain bin special at just $17/1.7 oz . It opens like cotton candy or a slight bubble gum vibe but then drys down into a yellow cake batter or caramelized vanilla/sugar mixture. Amazing stuff for this price. Very well done for a cheapy. Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents. Go easy on the sprays in the heat tho. Can&#x27;t lose. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5 The One by Dolce &amp; Gabbana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept. It smells so, so, so, delicious that it even beats out Blue Sugar in smell but the dry down from D&amp;G for ($52) from a deisgner house is just pathetic. If you give someone a hug after 4 hrs, they might still smell it on you but you have togo 4-6 sprays on this just to make it through a an 8hr work day. The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 sprays WILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day. Damn good smell tho. If D&amp;G 1 had the projection of Encre Noire, D&amp;G would be #1 HANDS DOWN it smells that good. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bias toward fragrances that I have smelled before that mimic other fragrance houses. For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before. It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top. It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for. Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.This is another acquired taste. I can see why many reviewers rave about it, and I can see why some do not like it. I lean more toward not liking it but the dry-down is really nice and it projects very well. You get 6-8 hrs on the skin easily with this one and 24hrs on ur clothing. I can always smell it on my clothes the next day. Easy on the sprayer. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#7 Silver by Jack Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients. Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc. Poor projection after 4 hrs and semi floral on the dry-down. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#8 Polo by Ralph Lauren&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic. The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion. I&#x27;m over it and so are the perfumers of the world because there are not many scents on the market like Polo&#x27;s green bottle original scent and noone is trying to mimic it anytime soon. I can&#x27;t believe this thing is not a parfum. It projects like a BEAST. You know the deal guys...Polo stinks so good if you like it and it stinks so bad when you don&#x27;t. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of how opposites attract, my GF chose my #5, 6 and 8 as her top three best smelling scents respectively. I buy cologne because I love the way it smells on me. I do not buy it to impress females. If you are the type of person who buys based on what women like, then you better try some blind tests with some women you know because you may be surprised to find out that they may like the scents you don&#x27;t and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this was so long people. Hope it was helpful at least.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of this one by Aquolina. This is my third bottle and still looking for more. It is a very strong but deliciously sweet/gourmand fragrance. Wear it with caution, two sprays go a long way! Complain: The seal on my packaging was broken, as if it was previously used, and I ordered a NEW perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. It blends perfectly with my husbands body chemistry and it lasts more than 12 hours. This is my husbands top 5 favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> this may be for men but I wear it and I LOVE IT. It smells so so so good. I get a ton of compliments from both men AND women. It&#x27;s crazy how when I wear this how many guys comment on how good I smell or they just seem in a better mood to see me. I didn&#x27;t think I would like this but it&#x27;s my new go-to perfume and I hope they never stop selling this. It&#x27;s like pink sugar only what I call the more &#x27;grown up&#x27; version.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE pink Sugar, so when I saw that they made a scent for men, I bought it! When I actually smelled it I was so disappointed. This smells NOTHING at all like Pink Sugar, more like ANGEL which I think smells like body odor. Stay away if you think this is going to be a fresh clean scent, unless you actually like Angel, do NOT buy this.</li>
            <li> Did you hear that? That was the sound of my panties hitting the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not for everyone- it&#x27;s incredibly powerful and has a very strong cedar/pine scent at first. I personally love that- it smells like the best part of winter at first... then it gets lighter and sweeter. One spritz is all you need- that&#x27;s no joke. It pairs very well with my Pink Sugar that HE loves so much on me. I spritz mine on my pillow and blue sugar on his- our bed smells AMAZING. When we wear them together they just GO together.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Blue Sugar!  I have worn Pink Sugar for women for about 5 years, and was so excited to see a men&#x27;s version.  It smells sweet w/ a hint of pepper/musk.  Can&#x27;t really explain it, but love it on my man!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother for christmas. It&#x27;s great. It smells like pine trees and candy, sweet but masculine enough. He wears it all the time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I have received while wearing this stuff.  One guy said I smelled like \\&quot;cotton candy\\&quot;.  Another said I smelled like \\&quot;baked goods\\&quot;.  A girl asked me if the scent was from Bath &amp; Body works but I simply smiled and told her it was called \\&quot;Blue Sugar\\&quot;.  To me, it smells like a cinnamon bun. If you like sweet smelling colognes (but not overly sweet) and receiving compliments than this cologne is definitely for you! The reason i took off the one star is perhaps because I had higher expectations as surprising as that sounds.  It smells sweet but I wish it smelled a little bit sweeter and little less spicy.</li>
            <li> This product reasonable priced....guess that is the reason for its lack of staying power.  Could not detect this spray shortly after application.  Will have to go back to expensive perfumes!</li>
            <li> I love it so much, one of my favorite perfume smells good and i got allot of a nice complements.</li>
            <li> Some people say this smells like freshly baked cookies. I say it smells like that, but with a lot of birthday-cake in it. It&#x27;s quite a strong scent and definitely lasts, with the right amount of silage and projection for this kind of a smell. It&#x27;s quite unique, which is why I love it. If you&#x27;re looking for a really classic male scent: anything with hardwood, vanilla, whiskey, citrus, grapefruit, patchouli, anything traditional, then you&#x27;d better go elsewhere. This is in its own class. It smells delicious and you will get lots of compliments, and it&#x27;s cheap to boot. The 1.7 will last you at least a year.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the original Pink Sugar &amp; after reading the reviews for Blue Sugar I decided to give a try and I almost LOVE it more than PS! It is so nice, smells sweet &amp; a little outdoorsy....and I really think it is more for a women than a man....my boyfriend loves Pink Sugar on me, but he isn&#x27;t that thrilled with this as much, but I love it! I catch myself smelling my wrists just to breate it in and the smells seems to last a long time! I am going to buy again just to stock up! Love love love it!</li>
