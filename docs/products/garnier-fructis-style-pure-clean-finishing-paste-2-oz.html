            <li>the look after using clay wax and hairspray on the rest of my hair to give it a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not the best hold, but does a great job finishing the look!</li>
            <li>Great paste.  </li>
            <li>Works great to combat frizz.</li>
            <li>I also use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Wax Works, also a great product for definition, weight, and hold, but I prefer the feeling and texture of this paste</li>
            <li>I was staying in and didn&#x27;t need to look great,</li>
            <li>Great pomade for texture.</li>
            <li>Great product, nothing compares</li>
            <li>not too happy with this.</li>

            <li>I like buying it from Amazon because they have a great price</li>

            <li>It also gives your hair a very nice texture...</li>
            <li>Your search for the perfect product may be over. :)</li>
            <li>Garnier has many wonderful products, this one is another one I&#x27;ve added to my list</li>
            <li>Just as advertised not sticky, good smell, great price.</li>
            <li>Pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good control.</li>
            <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t get rid of the flyaways</li>
            <li>This paste is wonderful, it is both light and malleable.</li>
            <li>This product gives my hair great body and a nice conditioned shine.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell good and doesn&#x27;t hold my son&#x27;s hair style.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, the texture and smoothness of my hair after using this was extremely good.</li>
            <li>Product came in good time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product, at a very good price, and worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking for something better, I picked this up, and have been really happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>then bought \\&quot;Got2b InPlay Paste\\&quot; and am very satisfied with the hold.</li>
            <li>I find this to be a great product after years of trying to find something comparable to Sebastian Molding Mud after they changed the original formula (original formula was the best hair product ever).  </li>
            <li>love the neutral scent!</li>
            <li>My husband uses this on his hair (as do I) and we both love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - get it!</li>
            <li>Great finishing product to smooth hair while adding shine.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff...</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice and lightweight...  </li>
            <li>Good scent, easy to apply, works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product by far...</li>
            <li>I found that it does an excellent job at combating humidity and allows the hair to flow naturally after use.</li>
            <li>Best paste I have found, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky and is a soft hold.  </li>
            <li>and I have very fine hair...</li>
            <li>Did seem to help the fly aways when first applied.</li>
            <li>Scent is very light, like a lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product is very light, non sticky and non flaky.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t go more than an hour or two without my style falling apart.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite finishing cream for his hair.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product for just that.  </li>
            <li>I never intended for this to be my end-game product, just a temporary fix while I researched more options.&lt;br</li>
            <li>*!\\&quot; was simply the best way to sum up the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>No complaints here :-)</li>
            <li>and I have a really cute style.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Consort extra hold hair spray, 8.3oz]] and find that it works the best for this purpose.</li>
            <li>He says that he does not like this product because it does not hold his hair for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I just give it a 3 because it doesn&#x27;t work the way it&#x27;s supposed to, even though it&#x27;s a lovely product.</li>
            <li>I would brand it more as a texturizes than something to holding a style like a gel or spray.</li>
            <li>Its ok</li>
            <li>I love it and would suggest it to others.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing product, but my boyfriend uses a lot more than I do and it looks like he&#x27;s using a styling product -</li>
            <li>and I think it does a pretty good job, plus I love that it can be applied to damp hair unlike Wax Works.  </li>
            <li>Hold and control could be better, but pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this product I first purchased it in the store, then went on line and stat purchasing it here.</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair that is lighter in color, so it&#x27;s perfect for not making me look greasy.</li>
            <li>I think it would be excellent for a fine-haired wavy that wanted glossy loose waves.</li>
            <li>great, soft feel.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is so light.</li>
            <li>This paste is great and leaves hair shiny and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Aside from the strength issue, the product does leave a very light, clean feel to the hair, unlike stronger products.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful and the price is extremely affordable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bonus: it washes off your hands and out of your hair easily too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>Seems to do the trick, yet washes out easy -</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t weigh it down and gave me the best hold with clean feel.</li>
            <li>I use it to smooth my hair before curling.</li>
            <li>Light control and no scent.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>But after a while, they are up and flying freely.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clean and washes out easily with shampoo.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t damage your scalp.</li>
            <li>During the Great Recession, it was time to cut back on excess expenses...  </li>
            <li>So for light hold, defining, and frizz control, this is a go-to product.</li>
            <li>I have medium short very layered hair, and the best this stuff does it add shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very economical compared to salon brand pastes.  </li>
            <li>dry hair, however, it&#x27;s really best for people who want to spike, although it doesn&#x27;t offer much hold.</li>
            <li>A small dab rubbed on my fingers and finger though my hair and its perfect.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked the best curly it had ever looked, and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of curly girl products in the past.</li>
            <li>First of all I love Garnier products.</li>
            <li>The only good thing it has going for it is its light, clean</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that could give some light hold and make my very stick-straight hair behave better.  </li>
            <li>Try looking at Hanz de fuko who makes excellent natural hair styling products that are on par with American Crew if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product 4 stars</li>
            <li>Was reluctant at first to switch, but after testing a handful of store bought brands, finally found one that is a great substitution for what I used to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find two things to be true; 1.</li>
            <li>Which secondary product to choose is up to you, but I find that the airy quality and rigidity of hairspray serves this purpose best.</li>
            <li>And I keep discovering new ways to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, 2b/3a wavy/curly chin-length hair.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to say I won&#x27;t be trying any other products for some time to come.</li>
            <li>I had a mild folliculitis for years that my herbalist advised was caused by hair product: gels, mousse, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great styling paste without all the creepy ingredients that aren&#x27;t good for one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it was a really mild level of hold, just to help prevent frizz.</li>
            <li>This product will start off with a fairly solid hold that transforms to a nice, light finish.  </li>
            <li>It works perfect in giving my hair that extra hold to not go flat or get pushed by the wind.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t make my hair crispy &amp; goes on pretty clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look great with little effort.</li>
            <li>elementary school PASTE.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that problem with this stuff and the price is right to boot.  </li>
            <li>Just the right separation to my hair without the goo or</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe that something this light, effective, nice smelling and natural feeling is also organic.</li>
            <li>This product would also be useful for those who blow dry to style to add a nice sheen to the hair.</li>
            <li>For fine hair this offers no hold and basically is a leave in conditioner without leaving hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Paste is exactly what it feel like,</li>
            <li>they were fast!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the strength to hold my hair when it gets longer, but for the first month after a haircut I swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hold well when I first put it on</li>
            <li>I love this paste, because it gives the ends of my layers some definition without making my hair feel all gross and sticky.</li>
            <li>Love it for my short &#x27;do!</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it claims to do</li>
            <li>I then switched to a hair spray, which was much lighter, and subsequently held the hair in position much better.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural American Crew Fiber kind of paste this is not for you.</li>
            <li>I like the natural look and feel if provides and the fact that it is a natural, safe product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl with stick straight hair, so when I cut it short I needed something to help give it more texture.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash the excess off your hands and the round container is easy to store or toss in a bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We can already see that many had bought this product looking for a high hold paste but were later dismayed.</li>
            <li>This has a nice smell and smooth texture but the hold is pretty weak.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in hoping to find a more natural solution to other products filled with leads, chemicals, and toxic solutions added to it.</li>
            <li>True, this doesn&#x27;t offer much hold, but it does leave the hair amazingly soft - when used on damp hair.</li>
            <li>The one area it falls short is that it claims to have strong hold.  </li>
            <li>have a very short layered style and this product does a beautiful job of adding body, definition and shine without being stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice on my medium-short, fine hair and and will not be using it a third time.  </li>
            <li>This helps control the little frizz from letting my hairdryer on its own.</li>
            <li>This stuff provides absolutely ZERO hold.</li>
            <li>This product is light enough to help you maintain that hard-earned shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(no chick wants to touch your spiked hair).  </li>
            <li>Dint feel like this product did much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely ZERO stickiness.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s reasonably priced -- really what all these products should be charging.</li>
            <li>Not sticky, and it holds really well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>The second important part is the indication that the product \\&quot;accentuates</li>
            <li>Perhaps if a person just wants a bedhead look?</li>
            <li>Plus, I still like this so much that I&#x27;m stocking up on it, as I think it&#x27;s no longer being made.</li>
            <li>If it was designed to accentuate layers then it is probably not going to perform very well at spiking your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very flexiable.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it had more of a clay-wax hold in terms of keeping shape but still being flexible, it does not really give volume or lift.</li>
            <li>It works best on dry or slightly damp short hair.  </li>
            <li>Works best for me if a small amount is placed in the palm of my hand and warmed up a little before working into my hair while it&#x27;s still damp.</li>
            <li>Finally someone got it right!</li>
            <li>Also, if you don&#x27;t warm this enough, on dry hair, it will clump and look like lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then I found this Pure Clean pastes and my decade long search is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this would work for someone with thick hair, but it worked great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>As a male, who has tried many different kinds of hair gel, hair sprays etc.</li>
            <li>have long, naturally curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I use this paste nearly every day on my VERY curly hair.  </li>
            <li>, this isn&#x27;t a firm hold more of a shining finishing product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get gross like some do - and it holds pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>But for thick hair - you know the kind that resembles a football helmet in the morning?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li>but it is a very natural hold..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happily surprised by this one!  </li>
            <li>it usually takes more than one product to achieve a desirable result.</li>
            <li>In this way the product does exactly what it says it does, and this layered look will hold for 24 hours, but only if you remember it is a &#x27;finishing&#x27; paste.</li>
            <li>It adds tremendous depth to your hair by adding volume and creating a structured fluff.</li>
            <li>I would say this is fine for soft/curly hairs that need just a little something to hold in place.  </li>
            <li>It is less effective on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Most products either leave my hair sticky or hard as as rock.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals in this.  </li>
            <li>part is it feels natural and not like a porcupine.</li>
            <li>light and not too heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>This is a low-hold product as far as pastes go.</li>
            <li>I tried this paste to see how well it would hold my hair being as it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re after the spikey look or a product that holds your hair in the exact position all day long...</li>
            <li>It leaves a soft pliable feel.</li>
            <li>For Asian straight hair, it does not work.</li>
            <li>It offers the control I want without being too tacky, when I don&#x27;t want to use a wax.</li>
            <li>Your hair is just extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and I like that it uses naturally derived ingredients.</li>
            <li>My hair stays where I want it, has a lot of volume, but is completely touchable and natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I started using it a year ago and nothing else works nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>The texture is really soft - almost that of a thick lotion more than a paste - but that means you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think it is much cheaper on Amazon than it is in other places.</li>
            <li>This is mainly for people who want an anti frizz natural product that will get the job done with lasting effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair products in my search and most have disappointed.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>&quot; Most hair gels are so heavy that the hair actually sticks together in &#x27;spikes&#x27; &#x27;clumps&#x27; or what have you, while the finishing paste actually pushes the hair away from itself and prevents clumping.</li>
            <li>Once the product dried, what I got was a head full of embarrassing flakes.</li>
            <li>Being a curly girl, I have a lot of frizz, and I live in the humid deep South, which doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I have short asian hair and this product really doesn&#x27;t have any strength to provide any hold.  </li>
            <li>I put it on while my hair is wet and slick my hair straight down, but it develops a nice shiny bounce.  </li>
            <li>Garnier should definitely make a clearly understandable label for this product.</li>
            <li>Ever since I left my hairdresser and decided to manage my own hair I have been searching for a product that would not leave any heavy residue in my hair, a product that does not cause embarrassing flakes and something that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling brittle and hard.</li>
            <li>One class of product was malleable but heavy, and the other was light but rigid.</li>
            <li>A finishing paste or cream is for styles that are loose and lush and just need some fly-away or frizz taming.</li>
            <li>I was first attracted to the \\&quot;green / natural ingredients\\&quot; aspect because I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes other product will give me acne on my scalp.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just incredible</li>
            <li> the look after using clay wax and hairspray on the rest of my hair to give it a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not the best hold, but does a great job finishing the look!</li>
            <li> Great paste.  </li>
            <li> Works great to combat frizz.</li>
            <li> I also use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Wax Works, also a great product for definition, weight, and hold, but I prefer the feeling and texture of this paste</li>
            <li> I was staying in and didn&#x27;t need to look great,</li>
            <li> Great pomade for texture.</li>
            <li> Great product, nothing compares</li>
            <li> not too happy with this.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff and it works great.</li>
            <li> which is great.  </li>
            <li> Works great on my curly hair</li>
            <li> It works great for both</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells great in a barely-noticeable way.</li>
            <li> Great product, Iwill purchase again,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> I like buying it from Amazon because they have a great price</li>
            <li> great paste for my husbands curly hair and beard.</li>
            <li> It also gives your hair a very nice texture...</li>
            <li> Your search for the perfect product may be over. :)</li>
            <li> Garnier has many wonderful products, this one is another one I&#x27;ve added to my list</li>
            <li> Just as advertised not sticky, good smell, great price.</li>
            <li> Pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good control.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t get rid of the flyaways</li>
            <li> This paste is wonderful, it is both light and malleable.</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair great body and a nice conditioned shine.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell good and doesn&#x27;t hold my son&#x27;s hair style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the texture and smoothness of my hair after using this was extremely good.</li>
            <li> Product came in good time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product, at a very good price, and worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking for something better, I picked this up, and have been really happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> then bought \\&quot;Got2b InPlay Paste\\&quot; and am very satisfied with the hold.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a great product after years of trying to find something comparable to Sebastian Molding Mud after they changed the original formula (original formula was the best hair product ever).  </li>
            <li> love the neutral scent!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his hair (as do I) and we both love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - get it!</li>
            <li> Great finishing product to smooth hair while adding shine.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff...</li>
            <li> It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and lightweight...  </li>
            <li> Good scent, easy to apply, works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product by far...</li>
            <li> I found that it does an excellent job at combating humidity and allows the hair to flow naturally after use.</li>
            <li> Best paste I have found, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky and is a soft hold.  </li>
            <li> and I have very fine hair...</li>
            <li> Did seem to help the fly aways when first applied.</li>
            <li> Scent is very light, like a lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product is very light, non sticky and non flaky.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go more than an hour or two without my style falling apart.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite finishing cream for his hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for just that.  </li>
            <li> I never intended for this to be my end-game product, just a temporary fix while I researched more options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> *!\\&quot; was simply the best way to sum up the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> No complaints here :-)</li>
            <li> and I have a really cute style.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Consort extra hold hair spray, 8.3oz]] and find that it works the best for this purpose.</li>
            <li> He says that he does not like this product because it does not hold his hair for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I just give it a 3 because it doesn&#x27;t work the way it&#x27;s supposed to, even though it&#x27;s a lovely product.</li>
            <li> I would brand it more as a texturizes than something to holding a style like a gel or spray.</li>
            <li> Its ok</li>
            <li> I love it and would suggest it to others.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing product, but my boyfriend uses a lot more than I do and it looks like he&#x27;s using a styling product -</li>
            <li> and I think it does a pretty good job, plus I love that it can be applied to damp hair unlike Wax Works.  </li>
            <li> Hold and control could be better, but pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product I first purchased it in the store, then went on line and stat purchasing it here.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair that is lighter in color, so it&#x27;s perfect for not making me look greasy.</li>
            <li> I think it would be excellent for a fine-haired wavy that wanted glossy loose waves.</li>
            <li> great, soft feel.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is so light.</li>
            <li> This paste is great and leaves hair shiny and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Aside from the strength issue, the product does leave a very light, clean feel to the hair, unlike stronger products.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful and the price is extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus: it washes off your hands and out of your hair easily too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick, yet washes out easy -</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t weigh it down and gave me the best hold with clean feel.</li>
            <li> I use it to smooth my hair before curling.</li>
            <li> Light control and no scent.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> But after a while, they are up and flying freely.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clean and washes out easily with shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t damage your scalp.</li>
            <li> During the Great Recession, it was time to cut back on excess expenses...  </li>
            <li> So for light hold, defining, and frizz control, this is a go-to product.</li>
            <li> I have medium short very layered hair, and the best this stuff does it add shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very economical compared to salon brand pastes.  </li>
            <li> dry hair, however, it&#x27;s really best for people who want to spike, although it doesn&#x27;t offer much hold.</li>
            <li> A small dab rubbed on my fingers and finger though my hair and its perfect.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked the best curly it had ever looked, and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of curly girl products in the past.</li>
            <li> First of all I love Garnier products.</li>
            <li> The only good thing it has going for it is its light, clean</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that could give some light hold and make my very stick-straight hair behave better.  </li>
            <li> Try looking at Hanz de fuko who makes excellent natural hair styling products that are on par with American Crew if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product 4 stars</li>
            <li> Was reluctant at first to switch, but after testing a handful of store bought brands, finally found one that is a great substitution for what I used to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find two things to be true; 1.</li>
            <li> Which secondary product to choose is up to you, but I find that the airy quality and rigidity of hairspray serves this purpose best.</li>
            <li> And I keep discovering new ways to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, 2b/3a wavy/curly chin-length hair.</li>
            <li> and I am happy to say I won&#x27;t be trying any other products for some time to come.</li>
            <li> I had a mild folliculitis for years that my herbalist advised was caused by hair product: gels, mousse, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great styling paste without all the creepy ingredients that aren&#x27;t good for one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it was a really mild level of hold, just to help prevent frizz.</li>
            <li> This product will start off with a fairly solid hold that transforms to a nice, light finish.  </li>
            <li> It works perfect in giving my hair that extra hold to not go flat or get pushed by the wind.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t make my hair crispy &amp; goes on pretty clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look great with little effort.</li>
            <li> elementary school PASTE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that problem with this stuff and the price is right to boot.  </li>
            <li> Just the right separation to my hair without the goo or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that something this light, effective, nice smelling and natural feeling is also organic.</li>
            <li> This product would also be useful for those who blow dry to style to add a nice sheen to the hair.</li>
            <li> For fine hair this offers no hold and basically is a leave in conditioner without leaving hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Paste is exactly what it feel like,</li>
            <li> they were fast!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the strength to hold my hair when it gets longer, but for the first month after a haircut I swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold well when I first put it on</li>
            <li> I love this paste, because it gives the ends of my layers some definition without making my hair feel all gross and sticky.</li>
            <li> Love it for my short &#x27;do!</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it claims to do</li>
            <li> I then switched to a hair spray, which was much lighter, and subsequently held the hair in position much better.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural American Crew Fiber kind of paste this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I like the natural look and feel if provides and the fact that it is a natural, safe product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl with stick straight hair, so when I cut it short I needed something to help give it more texture.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash the excess off your hands and the round container is easy to store or toss in a bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We can already see that many had bought this product looking for a high hold paste but were later dismayed.</li>
            <li> This has a nice smell and smooth texture but the hold is pretty weak.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in hoping to find a more natural solution to other products filled with leads, chemicals, and toxic solutions added to it.</li>
            <li> True, this doesn&#x27;t offer much hold, but it does leave the hair amazingly soft - when used on damp hair.</li>
            <li> The one area it falls short is that it claims to have strong hold.  </li>
            <li> have a very short layered style and this product does a beautiful job of adding body, definition and shine without being stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice on my medium-short, fine hair and and will not be using it a third time.  </li>
            <li> This helps control the little frizz from letting my hairdryer on its own.</li>
            <li> This stuff provides absolutely ZERO hold.</li>
            <li> This product is light enough to help you maintain that hard-earned shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (no chick wants to touch your spiked hair).  </li>
            <li> Dint feel like this product did much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely ZERO stickiness.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s reasonably priced -- really what all these products should be charging.</li>
            <li> Not sticky, and it holds really well.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> The second important part is the indication that the product \\&quot;accentuates</li>
            <li> Perhaps if a person just wants a bedhead look?</li>
            <li> Plus, I still like this so much that I&#x27;m stocking up on it, as I think it&#x27;s no longer being made.</li>
            <li> If it was designed to accentuate layers then it is probably not going to perform very well at spiking your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very flexiable.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it had more of a clay-wax hold in terms of keeping shape but still being flexible, it does not really give volume or lift.</li>
            <li> It works best on dry or slightly damp short hair.  </li>
            <li> Works best for me if a small amount is placed in the palm of my hand and warmed up a little before working into my hair while it&#x27;s still damp.</li>
            <li> Finally someone got it right!</li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t warm this enough, on dry hair, it will clump and look like lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I found this Pure Clean pastes and my decade long search is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this would work for someone with thick hair, but it worked great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> As a male, who has tried many different kinds of hair gel, hair sprays etc.</li>
            <li> have long, naturally curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I use this paste nearly every day on my VERY curly hair.  </li>
            <li> , this isn&#x27;t a firm hold more of a shining finishing product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get gross like some do - and it holds pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> But for thick hair - you know the kind that resembles a football helmet in the morning?  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> but it is a very natural hold..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happily surprised by this one!  </li>
            <li> it usually takes more than one product to achieve a desirable result.</li>
            <li> In this way the product does exactly what it says it does, and this layered look will hold for 24 hours, but only if you remember it is a &#x27;finishing&#x27; paste.</li>
            <li> It adds tremendous depth to your hair by adding volume and creating a structured fluff.</li>
            <li> I would say this is fine for soft/curly hairs that need just a little something to hold in place.  </li>
            <li> It is less effective on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Most products either leave my hair sticky or hard as as rock.  </li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals in this.  </li>
            <li> part is it feels natural and not like a porcupine.</li>
            <li> light and not too heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> This is a low-hold product as far as pastes go.</li>
            <li> I tried this paste to see how well it would hold my hair being as it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re after the spikey look or a product that holds your hair in the exact position all day long...</li>
            <li> It leaves a soft pliable feel.</li>
            <li> For Asian straight hair, it does not work.</li>
            <li> It offers the control I want without being too tacky, when I don&#x27;t want to use a wax.</li>
            <li> Your hair is just extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> and I like that it uses naturally derived ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair stays where I want it, has a lot of volume, but is completely touchable and natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I started using it a year ago and nothing else works nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> The texture is really soft - almost that of a thick lotion more than a paste - but that means you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t think it is much cheaper on Amazon than it is in other places.</li>
            <li> This is mainly for people who want an anti frizz natural product that will get the job done with lasting effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair products in my search and most have disappointed.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> &quot; Most hair gels are so heavy that the hair actually sticks together in &#x27;spikes&#x27; &#x27;clumps&#x27; or what have you, while the finishing paste actually pushes the hair away from itself and prevents clumping.</li>
            <li> Once the product dried, what I got was a head full of embarrassing flakes.</li>
            <li> Being a curly girl, I have a lot of frizz, and I live in the humid deep South, which doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I have short asian hair and this product really doesn&#x27;t have any strength to provide any hold.  </li>
            <li> I put it on while my hair is wet and slick my hair straight down, but it develops a nice shiny bounce.  </li>
            <li> Garnier should definitely make a clearly understandable label for this product.</li>
            <li> Ever since I left my hairdresser and decided to manage my own hair I have been searching for a product that would not leave any heavy residue in my hair, a product that does not cause embarrassing flakes and something that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling brittle and hard.</li>
            <li> One class of product was malleable but heavy, and the other was light but rigid.</li>
            <li> A finishing paste or cream is for styles that are loose and lush and just need some fly-away or frizz taming.</li>
            <li> I was first attracted to the \\&quot;green / natural ingredients\\&quot; aspect because I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes other product will give me acne on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The key is to choose the right combination of items to make up for these common weaknesses.</li>
            <li> If half your hair is wet and half is dry, the dry pieces actually take on MORE frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much either, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick &amp; I have short hair like Halle Berry short with a razor cut.</li>
            <li> It contains entirely too much moisture and yet has very little hold to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applying this to my hair has no apparent effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually flat iron my hair or anything</li>
            <li> Without it, his hair looks less professional looking (for his job) and frizzier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other waxes and products, but this one is my fall back as it is easy to use and hardly noticeable when being worn.</li>
            <li> me, I wet my hair with a spray bottle or apply just after a shower, do  a quick and moderate towel dry, apply about a quarter-sized blob of this paste, work it through my hair , brush it through and then hair dry with a tight round brush.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I used hair gels, but many of them are thick and heavy and weigh the hair down upon application.</li>
            <li> I use it probably 90% of the time over the other more expensive option in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> And while it is named a finishing paste, I find I can use it as my only hair product, and apply it on toweled dry hair (I don&#x27;t blow dry).  </li>
            <li> When it dried, it was not stiff or sticky, and I had glossy, perfectly-shaped curls that didn&#x27;t frizz all day.</li>
            <li> It is somewhere between a gel and a harder paste like American Crew Fiber in thickness.</li>
            <li> long hold.</li>
            <li> long as this paste is on the market, I have no plans to use anything</li>
            <li> I used to use gel when I had long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with hair about 4-5 inches long</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and find that this keeps it manageable, but doesn&#x27;t really do much in the way of styling it.</li>
            <li> If this is strong then weak must be plain water.</li>
            <li> I prefer the dry look.</li>
            <li> Once it is completely dry</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair like some gel or mousse products.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this while your hair is either somewhat damp or all the way dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably 30 different hair products (paste, gel, spray) over the last 10 years or so to try and tame the hair monster.  </li>
            <li> It is unbelievable how soft this makes my hair and it holds</li>
            <li> I use this to hold loose up-dos in place, and to bring definition to my curls.</li>
            <li> This paste doesn&#x27;t small bad and isn&#x27;t sticky, but does absolutely nothing for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Just a little FYI (since products work differently on different hair types &amp; hair textures  </li>
            <li> I would have to say that is stretching it a little (or maybe I&#x27;m not using enough of the product)</li>
            <li> My hair wont stay like that all day long, but a simple brush through or even raking my hands through will usually fix things up</li>
            <li> Then brush it out a few minutes later.  </li>
            <li> And I would imagine that if you have thin, straight hair, this probably isn&#x27;t for you either.  </li>
            <li> This is the only paste that I use for my disheveled messy hair look.  </li>
            <li> I got this at a local drug store to see if it would help tame some errant hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, just the other day I didn&#x27;t feel like blow drying my hair, so I took a bit of paste, rubbed it on both hands, and scrunched my wet curls.</li>
            <li> I have used several containers of this product, and highly recommend it once your mustache or beard length start to become difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> My hair is currently in a pixie cut, so anything sticky makes it look flat and ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I use with other Garnier Fructis products</li>
            <li> Works just as well as any conventional paste product.  </li>
            <li> It is the least waxy of the paste products I have tried on my short hair.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to scented products, but this product is much less irritating.</li>
            <li> This gives you both, but does NOT flatten or weigh down the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lite weight paste doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, or leave it greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my hair and comb it through evenly, laying my hair down with it, I style it &amp; mold it and usually tie it up with a scarf and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this (and the previous variation of this) for close to a decade.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> However, it lacked the rigidity that hair spray had previously offered.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of expensive product, I highly recommend this as an alternative.</li>
            <li> But I also love to chop my hair off to chin length every few years, so they&#x27;re a necessary evil.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair &amp; while it is wet</li>
            <li> My hair failed to be texturized throughout the day, so I had to invest in a new hair product.</li>
            <li> , this won&#x27;t hold your hair in one place in wind like some products do, but it will allow you to take thick hair and blow dry it without it frizzing</li>
            <li> Sometimes I pat just a little bit on the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> I just kinda tussle it a little bit with my fingers</li>
            <li> I wish it were just a little bit stronger of a hold.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> For people who say this product has no hold and to use hairspray are missing its purpose.</li>
            <li> Some pastes absolutely destroy shine</li>
            <li> too heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I often use this in conjunction with a few drops of sunflower oil all over to control frizz.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$$$.</li>
            <li> and it only got worse.  </li>
            <li> few products do what they claim to do, and 2.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a drier pomade/putty that doesn&#x27;t give your hair a childish sheen, avoid this stuff.</li>
            <li> For heavy hold, find something else.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look shellacked or heavy.</li>
            <li> , this is not going to past your hair down like a pomade or gel, so don&#x27;t get the impression that it is going to hold hair like that.  </li>
            <li> This product tames hair a little but has very little hold.</li>
            <li> Not strong or sticky at all.  </li>
            <li> It holds a very slight lemony/lime smell, which fades almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how cheap this stuff is compared to other products that are just horrible on my hair..</li>
            <li> This product has very little hold.</li>
            <li> but I usually need to reapply if I&#x27;m going out at night.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually swear, but the title of my review, \\&quot;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Using a small amount to define curls.  </li>
            <li> From the descriptions, people are using this for the wrong purpose and becoming frustrated because they&#x27;re not getting the results they desire.</li>
            <li> I have very thick dark hair that will also frizz some at the thought of humidity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a product that allows me to scrunch my wavy hair without the hard crunchy feel.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and won&#x27;t make your hair hard.</li>
            <li> This paste is the lightest, least imposing product of its type.</li>
            <li> I use oils to condition, so I know it should work at least a bit.  </li>
            <li> Meaning, that you should be using a secondary product to reinforce the hold.  </li>
            <li> However, on damp hair, this left my hair extremely soft and smoothed, although my curls weren&#x27;t terrible</li>
            <li> There have been a lot of fairly negative reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re looking for a thick, pasty product that will mold your hair into place, this is NOT THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I think some of the reviewers had unrealistic expectations of the product.</li>
            <li> Its awful, and quite disappointing, as I am usually very pleased with Garnier products.</li>
            <li> Not only does it hold my hair all day, but it&#x27;s impossible to tell that there is any product in my hair once it dries.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and dissipates.</li>
            <li> So weak as to be unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great for frizz control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember, if you look for one product that does it all, be prepared to be disappointed with almost every single product you try, because they all have shortcomings in regards to hold, malleability, or weight.</li>
            <li> THAT product was awful, for lots of reasons, the main one being it felt like sticky glue on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it as a base before applying expensive American Crew Fiber when I want to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have thick or difficult hair, this stuff is useless.</li>
            <li> This “finishing paste” has no hold and gives my hair a wet glossy finish which I hate.</li>
            <li> It might have been silly to think a $5 product could replace a $23 one, but I figured I&#x27;d try.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> I hate product that is too stiff with its hold or goopy or whatever you want to call it.  </li>
            <li> I have bought the expensive brands but for the price and value you cannot beat this!</li>
            <li> Utterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once I had applied the product through my hair and went about through the day I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HATE hair products.</li>
            <li> Hate hate hate them.</li>
            <li> It did a terrible job, I would not recommend it to anyone who is trying to style their hair to hold.</li>
            <li> and it was awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Horrid. I had to throw this product away. Paste is exactly what it feel like, elementary school PASTE. Its awful, and quite disappointing, as I am usually very pleased with Garnier products.</li>
            <li> This stuff provides absolutely ZERO hold. I couldn&#x27;t go more than an hour or two without my style falling apart. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money. Go with L&#x27;Oreal Hair Putty instead. Trust me on this.</li>
            <li> Great paste.  No harsh chemicals in this.  I had a mild folliculitis for years that my herbalist advised was caused by hair product: gels, mousse, etc. ..when I switched to this product, the irritation was gone in 48hours and has not returned!  I highly recommend this product for sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> For people who say this product has no hold and to use hairspray are missing its purpose. Its not supposed to feel greasy/thick. Its supposed to add strength and hold without that feeling. It works perfect in giving my hair that extra hold to not go flat or get pushed by the wind.&lt;br /&gt;Best part is it feels natural and not like a porcupine.</li>
            <li> Utterly disappointed. This product essentially does nothing. I understand this isn’t a pomade although it looks identical to their pomade paste.  This “finishing paste” has no hold and gives my hair a wet glossy finish which I hate. I use pastes so it doesn’t look like a product is in my hair.  Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this (and the previous variation of this) for close to a decade. Pleasant to use. No stickiness. Makes my hair look great with little effort. Not only does it hold my hair all day, but it&#x27;s impossible to tell that there is any product in my hair once it dries.</li>
            <li> Great finishing product to smooth hair while adding shine. Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Nice stuff...light and not too heavy or sticky. Good product.</li>
            <li> Prior to trying this finishing paste, I&#x27;d been using a paste I&#x27;d picked up at Master Cuts. THAT product was awful, for lots of reasons, the main one being it felt like sticky glue on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for something better, I picked this up, and have been really happy with the results.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  NO funky fragrance. It holds a very slight lemony/lime smell, which fades almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) ZERO STICKINESS. My hair is currently in a pixie cut, so anything sticky makes it look flat and ridiculous. What you&#x27;re after with a pixie is a controlled messiness, and some body. This gives you both, but does NOT flatten or weigh down the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Let&#x27;s the shine come through. Some pastes absolutely destroy shine you work at getting when you use specialty shampoos and conditioners. This product is light enough to help you maintain that hard-earned shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Good control. Holds my short hair in place, without giving a helmet-head look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product, at a very good price, and worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am extremely sensitive to scented products, but this product is much less irritating. I use it to smooth my hair before curling.</li>
            <li> This paste is the lightest, least imposing product of its type. The smell is subtle and dissipates. The texture is really soft - almost that of a thick lotion more than a paste - but that means you don&#x27;t need a lot. If you want drier looking hair that doesn&#x27;t look over-produced and sticky, then this is your stuff. I have short fine hair that is lighter in color, so it&#x27;s perfect for not making me look greasy. It&#x27;s not necessarily an &amp;#34;all-day&amp;#34; hold type of product, but if you know what you&#x27;re doing, you can reapply a tiny bit and be back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: it washes off your hands and out of your hair easily too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time. Which is really great because this is the least expensive stuff around. I have plenty of expensive product, I highly recommend this as an alternative. I use it probably 90% of the time over the other more expensive option in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I hate product that is too stiff with its hold or goopy or whatever you want to call it.  Yes, you can tell you have product in when you use this, but you can still run your hands through it.  I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on this balance from female friends too (no chick wants to touch your spiked hair).  It works for a solid 8 hour day at work but I usually need to reapply if I&#x27;m going out at night.  I was first attracted to the \\&quot;green / natural ingredients\\&quot; aspect because I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes other product will give me acne on my scalp.  Yeah, no thank you.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with this stuff and the price is right to boot.  This is my go to.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite finishing cream for his hair. Without it, his hair looks less professional looking (for his job) and frizzier. We like the price for it on Amazon and convenience.</li>
            <li> I a shorter hairstyle cut just below my ears, layered. I want definition, not a spike hold. This is my favorite product for just that.  A small dab rubbed on my fingers and finger though my hair and its perfect.  Just the right separation to my hair without the goo or too heavy feeling.  I sue hair spray after if I need a hold but this is perfect for style!  I have tried others, this is it for me.</li>
            <li> Not strong or sticky at all.  Light control and no scent.</li>
            <li> Works great to combat frizz. I use with other Garnier Fructis products</li>
            <li> I find this to be a great product after years of trying to find something comparable to Sebastian Molding Mud after they changed the original formula (original formula was the best hair product ever).  I wear my hair in a pixie style, but need a product to give some definition and weight to my hair especially for the hair that falls across my forehead.  This paste is malleable but adds definition and keeps the style in place without the stiffness or stickiness.  And while it is named a finishing paste, I find I can use it as my only hair product, and apply it on toweled dry hair (I don&#x27;t blow dry).  I also use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Wax Works, also a great product for definition, weight, and hold, but I prefer the feeling and texture of this paste and I think it does a pretty good job, plus I love that it can be applied to damp hair unlike Wax Works.  I&#x27;ve tried many hair products in my search and most have disappointed.  I&#x27;m happily surprised by this one!  Finally someone got it right!</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t get rid of the flyaways</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product, have been using it for years and I have very fine hair...gives it volume, lift and style,</li>
            <li> This is a low-hold product as far as pastes go. It is somewhere between a gel and a harder paste like American Crew Fiber in thickness. I have thick hair and find that this keeps it manageable, but doesn&#x27;t really do much in the way of styling it. I find it&#x27;s best applied while my hair is damp. I use it as a base before applying expensive American Crew Fiber when I want to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the neutral scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a product that allows me to scrunch my wavy hair without the hard crunchy feel. This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried! Works best for me if a small amount is placed in the palm of my hand and warmed up a little before working into my hair while it&#x27;s still damp. Definitely going to keep it stocked up!</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail product for me. And I keep discovering new ways to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, 2b/3a wavy/curly chin-length hair. I saw a haircare tutorial that recommended using a finishing paste to take care of all the flyaway hair on your crown. I wanted something that didn&#x27;t have silicones, since I use sulfate-free shampoo, and found this at the grocery store. I never intended for this to be my end-game product, just a temporary fix while I researched more options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully for this purpose. I take a bit of paste on the tips of my finger, and sort of stretch out the hair at the crown. Sometimes I pat just a little bit on the rest of my hair. All the flyaways disappear. I often use this in conjunction with a few drops of sunflower oil all over to control frizz. Being a curly girl, I have a lot of frizz, and I live in the humid deep South, which doesn&#x27;t help. These two steps deal with frizz without having to resort to silicones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, just the other day I didn&#x27;t feel like blow drying my hair, so I took a bit of paste, rubbed it on both hands, and scrunched my wet curls. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much. I was staying in and didn&#x27;t need to look great, just wanted to give my hair a heat break. My hair looked the best curly it had ever looked, and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of curly girl products in the past. When it dried, it was not stiff or sticky, and I had glossy, perfectly-shaped curls that didn&#x27;t frizz all day. I&#x27;m not sure this would work for someone with thick hair, but it worked great for my fine hair. I think it would be excellent for a fine-haired wavy that wanted glossy loose waves.</li>
            <li> This product tames hair a little but has very little hold. Did seem to help the fly aways when first applied. But after a while, they are up and flying freely.  Dint feel like this product did much for my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this paste to see how well it would hold my hair being as it&#x27;s all natural.  It did a terrible job, I would not recommend it to anyone who is trying to style their hair to hold.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to reduce frizz. Once the product dried, what I got was a head full of embarrassing flakes. Unacceptable...</li>
            <li> So weak as to be unnoticeable.  No hold whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have short asian hair and this product really doesn&#x27;t have any strength to provide any hold.  I would compare the strength of this to be a weak/medium pomade level.  Aside from the strength issue, the product does leave a very light, clean feel to the hair, unlike stronger products.  I would say this is fine for soft/curly hairs that need just a little something to hold in place.  But definitely would not call this a \\&quot;styling\\&quot; or style-inducing product.</li>
            <li> I have used several containers of this product, and highly recommend it once your mustache or beard length start to become difficult to manage. I&#x27;ve tried a few other waxes and products, but this one is my fall back as it is easy to use and hardly noticeable when being worn.</li>
            <li> great, soft feel. not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;day long hold.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold anything.....Doesn&#x27;t come close to Loreal&#x27;s poduct which &amp;#34;does&amp;#34; hold hair is place.  Don&#x27;t waste your $$$$. Simply doesn&#x27;t do the job...25% of reviews for this product say the same thing......</li>
            <li> Hold and control could be better, but pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> This product actually shipped the same day I placed the order! they were fast! and this is my finishing product for my hair. It is NOT a wax. It just keeps flyaways in place when you are finished styling your hair the way you want it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that something this light, effective, nice smelling and natural feeling is also organic. It doesn&#x27;t have the strength to hold my hair when it gets longer, but for the first month after a haircut I swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very thick dark hair that will also frizz some at the thought of humidity.  I&#x27;ve tried probably 30 different hair products (paste, gel, spray) over the last 10 years or so to try and tame the hair monster.  Most products either leave my hair sticky or hard as as rock.  Then I found this Pure Clean pastes and my decade long search is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this won&#x27;t hold your hair in one place in wind like some products do, but it will allow you to take thick hair and blow dry it without it frizzing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I wet my hair with a spray bottle or apply just after a shower, do  a quick and moderate towel dry, apply about a quarter-sized blob of this paste, work it through my hair , brush it through and then hair dry with a tight round brush.  Then brush it out a few minutes later.  My hair wont stay like that all day long, but a simple brush through or even raking my hands through will usually fix things up quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And stickiness?  None. Absolutely ZERO stickiness.  Easy to wash the excess off your hands and the round container is easy to store or toss in a bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as this paste is on the market, I have no plans to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re after the spikey look or a product that holds your hair in the exact position all day long...this isn&#x27;t for you.  And I would imagine that if you have thin, straight hair, this probably isn&#x27;t for you either.  But for thick hair - you know the kind that resembles a football helmet in the morning?  Give this a shot.  Your search for the perfect product may be over. :)</li>
            <li> This has a nice smell and smooth texture but the hold is pretty weak.  I bought it for edge smoothing and it did nothing. It may add a bit of texture and hold but it&#x27;s not great for frizz control.</li>
            <li> This is the only paste that I use for my disheveled messy hair look.  It&#x27;s very economical compared to salon brand pastes.  Scent is very light, like a lotion.  Price on amazon is about the same as Target non-sale.  The convenience of adding this to subscribe and save makes is extra brownie points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each can lasts me about 2 months.</li>
            <li> This helps control the little frizz from letting my hairdryer on its own. It leaves a soft pliable feel. It smells nice too. If you don&#x27;t want any movement, try something stiffer.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his hair (as do I) and we both love it! It&#x27;s a great styling paste without all the creepy ingredients that aren&#x27;t good for one&#x27;s hair. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this and will use it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually swear, but the title of my review, \\&quot;Doesn&#x27;t hold ****!\\&quot; was simply the best way to sum up the product.  I used it twice on my medium-short, fine hair and and will not be using it a third time.  It didn&#x27;t hold well when I first put it on and it only got worse.  The only good thing it has going for it is its light, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then bought \\&quot;Got2b InPlay Paste\\&quot; and am very satisfied with the hold.</li>
            <li> Garnier has many wonderful products, this one is another one I&#x27;ve added to my list, this isn&#x27;t a firm hold more of a shining finishing product.</li>
            <li> I HATE hair products. Hate hate hate them. But I also love to chop my hair off to chin length every few years, so they&#x27;re a necessary evil. I love this paste, because it gives the ends of my layers some definition without making my hair feel all gross and sticky. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This product has very little hold. For Asian straight hair, it does not work.</li>
            <li> This is my preferred finishing paste. It goes on clean and washes out easily with shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent and it&#x27;s not greasy like a lot of pastes out there. Also, it&#x27;s reasonably priced -- really what all these products should be charging. Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive products when this will do the job very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Not sticky, and it holds really well.</li>
            <li> Applying this to my hair has no apparent effect. I was hoping it was a really mild level of hold, just to help prevent frizz. But instead I can&#x27;t tell that it does anything.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I keep my hair short these days and this makes styling my hair extremely simple. I used to use gel when I had long hair and it was awful. This product is very light, non sticky and non flaky. It also doesn&#x27;t stick to your scalp the way gel does. Works with wet or dry hair. I prefer the dry look. Fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t damage your scalp. You don&#x27;t need much either, a little bit goes a long way. No complaints here :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years now.  Works just as well as any conventional paste product.  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Great pomade for texture. Not overly sticky or goopy.</li>
            <li> Purchased on the recommendation of a beard care blog.  Doesn&#x27;t offer any control over my beard.  My beard must be too wiry.  I use oils to condition, so I know it should work at least a bit.  If using for facial hair, I recommend American Crew &amp;#34;Fiber&amp;#34; paste instead.  It offers the control I want without being too tacky, when I don&#x27;t want to use a wax.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hoping to find a more natural solution to other products filled with leads, chemicals, and toxic solutions added to it. I was really hoping it had more of a clay-wax hold in terms of keeping shape but still being flexible, it does not really give volume or lift. I have medium short very layered hair, and the best this stuff does it add shine. It gives your hair a just conditioned luster and that I am very happy with. I use it to quite literally &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; the look after using clay wax and hairspray on the rest of my hair to give it a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not the best hold, but does a great job finishing the look!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking in an attempt to avoid buying the $23 jar of pomade at the salon. It might have been silly to think a $5 product could replace a $23 one, but I figured I&#x27;d try. Unfortunately, I regret the purchase. This paste doesn&#x27;t small bad and isn&#x27;t sticky, but does absolutely nothing for my fine hair. I can&#x27;t tell the difference between before applying the product and after applying the product.</li>
            <li> Ever since I left my hairdresser and decided to manage my own hair I have been searching for a product that would not leave any heavy residue in my hair, a product that does not cause embarrassing flakes and something that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling brittle and hard. Just a little FYI (since products work differently on different hair types &amp; hair textures  I am a black woman with relaxed hair. My hair is pretty thick &amp; I have short hair like Halle Berry short with a razor cut. I use this to mold my hair and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. This is the best product by far... I have tried gels, hair mousse, you name it I&#x27;ve probably tried it but this... This one is a keeper. I usually wash my hair &amp; while it is wet I apply this to my hair and comb it through evenly, laying my hair down with it, I style it &amp; mold it and usually tie it up with a scarf and let it air dry. Once it is completely dry I have the softest hair you can imagine.. It is unbelievable how soft this makes my hair and it holds but it is a very natural hold.. Not like a sticky hold... No flaking whatsoever... Your hair is just extremely soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t usually flat iron my hair or anything.. I just kinda tussle it a little bit with my fingers and I have a really cute style. I love this product. It is wonderful and the price is extremely affordable. I cannot believe how cheap this stuff is compared to other products that are just horrible on my hair.. It also gives your hair a very nice texture... Just incredible</li>
            <li> I used Aveda and Bumble &amp; Bumble hair products for years...  During the Great Recession, it was time to cut back on excess expenses...  e.g. starting by not buying $20-$25 styling creams.  Was reluctant at first to switch, but after testing a handful of store bought brands, finally found one that is a great substitution for what I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and lightweight...  and I like that it uses naturally derived ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. The lite weight paste doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, or leave it greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product, nothing compares</li>
            <li> I use this paste nearly every day on my VERY curly hair.  Using a small amount to define curls.  It works very well. Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair like some gel or mousse products.</li>
            <li> This holds my unwieldy hair in place but I really don&#x27;t think it is much cheaper on Amazon than it is in other places.</li>
            <li> As a male, who has tried many different kinds of hair gel, hair sprays etc. I find two things to be true; 1. few products do what they claim to do, and 2. it usually takes more than one product to achieve a desirable result. For a long time I used hair gels, but many of them are thick and heavy and weigh the hair down upon application. I then switched to a hair spray, which was much lighter, and subsequently held the hair in position much better. However, because it was a spray it did not have the malleability of the hair gel. One class of product was malleable but heavy, and the other was light but rigid. So i figured, why not try a third type of product, a paste. This paste is wonderful, it is both light and malleable. However, it lacked the rigidity that hair spray had previously offered. Yet, the name of the product indicates how this problem can be solved. It is not just a paste, but a &#x27;finishing&#x27; paste. As the name indicates it isn&#x27;t meant to be used alone it is meant to be included in a series of products. The second important part is the indication that the product \\&quot;accentuates layers.\\&quot; Most hair gels are so heavy that the hair actually sticks together in &#x27;spikes&#x27; &#x27;clumps&#x27; or what have you, while the finishing paste actually pushes the hair away from itself and prevents clumping. It adds tremendous depth to your hair by adding volume and creating a structured fluff. In this way the product does exactly what it says it does, and this layered look will hold for 24 hours, but only if you remember it is a &#x27;finishing&#x27; paste. Meaning, that you should be using a secondary product to reinforce the hold.  Which secondary product to choose is up to you, but I find that the airy quality and rigidity of hairspray serves this purpose best. I personally prefer [[ASIN:B000JO2DXY Consort extra hold hair spray, 8.3oz]] and find that it works the best for this purpose. In goes the paste, on goes the hairspray, blast with the hair dryer, and my hair looks fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, if you look for one product that does it all, be prepared to be disappointed with almost every single product you try, because they all have shortcomings in regards to hold, malleability, or weight. The key is to choose the right combination of items to make up for these common weaknesses. I have found this paste to be essential to my lineup and I am happy to say I won&#x27;t be trying any other products for some time to come.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair well. Not greasy and won&#x27;t make your hair hard.</li>
            <li> The only product that works for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He says that he does not like this product because it does not hold his hair for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair great body and a nice conditioned shine.  I was looking for a product that could give some light hold and make my very stick-straight hair behave better.  This is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is not going to past your hair down like a pomade or gel, so don&#x27;t get the impression that it is going to hold hair like that.  This product will start off with a fairly solid hold that transforms to a nice, light finish.  I put it on while my hair is wet and slick my hair straight down, but it develops a nice shiny bounce.  This product would also be useful for those who blow dry to style to add a nice sheen to the hair.</li>
            <li> not too happy with this. doesn&#x27;t smell good and doesn&#x27;t hold my son&#x27;s hair style. will not order again.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff and it works great. recommend it to anyone, it does the job its supposed to well</li>
            <li> True, this doesn&#x27;t offer much hold, but it does leave the hair amazingly soft - when used on damp hair. However, on damp hair, this left my hair extremely soft and smoothed, although my curls weren&#x27;t terrible define.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the texture and smoothness of my hair after using this was extremely good. I almost think they should have sold this as a damp hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On dry hair, however, it&#x27;s really best for people who want to spike, although it doesn&#x27;t offer much hold. Perhaps if a person just wants a bedhead look? Also, if you don&#x27;t warm this enough, on dry hair, it will clump and look like lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a three because it smells wonderful. Plus, I still like this so much that I&#x27;m stocking up on it, as I think it&#x27;s no longer being made. I just give it a 3 because it doesn&#x27;t work the way it&#x27;s supposed to, even though it&#x27;s a lovely product.</li>
            <li> I got this at a local drug store to see if it would help tame some errant hairs. If this is strong then weak must be plain water.</li>
            <li> Love it for my short &#x27;do!</li>
            <li> I use this paste on my son&#x27;s hair to do a faux-hawk.  Seems to do the trick, yet washes out easy - which is great.  I wish it were just a little bit stronger of a hold.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:ff0345c57812ad9f3573795ce39fee20]] I bought this product in order to texturize my hair and provide an all day hold. Seeing the product labeled as \\&quot;Strong\\&quot;, I decided to give it a shot. Once I had applied the product through my hair and went about through the day I was disappointed. My hair failed to be texturized throughout the day, so I had to invest in a new hair product. The label was misleading about the hold of the product so I must inform future customers that this is not the product that it seems to be. The product does have a lot of pros that come with it. I found that it does an excellent job at combating humidity and allows the hair to flow naturally after use. It washes of well and leaves no residue on your fingers. This is mainly for people who want an anti frizz natural product that will get the job done with lasting effects. If you are looking for a natural American Crew Fiber kind of paste this is not for you. Try looking at Hanz de fuko who makes excellent natural hair styling products that are on par with American Crew if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product 4 stars but I had to take one off for the misleading labeling. We can already see that many had bought this product looking for a high hold paste but were later dismayed. Garnier should definitely make a clearly understandable label for this product.</li>
            <li> I tested this product out when a local Walgreens was out of my regular stuff. If you have thick or difficult hair, this stuff is useless. It contains entirely too much moisture and yet has very little hold to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a drier pomade/putty that doesn&#x27;t give your hair a childish sheen, avoid this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great on my curly hair</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it claims to do which is:  \\&quot;24-hour definition and shine to accentuate the layers of your haircut with zero stickiness\\&quot;.  After reading the other reviews I think some of the reviewers had unrealistic expectations of the product. If it was designed to accentuate layers then it is probably not going to perform very well at spiking your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very short layered style and this product does a beautiful job of adding body, definition and shine without being stiff or sticky.  The one area it falls short is that it claims to have strong hold.  I would have to say that is stretching it a little (or maybe I&#x27;m not using enough of the product) but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.  I like the natural look and feel if provides and the fact that it is a natural, safe product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl with stick straight hair, so when I cut it short I needed something to help give it more texture. I tried several paste/fiber gum/pomade products. This one didn&#x27;t weigh it down and gave me the best hold with clean feel. I would brand it more as a texturizes than something to holding a style like a gel or spray.</li>
            <li> There have been a lot of fairly negative reviews for this product. From the descriptions, people are using this for the wrong purpose and becoming frustrated because they&#x27;re not getting the results they desire. The percentage of people that want a heavy-duty, styling wax type hold, are displeased. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a thick, pasty product that will mold your hair into place, this is NOT THE PRODUCT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I use it for: finishing. A finishing paste or cream is for styles that are loose and lush and just need some fly-away or frizz taming. I recommend using this while your hair is either somewhat damp or all the way dry. If half your hair is wet and half is dry, the dry pieces actually take on MORE frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, naturally curly, fine hair. I use this to hold loose up-dos in place, and to bring definition to my curls. It works great for both and I love that it is so light. Plus, it smells great in a barely-noticeable way. So for light hold, defining, and frizz control, this is a go-to product. For heavy hold, find something else.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - get it! Doesn&#x27;t get gross like some do - and it holds pretty much all day. Very flexiable.</li>
            <li> For fine hair this offers no hold and basically is a leave in conditioner without leaving hair greasy. Its ok but you will need a lot of hairspray after.</li>
            <li> First of all I love Garnier products. This paste is great and leaves hair shiny and soft to the touch. I love it and would suggest it to others. I have bought the expensive brands but for the price and value you cannot beat this!</li>
            <li> Great product, Iwill purchase again,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product I first purchased it in the store, then went on line and stat purchasing it here. Product came in good time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It is the least waxy of the paste products I have tried on my short hair.  It works best on dry or slightly damp short hair.  It is less effective on wet hair.  I like buying it from Amazon because they have a great price and no one has put their finger in it like I often see in the stores.</li>
            <li> Good scent, easy to apply, works as advertised.  I can put it on in the morning (short/medium men&#x27;s hair), touch it up during the day with my fingers, and even wet my fingers a bit and completely reset it before going out for dinner.  Doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing product, but my boyfriend uses a lot more than I do and it looks like he&#x27;s using a styling product - but it doesn&#x27;t look shellacked or heavy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best hair product I have ever used. My hair stays where I want it, has a lot of volume, but is completely touchable and natural looking.  I started using it a year ago and nothing else works nearly as well.  I&#x27;m a guy with hair about 4-5 inches long</li>
            <li> great paste for my husbands curly hair and beard.</li>
            <li> This has become my only hair product. It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t make my hair crispy &amp; goes on pretty clean. No fragrance either.</li>
            <li> Works great on my husbands 8&amp;#34; beard! Just as advertised not sticky, good smell, great price.</li>
            <li> Best paste I have found, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky and is a soft hold.  My son also likes, so we are both repeat buyers.</li>
