    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent blade.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li>Great deal!!</li>
            <li>these blades are, but not the best.</li>
            <li>They also seem quite forgiving, also, which would probably make them an excellent choice for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Very happy with price and product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades work best if you take three passes.  </li>
            <li>Awesome quality, too.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of blades and found these to work best for the money.</li>
            <li>They are great for children!</li>
            <li>The shave I get from these Derby&#x27;s is very good.</li>
            <li>and it works  very good</li>
            <li>Good blades !</li>
            <li>So...still a good product!</li>
            <li>I get a great shave at this price you can throw away a blade after every time you shave.</li>
            <li>Blade are great to shave with.</li>
            <li>Gillette Adjustable set on 4/5 and found them to be great blades.</li>
            <li>Great blades.  </li>
            <li>but with these blades I have greatly reduces the bumps</li>
            <li>The merchant who sold me the blades on amazon was great too.</li>
            <li>One person&#x27;s great blade is another&#x27;s nightmare.  </li>
            <li>its very nice item  </li>
            <li>Loved them as they were great value for money, great quality and come in packs of 5 which also can store the used blades</li>
            <li>They are at a good price point and I can recommend them.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;d say they are good blades and that you should try them for yourself.</li>
            <li>I need just one good edge,&lt;br /&gt;not six</li>
            <li>but there are a lot of them at a good price.  </li>
            <li>A good deal.</li>
            <li>Good combo.</li>
            <li>I get 3 to 4 good shaves from each one.</li>
            <li>They are also good for use in aggressive razors to provide some form of offset.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I do not get an incredibly close shave with these, but I do get a very nice, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Throughout the years I have learned that the best advertised product is not necessarily the best quality product.  </li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;m pleased, price/performance is great.</li>
            <li>I find I can get a week worth of shaves per blade, and for the cost that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>There were my first DE razor blades, but I am very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>The price is nice, though.  </li>
            <li>I own two DE razors, the mercur 180 and the 3\\&quot; slant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also recommend, by the way, a really nice shaving cream that lathers out of a brush, rather than rubbing on</li>
            <li>These blades are nice</li>
            <li>I get as good, or better, a shave with Derby Extras as I do with Feathers, Merkurs or Timors.  </li>
            <li>The picture suggests you&#x27;ll get a nicely boxed set of 5&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Nice and close</li>
            <li>Nice blades.  </li>
            <li>I can get three good shaves, one Ok shave, and one crappy shave from one blade (I suggest changing blades before the Ok shave).</li>
            <li>So I ordered a pack of Shark super chrome and what a world of difference, totally great shave.</li>
            <li>If this was the best blade out there, I would go back to a five blade cartridge.</li>
            <li>Love these blades.  </li>
            <li>I have used some better blades like the merkur blades</li>
            <li>I just love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li>So when I got some Proraso shaving cream, I decided to get some better blades too.</li>
            <li>These ones still pull a bit on my hair sometimes, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>As I obtained more tools and techniques, my shave has progressively gotten better everytime.  </li>
            <li>great all-around blade.</li>
            <li>DONT GO WITH THE CHEAP ONES!  </li>
            <li>So, it takes a tad more effort than with my preferred blade, the Israeli Personnas (packaged under the \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; brand).</li>
            <li>but it is ok for the prize.</li>
            <li>this one gave me better shaves and more shaves.  </li>
            <li>Top notch product.</li>
            <li>Now I get a nice clean and smooth shave as well.</li>
            <li>Returning to the wet shave scene, I tried this blade and found it to be an excellent blade.  </li>
            <li>They are good for beginners who are new to shaving, but I needed blades that were more aggressive like the Feathers.</li>
            <li>You can easily get 4 to 5 shaves.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with EJ (which is very very mild)</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I found I preferred these blades to the Feather light blades.  </li>
            <li>These blades are comfortable and shave close</li>
            <li>I used shave oil who knows but I like these cheap blades</li>
            <li>Fit into safety razor handles and work well for shaving.</li>
            <li>And, they&#x27;re just ridiculously cheap when you consider the quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;that Derby blades give me a smooth close shave every time.</li>
            <li>Way cheaper than the track-two blades I used to use, and I get a baby&#x27;s bottom smooth shave.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth, durable, and don&#x27;t pull at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great daily</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I guess if, two or three blades from now, I&#x27;ve run into issues, I&#x27;ll revisit the review, but I used one that came with my new Edwin Jagger razor, and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>These blades are very nice, and if you haven&#x27;t tried Derby before you definitely should.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I have absolutely no complaints, Derby blades are a great product.</li>
            <li>Not really that great.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and worth owning one.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews, and its true, its all about YOUR beard and face.</li>
            <li>Good Value for double edged blades.</li>
            <li>still not a bad deal</li>
            <li>They came in quickly and did the job.</li>
            <li>They are great for beginners as you won&#x27;t walk away with blood pouring down your face into the sink.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m obviously much more methodical about my shaving in this new style, and I think that&#x27;s part of the enjoyment.</li>
            <li>These are great little blades.</li>
            <li>I still think I can find a better blade than the sharks though too, but they are definitely a huge step above these derbys.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li>For the price they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>I get just as great a shave as I did before for a lot less money!</li>
            <li>To sum up: these blades give me an outstanding, very, very close shave with no nicks, cuts, or pulling and tugging, plus they last for at least four or five excellent shaves.  </li>
            <li>The flip side is that you only get a handful of decent shaves before the blade starts tugging on stubble, which can lead to a fair amount of razor burn.</li>
            <li>but the price is right.  </li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>I find these blades to be just right.</li>
            <li>OK, here&#x27;s the story: these blades are very sharp, smoothly finished, and give me an excellent, very close shave with very little effort on my part.  </li>
            <li>I bought this box for a good price and it will last these blades are good last a week of daily shaving.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my new DE razor and am completely blown away with how amazing they are.</li>
            <li>and I get several great shaves before I flip the blade over and get a few more.</li>
            <li>I have tried Feathers, Lords Super, and Sharks super chrome and they all work great, feel sharp and last a week or so.  </li>
            <li>give you a life time of good shaving and well cost you a lot less to shave.</li>
            <li>Just received these three weeks ago and trying them out, so far so good, no cuts, nick, razor burns, gives a better shave than those drug store razors and cost a lot less,  shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to pay a little more for better quality, so I&#x27;ll probably not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li>very fast well packaged.</li>
            <li>These Derby blades are very cost effective and are sharp enough to give an excellent shave without being so sharp they cut up your face (like the feather blades).  </li>
            <li>These blades give a good shave, and they come in convenient little packs that keep them from breaking in storage.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands which are more expensive, but Derby is  one of the best blades available</li>
            <li>So far, the EJ8911 seems to prefer a more \\&quot;high performance\\&quot; blade like Feather.</li>
            <li>First time with DE shaving</li>
            <li>I tried this as the first blade in my DE razor.  </li>
            <li>Because I wonder now why the hell I ever paid that much money for a mediocre-at-best shave, that&#x27;s why!    </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really all I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li>My change towards a better shave started with a badger brush and some proraso shaving cream, the DE razor came later.  </li>
            <li>Go with the grain on the first pass, rinse and re-lather.  </li>
            <li>OK, we all know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li>you might be ok but with a merkur HD or open blade no way.</li>
            <li>I took a chunk out of my pinky when I first got them.</li>
            <li>I am good for the end of the world with a few boxes</li>
            <li>sharp and amazing for what I need them for, you get a lot</li>
            <li>Shaving every other day and using my Silver Tone Double Edge razor, I got three great, close shaves, while the fourth shave was a bit more laborious, but passable.  </li>
            <li>Nothing particularly fancy or exciting about these blades -</li>
            <li>I will buy it again until I find the right double edge blade that fit my shaving habit.</li>
            <li>I ended up shaving twice--once with the grain, and once either laterally or against the grain--because I am rather obsessive about wanting a really close, smooth shave, and I got no burn, no odd bumps.</li>
            <li>I just recently switched over to double edge razors from disposable/cartridges and I am very pleased with the results of these blades.  </li>
            <li>Pure garbage.</li>
            <li>razors and this makes using an older style razor so much better, economical and environment friendly - at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Husband love these, they are very sharp and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I think if you have a very light beard and thin hair, these blades might be ok, otherwise don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really believe that I will receive the product of this quality at the price, and promptly.</li>
            <li>Combine these blades with the Lord Chrome Safety Razor and prepare for a close and economic shave.</li>
            <li>These are a real bummer.</li>
            <li>These blades really tore up my face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just getting into wet shaving with double edge razors, this would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li>Admittedly I have sensitive skin, but for the same sort of price you can get better.</li>
            <li>They are the first blades I&#x27;ve used with my new safety razor</li>
            <li>they can be sharp but after one shaving its more forgiving when you shave.</li>
            <li>so I use those only on special occassions.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t compare how they stack up to other double edge blades, I can tell you that they are far superior to any disposable razor or cartridge razor you can buy at the drugstore as I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>However, the thirty pack comes with six five packs which easily allow for a container to be turned into a spent blade box.</li>
            <li>I started shaving with a double edged safety razor about two years ago, and started off with Derby as they were the most recommended starting set of blades for beginners.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>The title says it all, the blades are very smooth and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I normally get 3 shaves out of Feathers and Wilkinson Swords.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try a few more Derby blades and see if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li>I plan to try other blades in the future, just for comparison purposes, since these are rated not as sharp as others (although I am more than highly satisfied with them).</li>
            <li>I purchased a Merkur 180 safety razor recently and had heard that different blades are better for certain people, so I decided to try multiple brands of blades before I settled on one.</li>
            <li>so I use a new blade every 10-12 shaves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Brand new</li>
            <li>your mileage may very, I was able to use these blades about 3 times each before they became too dull and started to cut me.</li>
            <li>These are the DERBY EXTRA Super Stainless Double Edge with Chromium-Ceramic Platinum Tungsten Polymer Coated Edges.   </li>
            <li>All in all the blades are cheap, but not worth it.  </li>
            <li>these Derbys are just okay, not enjoyable.</li>
            <li>After my first shave with these, they&#x27;re totally fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were the first blades I bought when I ventured into the world of double edged shaving.</li>
            <li>They stay sharp for a few good shaves.</li>
            <li>if your new to DE shaving, don&#x27;t slap on the soap and shave you won&#x27;t enjoy it, check some of the web site&#x27;s \\&quot;on how to DE shave\\&quot; for the half hour looking well</li>
            <li>Very sharp smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Trust me, even your absolute favorite blade is not necessarily good for all occasions.</li>
            <li>purchased as a gift to complete a safety razor set, completely satified!</li>
            <li>Take the razor at a slight angle to the hair on the second and third passes with a lather and rinse in between and you&#x27;ll get a nice, close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li>These blades are nothing flashy just sturdy good old fashioned blades that get the job done and done well!</li>
            <li>I have only used feathers prior to this purchase (which cost a bit more), so I am maybe slightly jaded but the cost wasn&#x27;t an issue than or now really.  </li>
            <li>Merkur isnt as dangerous as Feather and does a great job even after the amount of recommended shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>I am on my 3rd blade and seem to work real well.</li>
            <li>The old fashioned way is my husband&#x27;s preferred way to shave.  </li>
            <li>Derby Blades are epic.  </li>
            <li>various \\&quot;micro\\&quot; junk that is overpriced and probably contributes as much as multi-blades to skin irritation.</li>
            <li>They are similar to the Merkur blades, but at a much cheaper cost.</li>
            <li>The 5/6 setting tended to be a bit harsh and the 3/4 setting too light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are on the duller end of the scale as far as shaving razors go.</li>
            <li>I have a very course facial hair.</li>
            <li>I have used 10 Derby blades so far and found the quality to be inconsistent.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried Feather, Merkur, and now Derby.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then when I attempted to return them I&#x27;d spend just as much money sending them back as it did to buy them.</li>
            <li>For me, the Derby is a mild blade; a little on the dull side with a fair amount of drag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a George Trumper container of violet shaving cream, worked in with a boar hair brush, and the results have been a creamy, smooth shave, even with a slightly dull Dovo straight razor (slightly dull because the only wetstone I got originally was a 6,000 grit, which does absolutely nothing towards resharpening a dulling blade).</li>
            <li>Ok so these blades are  sharp just dont stay sharp.</li>
            <li>And they cost only about a THIRD as much!  </li>
            <li>I  really like these, not a lot of tugging and lasts long to.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as comfortable as my &#x27;stash&#x27; of Gillette or Wilkinson from past decades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not great for heavy beards or stubble better for light but find the one that woks for you.</li>
            <li>Stick to buyers who can confirm the landscape packaging or find a new brand, like the Israeli Red Personna.</li>
            <li>I find the derby to be extremely sharp when they&#x27;re first put in.</li>
            <li>The blades are not consistently sharp.  </li>
            <li>Not particularly sharp.</li>
            <li>I was curious about the quality and certainly couldn&#x27;t pass on the price.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy cheap plastic (or expensive plastic for that matter) disposable razors that seem to consistently pull at your face and leave nicks again.</li>
            <li>Slow thoughtful ritual.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to other than the big Gillette cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re aggressive enough to cut through my thick beard (especially in an old open-comb Gillette), but not so much that they shave a layer of skin off (looking at you, Feather!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving and these blades came with my Edwin Jagger razor.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving, look online for the tools and techniques used.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard just a normal old guy&#x27;s stubble.  </li>

            <li> They are at a good price point and I can recommend them.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;d say they are good blades and that you should try them for yourself.</li>
            <li> I need just one good edge,&lt;br /&gt;not six</li>
            <li> but there are a lot of them at a good price.  </li>
            <li> A good deal.</li>
            <li> Good combo.</li>
            <li> I get 3 to 4 good shaves from each one.</li>
            <li> They are also good for use in aggressive razors to provide some form of offset.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> I do not get an incredibly close shave with these, but I do get a very nice, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Throughout the years I have learned that the best advertised product is not necessarily the best quality product.  </li>
            <li> in all I&#x27;m pleased, price/performance is great.</li>
            <li> I find I can get a week worth of shaves per blade, and for the cost that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> There were my first DE razor blades, but I am very happy with them.  </li>
            <li> The price is nice, though.  </li>
            <li> I own two DE razors, the mercur 180 and the 3\\&quot; slant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also recommend, by the way, a really nice shaving cream that lathers out of a brush, rather than rubbing on</li>
            <li> These blades are nice</li>
            <li> I get as good, or better, a shave with Derby Extras as I do with Feathers, Merkurs or Timors.  </li>
            <li> The picture suggests you&#x27;ll get a nicely boxed set of 5&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Nice and close</li>
            <li> Nice blades.  </li>
            <li> I can get three good shaves, one Ok shave, and one crappy shave from one blade (I suggest changing blades before the Ok shave).</li>
            <li> So I ordered a pack of Shark super chrome and what a world of difference, totally great shave.</li>
            <li> If this was the best blade out there, I would go back to a five blade cartridge.</li>
            <li> Love these blades.  </li>
            <li> I have used some better blades like the merkur blades</li>
            <li> I just love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li> So when I got some Proraso shaving cream, I decided to get some better blades too.</li>
            <li> These ones still pull a bit on my hair sometimes, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> As I obtained more tools and techniques, my shave has progressively gotten better everytime.  </li>
            <li> great all-around blade.</li>
            <li> DONT GO WITH THE CHEAP ONES!  </li>
            <li> So, it takes a tad more effort than with my preferred blade, the Israeli Personnas (packaged under the \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; brand).</li>
            <li> but it is ok for the prize.</li>
            <li> this one gave me better shaves and more shaves.  </li>
            <li> Top notch product.</li>
            <li> Now I get a nice clean and smooth shave as well.</li>
            <li> Returning to the wet shave scene, I tried this blade and found it to be an excellent blade.  </li>
            <li> They are good for beginners who are new to shaving, but I needed blades that were more aggressive like the Feathers.</li>
            <li> You can easily get 4 to 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with EJ (which is very very mild)</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I found I preferred these blades to the Feather light blades.  </li>
            <li> These blades are comfortable and shave close</li>
            <li> I used shave oil who knows but I like these cheap blades</li>
            <li> Fit into safety razor handles and work well for shaving.</li>
            <li> And, they&#x27;re just ridiculously cheap when you consider the quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;that Derby blades give me a smooth close shave every time.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than the track-two blades I used to use, and I get a baby&#x27;s bottom smooth shave.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smooth, durable, and don&#x27;t pull at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great daily</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I guess if, two or three blades from now, I&#x27;ve run into issues, I&#x27;ll revisit the review, but I used one that came with my new Edwin Jagger razor, and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These blades are very nice, and if you haven&#x27;t tried Derby before you definitely should.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints, Derby blades are a great product.</li>
            <li> Not really that great.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap and worth owning one.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, and its true, its all about YOUR beard and face.</li>
            <li> Good Value for double edged blades.</li>
            <li> still not a bad deal</li>
            <li> They came in quickly and did the job.</li>
            <li> They are great for beginners as you won&#x27;t walk away with blood pouring down your face into the sink.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m obviously much more methodical about my shaving in this new style, and I think that&#x27;s part of the enjoyment.</li>
            <li> These are great little blades.</li>
            <li> I still think I can find a better blade than the sharks though too, but they are definitely a huge step above these derbys.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li> For the price they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I get just as great a shave as I did before for a lot less money!</li>
            <li> To sum up: these blades give me an outstanding, very, very close shave with no nicks, cuts, or pulling and tugging, plus they last for at least four or five excellent shaves.  </li>
            <li> The flip side is that you only get a handful of decent shaves before the blade starts tugging on stubble, which can lead to a fair amount of razor burn.</li>
            <li> but the price is right.  </li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> I find these blades to be just right.</li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s the story: these blades are very sharp, smoothly finished, and give me an excellent, very close shave with very little effort on my part.  </li>
            <li> I bought this box for a good price and it will last these blades are good last a week of daily shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my new DE razor and am completely blown away with how amazing they are.</li>
            <li> and I get several great shaves before I flip the blade over and get a few more.</li>
            <li> I have tried Feathers, Lords Super, and Sharks super chrome and they all work great, feel sharp and last a week or so.  </li>
            <li> give you a life time of good shaving and well cost you a lot less to shave.</li>
            <li> Just received these three weeks ago and trying them out, so far so good, no cuts, nick, razor burns, gives a better shave than those drug store razors and cost a lot less,  shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> I am willing to pay a little more for better quality, so I&#x27;ll probably not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> very fast well packaged.</li>
            <li> These Derby blades are very cost effective and are sharp enough to give an excellent shave without being so sharp they cut up your face (like the feather blades).  </li>
            <li> These blades give a good shave, and they come in convenient little packs that keep them from breaking in storage.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands which are more expensive, but Derby is  one of the best blades available</li>
            <li> So far, the EJ8911 seems to prefer a more \\&quot;high performance\\&quot; blade like Feather.</li>
            <li> First time with DE shaving</li>
            <li> I tried this as the first blade in my DE razor.  </li>
            <li> Because I wonder now why the hell I ever paid that much money for a mediocre-at-best shave, that&#x27;s why!    </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really all I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li> My change towards a better shave started with a badger brush and some proraso shaving cream, the DE razor came later.  </li>
            <li> Go with the grain on the first pass, rinse and re-lather.  </li>
            <li> OK, we all know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> you might be ok but with a merkur HD or open blade no way.</li>
            <li> I took a chunk out of my pinky when I first got them.</li>
            <li> I am good for the end of the world with a few boxes</li>
            <li> sharp and amazing for what I need them for, you get a lot</li>
            <li> Shaving every other day and using my Silver Tone Double Edge razor, I got three great, close shaves, while the fourth shave was a bit more laborious, but passable.  </li>
            <li> Nothing particularly fancy or exciting about these blades -</li>
            <li> I will buy it again until I find the right double edge blade that fit my shaving habit.</li>
            <li> I ended up shaving twice--once with the grain, and once either laterally or against the grain--because I am rather obsessive about wanting a really close, smooth shave, and I got no burn, no odd bumps.</li>
            <li> I just recently switched over to double edge razors from disposable/cartridges and I am very pleased with the results of these blades.  </li>
            <li> Pure garbage.</li>
            <li> razors and this makes using an older style razor so much better, economical and environment friendly - at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Husband love these, they are very sharp and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I think if you have a very light beard and thin hair, these blades might be ok, otherwise don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe that I will receive the product of this quality at the price, and promptly.</li>
            <li> Combine these blades with the Lord Chrome Safety Razor and prepare for a close and economic shave.</li>
            <li> These are a real bummer.</li>
            <li> These blades really tore up my face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just getting into wet shaving with double edge razors, this would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I have sensitive skin, but for the same sort of price you can get better.</li>
            <li> They are the first blades I&#x27;ve used with my new safety razor</li>
            <li> they can be sharp but after one shaving its more forgiving when you shave.</li>
            <li> so I use those only on special occassions.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t compare how they stack up to other double edge blades, I can tell you that they are far superior to any disposable razor or cartridge razor you can buy at the drugstore as I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li> However, the thirty pack comes with six five packs which easily allow for a container to be turned into a spent blade box.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a double edged safety razor about two years ago, and started off with Derby as they were the most recommended starting set of blades for beginners.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The title says it all, the blades are very smooth and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I normally get 3 shaves out of Feathers and Wilkinson Swords.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a few more Derby blades and see if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> I plan to try other blades in the future, just for comparison purposes, since these are rated not as sharp as others (although I am more than highly satisfied with them).</li>
            <li> I purchased a Merkur 180 safety razor recently and had heard that different blades are better for certain people, so I decided to try multiple brands of blades before I settled on one.</li>
            <li> so I use a new blade every 10-12 shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brand new</li>
            <li> your mileage may very, I was able to use these blades about 3 times each before they became too dull and started to cut me.</li>
            <li> These are the DERBY EXTRA Super Stainless Double Edge with Chromium-Ceramic Platinum Tungsten Polymer Coated Edges.   </li>
            <li> All in all the blades are cheap, but not worth it.  </li>
            <li> these Derbys are just okay, not enjoyable.</li>
            <li> After my first shave with these, they&#x27;re totally fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were the first blades I bought when I ventured into the world of double edged shaving.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp for a few good shaves.</li>
            <li> if your new to DE shaving, don&#x27;t slap on the soap and shave you won&#x27;t enjoy it, check some of the web site&#x27;s \\&quot;on how to DE shave\\&quot; for the half hour looking well</li>
            <li> Very sharp smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Trust me, even your absolute favorite blade is not necessarily good for all occasions.</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift to complete a safety razor set, completely satified!</li>
            <li> Take the razor at a slight angle to the hair on the second and third passes with a lather and rinse in between and you&#x27;ll get a nice, close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> These blades are nothing flashy just sturdy good old fashioned blades that get the job done and done well!</li>
            <li> I have only used feathers prior to this purchase (which cost a bit more), so I am maybe slightly jaded but the cost wasn&#x27;t an issue than or now really.  </li>
            <li> Merkur isnt as dangerous as Feather and does a great job even after the amount of recommended shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd blade and seem to work real well.</li>
            <li> The old fashioned way is my husband&#x27;s preferred way to shave.  </li>
            <li> Derby Blades are epic.  </li>
            <li> various \\&quot;micro\\&quot; junk that is overpriced and probably contributes as much as multi-blades to skin irritation.</li>
            <li> They are similar to the Merkur blades, but at a much cheaper cost.</li>
            <li> The 5/6 setting tended to be a bit harsh and the 3/4 setting too light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are on the duller end of the scale as far as shaving razors go.</li>
            <li> I have a very course facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have used 10 Derby blades so far and found the quality to be inconsistent.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried Feather, Merkur, and now Derby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then when I attempted to return them I&#x27;d spend just as much money sending them back as it did to buy them.</li>
            <li> For me, the Derby is a mild blade; a little on the dull side with a fair amount of drag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a George Trumper container of violet shaving cream, worked in with a boar hair brush, and the results have been a creamy, smooth shave, even with a slightly dull Dovo straight razor (slightly dull because the only wetstone I got originally was a 6,000 grit, which does absolutely nothing towards resharpening a dulling blade).</li>
            <li> Ok so these blades are  sharp just dont stay sharp.</li>
            <li> And they cost only about a THIRD as much!  </li>
            <li> I  really like these, not a lot of tugging and lasts long to.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as comfortable as my &#x27;stash&#x27; of Gillette or Wilkinson from past decades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not great for heavy beards or stubble better for light but find the one that woks for you.</li>
            <li> Stick to buyers who can confirm the landscape packaging or find a new brand, like the Israeli Red Personna.</li>
            <li> I find the derby to be extremely sharp when they&#x27;re first put in.</li>
            <li> The blades are not consistently sharp.  </li>
            <li> Not particularly sharp.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the quality and certainly couldn&#x27;t pass on the price.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy cheap plastic (or expensive plastic for that matter) disposable razors that seem to consistently pull at your face and leave nicks again.</li>
            <li> Slow thoughtful ritual.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to other than the big Gillette cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re aggressive enough to cut through my thick beard (especially in an old open-comb Gillette), but not so much that they shave a layer of skin off (looking at you, Feather!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and these blades came with my Edwin Jagger razor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving, look online for the tools and techniques used.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard just a normal old guy&#x27;s stubble.  </li>
            <li> In short, they&#x27;re enough to get you going, but it won&#x27;t be long before you want to move onto something</li>
            <li> Due to the lesser sharpness of these blades, the Derbys will allow you to shave gently over tender spots without causing further damage from a very sharp blade.</li>
            <li> They last a long time, but they are inexpensive</li>
            <li> While the blades are fairly sharp, they tend to dull rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> The slant would tear my face up if I wasn&#x27;t carefeul with the feather blades (slight exageration)so after really not finding the Derby blade satisfactory on the 180 without 5 passes in all directions, and then with wet hands fumbling to pull a feather out of its paperwax sleeve before running out of  hot water....</li>
            <li> Even with a much bigger ratio of blade exposed to your face, the Derby still failed to really give me a decent shave.....</li>
            <li> They last about five shaves before I can feel them beginning to loose their edge.</li>
            <li> However, the Derby is okay when you need a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; shave ... particularly, when the skin is irritated or you&#x27;ve raised a weeper or two due to bad technique.  </li>
            <li> Not only are they much less expensive, but I found them to be sharper, and better.</li>
            <li> Arrived several days before expected.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t expect you to want to stay on these stepping stones for too long.</li>
            <li> For the opposite extreme, try \\&quot;Shark\\&quot; blades.  </li>
            <li> Which I&#x27;m not; except for a brief excursion into the Horrid Land of Marketing, when I used Mach3&#x27;s and a couple of other multi-blade \\&quot;wonder</li>
            <li> Some seem to last longer than others: sometimes I get 3-4 shaves other times</li>
            <li> The razors are not quite sharp enough to achieve a baby&#x27;s butt shave unless you want to carve into your cheeks(no pun intended).</li>
            <li> They are sterile, sharp, clean, thin, and do not snap in half (unless you apply enough force/pressure to it.)</li>
            <li> this could be unfair because it could be me changing, but they don&#x27;t seem to stay sharp nearly as long as they used to and the recent batches have caused a lot more nicks shaving than they ever did in the past.</li>
            <li> These Derbys seem to be as dull as the other blades I use when I&#x27;m ready to throw them in the bin.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be less likely to cut yourself if you make a mistake.</li>
            <li> Less pulling and such.</li>
            <li> Several of the blades were sharp on one side but acted as though they had been used for months on the other.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan</li>
            <li> These razors make it harder than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> So as any wet shaver knows, you have to try a lot of blades to find the ones for you.</li>
            <li> I used about 5 of them at which point I was considering giving up and going back to my mach 3, thinking that I didn&#x27;t have the ability to use this style of razor without destroying my face.</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to wet shaving but never knew what I was missing until recently.  </li>
            <li> They were sharp enough to give me a closer shave than the other two, and no nicks (I got two after half a dozen shaves with the Wilkinsons).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, I do like these blades because my beard isn&#x27;t very coarse and the slightly duller blades irritate me less than an aggressive sharper blade would.</li>
            <li> As expected from other reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> Not really that sharp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and thought I had a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other blades.</li>
            <li> If they stayed sharp longer than 1 shave</li>
            <li> Sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp and close finish.</li>
            <li> I get about three shaves on sharp blades</li>
            <li> : After shaving with 5-10 of these blades, I understand what the other reviewer say when they comment on how they&#x27;re not quite as sharp as other blades.</li>

            <li> I get less nicks and cuts with these.  </li>
            <li> but it seems one side of the blade were dull while the other was really sharp...</li>
            <li> I prefer a little bit sharper, so they glide smoother.  </li>
            <li> As a former user of those expensive multi blade shavers I cannot help but think why did I waste all that money for so long.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You cant beat the price of these blades.  I get a great shave at this price you can throw away a blade after every time you shave.</li>
            <li> I found I preferred these blades to the Feather light blades.  I get less nicks and cuts with these.  They last a long time, but they are inexpensive so I use a new blade every 10-12 shaves.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and these blades came with my Edwin Jagger razor. I also bought extra. I am on my 3rd blade and seem to work real well. You can easily get 4 to 5 shaves. I haven&#x27;t tried other blades.</li>
            <li> Arrived several days before expected. Have only used once but so far so good. Nothing negative to say. As expected from other reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Merkur blades, but after reading some reviews about the Derby Extra DE Blades ([[ASIN:B0026MRA1W Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades - 25 Ct]]), I decided to give them a try. Not only are they much less expensive, but I found them to be sharper, and better. I can get about 5-6 shaves per blade with no problems. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I am still using these. Its been over two years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these in my safety razor. I&#x27;ve also tried Shark and Feather blades. I find the derby to be extremely sharp when they&#x27;re first put in. They last about five shaves before I can feel them beginning to loose their edge. My only complaint lies in the packaging not having a place to insert used blades (a feature found on both shark and feather blade boxes). However, the thirty pack comes with six five packs which easily allow for a container to be turned into a spent blade box.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, and it usually *is* a personal thing, but these are TOO dull.  If you like duller blades that require you to put a little pressure to shave those hard to get at areas, these might be what you&#x27;re looking for.  I prefer a little bit sharper, so they glide smoother.  Just so you know.  The price is nice, though.  For the opposite extreme, try \\&quot;Shark\\&quot; blades.  The price is similar, and they&#x27;re a lot sharper.  I find sharper blades last longer, too, but that&#x27;s just me, again.</li>
            <li> Excellent blade. Very sharp smooth shave. First time with DE shaving and it&#x27;s been great! No increase in nicks/cuts as some comments indicate (actually a decrease), but I&#x27;m obviously much more methodical about my shaving in this new style, and I think that&#x27;s part of the enjoyment. Slow thoughtful ritual.</li>
            <li> Despite the image advertised, I received the portrait print package.  The blades are not consistently sharp.  The blade catches and skips, and ultimately causes irritation and razor burn.  Stick to buyers who can confirm the landscape packaging or find a new brand, like the Israeli Red Personna.</li>
            <li> I tried this as the first blade in my DE razor.  Tried different soaps and cremes.  Could not get the blade to shave without persistent scraping over and over.  Thought the razor was bad until I replaced the blade with a Gillette 7&#x27;O Clock.  That&#x27;s when I realized that this blade was not for me.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard just a normal old guy&#x27;s stubble.  Haven&#x27;t tried the Feathers&#x27; but that will probably be the next one to try.  My razor is a Jagger 89.</li>
            <li> I switched to safety razors after realizing I was only getting two or three non-painful shaves from my disposable razors. These blades are comfortable and shave close and I get several great shaves before I flip the blade over and get a few more. They are at a good price point and I can recommend them.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan but the price is right.  I have only used feathers prior to this purchase (which cost a bit more), so I am maybe slightly jaded but the cost wasn&#x27;t an issue than or now really.  I own two DE razors, the mercur 180 and the 3\\&quot; slant.  The slant would tear my face up if I wasn&#x27;t carefeul with the feather blades (slight exageration)so after really not finding the Derby blade satisfactory on the 180 without 5 passes in all directions, and then with wet hands fumbling to pull a feather out of its paperwax sleeve before running out of  hot water.... I decided to try it in the slant.  Even with a much bigger ratio of blade exposed to your face, the Derby still failed to really give me a decent shave.....All in all the blades are cheap, but not worth it.  If this was the best blade out there, I would go back to a five blade cartridge.</li>
            <li> Husband love these, they are very sharp and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Ok so these blades are  sharp just dont stay sharp. Blade are great to shave with. I get the same result with these than I do with 5blade razor. I was suppose to receive 30CT but received 15CT 15blades total I was short 15 blades.. I like shaving with these but idk if its me but it goes dull after 1 shave maybe its cause I used shave oil who knows but I like these cheap blades they get the job done.. If they stayed sharp longer than 1 shave and if I received all 30CT I would rate 5star</li>
            <li> Just received these three weeks ago and trying them out, so far so good, no cuts, nick, razor burns, gives a better shave than those drug store razors and cost a lot less,  shipping was fast.  if your new to DE shaving, don&#x27;t slap on the soap and shave you won&#x27;t enjoy it, check some of the web site&#x27;s \\&quot;on how to DE shave\\&quot; for the half hour looking well give you a life time of good shaving and well cost you a lot less to shave.</li>
            <li> The old fashioned way is my husband&#x27;s preferred way to shave.  It has been difficult or expensive to find replacement double edge blades.  I didn&#x27;t really believe that I will receive the product of this quality at the price, and promptly.</li>
            <li> Great deal!! I like it. and I will recommend it to my friends! It is cheap and worth owning one.</li>
            <li> The title says it all, the blades are very smooth and last a long time. I have absolutely no complaints, Derby blades are a great product.</li>
            <li> Derby Blades are epic.  I can&#x27;t believe I used to pay $$$ for cartridges and disposable razors.  Combine these blades with the Lord Chrome Safety Razor and prepare for a close and economic shave.</li>
            <li> I guess if, two or three blades from now, I&#x27;ve run into issues, I&#x27;ll revisit the review, but I used one that came with my new Edwin Jagger razor, and I was very satisfied. I ended up shaving twice--once with the grain, and once either laterally or against the grain--because I am rather obsessive about wanting a really close, smooth shave, and I got no burn, no odd bumps. I&#x27;d also recommend, by the way, a really nice shaving cream that lathers out of a brush, rather than rubbing on various \\&quot;micro\\&quot; junk that is overpriced and probably contributes as much as multi-blades to skin irritation. I&#x27;m using a George Trumper container of violet shaving cream, worked in with a boar hair brush, and the results have been a creamy, smooth shave, even with a slightly dull Dovo straight razor (slightly dull because the only wetstone I got originally was a 6,000 grit, which does absolutely nothing towards resharpening a dulling blade).</li>
            <li> These Derby blades are very cost effective and are sharp enough to give an excellent shave without being so sharp they cut up your face (like the feather blades).  They are similar to the Merkur blades, but at a much cheaper cost.</li>
            <li> They are the first blades I&#x27;ve used with my new safety razor so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to other than the big Gillette cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They give me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  The Gillete cartridges would cause all kinds of razor burn and my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow would come in at around 4 later that day.  The Derby&#x27;s haven&#x27;t caused any razor burn whatsoever, and the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow waits until 5 in the morning the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m pleased, price/performance is great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re inexpensive blades, and it shows. I have a thin beard with coarse hair. One blade goes dull before I&#x27;m even done shaving once. Forget about trying to get a second shave from one of these- it ain&#x27;t going to happen.</li>
            <li> Of course, as with all things YMMV. I have been using these [[ASIN:B002OC76CW Derby Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]] for a couple of weeks in my 1960s Gillette Adjustable set on 4/5 and found them to be great blades. The 5/6 setting tended to be a bit harsh and the 3/4 setting too light. I can get three good shaves, one Ok shave, and one crappy shave from one blade (I suggest changing blades before the Ok shave). When I switch to my EJ8911 these blades don&#x27;t work as well. I could not get a close shave even with 4 passes. So far, the EJ8911 seems to prefer a more \\&quot;high performance\\&quot; blade like Feather. All in all, I&#x27;d say they are good blades and that you should try them for yourself. I will be re-ordering some of these.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a double edged safety razor about two years ago, and started off with Derby as they were the most recommended starting set of blades for beginners. In short, they&#x27;re enough to get you going, but it won&#x27;t be long before you want to move onto something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are on the duller end of the scale as far as shaving razors go. You&#x27;ll be less likely to cut yourself if you make a mistake. The flip side is that you only get a handful of decent shaves before the blade starts tugging on stubble, which can lead to a fair amount of razor burn. After borrowing a set of Astras from a friend, the difference was night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, their short half-life didn&#x27;t stop me from finishing off the package. If you&#x27;re just getting into wet shaving with double edge razors, this would be a good place to start. I just don&#x27;t expect you to want to stay on these stepping stones for too long.</li>
            <li> sharp and amazing for what I need them for, you get a lot so I will never run out of them.</li>
            <li> I  really like these, not a lot of tugging and lasts long to. Not great for heavy beards or stubble better for light but find the one that woks for you.</li>
            <li> On the third blade now.  These aren&#x27;t as comfortable as my &#x27;stash&#x27; of Gillette or Wilkinson from past decades.&lt;br /&gt;I think they&#x27;re thinner and perhaps not as well coated.  Living in the past, I guess.  I need just one good edge,&lt;br /&gt;not six as in today&#x27;s hyper-turbo-marketed wonder-toys, but these Derbys are just okay, not enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Love these blades.  As a former user of those expensive multi blade shavers I cannot help but think why did I waste all that money for so long.  I get just as great a shave as I did before for a lot less money!</li>
            <li> These blades are nice the price is right. I have used some better blades like the merkur blades I just love. But these get the jb done too.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on a whim- I was curious about the quality and certainly couldn&#x27;t pass on the price.  After going through about a dozen blades, I peg these at about 3 out of 5 stars.  While the blades are fairly sharp, they tend to dull rather quickly.  I can get about 2 shaves out of them before they start tearing up the face. I normally get 3 shaves out of Feathers and Wilkinson Swords. I&#x27;ll use up what I have, but will not purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Razor blades. Sharp. Fit into safety razor handles and work well for shaving. Seem to keep a keen edge for several shaves.</li>
            <li> these blades are, but not the best. if u have  a thick beard i recommend feather, asta, wilkinson sword or personna.</li>
            <li> Received 6 five-blade packs. They even threw in a pre-shave oil sample! These blades are very nice, and if you haven&#x27;t tried Derby before you definitely should.</li>
            <li> After trying some other blades I find these unacceptably dull.  I have tried Feathers, Lords Super, and Sharks super chrome and they all work great, feel sharp and last a week or so.  These Derbys seem to be as dull as the other blades I use when I&#x27;m ready to throw them in the bin.  Admittedly I have sensitive skin, but for the same sort of price you can get better.</li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s the story: these blades are very sharp, smoothly finished, and give me an excellent, very close shave with very little effort on my part.  They also seem quite forgiving, also, which would probably make them an excellent choice for a beginner. Which I&#x27;m not; except for a brief excursion into the Horrid Land of Marketing, when I used Mach3&#x27;s and a couple of other multi-blade \\&quot;wonder cartridges\\&quot;, a double-edge safety razor has always been my weapon of choice for attacking facial hair. Why do I call them \\&quot;wonder cartridges\\&quot;?  Because I wonder now why the hell I ever paid that much money for a mediocre-at-best shave, that&#x27;s why!    To sum up: these blades give me an outstanding, very, very close shave with no nicks, cuts, or pulling and tugging, plus they last for at least four or five excellent shaves.  And, they&#x27;re just ridiculously cheap when you consider the quality.  Definitely my \\&quot;blades of choice.\\&quot;  I get as good, or better, a shave with Derby Extras as I do with Feathers, Merkurs or Timors.  And they cost only about a THIRD as much!  Settles the blade issue for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing particularly fancy or exciting about these blades - but there are a lot of them at a good price.  That&#x27;s really all I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li> Great blades.  I get tired of &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34; razors and this makes using an older style razor so much better, economical and environment friendly - at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They are sterile, sharp, clean, thin, and do not snap in half (unless you apply enough force/pressure to it.) They came in quickly and did the job. I&#x27;m quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Sharp and close finish. I can easly get 2 or 3 shaves uut of one blade. I am prone to razor burn but with these blades I have greatly reduces the bumps</li>
            <li> Product name: Derby Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct     These are the DERBY EXTRA Super Stainless Double Edge with Chromium-Ceramic Platinum Tungsten Polymer Coated Edges.   They come in 6 packs, each pack contains 5 blades.    I have been useing these as my everyday blades. I do not get an incredibly close shave with these, but I do get a very nice, comfortable shave. A good deal. Go ahead and try them.</li>
            <li> These blades will do the job.  Very sharp.  I get about three shaves on sharp blades and I have been averaging five on these Derbys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Platinum Express blades before and felt that my shave could do with some upgrading. So when I got some Proraso shaving cream, I decided to get some better blades too. Derby blades \\&quot;make the cut\\&quot; (pun sadly intended), and seem at least a bit sharper than the other ones, which contrary to some people&#x27;s opinions, makes a smoother shave. Less pulling and such. These ones still pull a bit on my hair sometimes, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, and its true, its all about YOUR beard and face. I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and thought I had a tough beard. I find these blades to be just right. Others may find them to be a bit dull. They are great for beginners as you won&#x27;t walk away with blood pouring down your face into the sink. I find I can get a week worth of shaves per blade, and for the cost that&#x27;s awesome. Now I get a nice clean and smooth shave as well. Very happy with price and product. The merchant who sold me the blades on amazon was great too. very fast well packaged. In addition to these blades I purchased the Merkur barber pole razor. Good combo.</li>
            <li> Not particularly sharp. Perhaps Derby blades work well for people that shave every day, but I shave twice a week. These razors make it harder than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> your mileage may very, I was able to use these blades about 3 times each before they became too dull and started to cut me. I have a very course facial hair. still not a bad deal</li>
            <li> Good Value for double edged blades. Where do the stores come off charing in excess of $10 for 5 blades?</li>
            <li> these blades are utterly s***!!!</li>
            <li> Good blades ! Would buy again !</li>
            <li> After my first shave with these, they&#x27;re totally fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 100 pack and a 200 pack out there for order too, at an even lower per-blade price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After shaving with 5-10 of these blades, I understand what the other reviewer say when they comment on how they&#x27;re not quite as sharp as other blades. Still, I do like these blades because my beard isn&#x27;t very coarse and the slightly duller blades irritate me less than an aggressive sharper blade would. And the price is really hard to beat. So...still a good product!</li>
            <li> I just recently switched over to double edge razors from disposable/cartridges and I am very pleased with the results of these blades.  While I can&#x27;t compare how they stack up to other double edge blades, I can tell you that they are far superior to any disposable razor or cartridge razor you can buy at the drugstore as I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I am no stranger to wet shaving but never knew what I was missing until recently.  Throughout the years I have learned that the best advertised product is not necessarily the best quality product.  My change towards a better shave started with a badger brush and some proraso shaving cream, the DE razor came later.  As I obtained more tools and techniques, my shave has progressively gotten better everytime.  I no longer dread shaving in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades work best if you take three passes.  Go with the grain on the first pass, rinse and re-lather.  Take the razor at a slight angle to the hair on the second and third passes with a lather and rinse in between and you&#x27;ll get a nice, close shave without irritation.  If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving, look online for the tools and techniques used.  I hear that the Derby&#x27;s are forgiving and so that is why I started with these instead of a sampler pack.</li>
            <li> So as any wet shaver knows, you have to try a lot of blades to find the ones for you. After trying something in the range of 50 blades, from Wilkinson Sword&#x27;s (aka razor graters) to Feathers (samurai swords for your face), I finally settled on Derby&#x27;s. They&#x27;re aggressive enough to cut through my thick beard (especially in an old open-comb Gillette), but not so much that they shave a layer of skin off (looking at you, Feather!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great all-around blade. Awesome quality, too.</li>
            <li> Since I returned to using double edge razors in 2011, I have tried several brands of blades.I find&lt;br /&gt;that Derby blades give me a smooth close shave every time. I have tried other brands which are more expensive, but Derby is  one of the best blades available</li>
            <li> Use them to shave everyday and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;Brand new they can be sharp but after one shaving its more forgiving when you shave.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.  These blades are nothing flashy just sturdy good old fashioned blades that get the job done and done well!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of blades and found these to work best for the money. I use them in a 1974 Gillette Flair Tip. I get 3 to 4 good shaves from each one.</li>
            <li> If you shave with this type of razor...DONT GO WITH THE CHEAP ONES!  Tried some bargain blades and WONT do it again.  Worth every penny!  AND saves your face alot of discomfort!  Only blades I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
            <li> I prefer them over Wilkinson Swords and Gillette 7&#x27;o clocks.  They were sharp enough to give me a closer shave than the other two, and no nicks (I got two after half a dozen shaves with the Wilkinsons).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband used them in his razor as well, he still doesn&#x27;t think they get as close as the electric razor for him.  He has only tried twice, so it is probably lack of experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased these blades along with a Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle. For the price they are well worth it. I will never buy cheap plastic (or expensive plastic for that matter) disposable razors that seem to consistently pull at your face and leave nicks again. They do require some patience and in my opinion are not as close a shave as you might get from Mach 3 or similar razor, but the do work, and work well.</li>
            <li> Seem to be factory originals. Some seem to last longer than others: sometimes I get 3-4 shaves other times I get 5-6 before I start cutting myself up.&lt;br /&gt;I go back and forth between these and Feather blades.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my new DE razor and am completely blown away with how amazing they are. Forget the razors that have 1000 blades on them, if you want the closest shave with no irritation buy these razors. They cut through my thick stubborn whiskers like they weren&#x27;t even there.</li>
            <li> Just started using them but it seems one side of the blade were dull while the other was really sharp...</li>
            <li> There were my first DE razor blades, but I am very happy with them.  Way cheaper than the track-two blades I used to use, and I get a baby&#x27;s bottom smooth shave.</li>
            <li> OK, we all know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different. One person&#x27;s great blade is another&#x27;s nightmare.  For me, the Derby is a mild blade; a little on the dull side with a fair amount of drag. So, it takes a tad more effort than with my preferred blade, the Israeli Personnas (packaged under the \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; brand). However, the Derby is okay when you need a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; shave ... particularly, when the skin is irritated or you&#x27;ve raised a weeper or two due to bad technique.  Due to the lesser sharpness of these blades, the Derbys will allow you to shave gently over tender spots without causing further damage from a very sharp blade. They are also good for use in aggressive razors to provide some form of offset.  So, I use the Derbys sparingly for those types of specific situations. Trust me, even your absolute favorite blade is not necessarily good for all occasions.</li>
            <li> The razors are not quite sharp enough to achieve a baby&#x27;s butt shave unless you want to carve into your cheeks(no pun intended). The picture is also misleading: there are way fewer blades than the picture implies. You will get six of those little plastic dispensers. These are a real bummer. Proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> These were the first blades I bought when I ventured into the world of double edged shaving. These blades really tore up my face. I used about 5 of them at which point I was considering giving up and going back to my mach 3, thinking that I didn&#x27;t have the ability to use this style of razor without destroying my face. I decided to order a different blade just to see if it was my problem or the blade&#x27;s. So I ordered a pack of Shark super chrome and what a world of difference, totally great shave. I still think I can find a better blade than the sharks though too, but they are definitely a huge step above these derbys. I&#x27;ll probably give feather a try soon. I think if you have a very light beard and thin hair, these blades might be ok, otherwise don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I am used to but it is ok for the prize. I will buy it again until I find the right double edge blade that fit my shaving habit.</li>
            <li> The shave I get from these Derby&#x27;s is very good. They&#x27;re smooth, durable, and don&#x27;t pull at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was quite upsetting though. The picture suggests you&#x27;ll get a nicely boxed set of 5&#x27;s. What I got was a tied off plastic bag with razors tossed in. I hope it was a fluke and that they don&#x27;t do this for everyone. I know human error happens, but I hope quality assurance verifies their advertised packaging vs their deliverable.</li>
            <li> I had been using these Derby blades for years. Loved them as they were great value for money, great quality and come in packs of 5 which also can store the used blades afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only dropping the stars to 3 and this could be unfair because it could be me changing, but they don&#x27;t seem to stay sharp nearly as long as they used to and the recent batches have caused a lot more nicks shaving than they ever did in the past.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Merkur 180 safety razor recently and had heard that different blades are better for certain people, so I decided to try multiple brands of blades before I settled on one. I have used 10 Derby blades so far and found the quality to be inconsistent. Several of the blades were sharp on one side but acted as though they had been used for months on the other. I am willing to pay a little more for better quality, so I&#x27;ll probably not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Good price. I use these on occasion and they work well. They stay sharp for a few good shaves. Nice and close</li>
            <li> Not really that great.  Not really that sharp.  I&#x27;ve moved on to either Astras or Feather blades.</li>
            <li> These blades give a good shave, and they come in convenient little packs that keep them from breaking in storage.</li>
            <li> Garbage. Pure garbage. enough said.....I actually had to throw these away. No way I can use this with a quality razor. Perhaps with EJ (which is very very mild) you might be ok but with a merkur HD or open blade no way.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried Feather, Merkur, and now Derby.&lt;br /&gt;- Feather is like shaving with a scalpel so I use those only on special occassions. It&#x27;s the shave you wear with a Tux.&lt;br /&gt;- Merkur isnt as dangerous as Feather and does a great job even after the amount of recommended shaves per blade. It&#x27;s a great daily blade.&lt;br /&gt;- Derby I am finding to be dull. I&#x27;ll try a few more Derby blades and see if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> Returning to the wet shave scene, I tried this blade and found it to be an excellent blade.  Shaving every other day and using my Silver Tone Double Edge razor, I got three great, close shaves, while the fourth shave was a bit more laborious, but passable.  I have only compared it to the more expensive Feather blades and this one gave me better shaves and more shaves.  I plan to try other blades in the future, just for comparison purposes, since these are rated not as sharp as others (although I am more than highly satisfied with them).</li>
            <li> these blades are only second to feather for me, that of course depends on your skin but these blades are always going to be in my stash.</li>
            <li> These blades shouldn&#x27;t be sold. The few times I shaved with them my face felt raw because they were so dull.</li>
            <li> its very nice item  i been wanting one for years  now  i dont have to go buy  every month,  thank you  i will save  money  and it works  very good</li>
            <li> These are great little blades. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I took a chunk out of my pinky when I first got them. That&#x27;s not going to grow back, but now I revere them. They are great for children!</li>
            <li> If you ever had the pleasure of visiting a barber shop in Turkey this is the steel they use. Top notch product. Plus at this price it is an unbeatable deal. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this box for a good price and it will last these blades are good last a week of daily shaving. I am good for the end of the world with a few boxes</li>
            <li> Nice blades.  I&#x27;d recommend them to try out.</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift to complete a safety razor set, completely satified! recommended to anyone looking to buy anything similar</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking I was getting 30 packs of razors. Instead, I ended up with 6 packs all with (5) razors in them. Then when I attempted to return them I&#x27;d spend just as much money sending them back as it did to buy them. Not worth it. I can spend $3.00 and get(30) razors from tthe beauty supply. Thought I was getting a deal. Instead I just got hustled! Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I only use these blades to sharpen up my hairline, because they pulled and tugged on my face, and caused some irritation. They are good for beginners who are new to shaving, but I needed blades that were more aggressive like the Feathers.</li>
