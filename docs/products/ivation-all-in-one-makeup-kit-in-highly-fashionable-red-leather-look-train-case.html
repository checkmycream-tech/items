            <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Ver very good quality eyeshadow and lip</li>
            <li>When opened some of the eye shadows cracked otherwise it was a very good buy.</li>
            <li>While, by design, the tiers rest on one another, access is very good and you can even lift the standalone trays out from the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this set!</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this makeup kit!</li>
            <li>That is always a good thing!</li>
            <li>I was happy to see it was just like picture on Amazon website just beautiful.....</li>
            <li>This is a great make up kit.</li>
            <li>This makeup box came in very handy with the eye shadow</li>
            <li>Comes with everything very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice gift.</li>
            <li>Very nice and has everything you need.</li>
            <li>Many colors and great for beginners!  </li>
            <li>Great product, my wife loved it.</li>
            <li>She eas delighted.  </li>
            <li>It was a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>My wife really loved the producted, the make up seems to have quality.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it keeps my bathroom clean without stacks of containers</li>
            <li>There is a lot of makeup in here, and most of it is great.</li>
            <li>My daughter love this make up kit!  </li>
            <li>So many options to choose!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re good at applying makeup you can get some fairly spectacular eyes out of this set, and I&#x27;d have to say that the shadow collection is really the best part of the All-in-One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye pencils?  </li>
            <li>and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Liked, it was the one I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off using a set of good eye brushes with them.  </li>
            <li>Either way you&#x27;re going to need your own mascara to finish your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will make a nice gift</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the makeup isn&#x27;t top notch, it is actually surprisingly nice and seems to stay well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect present for any makeup lover!</li>
            <li>She said it had so many things.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to wait for many days, it was faster than I thought</li>
            <li>Was actually better than what she was expecting.</li>
            <li>Love the carrying case</li>
            <li>I love everything about this set.  </li>
            <li>I love a couple of the shades of blush, I love a couple of the shades of lipstick and I love the case it comes in.  </li>
            <li>The eye shadow, which comes in a stunning array of colors, many of them quite beautiful, is good, but again a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>The makeup quality is better than you would expect for the money, and the quantity is pretty staggering - in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The train case and integrated mirror made this her go-to kit for vacations and traveling.</li>
            <li>cause she loved it so much!  </li>
            <li>love the box but the makeup holders are plastic and break easily , also the stand broke</li>
            <li>it just broke easily</li>
            <li>Very compact, nice size for a beginner or an old hand, very nice case</li>
            <li>The case is so convenient, it would be great for traveling, for a team (drama, cheerleaders, school play etc) because the price is very reasonable and there is so much variety.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be cheap</li>
            <li>Free bottle included</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a free sample to test for my review.</li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>The makeup is cheap and shotty.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I&#x27;m excited to.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see that the make-up kit I ordered arrived on time and when I opened it.</li>
            <li>You can safely deduct that I didn&#x27;t buy this one for myself ;-)</li>
            <li>I wanted something special for her.</li>
            <li>Arrived in great condition, a little goes a long way and color options are beautiful.</li>
            <li>but man it was good quality for a low price</li>
            <li>sum up, it&#x27;s a nice collection of slightly lower-end makeup in a cute case.  </li>
            <li>To sum up, it&#x27;s a nice collection of slightly lower-end makeup in a cute case.  </li>
            <li>worth every cent.</li>
            <li>The color does smudge easily with a damp swab -- possibly too easily -- so smoothing out your line is easier than you might fear.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the kind of lip stick they gave dark purple and light brown</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift for christmas and all i can say is that its only suitable for childeren.</li>
            <li>The ideal gift for a teen aged girl.</li>
            <li>My mom found this exact one at Ulta beauty</li>
            <li>Nice quality with a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Just be aware.  </li>
            <li>Only con is the smell is a bit strong, but I&#x27;m dealing with that pretty well.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, the lipstick is dry, so I put a lip conditioner on first and a bit of gloss over the top.</li>
            <li>The colors are good, but the actual makeup is a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleas</li>
            <li>It looks better than expected and the carrying case keeps all the make up organized!</li>
            <li>My granddaughter is at the right age that she particularly enjoys playing dress up, complete with make up.</li>
            <li>The Housemate tells me that most collections don&#x27;t include mascara, though the big ones I&#x27;ve seen generally do.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 18 year old daughter, she absolutely adore it!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t high end makeup.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t figure out how to open it up in the 3 different steps, but when she saw it, she was so excited!</li>
            <li>It took me about ten minutes just to get the pencil on and looking right.  </li>
            <li>This was particularly apparent to me when I looked at the lip colors which in the photo show up as ranging from true red to blue-reds and burgundies.  </li>
            <li>all the makeup is presented in a very professional manner.</li>
            <li>A statement on their website seems to imply that they don&#x27;t, but really says exactly nothing on the subject while using a whole lot of words.  </li>

            <li>This case allows her to have a complete set of makeup that she can use when at Grammy&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li>The mirror was completely cracked when I received it</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 8 year old for play.  </li>
            <li>like the case very much, but the design of the trays makes it necessary to remove them from the case in order to open them up.  </li>

            <li>The powder and blush requires a bit of work, particularly with the tiny brush that&#x27;s included.  </li>
            <li>It was sent out quickly and arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>Alas, most collections are a whole lot more expensive than this one, particularly collections with such an extensive array of colors and products, so by any standards you can say that the Jumbl All-in-One is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>

            <li> It would also be a fun dress up gift for a little girl, or those of us with inner little girls who still like to play dressup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My inner girl comes out when I see makeup collections like this, and I long to buy them and sit in front of the mirror and play with all the colors.  </li>
            <li> I should stress here that the consistency of these items doesn&#x27;t make them unusable, it simply makes them a bit harder to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lipsticks are, again, a bit dry except for the gloss.  </li>
            <li> A dry pencil will drag on your lid and apply spottily.  </li>
            <li> but if your children don&#x27;t destroy things they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Only used 2 colors just this past weekend because i had no choice.</li>
            <li> I ordered them later than I usually would&#x27;ve due to someone letting the cat out of the bag on my orginal gift.</li>
            <li> The case is a little flimsy</li>
            <li> Mine were almost all in the brownish-pink family, not good colors for me.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t see this cause I sent it to my granddaughter,  but she called to thank me cause she loved it so much!  She said it had so many things.  She eas delighted.  It was a good value for the money.  It was sent out quickly and arrived earlier than expected.  That is always a good thing!</li>
            <li> Liked, it was the one I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t have to wait for many days, it was faster than I thought</li>
            <li> This makeup box came in very handy with the eye shadow but I didn&#x27;t like the kind of lip stick they gave dark purple and light brown</li>
            <li> This is a great make up kit.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I&#x27;m excited to. Free bottle included</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this kit.</li>
            <li> The product came on time. When opened some of the eye shadows cracked otherwise it was a very good buy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my choice</li>
            <li> My wife really loved the producted, the make up seems to have quality. Was actually better than what she was expecting. Recommended</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is at the right age that she particularly enjoys playing dress up, complete with make up. This case allows her to have a complete set of makeup that she can use when at Grammy&#x27;s house. Best of all, it keeps my bathroom clean without stacks of containers everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the makeup isn&#x27;t top notch, it is actually surprisingly nice and seems to stay well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to test for my review.</li>
            <li> One of the best gifts to give to a women that loves makeup. Comes with everything very nice. Great product overall.</li>
            <li> The mirror was completely cracked when I received it</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for christmas and all i can say is that its only suitable for childeren. The makeup is cheap and shotty. All the oil based products were melted when received. Only used 2 colors just this past weekend because i had no choice. Would never give as a gift. Just a dissapointment.</li>
            <li> love the box but the makeup holders are plastic and break easily , also the stand broke I had to glue it back. I got this for my 9 year old to play make up , she snot rough it just broke easily</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see that the make-up kit I ordered arrived on time and when I opened it. I was happy to see it was just like picture on Amazon website just beautiful.....</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition, a little goes a long way and color options are beautiful. Only con is the smell is a bit strong, but I&#x27;m dealing with that pretty well.</li>
            <li> You can safely deduct that I didn&#x27;t buy this one for myself ;-) But the wife loves it and has found it to be the best kit to test face and eye color combinations. The makeup quality is better than you would expect for the money, and the quantity is pretty staggering - in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The train case and integrated mirror made this her go-to kit for vacations and traveling. While, by design, the tiers rest on one another, access is very good and you can even lift the standalone trays out from the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faux leather or no, this is a real good value and a personable gift that is well received.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 18 year old daughter, she absolutely adore it! She didn&#x27;t figure out how to open it up in the 3 different steps, but when she saw it, she was so excited! Very nice gift. Love the carrying case it&#x27;s in too</li>
            <li> There is a lot of makeup in here, and most of it is great. As mentioned, the lipstick is dry, so I put a lip conditioner on first and a bit of gloss over the top. The blush, eye makeup, powder is where this kit shines. It&#x27;s excellent. The case is so convenient, it would be great for traveling, for a team (drama, cheerleaders, school play etc) because the price is very reasonable and there is so much variety. It would also be a fun dress up gift for a little girl, or those of us with inner little girls who still like to play dressup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would go ahead and buy a set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> My daughter has not stopped applying make up since she received this make up kit!  Nice quality with a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife. She loved it.</li>
            <li> I sent it as a Christmas present to a teenager. She absolutely loved it!!! The ideal gift for a teen aged girl. I wanted something special for her.</li>
            <li> My inner girl comes out when I see makeup collections like this, and I long to buy them and sit in front of the mirror and play with all the colors.  Alas, most collections are a whole lot more expensive than this one, particularly collections with such an extensive array of colors and products, so by any standards you can say that the Jumbl All-in-One is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well,there&#x27;s a reason for that.  This isn&#x27;t high end makeup.  The colors are good, but the actual makeup is a bit dry.  The powder and blush requires a bit of work, particularly with the tiny brush that&#x27;s included.  The eye shadow, which comes in a stunning array of colors, many of them quite beautiful, is good, but again a bit dry.  You&#x27;d be better off using a set of good eye brushes with them.  If you&#x27;re good at applying makeup you can get some fairly spectacular eyes out of this set, and I&#x27;d have to say that the shadow collection is really the best part of the All-in-One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye pencils?  Again dryish, and this is where it becomes a problem.  A dry pencil will drag on your lid and apply spottily.  It took me about ten minutes just to get the pencil on and looking right.  The color does smudge easily with a damp swab -- possibly too easily -- so smoothing out your line is easier than you might fear.  Also?  There&#x27;s no mascara in this collection.  None.  The Housemate tells me that most collections don&#x27;t include mascara, though the big ones I&#x27;ve seen generally do.  Either way you&#x27;re going to need your own mascara to finish your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipsticks are, again, a bit dry except for the gloss.  I should stress here that the consistency of these items doesn&#x27;t make them unusable, it simply makes them a bit harder to use.  Making up will take you a bit longer than you imagine it will.  The colors in my case are significantly different from the colors in the product photos.  This was particularly apparent to me when I looked at the lip colors which in the photo show up as ranging from true red to blue-reds and burgundies.  Mine were almost all in the brownish-pink family, not good colors for me.  There were variations in the colors of the powders/blushes and shadows as well, though in neither case were those variations as problematic as with the lip colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the case very much, but the design of the trays makes it necessary to remove them from the case in order to open them up.  I managed to smash one of the blushes trying to take the taped-on lid off the bottom tray.  There&#x27;s no way to get to the lip brushes without taking the middle tray out of the case, so when you take the tray out to remove the lid, put the brushes somewhere else unless you want to be wrestling plastic every time you make up.  That&#x27;s badly thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, it&#x27;s a nice collection of slightly lower-end makeup in a cute case.  It is, as the product description says, wonderful for beginners, and people like me who go all gooey when we see something like this.  I do feel obligated to point out that all of this makeup has probably been tested on animals, though I have no way of knowing.  A statement on their website seems to imply that they don&#x27;t, but really says exactly nothing on the subject while using a whole lot of words.  Several watchdog groups list Cameo as a company to avoid.  I make no claims either way, and feel that it&#x27;s up to each individual to decide.  Just be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I was sent this product in exchange for a review.burgundies.  Mine were almost all in the brownish-pink family, not good colors for me.

            <li> You will not be disappointed. Very nice and has everything you need. It will make a nice gift</li>
            <li> These were gifts for my two girls from Santa Claus this year. I ordered them later than I usually would&#x27;ve due to someone letting the cat out of the bag on my orginal gift.I was very pleas ed they showed up on Christmas eve jus like it said they would and I was very impressed with the quality of them. The case is a little flimsy but if your children don&#x27;t destroy things they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this set.  I bought it for my 8 year old for play.  I love a couple of the shades of blush, I love a couple of the shades of lipstick and I love the case it comes in.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
