            <li>This is a very fine product.</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing and works best if pump it on the back of you hand and rub the serums together before applying.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Ok I admit it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>my skin started looking better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I have noticed a difference in the way my face looks.</li>
            <li>allwas looking to find somthing better</li>
            <li>I mostly use this serum once a day and on some occasions twice a day.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (14)</li>
            <li>I am using it now and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Skinmedica has some of the best facial products I have seen around in many years.</li>
            <li>Remember to be sure to check out the sellers rating before buying this...lots of fakes.  </li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>more than on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I had to remove the top to get cream out</li>
            <li>Love this product...just not the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s never looked this healthy.</li>
            <li>Seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li>After spending lots of $$$$ trying the latest and greatest for my skin with mixed results, I found Skin Medica&lt;br /&gt;through</li>
            <li>Fabulous for the face!</li>
            <li>One of the better products out there</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have also urged many friends to try it, and they love it</li>
            <li>I think it started making a difference and will try one more time</li>
            <li>I just turned 54 and my skin looks better now than it did 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love the price.  </li>
            <li>Getting it for a discounted price makes it all the more appealing.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin care product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I wish they were more understanding</li>
            <li>No joke, fantastic results!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sagging that is more problematic for me.</li>
            <li>Product does make face look better.</li>
            <li>love the way it makes my skin feel and look</li>
            <li>Then  Needs more moisture in winter.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay $260 for it there.</li>
            <li>though the package recommends using it twice a day, I only use it at night and feel the results are wonderful!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; is consistency; products are meant to be used daily for best results.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but it doesn&#x27;t come out well</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I think Obagi is a great product, but  I have not had the same results as the TNS.I am 43 years old with very nice skin and am happy to find a product that will help me keep it that way.</li>
            <li>Seems to cover more easily this way.</li>
            <li>It heals blemishes very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is already smoothing out some fine wrinkles on my face and</li>
            <li>Have lost a couple of fine lines</li>
            <li>If they put it in a smaller container you could fly w/ it easily.</li>
            <li>It gives you more fresh &amp; light to you face</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see that available here.</li>
            <li>Helps smooth texture of face and neck.</li>
            <li>It is light</li>
            <li>Product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>That confirmed my opinion of This product.</li>
            <li>and my skin is relatively smooth, but the jowls are beginning to show.</li>
            <li>Although finding this product on Amazon was a much more economical choice when compared to the price in salons, spas, and physicians offices.</li>
            <li>So not only is it a great product</li>
            <li>obviously it is one of the leading face care products and I would recommend it to anyone that wants the best for their skin</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy to purchase this product that I love soooooo much!!  </li>
            <li>This was a good product, fresh and new.</li>
            <li>This product was originally prescribed by my doctor.</li>
            <li>I have continued to use it (and love it) because it absolutely works!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for six months now and have noticed a significant change in the texture and appearance in my aging skin.</li>
            <li>An MD originally recommended this product, and I have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li>This product is very good but a little costly.</li>
            <li>When I get it from the Doctor&#x27;s office it is bright red!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really find a better skin product than TNS.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>The stuff really works great, and all the better at a hundred bucks less.</li>
            <li>This cleared up quickly once I started  using it again</li>
            <li>I have bought at regular price from local dermatologist and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen-my new favorite TIZO3-</li>
            <li>Was happy to find it for almost half the salon cost here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and love it!  </li>
            <li>Amazing, totally revitalized my skin after just couple of weeks-</li>
            <li>Skin looks amazing after 3 weeks of TNS Essential Serum but one side of the dual chamber dispenser quit working;(  </li>
            <li>lot number before i buy to ensure I get a fresh product</li>
            <li>so it raises a question of how fresh are these products.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Package was completely sealed and appears authentic.</li>
            <li>The price at the surgeons office was nearly $100 more</li>
            <li>Worth every penny or</li>
            <li>I normally use very high quality products with a high percentage of organic ingredients, so I am used to pretty good results.  </li>
            <li>Have used many other skin care products but love this stuff .</li>
            <li>Item was received quickly and was exactly as presented.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s important to buy from sellers with high ratings.</li>
            <li>and this is the only product that gave me great results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>the left over is working really great on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for quite some time, and it was first recommended when I had a peel done.</li>
            <li>but, at first, my face looked brighter and plumber and difference was noticable.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME WAS 2-3 YEARS AGO</li>
            <li>Skinmedica&#x27;s Essential Serum is my favorite skincare product, and I must admit I am a skincare junkie</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t purchased this on Amazon yet because I like to be aware of the manufacturers</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look smooth and clear</li>
            <li>This serum really works!  </li>
            <li>PS, It was recommended by my dermatologist in the first place.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>I had scars from within the last year and had heard from the past that this product was perfect for that.</li>
            <li>I only wish I had more money to use it again.</li>
            <li>The most recent one I ordered(from Specialty Skincare/fulfilled by Amazon) had the expiration date clearly showing and was very fresh.</li>
            <li>I loved the first bottle I bought, but the second one is defective and doesn&#x27;t dispense the product properly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, be sure you get a fresh product by checking the expiration dates, and also be careful not to buy a a knock off.</li>
            <li>so I was extremely pleased to find it at such a reasonable price through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I see and feel the positive results as soon as I start using it again.</li>
            <li>So, all in all, for the price, I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m getting a good deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past, with good results.  </li>
            <li>My first bottle is almost finished, see my pictures, if you hold it against a light you can see how much is left inside.</li>
            <li>It does have a slight smell, kind of like mildew.  </li>
            <li>Immediately absorbed--feels like new skin!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without!!</li>
            <li>Initial application feels good, till dry.</li>
            <li>Fine lines seem to improve and not increase daily.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this produce by a very high end salon in NYC.</li>
            <li>Perhaps there is nothing out there that really works, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I credit it for keeping my neck and chest as smooth as possible.</li>
            <li>It is the real thing.</li>
            <li>The real stuff</li>
            <li>bought one of these on Amazon and I am convinced it is real, however, I have seen fakes out</li>
            <li>I really see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell...</li>
            <li>I really like this product, just not the price &amp; the fact it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the real deal, &amp; trust the seller to be legit-</li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t see much difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and really like it.</li>
            <li>I am really grateful that Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>Can tell it really made a difference in texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, and have never really seen or felt a difference.</li>
            <li>As it is, it takes up way too much space.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s December 2014 today and everyone wants to see my ID to buy alcohol when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>Use it about once a week when I don&#x27;t want to go through the whole Obagi routine.</li>
            <li>PS, My Doctor warned me that it had a funky smell, but that is how you know its real.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well.</li>
            <li>I have always felt like I was getting the real thing, but I have received defective bottles.</li>
            <li>For the price, I expected a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>I have already purchased another new bottle sealed in box on eBay for $110, I paid $120 for the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot and the price is more reasonable than any other place I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but I have to buy this product every other month.</li>
            <li>When I went to a spa and used a sample of the same product for sale it contained steams of bright red and white streams.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning and hope the distributor can refund my $$$ or send me new product!</li>
            <li>so I continued mixing it on the same hand and have asked several people which hand looked better.  </li>
            <li>This is my main skin cream.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>but this was highly recommended by a skin care spa that has served me well over the years.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is also high on the list, so if you like shea just buy a jar for $20.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>+ yr old skin is really getting what it needs.</li>
            <li>expensive but great..</li>
            <li>So where ever you choose to buy make sure you do your research and make an informed decision so as not to waste your money.</li>
            <li>, I went right out and bought their THS Essential Serum from my dermatologist ($250!).</li>
            <li>I went right back to it, and will not stop again.  </li>
            <li>The pump did not work correctly, and the red serum was very light red and low in quanity .&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I started to see a difference in the first week actually.</li>
            <li>After the first month you could visually see the difference in the wrinkles in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Was told by a 26 year old  cosmetic tech at a well known cosmetic store in Belevue Square that I do not need and should not wear foundation on my face!  </li>
            <li>I had my first batch from him and the last two on AMAZON.</li>
            <li>This product only lasted me 2 months, it is pretty pricey</li>
            <li>this cream was going to do somthing special since it has a big price tag, but now i found out that big price means nothing.</li>
            <li>it has a slight tint but glides so smoothly over your skin</li>
            <li>I have also used the same bottle for almost 2 months which makes the price a little better as well.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this before and it was old and gross and way discolored, this time it was the real deal...</li>
            <li>Let me be clear here.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 8 weeks so far and can see a difference in the clarity and texture of my skin</li>
            <li>I also noticed an added benefit that some raised skin \\&quot;tags\\&quot; completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with results.</li>
            <li>So far I like it .</li>
            <li>Amazon offers substandard defective products from some of their vendors.</li>
            <li>I have used this serum for several years now, and feel it makes a real difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>Skin Medica&#x27;s TNS serum makes my skin feel young and supple.</li>
            <li>This will not last you more than a few months like some face products.</li>
            <li>I have had mostly good luck buying it on Amazon, but feel that some distributors send me an old product rather than a fake one.</li>
            <li>I have been using high and low end skin care product for years</li>
            <li>Great product but very expensive.</li>
            <li>I purchased the same from the doctor and it lasted much longer with the same frequency of usage.</li>
            <li>I do love this product, but it is simply much too expensive for a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the product will last, to be worth the VERY HIGH PRICE it cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the length of available use.  </li>
            <li>This actually seems to make some improvement in my old skin</li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;m viewed as much younger than my natural self.</li>
            <li>but if i were to place additional orders it would be through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used this product each morning and night for nearly 30 days, my initial impression remains that this is the nastiest smelling beauty I have ever used</li>
            <li>and it does not work any better or worse than other products ranging from Olay to high end</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a short time, but so far I like it, makes my face softer.</li>
            <li>the unexpected benefit is that when smoothing the left over on the back of my hand it makes it look plumper.</li>
            <li>I am not really sure if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>This item is the exact same that I purchase in my physician&#x27;s office only for less money.</li>
            <li>The TNS seems to be working comparably so far after about 3 weeks, Ive actually been combining it with some of my other products and am liking the results so far.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to prove that it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a very fine product.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing and works best if pump it on the back of you hand and rub the serums together before applying.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Ok I admit it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> my skin started looking better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I have noticed a difference in the way my face looks.</li>
            <li> allwas looking to find somthing better</li>

            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (14)</li>
            <li> I am using it now and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Skinmedica has some of the best facial products I have seen around in many years.</li>
            <li> Remember to be sure to check out the sellers rating before buying this...lots of fakes.  </li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> more than on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I had to remove the top to get cream out</li>
            <li> Love this product...just not the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s never looked this healthy.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li> After spending lots of $$$$ trying the latest and greatest for my skin with mixed results, I found Skin Medica&lt;br /&gt;through</li>
            <li> Fabulous for the face!</li>
            <li> One of the better products out there</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have also urged many friends to try it, and they love it</li>
            <li> I think it started making a difference and will try one more time</li>
            <li> I just turned 54 and my skin looks better now than it did 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the price.  </li>
            <li> Getting it for a discounted price makes it all the more appealing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin care product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I wish they were more understanding</li>
            <li> No joke, fantastic results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sagging that is more problematic for me.</li>
            <li> Product does make face look better.</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my skin feel and look</li>
            <li> Then  Needs more moisture in winter.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay $260 for it there.</li>
            <li> though the package recommends using it twice a day, I only use it at night and feel the results are wonderful!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; is consistency; products are meant to be used daily for best results.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but it doesn&#x27;t come out well</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I think Obagi is a great product, but  I have not had the same results as the TNS.I am 43 years old with very nice skin and am happy to find a product that will help me keep it that way.</li>
            <li> Seems to cover more easily this way.</li>
            <li> It heals blemishes very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is already smoothing out some fine wrinkles on my face and</li>
            <li> Have lost a couple of fine lines</li>
            <li> If they put it in a smaller container you could fly w/ it easily.</li>
            <li> It gives you more fresh &amp; light to you face</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see that available here.</li>
            <li> Helps smooth texture of face and neck.</li>
            <li> It is light</li>
            <li> Product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> That confirmed my opinion of This product.</li>
            <li> and my skin is relatively smooth, but the jowls are beginning to show.</li>
            <li> Although finding this product on Amazon was a much more economical choice when compared to the price in salons, spas, and physicians offices.</li>
            <li> So not only is it a great product</li>
            <li> obviously it is one of the leading face care products and I would recommend it to anyone that wants the best for their skin</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy to purchase this product that I love soooooo much!!  </li>
            <li> This was a good product, fresh and new.</li>
            <li> This product was originally prescribed by my doctor.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use it (and love it) because it absolutely works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for six months now and have noticed a significant change in the texture and appearance in my aging skin.</li>
            <li> An MD originally recommended this product, and I have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li> This product is very good but a little costly.</li>
            <li> When I get it from the Doctor&#x27;s office it is bright red!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really find a better skin product than TNS.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> The stuff really works great, and all the better at a hundred bucks less.</li>
            <li> This cleared up quickly once I started  using it again</li>
            <li> I have bought at regular price from local dermatologist and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen-my new favorite TIZO3-</li>
            <li> Was happy to find it for almost half the salon cost here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and love it!  </li>
            <li> Amazing, totally revitalized my skin after just couple of weeks-</li>
            <li> Skin looks amazing after 3 weeks of TNS Essential Serum but one side of the dual chamber dispenser quit working;(  </li>
            <li> lot number before i buy to ensure I get a fresh product</li>
            <li> so it raises a question of how fresh are these products.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Package was completely sealed and appears authentic.</li>
            <li> The price at the surgeons office was nearly $100 more</li>
            <li> Worth every penny or</li>
            <li> I normally use very high quality products with a high percentage of organic ingredients, so I am used to pretty good results.  </li>
            <li> Have used many other skin care products but love this stuff .</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly and was exactly as presented.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s important to buy from sellers with high ratings.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product that gave me great results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> the left over is working really great on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for quite some time, and it was first recommended when I had a peel done.</li>
            <li> but, at first, my face looked brighter and plumber and difference was noticable.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME WAS 2-3 YEARS AGO</li>
            <li> Skinmedica&#x27;s Essential Serum is my favorite skincare product, and I must admit I am a skincare junkie</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t purchased this on Amazon yet because I like to be aware of the manufacturers</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look smooth and clear</li>
            <li> This serum really works!  </li>
            <li> PS, It was recommended by my dermatologist in the first place.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> I had scars from within the last year and had heard from the past that this product was perfect for that.</li>
            <li> I only wish I had more money to use it again.</li>
            <li> The most recent one I ordered(from Specialty Skincare/fulfilled by Amazon) had the expiration date clearly showing and was very fresh.</li>
            <li> I loved the first bottle I bought, but the second one is defective and doesn&#x27;t dispense the product properly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, be sure you get a fresh product by checking the expiration dates, and also be careful not to buy a a knock off.</li>
            <li> so I was extremely pleased to find it at such a reasonable price through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I see and feel the positive results as soon as I start using it again.</li>
            <li> So, all in all, for the price, I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m getting a good deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past, with good results.  </li>
            <li> My first bottle is almost finished, see my pictures, if you hold it against a light you can see how much is left inside.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell, kind of like mildew.  </li>
            <li> Immediately absorbed--feels like new skin!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without!!</li>
            <li> Initial application feels good, till dry.</li>
            <li> Fine lines seem to improve and not increase daily.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this produce by a very high end salon in NYC.</li>
            <li> Perhaps there is nothing out there that really works, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I credit it for keeping my neck and chest as smooth as possible.</li>
            <li> It is the real thing.</li>
            <li> The real stuff</li>
            <li> bought one of these on Amazon and I am convinced it is real, however, I have seen fakes out</li>
            <li> I really see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell...</li>
            <li> I really like this product, just not the price &amp; the fact it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the real deal, &amp; trust the seller to be legit-</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t see much difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and really like it.</li>
            <li> I am really grateful that Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li> Can tell it really made a difference in texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, and have never really seen or felt a difference.</li>
            <li> As it is, it takes up way too much space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s December 2014 today and everyone wants to see my ID to buy alcohol when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> Use it about once a week when I don&#x27;t want to go through the whole Obagi routine.</li>
            <li> PS, My Doctor warned me that it had a funky smell, but that is how you know its real.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well.</li>
            <li> I have always felt like I was getting the real thing, but I have received defective bottles.</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> I have already purchased another new bottle sealed in box on eBay for $110, I paid $120 for the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and the price is more reasonable than any other place I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but I have to buy this product every other month.</li>
            <li> When I went to a spa and used a sample of the same product for sale it contained steams of bright red and white streams.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning and hope the distributor can refund my $$$ or send me new product!</li>
            <li> so I continued mixing it on the same hand and have asked several people which hand looked better.  </li>
            <li> This is my main skin cream.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> but this was highly recommended by a skin care spa that has served me well over the years.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is also high on the list, so if you like shea just buy a jar for $20.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> + yr old skin is really getting what it needs.</li>
            <li> expensive but great..</li>
            <li> So where ever you choose to buy make sure you do your research and make an informed decision so as not to waste your money.</li>
            <li> , I went right out and bought their THS Essential Serum from my dermatologist ($250!).</li>
            <li> I went right back to it, and will not stop again.  </li>
            <li> The pump did not work correctly, and the red serum was very light red and low in quanity .&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I started to see a difference in the first week actually.</li>
            <li> After the first month you could visually see the difference in the wrinkles in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Was told by a 26 year old  cosmetic tech at a well known cosmetic store in Belevue Square that I do not need and should not wear foundation on my face!  </li>
            <li> I had my first batch from him and the last two on AMAZON.</li>
            <li> This product only lasted me 2 months, it is pretty pricey</li>
            <li> this cream was going to do somthing special since it has a big price tag, but now i found out that big price means nothing.</li>
            <li> it has a slight tint but glides so smoothly over your skin</li>
            <li> I have also used the same bottle for almost 2 months which makes the price a little better as well.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and it was old and gross and way discolored, this time it was the real deal...</li>
            <li> Let me be clear here.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 8 weeks so far and can see a difference in the clarity and texture of my skin</li>
            <li> I also noticed an added benefit that some raised skin \\&quot;tags\\&quot; completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with results.</li>
            <li> So far I like it .</li>
            <li> Amazon offers substandard defective products from some of their vendors.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for several years now, and feel it makes a real difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Skin Medica&#x27;s TNS serum makes my skin feel young and supple.</li>
            <li> This will not last you more than a few months like some face products.</li>
            <li> I have had mostly good luck buying it on Amazon, but feel that some distributors send me an old product rather than a fake one.</li>
            <li> I have been using high and low end skin care product for years</li>
            <li> Great product but very expensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased the same from the doctor and it lasted much longer with the same frequency of usage.</li>
            <li> I do love this product, but it is simply much too expensive for a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product will last, to be worth the VERY HIGH PRICE it cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the length of available use.  </li>
            <li> This actually seems to make some improvement in my old skin</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;m viewed as much younger than my natural self.</li>
            <li> but if i were to place additional orders it would be through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used this product each morning and night for nearly 30 days, my initial impression remains that this is the nastiest smelling beauty I have ever used</li>
            <li> and it does not work any better or worse than other products ranging from Olay to high end</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a short time, but so far I like it, makes my face softer.</li>
            <li> the unexpected benefit is that when smoothing the left over on the back of my hand it makes it look plumper.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This item is the exact same that I purchase in my physician&#x27;s office only for less money.</li>
            <li> The TNS seems to be working comparably so far after about 3 weeks, Ive actually been combining it with some of my other products and am liking the results so far.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to prove that it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
            <li> product has really made a difference in my skin, as it is plumper and just plain younger looking.</li>
            <li> Within a short period of time, there was dramatic decrease in the fine lines and wrinkles and an improvement in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is very disappointing, I expect great results or at least a reasonable improvement</li>
            <li> Strange thing is almost ALL of these glowing reviews are from people who have only written reviews for this</li>
            <li> The price through Amazon was far less than through my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> use this product along with several other product as my daily regimen:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> If it does not last at least 2 months - it will be UNAFFORDABLE, even for the above average house whole Encome.</li>
            <li> The long ingredient list includes perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear to me if this is a fresh or an outdated product.  </li>
            <li> As far as expiration and all that goes, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviews mention that the product does not last long with regular use; I can&#x27;t wait for this to run out and have relegated it to use on my feet in the evenings before sleeping in heavy socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck!</li>
            <li> Its very expensive, however its made such a fantastic difference to my skin</li>
            <li> and if you have very dry skin you may need an additional moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that I finished it so quickly given the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of serums and treatments out there, and this can be expensive, but you only have one face, so why not spend the bucks (from a purchaser who&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> This product has two streams of product - a dark red and a separated dark cream colored stream.  </li>
            <li> But TNS essential is too iffy to waste money on.</li>
            <li> It was expensive but based on the results, the product is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I expected to see some diminishing of lines but it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.</li>
            <li> only thing I would change is the packaging ,  there seems to be wasted product in tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will try for a few months before my final review.</li>
            <li> A big waste of money.  </li>
            <li> be careful when you buy</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels less dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I wear very little make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews, I always buy from my face doctor</li>
            <li> Combined with other products from this  company.</li>
            <li> Wear it over your vitamin C  product (for me, Obagi) and under sunscreen or other skin care product.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice on my neck and threw it away due to the smell.</li>
            <li> Strong perfume smell for the first few seconds, then smells horrible.</li>
            <li> It helps heal the occasional pimple/ breakout that I pop and it takes care of the mark left behind too.</li>
            <li> If the white lotion is turning dark, that is my clue that it is past</li>
            <li> I knew that it might be hard to notice if I only used it on my face</li>
            <li> Also the method for applying a pump to the back of your hand (for mixing) causes a small amount to be wasted on the hand.</li>
            <li> Average product, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat expensive at the Doctor&#x27;s office and I appreciate the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are less noticeable  </li>
            <li> The prices on Amazon are $100 less then in my doctors office.</li>
            <li> I previously had a bottle that I got from a doctor, but I threw it away before I thought to compare it to the ones purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> 2 x daily according to the 1-pump application directions--very expensive for that short  length of time!</li>
            <li> About $70 less on Amazon than  through the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Seriously leave my face looking younger and even noticed my hands where I blend</li>
            <li> I searched and found it on Amazon for $100.00 less than retail.</li>
            <li> Same product that I purchase at my dermatologist only less expensive through Amazon</li>
            <li> A few months ago she suggested it again, and this time I bought it from Amazon at over $100 less.</li>
            <li> With my face a little damp .  </li>
            <li> A little delayed.</li>
            <li> My wife sees a little change after use.</li>
            <li> Three stars because I can&#x27;t say it does not deliver, deducting 2 for the smell and waste.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money again.    </li>
            <li> I have never had any problems with the pump and dispensing the product, skinmedica advises that you invert the bottle and tap it a few times before you pump it</li>
            <li> Use sunscreen everyday even in the winter  3.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and notice a difference in my complexion when I go without.</li>
            <li> I feel it has dried my skin.  </li>
            <li> This go round however</li>
            <li> Either the second bottle was crap or the whole thing is a scam</li>
            <li> It is a dual pump dispenser that delivers a mixture of this product (THS recovery complex) plus APS corrective Complex) in the other chamber, all to rejuvenate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered them over the past year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is legit or not.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m unable to determine whether or not this is, in fact, the actual product - it does seem to be.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past two years and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT cheap!</li>
            <li> It is the same product but not as expensive</li>
            <li> No crepey skin here and very few lines.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results and would be willing to wait for some, but I just hate the smell.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t see to attract my 2 cats.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up for at least 3 months as is recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Expensive item for little result.</li>
            <li> This is too expensive to waste ANY.</li>
            <li> Just so yall know - the real deal from the bad!!</li>
            <li> When I received the cream the pump was broken.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin, and this product smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> I am now addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the product only lasted approx.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is red, Yes, it smells horrific.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for about a month when I ran out because I was skeptical about purchasing from amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but a lot cheaper than the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this serum even though it is expensive.</li>
            <li> The mechanism for this expensive product is faulty.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but you asked.</li>
            <li> but I am skeptical of all these &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li> Although it is expensive it is cheaper than if I purchase it from my Dr. In Tucson</li>
            <li> but I hate the packaging.</li>
            <li> The one bad batch was an orange color!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So who knows what is in this. But. Some derm recommended it. And he doesn&#x27;t sell it and doesn&#x27;t own the company. So I decided to try it. It&#x27;s probably not science but I do like the cream. My skin is good but I got the genes and it&#x27;s enhanced. :) anyways. If you&#x27;re a junkie you&#x27;ll try any cream even one where they refuse to list ingredients. Ok I admit it. I have a problem .......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product recommended by my derm, but only once a day. I have not seen any results and would be willing to wait for some, but I just hate the smell. It lingers for awhile, even after the serum dries and I apply my moisturizer over it. Also the method for applying a pump to the back of your hand (for mixing) causes a small amount to be wasted on the hand. This is too expensive to waste ANY. At least it doesn&#x27;t see to attract my 2 cats. Three stars because I can&#x27;t say it does not deliver, deducting 2 for the smell and waste.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and it was old and gross and way discolored, this time it was the real deal...&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews, I always buy from my face doctor (I&#x27;m 44)  When I&#x27;m there, in between visits I order online. When I get it from the Doctor&#x27;s office it is bright red! The one bad batch was an orange color! Just so yall know - the real deal from the bad!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Buy it!  I&#x27;ve tried everything else and this is the only product that gave me great results in a short period of time. About 5 days. Works great on fine lines and tone. It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I am not a verified purchaser, but reading all of the hubbub on Amazon makes me want to weigh in. I purchase this from a family member who  works at a plastic surgeon/dermatology spa. Yes, it is red, Yes, it smells horrific. AND (unless I am being totally duped) it has holes in the bottom.  I have been using it for quite some time, and it was first recommended when I had a peel done. I am not a person who scars or heals well, and it was suggested to help with that process. My skin was protected and did not scar or keloid. I know this is amazing stuff.  It has continued to plump, refine and even-out my skin. I know there are a lot of serums and treatments out there, and this can be expensive, but you only have one face, so why not spend the bucks (from a purchaser who&#x27;s the real deal. I cannot comment on counterfeits).</li>
            <li> This item is the exact same that I purchase in my physician&#x27;s office only for less money. I stopped using it for about a month when I ran out because I was skeptical about purchasing from amazon.  I finally figured I would try it and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Literally within a day of using it (I&#x27;m a twice a day user) my skin started looking better.  This product really is amazing, and I have tried a LOT of products over the years.  I will continue to purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have noticed a difference in the way my face looks. Wrinkles are less noticeable  and my skin is smoother. Would not be without it.</li>
            <li> I thoat this cream was going to do somthing special since it has a big price tag, but now i found out that big price means nothing. Im 34 with a very nice skin to began with ( I take good care of it) and  allwas looking to find somthing better but so faar nothing beats Obagi, specialy the tretinoin treatment with the blender. Nothing nothing beats Tretinoin with the blender combo from Obagi</li>
            <li> Love the product, great price on Amazon</li>
            <li> Either the second bottle was crap or the whole thing is a scam but, at first, my face looked brighter and plumber and difference was noticable. Now, I see no value at all and am frankly pissed off I wasted my money again.    Perhaps there is nothing out there that really works, I don&#x27;t know. But TNS essential is too iffy to waste money on.</li>
            <li> obviously it is one of the leading face care products and I would recommend it to anyone that wants the best for their skin</li>
            <li> NOT A PRODUCT PROMOTER BUT THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE SECOND TIME TO USE IT THE FIRST TIME WAS 2-3 YEARS AGO</li>
            <li> Skinmedica&#x27;s Essential Serum is my favorite skincare product, and I must admit I am a skincare junkie so I have a lot. I have been using it for 8 weeks so far and can see a difference in the clarity and texture of my skin, I started to see a difference in the first week actually. Fine lines seem to improve and not increase daily. It is not oily at all and if you have very dry skin you may need an additional moisturizer over it. My first bottle is almost finished, see my pictures, if you hold it against a light you can see how much is left inside. I mostly use this serum once a day and on some occasions twice a day. I have never had any problems with the pump and dispensing the product, skinmedica advises that you invert the bottle and tap it a few times before you pump it but I just invert the bottle while toning my face(see pics) and after I&#x27;m finished toning and pump the bottle I get the perfect combination of the 2 colored serums every time. I will continue to purchase this product because I can see results. It helps heal the occasional pimple/ breakout that I pop and it takes care of the mark left behind too. It&#x27;s an all in one product for me. I&#x27;m 30 with combination skin and I haven&#x27;t purchased this on Amazon yet because I like to be aware of the manufacturers lot number before i buy to ensure I get a fresh product and I don&#x27;t see that available here. I have already purchased another new bottle sealed in box on eBay for $110, I paid $120 for the first bottle. This is an expensive product so I must buy where I get it cheapest and it&#x27;s important to buy from sellers with high ratings. So where ever you choose to buy make sure you do your research and make an informed decision so as not to waste your money. That&#x27;s the key to shopping online.</li>
            <li> My face is glowing!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Makes my skin look smooth and clear</li>
            <li> This product works. Be patient. Don&#x27;t give up for at least 3 months as is recommended by my dermatologist. It&#x27;s expensive, but a lot cheaper than the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Average product, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just like what I paid an extra $100 for at the derms office..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear to me if this is a fresh or an outdated product.  This product has two streams of product - a dark red and a separated dark cream colored stream.  When I went to a spa and used a sample of the same product for sale it contained steams of bright red and white streams.  There are no expiration dates on the box nor the canister so it raises a question of how fresh are these products.  I&#x27;ve ordered them over the past year and I&#x27;m noticing that Amazon didn&#x27;t offered it, it was supplied by a third party.  So, all in all, for the price, I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m getting a good deal.  I might be but it&#x27;s hard to prove that it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and love it!  It&#x27;s great and worth the money.  My skin has defiinitely improved using this product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by the person who does my facials in the Dr.&#x27;s office.  Seems to work well. I use this in the A.M.  With my face a little damp .  Seems to cover more easily this way.</li>
            <li> I recently tried TNS essential serum and wanted proof that the product actually worked.  I mixed it on the same hand every day and rubbed the excess into my hand.  After the first month you could visually see the difference in the wrinkles in my hand.  I knew that it might be hard to notice if I only used it on my face so I continued mixing it on the same hand and have asked several people which hand looked better.  Every person I have asked has picked the hand that I have been mixing the serum on.  It was expensive but based on the results, the product is totally worth it. I have also used the same bottle for almost 2 months which makes the price a little better as well. I think Obagi is a great product, but  I have not had the same results as the TNS.I am 43 years old with very nice skin and am happy to find a product that will help me keep it that way.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  Got rid of some discoloration and decreasing acne scaring.</li>
            <li> Liquid silk for your face. Helps smooth texture of face and neck.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have been using Skin Medica since the product hit the market.  I have very dry skin and I am very fair.  So how to look 10 years younger????  1.  Stay out of the sun  2. Use sunscreen everyday even in the winter  3. Dont smoke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product along with several other product as my daily regimen:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lumxyl- to treat hyperpigmentation  2. Skin Medica Vit C  3. Skin Medica TNS essential Serum 4. Neocutis Bio-restorative cream  5. Sunscreen-my new favorite TIZO3- it has a slight tint but glides so smoothly over your skin it acts like a primer for your makeup foundation!  6. Neocutis eye cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product every morning and evening since the middle of May and I have not seen any improvements in my skin. This is very disappointing, I expect great results or at least a reasonable improvement but I see none.</li>
            <li> This product was originally prescribed by my doctor. I have continued to use it (and love it) because it absolutely works!</li>
            <li> Reluctantly tried this product because I thought it was pricey, but after just a week or so, I could tell a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.  I also noticed an added benefit that some raised skin \\&quot;tags\\&quot; completely disappeared.  I wish I could bathe in this stuff!  Pricey, but I will keep using this product for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (14) +. I credit it for keeping my neck and chest as smooth as possible. No crepey skin here and very few lines. The price through Amazon was far less than through my dermatologist. It is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered--no problems.</li>
            <li> This actually seems to make some improvement in my old skin</li>
            <li> The real stuff and I appreciate it!</li>
            <li> I have used it before and really liked it.  I am using it now and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Good product. A little delayed. But that was ok!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for your skin! A little goes a long way. I will continue to use this serum even though it is expensive. The product does what it says.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Saw results immediately..skin tighter, spots lighter, skin tone great!  Will definitely continue using this product. I&#x27;ve used this product for one month ... Pleasantly surprised with results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  My dermatologist sells it but it is a lot more expensive in the doctor&#x27;s office.  I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly and was exactly as presented.</li>
            <li> Great product! I will continue to order and use this product.</li>
            <li> Skinmedica has some of the best facial products I have seen around in many years. Before trying this I swore by Obagi ( which I still think is great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has really made a difference in my skin, as it is plumper and just plain younger looking. I was so impressed, I went right out and bought their THS Essential Serum from my dermatologist ($250!). It is a dual pump dispenser that delivers a mixture of this product (THS recovery complex) plus APS corrective Complex) in the other chamber, all to rejuvenate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these on Amazon and I am convinced it is real, however, I have seen fakes out here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, be sure you get a fresh product by checking the expiration dates, and also be careful not to buy a a knock off. The prices on Amazon are $100 less then in my doctors office. Just buy smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  3/3/14&lt;br /&gt;  I really see a difference in my skin and I am going to buy this product again.  Remember to be sure to check out the sellers rating before buying this...lots of fakes.  If my review was helpful, would you mind clicking below on the \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; button.  Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is legit or not. According to the Skin Medica website FAQ, Amazon and anyone selling on Amazon is not an authorized reseller. I&#x27;ve done a bit of research and I&#x27;m unable to determine whether or not this is, in fact, the actual product - it does seem to be. As far as expiration and all that goes, I&#x27;m not sure. I previously had a bottle that I got from a doctor, but I threw it away before I thought to compare it to the ones purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved the product. My only disappointment was that I finished it so quickly given the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends this product but it sells for 100. more than on Amazon.  Been using it for a month and it seems to help make my skin look firmer and healthier!</li>
            <li> Which you would expect for the price...but I have used this product for 18 months now and I love it.  My skin is clearer and smoother. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and notice a difference in my complexion when I go without. My skin appears my youthful after using this. I really don&#x27;t like the smell... but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a short time, but so far I like it, makes my face softer. I have deep wrinkles so that will take longer use I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> The mechanism for this expensive product is faulty. The problem is so prevalent that there is a you tube video  explaining how to solve the problem, but the &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; also doesn&#x27;t work.  Buyer beware. You can see the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;EvQp1KlI7jI</li>
            <li> I really like this product, just not the price &amp; the fact it only last 2 months:(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the real deal, &amp; trust the seller to be legit- but who knows?</li>
            <li> It is everything it claims to be!!!  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t see much difference in my skin.  Expensive item for little result. I expected to see some diminishing of lines but it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.</li>
            <li> Part of my daily skin care regiment.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this serum. I thought I would see improvement. I feel it has dried my skin.  i may go back to the drug store brand of cream that I had been using.  Sorry, but you asked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and really like it. Has not done miracles yet but definate improvement overall. Best product I have ever used on my face, and I have used hundreds!</li>
            <li> I use Skin Medica moisturizer and have just bought the serum and have used it only three times. So far I like it . It is already smoothing out some fine wrinkles on my face and the left over is working really great on the back of my hands. You put one pumbp on the back of your hand and mix the two colors together then apply to your face. the unexpected benefit is that when smoothing the left over on the back of my hand it makes it look plumper.</li>
            <li> When I received the cream the pump was broken. I had to remove the top to get cream out</li>
            <li> This product is truly &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; for my aging skin, and, along with retin-A and a good sunscreen, is all you need for remarkably good skin. I too, have purchased it in the Dr.&#x27;s office as well as from the Skin Medica website. I have had mostly good luck buying it on Amazon, but feel that some distributors send me an old product rather than a fake one. If the white lotion is turning dark, that is my clue that it is past it&#x27;s prime and I just send it back for a refund. The most recent one I ordered(from Specialty Skincare/fulfilled by Amazon) had the expiration date clearly showing and was very fresh.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  It has changed the texture of my skin.  I am really grateful that Amazon carries it.  It is somewhat expensive at the Doctor&#x27;s office and I appreciate the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me a couple yeas ago.  I used one container and didn&#x27;t repurchase it because of the price, over $250 from her office.  A few months ago she suggested it again, and this time I bought it from Amazon at over $100 less. The stuff really works great, and all the better at a hundred bucks less.</li>
            <li> Very good you can realize the result after three days from using it. It gives you more fresh &amp; light to you face</li>
            <li> Love this product...just not the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very fine product.</li>
            <li> Have used many other skin care products but love this stuff . Can tell it really made a difference in texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> It causes cancer cells to multiply. Please read the lawsuit on Google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shockingly Dr. Oz didn&#x27;t mention this on his show</li>
            <li> Amazing, totally revitalized my skin after just couple of weeks- it&#x27;s never looked this healthy.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok.  It does have a slight smell, kind of like mildew.  Package was completely sealed and appears authentic.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed this several times. Still the best!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I stopped using it for a while a really noticed my complexion getting uneven and ruddy . This cleared up quickly once I started  using it again</li>
            <li> Great cream. I have tried many, and have never really seen or felt a difference. Until now. Already planning on my next order for this.</li>
            <li> I have been using high and low end skin care product for years and I keep coming back to this one.  Was happy to find it for almost half the salon cost here.  Feels like my 60+ yr old skin is really getting what it needs.</li>
            <li> It is great!  I love it!  Best serum I have ever used.  It is keeping the wrinkles from returning. It had been 4 months since  Botox and I&#x27;m not making an appointment until I see the wrinkles start appearing again.  I have been getting Boyox got 10 years.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to TNS Serum from my facial surgeon. After using it for three months I was hooked. The price at the surgeons office was nearly $100 more so I was extremely pleased to find it at such a reasonable price through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I use TNS daily and my face is smoother. It is light so I just use foundation over it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over a year and when I run out I miss it! Combined with other products from this  company. My skin looks and feels less dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> After spending lots of $$$$ trying the latest and greatest for my skin with mixed results, I found Skin Medica&lt;br /&gt;through my Doctor.  Its very expensive, however its made such a fantastic difference to my skin I&#x27;s rather give&lt;br /&gt;up my &amp;#34;coffee&amp;#34; than go without it.  I think the packaging could be improved to enable one to manage to dig&lt;br /&gt;the last drop out.....but maybe next year!!!</li>
            <li> Great skin serum and I highly recommend it, I already feel the difference in the look of my face and neck</li>
            <li> I had been using it at nite only but decided to try it twice a day.  Great product, cost alot but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for the face! Immediately absorbed--feels like new skin!!</li>
            <li> This serum really works!  Within a short period of time, there was dramatic decrease in the fine lines and wrinkles and an improvement in the texture of my skin.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> One of the better products out there</li>
            <li> I have been using tns for over a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;I like a simple skin regimen .&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face and apply tns both am and pm. It acts as a moisterizer as well!&lt;br /&gt;I have recieved my compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also urged many friends to try it, and they love it too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is the packaging ,  there seems to be wasted product in tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully a change for packaging is planned for 2014!!! Hint hint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely a devouted user&lt;br /&gt;Judi&lt;br /&gt;Seattle wa</li>
            <li> One of the things you can do to see if reviews are honest or not is to click on &amp;#34;see all my reviews&amp;#34; after the persons name (check mine as an example, then look at the others).  If this product is the only one they have written a review for, chances are the glowing review is from a schill (plant) for the distributor.  Strange thing is almost ALL of these glowing reviews are from people who have only written reviews for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife did buy this product on her Amazon account for me and after three weeks, one of the two serums (the red one), ran out while the white part kept going for about another week.  Defective?  Counterfit?  Who knows.  I think it started making a difference and will try one more time but I am skeptical of all these &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li> This is very best product for my skin that I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It works. However I have since learned it is made with baby foreskin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for six months now and have noticed a significant change in the texture and appearance in my aging skin. I just turned 54 and my skin looks better now than it did 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> If they could find a way to lower the cost on this product that would be wonderful.  Love the product.  Don&#x27;t love the price.  I do see a difference to my skin.  I have been using it for the past two years and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this serum multiple times but I hate the packaging. It is meant to look much larger than it is. If they put it in a smaller container you could fly w/ it easily. As it is, it takes up way too much space.</li>
            <li> I truly believe in Skin Medica and their products. Skin looks amazing after 3 weeks of TNS Essential Serum but one side of the dual chamber dispenser quit working;(  I&#x27;m returning and hope the distributor can refund my $$$ or send me new product! This product is NOT cheap!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for four months now and people are always asking me if I have had some cosmetic procedure done. This product is truly amazing and works best if pump it on the back of you hand and rub the serums together before applying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for the last 8 years and it is a miracle worker! I wouldn&#x27;t trade for anything and the compliments on my skin prove it. Wear it over your vitamin C  product (for me, Obagi) and under sunscreen or other skin care product. It&#x27;s December 2014 today and everyone wants to see my ID to buy alcohol when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup. When I do wear makeup, about 40% of the people want to see my ID. Obviously, I wear very little make up. Either way, I&#x27;m viewed as much younger than my natural self. Be sure to pay attention to directions! If this doesn&#x27;t do what you hoped, try TNS serum without the dual dispehnser. Both are excellent!</li>
            <li> It works beautifully.  Although it is expensive it is cheaper than if I purchase it from my Dr. In Tucson</li>
            <li> This really works.  I could tell an overall difference in my skin within days - it has never looked healthier.</li>
            <li> Great product and received quickly</li>
            <li> great product.  good seller</li>
            <li> It is great. I have been using it for about 1 month and I can see the improvement of the skin. My friends are telling me the same.</li>
            <li> This is my second order. I notice a difference on my hand where I mix the serum enforce applying it to my face. People say I have nice skin so there is probably some effect on my face</li>
            <li> I did not make my initial purchase on Amazon but this was highly recommended by a skin care spa that has served me well over the years. I made my initial purchase from the spa but if i were to place additional orders it would be through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used this product each morning and night for nearly 30 days, my initial impression remains that this is the nastiest smelling beauty I have ever used and it does not work any better or worse than other products ranging from Olay to high end brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews mention that the product does not last long with regular use; I can&#x27;t wait for this to run out and have relegated it to use on my feet in the evenings before sleeping in heavy socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck!</li>
            <li> I tried for two weeks before the red disappeared from the mix.  It feels different without it.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the length of available use.  My skin feels nice but I have yet to see a change.  I will try for a few months before my final review.</li>
            <li> This product is great....BUT my order through Amazon was defective!!!!  Only one side worked!  A big waste of money.  Beware!  Price is reflective of the quality.  I have bought at regular price from local dermatologist and it worked perfectly.  Product is fantastic. Amazon offers substandard defective products from some of their vendors.</li>
            <li> This serum is like gold!! Can&#x27;t live without!! So good for your skin, what a difference.</li>
            <li> A great product that I have been using for years. Getting it for a discounted price makes it all the more appealing.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin, and this product smells horrible.  It also isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I thought it would be.  For the price, I expected a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> Everyone should use this product.  It works.  I have using this product for 3 years and Iwouldnt go backto over the counter products for any reason.  Buy it today..</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin care product. I go without it once and awhile for a couple of weeks. I see and feel the positive results as soon as I start using it again. It is definitely pricy. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> After one week of use my skin has been transformed.  The texture of my skin is greatly improved.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was a good product, fresh and new. Not like the expired product I had bought from eBay.</li>
            <li> The pump did not work correctly, and the red serum was very light red and low in quanity .&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase it again from that company..</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working as promised. I like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for several years now, and feel it makes a real difference in my complexion.  It definitely reduces wrinkle definition.  I learned from another reviewer to combine it with a vitamin A &amp; E serum.  In any case, I tried not using it this summer, and my skin showed it.  I went right back to it, and will not stop again.  Was told by a 26 year old  cosmetic tech at a well known cosmetic store in Belevue Square that I do not need and should not wear foundation on my face!  That confirmed my opinion of This product.</li>
            <li> I wish they were more understanding i a rash from this good serum and they do NOT take things back so be careful when you buy</li>
            <li> My wife sees a little change after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past, with good results.  This go round however, I find this product just irritates my rosacea.  Still like the Tri-Retinol and the sunscreen and Rejuvenative Moisturizer.  But won&#x27;t order this again (silver lining&#x3D; it&#x27;s PRICEY!)...</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years. Use it about once a week when I don&#x27;t want to go through the whole Obagi routine. I like it a lot and the price is more reasonable than any other place I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the product only lasted approx. 6 weeks!--I used it 2 x daily according to the 1-pump application directions--very expensive for that short  length of time! I&#x27;ll not be reordering...</li>
            <li> This product is very good but a little costly.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but I have to buy this product every other month. This will not last you more than a few months like some face products.</li>
            <li> I normally use very high quality products with a high percentage of organic ingredients, so I am used to pretty good results.  The TNS seems to be working comparably so far after about 3 weeks, Ive actually been combining it with some of my other products and am liking the results so far.</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy to purchase this product that I love soooooo much!!  I would buy this again and again through this person.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product but experienced problems with the pump. The pump is supposed to dispenses (2) equal serums. About 1/3 way through the product only one would dispense. I returned for a refund and reordered the product again.</li>
            <li> Has done wonders in the two months that I have been using it.. My Derm recommended it</li>
            <li> Great product but very expensive. About $70 less on Amazon than  through the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i&#x27;ve purchsed this pricy product on Amamzon. All i can say, is WOWEEE, my skin loves it. PS, It was recommended by my dermatologist in the first place. No joke, fantastic results! Have lost a couple of fine lines already~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 PS, My Doctor warned me that it had a funky smell, but that is how you know its real. I had my first batch from him and the last two on AMAZON. No worries,  I got over the smell, as soon as I saw the results!</li>
            <li> An MD originally recommended this product, and I have used it ever since.  This is an excellent product for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> All Skin medica products are great!  I&#x27;ve been using them for over a year now, and I can definitely tell the difference in my skin. Even my husband notices the difference!  The products were recommended to me by my aesthetician, and it was the best tip I&#x27;ve received.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Use with skinrdoca DS essential serum</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested I use this serum for sagging skin.  Really do see a difference after a few weeks of  use.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear here. I do love this product, but it is simply much too expensive for a repeat purchase. I use the Image line and it works just as well for a quarter of the price. I do not have a big problem with wrinkles. It&#x27;s sagging that is more problematic for me. I am going to be 52 and my skin is relatively smooth, but the jowls are beginning to show. I also have lots of brown spots. I need a very good cream for sagging, but I really don&#x27;t think one exists. If any one of you ladies knows of one, I sure would appreciate your feedback!</li>
            <li> it is essential for the care of your skin care.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Seriously leave my face looking younger and even noticed my hands where I blend it look younger!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time in excellent new condition. Product does make face look better. I recommend It to others.</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my skin feel and look</li>
            <li> I use this daily and love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> This product makes a difference in the appearance of my skin.  I use it every day</li>
            <li> So glad you provide this product love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into 3 weeks of use as directed. Not sure if the product will last, to be worth the VERY HIGH PRICE it cost. If it does not last at least 2 months - it will be UNAFFORDABLE, even for the above average house whole Encome. Initial application feels good, till dry. Then  Needs more moisture in winter. And of course sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The second ingredient on the list is water. This is pricey for what I can get out of my faucet. Strong perfume smell for the first few seconds, then smells horrible. The long ingredient list includes perfume so I didn&#x27;t try it on the rosacea areas of my face. I tried it twice on my neck and threw it away due to the smell. My dermatologist&#x27;s office mentioned it and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay $260 for it there. Shea butter is also high on the list, so if you like shea just buy a jar for $20.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well. I had scars from within the last year and had heard from the past that this product was perfect for that. I tried it and it worked perfectly. I only wish I had more money to use it again. Maybe again in the future. Although finding this product on Amazon was a much more economical choice when compared to the price in salons, spas, and physicians offices.</li>
            <li> Gives skin a youthful glow. Makes skin look younger.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this produce by a very high end salon in NYC. It is wonderful but the price was $260.00. I searched and found it on Amazon for $100.00 less than retail. So not only is it a great product but now I can justify the price.</li>
            <li> Skin Medica&#x27;s TNS serum makes my skin feel young and supple. It heals blemishes very quickly. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the package recommends using it twice a day, I only use it at night and feel the results are wonderful!</li>
            <li> The pump does not work</li>
            <li> This is the serum my dermatologist recommended.  The &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; is consistency; products are meant to be used daily for best results.</li>
            <li> I loved the first bottle I bought, but the second one is defective and doesn&#x27;t dispense the product properly.  I have tried contacting the company via email and have not gotten a response.  I love the product, but it doesn&#x27;t come out well so I can&#x27;t use it. I would keep buying this again if they replace the defective bottle.</li>
            <li> I love skin medica products!</li>
            <li> There are several vendors on Amazon offering Skin Medica TNS Essential Serum. I have always felt like I was getting the real thing, but I have received defective bottles. This company&#x27;s product seems to be the best of them all. It appears to be fresh and the &amp;#34;squirter&amp;#34; works perfectly. I intend to order from them again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I am now addicted to this product. My skin is great</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Worth every penny or should I say dollar.  expensive but great.. Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really find a better skin product than TNS.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001QTLNK0 Skin Medica TNS Essential Serum, 1 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> really great worth every penny..magical</li>
            <li> This is my main skin cream.</li>
            <li> It is the same product but not as expensive</li>
            <li> Same product that I purchase at my dermatologist only less expensive through Amazon</li>
            <li> This product only lasted me 2 months, it is pretty pricey and I didn&#x27;t see any visible results. I purchased the same from the doctor and it lasted much longer with the same frequency of usage. I am not really sure if it is worth the money.</li>
