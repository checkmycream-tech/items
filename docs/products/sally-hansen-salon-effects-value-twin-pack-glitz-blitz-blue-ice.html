            <li>I love these things!  </li>
            <li>I am not  a manicure kind of gal</li>
            <li>Cheaper than going to the salon; faster and neater than painting your own nails.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to apply and they look great!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super happy with them.</li>
            <li>I thought these were a great color, but was super bummed that they wouldn&#x27;t stick or stay in place.</li>
            <li>However, if I have a special event planned these come in handy!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Digging this easy application process!</li>
            <li>You can get more time than they say even.</li>
            <li>I love the Sally Hansen Salong effects -- not just this design, but any of the designs.</li>
            <li>I guess I could&#x27;ve shellac&#x27;ed them in place with a top coat, but these are supposed to be simpler than that.</li>
            <li>I love to use these for my toenails.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I love them.</li>
            <li>The nail paint did not stick more than 2 days.</li>
            <li>I love all sally hansen nail stickers.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say they&#x27;re my favorite design, but the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I think that will work better than just remover on a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>If the would have put them on better they probably would have lasted 5.</li>
            <li>These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li>there is a reason why this one is cheap cuz its cheap!</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li>I thought these were easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Looked beautiful with my blue sparkly dress.</li>
            <li>it is an important step.</li>
            <li>Takes some time to apply correctly, but great once you get used to doing, Bought several for holiday use.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions and apply with care, they look great and do last awhile.</li>
            <li>Ended up removing after 7 days which in my book is fantastic for a manicure for my nails.  </li>
            <li>particular combination, Glitz Blitz &amp; Blue Ice, are awesome.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to get the salon look without the price.</li>
            <li>, shipping was SUPER quick!</li>
            <li>I loved how they looked and required no dry time.</li>
            <li>but Once it&#x27;s on it actually stays on pretty good for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They go on so easy and you can do dishes right afterward.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to see value pack was such a steal!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the clear coat was effective.</li>
            <li>Hoping for the full 10 days but quite frankly, I&#x27;ll take 5-7 which is longer than any manicure has ever lasted me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking 26 boxes with me to New Zealand because I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t have those there</li>
            <li>I use a good base and then cover it with a nice top coat to get more out of the look.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun, lots of sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Probably would&#x27;ve lasted longer had I applied a clear top coat as some others have suggested.  </li>
            <li>Application is a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, they go on quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have bought Sally Hansen salon effects from the store before a few times, and have used them successfully.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to apply (I always use a clear coat on top) and they last for 7-12 days without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>First of all, I must say that I&#x27;ve used other Sally Hansen salon effects before and have been VERY pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>If I actually took good care of them, maybe put a topcoat on, I&#x27;m sure I could go a little longer.  </li>
            <li>but I do like to have pretty nails on occasion.  </li>
            <li>It is important to follow the directions exactly and to put on a clear coat afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The glitter is a bit pointy and needs the clear coat to smooth it out</li>
            <li>Stick Nail Decals at the local drugstore, and they&#x27;d always lasted 10 days or more.</li>
            <li>im very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>the product is old or what), when you go to peel off the top clear part, the silver bit that is supposed to help you remove the bottom peal away</li>
            <li>Other than that they are very easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Removal process was simple and easy.  </li>
            <li>It just depends on how fast your nails grow.</li>
            <li>I had to throw the whole thing away.</li>
            <li>I would have been really upset that 12 of my strips were ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the Sally Hansen polish strips.  </li>
            <li>However, I would highly suggest using a clear top coat to protect them and help them last longer.  </li>
            <li>They seemed to do more damage to my nails than the other colors.</li>
            <li>there are other products out there for 15$ YES its more</li>
            <li>So far, I would purchase again simply based on the easy of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They last almost a full two weeks</li>
            <li>By day 13, I was ready to take it off and apply a new design.  </li>
            <li>THEY COMPLETELY FALL APART!</li>
            <li>(If you&#x27;re super careful, you can get two uses out of one box.</li>
            <li>it took me forever and it is just a huge mess on my nails.</li>
            <li>The clear coat isn&#x27;t mentioned in the instructions</li>
            <li>With only one box, I was able to cover not only my ten fingernails, but also my daughter&#x27;s ten fingernails *and*</li>
            <li>Glitz Bitz and Blue Ice patterns really sparkle.  </li>
            <li>The true test for me is to see how long they last.  </li>
            <li>HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li>I ordered these plus a bunch of different styles and colors since they were on sale for much cheaper than the local stores near me.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>Mine usually last at least a week with a top coat.</li>
            <li>I have the worst lucky with nail polish but so far I have great luck with these.</li>
            <li>The clear peel off cover lifts the nail polish from the white backing.</li>
            <li>strip comes apart from the strip -- there is then no way to remove the clear peel and therefore no way to properly apply the nail.</li>
            <li>After applying I put on a clear coat to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>only thing, is because there is so much glitter on these, it is more difficult to take off with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>Most of them are unusable as you are unable to separate the clear backing from the white one without tearing the polish apart (some sticks to the clear side, some to the white side).</li>
            <li>Was actually pleasantly surprised with how long these lasted!  </li>
            <li>They are not as pretty as they look, and don&#x27;t last a few days without peeling -not reusable-</li>

            <li> I felt that the application process was relatively easy especially when applying to my left hand (which with nail polish ALWAYS is difficult for me).  </li>
            <li> I can get them on in about 5 minutes flat</li>
            <li> You will snag your sheer clothing if you do not clear coat it afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that if I put a coat of clear polish over them they can last a little longer even.</li>
            <li> No need to wait for them to dry, and they last through all sorts of abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is a third of the price of a single pack</li>
            <li> Nevertheless -- for these particular strips (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the design or is</li>
            <li> They stay on a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them so long</li>
            <li> I herd that the glitter ones (these ones) dont stay on as long as the non glitter ones</li>
            <li> so had I read other reviews prior to application</li>
            <li> I like that there are a few extra strips to match to different size cuticle beds because some of my nail beds are wider than others.  </li>
            <li> Only half of the 10 nails weren&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> , I probably could have got more than one use out of the strips by cutting them in half.  </li>
            <li> or you will feel the rough edges.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder to put on than the instructions made it seem</li>
            <li> (I think because I wasn&#x27;t as careful applying them).</li>
            <li> For Christmas, I used the gold as a base and then did a French manicure by putting a bright red on the edge and STRANGERS not only went crazy for it</li>
            <li> These colors are very pretty, my only complaint with the Sally Hansen glitter polishes is they are so difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> As with other sparkle polishes they can tear your nails up upon removal.</li>
            <li> It seems as if the nail polish was under the sun or exposed to extreme heat.</li>
            <li> The only issue with these is the glitter ones are hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> the solid colors they tend to get hard and wont stick to the nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered that cutting the strips can make one box go a long way, especially with short nails.  </li>
            <li> Will purchase from amazon again, about half the price of in store retailers.</li>
            <li> The color comes off, the glitter is a little bit stubborn.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> recommend Salon Effects for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to worry about wet polish and delicate nails.  </li>
            <li> Of the two packs of nail stickers, just use one and cut them in half!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product none the less!</li>
            <li> Nail polish remover and just a little pealing it off and no problem!  </li>
            <li> and I am not able to keep them up as often as I would like.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> Up close, they look like a thick coat of glitter nail polish.  </li>
            <li> BUT def worse the money!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> really bad product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is 99% the ONLY brand I use for basic nail cover. You can get more time than they say even. It just depends on how fast your nails grow. I use a good base and then cover it with a nice top coat to get more out of the look. For Christmas, I used the gold as a base and then did a French manicure by putting a bright red on the edge and STRANGERS not only went crazy for it but ACTUALLY remembered me a months later because of that manicure - even though I wasn&#x27;t wearing it when they saw me again.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and apply. As with other sparkle polishes they can tear your nails up upon removal. They stay on forever and I got compliments daily!!</li>
            <li> lasts a solid week or two on hands</li>
            <li> I love the Sally Hansen Salong effects -- not just this design, but any of the designs. They are super easy to apply (I always use a clear coat on top) and they last for 7-12 days without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;This particular combination, Glitz Blitz &amp; Blue Ice, are awesome. Lots of fun, lots of sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing, is because there is so much glitter on these, it is more difficult to take off with nail polish remover. The color comes off, the glitter is a little bit stubborn. Would recommend soaking your nails in nail polish remover before you try scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone regardless!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought Sally Hansen salon effects from the store before a few times, and have used them successfully. I was delighted to see value pack was such a steal! I ordered it and tried at home today. What a disappointment. It seems as if the nail polish was under the sun or exposed to extreme heat. The clear peel off cover lifts the nail polish from the white backing. Most of them are unusable as you are unable to separate the clear backing from the white one without tearing the polish apart (some sticks to the clear side, some to the white side). What a waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last 10 days, maybe 10 minutes</li>
            <li> These things are awesome! I have the worst lucky with nail polish but so far I have great luck with these. I tried the glitters before I bought a bunch online and I&#x27;m super happy with them. I&#x27;m taking 26 boxes with me to New Zealand because I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t have those there and I don&#x27;t want to take nail polish with me. (If you&#x27;re super careful, you can get two uses out of one box. Of the two packs of nail stickers, just use one and cut them in half! So since I bought 26 boxes, I&#x27;ll have 52 uses!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, shipping was SUPER quick! I ordered on Friday and got these on Monday with regular shipping! Was not expecting that!</li>
            <li> I am not  a manicure kind of gal but I do like to have pretty nails on occasion.  These are perfect for me.  It is important to follow the directions exactly and to put on a clear coat afterwards.  The clear coat isn&#x27;t mentioned in the instructions but I have found especially the glitzy nails with the sparkles it is an important step. The glitter is a bit pointy and needs the clear coat to smooth it out or you will feel the rough edges.  You will snag your sheer clothing if you do not clear coat it afterwards.Be patient.  It is easier the second time.  The price on Amazon is a third of the price of a single pack and here you get 2!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with these glitter nail polish strips, but they ended up being really awesome! They are super easy to apply and they look great! Not to mention the price was cheaper here than buying just one pack at the stores. Very happy with this product. Would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I guess these had been sitting in the warehouse for awhile. I&#x27;ve tried the Sally Hansen Peel&#x27;n&#x27; Stick Nail Decals at the local drugstore, and they&#x27;d always lasted 10 days or more. I thought these were a great color, but was super bummed that they wouldn&#x27;t stick or stay in place. I guess I could&#x27;ve shellac&#x27;ed them in place with a top coat, but these are supposed to be simpler than that.</li>
            <li> I love to use these for my toenails.  They stay on a long time.  My only problem has been that some of them simply would not stick to my nails.  I don&#x27;t know what the problem was.  Otherwise I love them.</li>
            <li> The nail paint did not stick more than 2 days. It would come off in one piece...it didnt chip in peices. Only half of the 10 nails weren&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> I love all sally hansen nail stickers.  I have been using them so long I can get them on in about 5 minutes flat and they stay on until I take them off with polish remover (every Sunday).  LOVE them!  I will not go back to polish as it chips.  The only issue with these is the glitter ones are hard to get off.  It takes even using the nail buffer to get some of the glitter pieces off.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo364CKO4QTMXRA]]I&#x27;ve just recently discovered Salon Effects and I think they&#x27;re wonderful.  No need to wait for them to dry, and they last through all sorts of abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One box has two packs of eight strips.  I&#x27;ve discovered that cutting the strips can make one box go a long way, especially with short nails.  With only one box, I was able to cover not only my ten fingernails, but also my daughter&#x27;s ten fingernails *and* all her toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Glitz Bitz and Blue Ice patterns really sparkle.  Up close, they look like a thick coat of glitter nail polish.  I can&#x27;t say they&#x27;re my favorite design, but the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go ten days before the nails start to look ratty from growth and chipping.  If I actually took good care of them, maybe put a topcoat on, I&#x27;m sure I could go a little longer.  By day 13, I was ready to take it off and apply a new design.  Removal is as simple as a cotton ball soaked with nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Salon Effects for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to worry about wet polish and delicate nails.  That would be me.</li>
            <li> HUGE WASTE OF MONEY! THEY COMPLETELY FALL APART! I AM SO UPSET ABOUT THIS ORDER, DO NOT BUY!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> First of all, I must say that I&#x27;ve used other Sally Hansen salon effects before and have been VERY pleased with the results. Nevertheless -- for these particular strips (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the design or is the product is old or what), when you go to peel off the top clear part, the silver bit that is supposed to help you remove the bottom peal away strip comes apart from the strip -- there is then no way to remove the clear peel and therefore no way to properly apply the nail. I had to throw the whole thing away. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply! Last for 1-2 weeks. Looked beautiful with my blue sparkly dress. Will purchase from amazon again, about half the price of in store retailers.</li>
            <li> I ordered these plus a bunch of different styles and colors since they were on sale for much cheaper than the local stores near me.&lt;br /&gt;To me it&#x27;s harder to put on than the instructions made it seem but Once it&#x27;s on it actually stays on pretty good for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that with the glitter colors the strips tend to stick to the plastic backing. I lost 12 of 16 strips because they were stuck and wouldn&#x27;t allow me to peel it off.&lt;br /&gt;With the solid colors they tend to get hard and wont stick to the nails.&lt;br /&gt;I think if I paid the regular price of $8-10per pack  I would have been really upset that 12 of my strips were ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product none the less!</li>
            <li> These colors are very pretty, my only complaint with the Sally Hansen glitter polishes is they are so difficult to remove.  I need to learn the foil/cotton/remover trick, I think that will work better than just remover on a cotton ball.  They seemed to do more damage to my nails than the other colors.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Quick and easy to get the salon look without the price. I have 2 girls,(enough said) and I am not able to keep them up as often as I would like. However, if I have a special event planned these come in handy!</li>
            <li> Price great. Takes some time to apply correctly, but great once you get used to doing, Bought several for holiday use.</li>
            <li> I was in a hurry to put them on so I cant properly review this but they only stayed on for three days. They started chipping the next day. If the would have put them on better they probably would have lasted 5. Other than that they are very easy to put on. You dont need anything but what is inside the box. No drying time. I herd that the glitter ones (these ones) dont stay on as long as the non glitter ones so I would try those but use this brand</li>
            <li> I thought these were easy to apply. I loved how they looked and required no dry time. After applying I put on a clear coat to make it last longer. I don&#x27;t think the clear coat was effective. I gave it four stars because the Glitz Blitz stayed on for awhile, but the Blue Ice chipped soon (I think because I wasn&#x27;t as careful applying them). If you follow the directions and apply with care, they look great and do last awhile.</li>
            <li> They are not as pretty as they look, and don&#x27;t last a few days without peeling -not reusable- I would rather spend the money on a bottle of nail polish and get 20 manicures out of it --</li>
            <li> ***Note: Product Review only, not a review for this amazon.com distributor***&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased this product (Blue Ice Color) from a local big box store and just recently applied.  I felt that the application process was relatively easy especially when applying to my left hand (which with nail polish ALWAYS is difficult for me).  I like that there are a few extra strips to match to different size cuticle beds because some of my nail beds are wider than others.  My nails are very short so had I read other reviews prior to application, I probably could have got more than one use out of the strips by cutting them in half.  Next time I will try this.  The true test for me is to see how long they last.  Hoping for the full 10 days but quite frankly, I&#x27;ll take 5-7 which is longer than any manicure has ever lasted me (I&#x27;m not gentile with my nails at all).  So far, I would purchase again simply based on the easy of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** 11/07/12:  Was actually pleasantly surprised with how long these lasted!  Probably would&#x27;ve lasted longer had I applied a clear top coat as some others have suggested.  Ended up removing after 7 days which in my book is fantastic for a manicure for my nails.  Already purchased another box to use again.  Removal process was simple and easy.  Nail polish remover and just a little pealing it off and no problem!  Digging this easy application process!</li>
            <li> really bad product. not as simple as they said it would! it took me forever and it is just a huge mess on my nails. dont waste your money! there are other products out there for 15$ YES its more BUT def worse the money! there is a reason why this one is cheap cuz its cheap! im very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> These were priced so low how could you not buy them?  I love these things!  They go on so easy and you can do dishes right afterward.  They last almost a full two weeks and I have noticed that if I put a coat of clear polish over them they can last a little longer even.</li>
            <li> These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li> I really like the Sally Hansen polish strips.  Application is a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, they go on quickly.  Cheaper than going to the salon; faster and neater than painting your own nails. The best part is no drying time.  However, I would highly suggest using a clear top coat to protect them and help them last longer.  Mine usually last at least a week with a top coat.</li>
