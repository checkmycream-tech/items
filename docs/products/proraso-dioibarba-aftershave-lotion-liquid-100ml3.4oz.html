    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;The best part of the Proraso isn&#x27;t the bottle or the manly scent.</li>
            <li>The best part is in it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>Best of all, my wife also likes it.</li>

            <li>This proraso product is excellent, and may even replace my aquavelva.</li>
            <li>The two make a wonderful shave when paired together.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is old-school barbershop and the Italians are very good at recreating that feeling with their shaving products.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the product is even better!!!</li>
            <li>This shaving lotion is good stuff!</li>

            <li>-- Here&#x27;s wishing you a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Truly one of the 5 great \\&quot;Ss\\&quot; when coming in from the field.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job of soothing my razor burn, and closing up those nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Their aftershave is a great way to finish off a shave.</li>
            <li>great aftershave convenient bottle</li>
            <li>This aftershave feels great when I put it on, and it smell great.  </li>
            <li>B0085UECY2 Proraso Aftershave Lotion, Refresh, 100 ml]] which is a great product</li>
            <li>Leaves a great post shave feeling.</li>
            <li>Smells Amazing!</li>
            <li>This is why most of their products are best sellers on amazon.</li>
            <li>Face tingles all day and smells good.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry/sensitive skin however, treat yourself to applying some Lubriderm or Nivea men&#x27;s lotion for the best after-shave experience available.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good aftershave.</li>
            <li>you may have been too agressive, but that acts as a good feedback so that you can adjust your shaving methods.</li>
            <li>The price was certainly good</li>
            <li>Good if you don&#x27;t mind the price</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a good price in today&#x27;s market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good fragrance and feels good on face after shave, etc</li>
            <li>It burns, but it burns so good.</li>
            <li>Perfect before a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>good smell and freshens your face after a shave and contains alcohol which is good.</li>
            <li>Has good moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>I even bought the Prosaro eucalyptus shaving cream although I have Taylor&#x27;s shaving cream because I loved the after shave.</li>
            <li>Now I know that it is just as good.</li>
            <li>I use Proraso&#x27;s soap in a bowl as well, wonderful scent and rich lather.  </li>
            <li>I would have paid more for it, it is that good!</li>
            <li>Always happy with Proraso products, aftershave soothing and refreshing to the skin with a pleasant aroma pleasing to my&lt;br /&gt;wife.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell without being amazing.</li>
            <li>exceptional product.</li>
            <li>I love how good it smells and how great it leaves my skin feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li>Smells great and has that refreshing tingle when applied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this aftershave for about a week and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>However, i purchased this product on the strength of its reviews and have been very pleased with it, and have had no problems with dryness.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful fragrance, not too strong.</li>
            <li>leaves a nice refreshing feeling after a great shave.</li>
            <li>but it was better if it prevented pimples after shave as well!</li>
            <li>The feeling on application is pleasing and the smell is great, but also very mild.</li>
            <li>Smells good, (very light scent).</li>
            <li>This aftershave leaves my skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing face tingling feeling post shave</li>
            <li>Among them I&#x27;ve really liked 4711,</li>
            <li>Great product - great price - fast shipping.    </li>
            <li>and this was a nice purchase in regard to that</li>
            <li>This has a nice manly smell to it as well.</li>
            <li>BUUUURN!&lt;br /&gt;Burns nice, tightens your face and dries it out a bit - use a balm or cream after this aftershave - a must!&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Proraso post shave balm.  </li>
            <li>It has that nice aftershave tingle you expect, but does not have that burning sensation some do (think of that scene from Home Alone).  </li>
            <li>This smells nice, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I liked the cooling effect when applied.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>Has a nice sting to it</li>
            <li>- Nice smell</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Proraso aftershave user for years and have just loved it for so many reasons.</li>
            <li>but she say it smells nice now.</li>
            <li>Still, very light, very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Scent lasts for hours and smells refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great gift for the special man in your life.</li>
            <li>Best stuff around..leaves a nice fresh clean smell..</li>
            <li>so I guess that settles the most important question!!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; like many aftershaves...</li>
            <li>This stuff is by far the best aftershave I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily, goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t take much and my skin feels awesome for hours after a shave.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and great classic scent.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have dry/sensitive skin, you&#x27;re done and in awe of how clean shaven and good</li>
            <li>Smells great and seems to moisturize my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>scent fades relatively quickly which is a good thing imo.</li>
            <li>She disdains most fragrances, but of Proraso she said, \\&quot;Mmmmm...</li>
            <li>Apply after shaving and it will rid you of irritation (within reason, don&#x27;t shave the top 3 lays of your skin off and expect anything to help that).</li>
            <li>I was stating in the beginning of this review sometimes you don&#x27;t get what you pay for, but with Proraso Aftershave you get more than you pay for.</li>
            <li>Love the Prosaro line.</li>
            <li>Nivea for men post shave balms work the best at moisturizing your face and lasting all day.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but it smells better than anything I found in stores.</li>
            <li>I just converted from Norelco electrics that I&#x27;ve used for many years to manual shaving, and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>will by more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love Proraso products and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>I love the Proraso line of products.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Perfectly in the middle.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask from a aftershave</li>
            <li>This is my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li>I have adopted this scent as &amp;#34;my scent&amp;#34; and love it.</li>
            <li>but I would expect so much more for the money.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, my wife loves it when I use it.  </li>
            <li>This product gives your face a really good fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and how it helps you to not have bumps</li>
            <li>, I am so glad I found it and without doubt, when I run out I will most definately replenish stocks!!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite after shave&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that most of them are fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this aftershave.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt or sting, feels quite refreshing after apply.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love with Proraso products?  </li>
            <li>there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li>This product does the job but the scent that you will get it&#x27;s mostly alcohol...</li>
            <li>Love the way my face feels after a shave.</li>
            <li>The square bottle looks better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is EVERYTHING they say and MORE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I went out of my &amp;#34;comfort zone&amp;#34; and decided to use this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this scent to finish off a good shave, and the tingling it just the right amount.</li>
            <li>scent is nice and clean; my wife likes it.  </li>
            <li>After used it my face a nice clean and soothing feel.</li>
            <li>Though not what I was expecting/wanting, it does have a nice, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>This morning I was able to shave with it for the first time and I must say, I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>Said that, this after shave is awsome and has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>I use this with their shaving cream, and my face feels nice and clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, mild menthol aroma that fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a great feeling because while it has alcohol, there are other qualities that make it feel good.  </li>
            <li>Great lively scent - not too strong -</li>
            <li>Fragrance is also very pleasant but doesn&#x27;t linger for long.</li>
            <li>Apply this product when your face is still damp (not dripping wet) from towelling off or after your bloc osma (USE THIS) treatment for best effect.  </li>
            <li>For the price this is a decent aftershave, but if you like a pleasant scent in the morning...</li>
            <li>this is a good product and smells great, but a little pricey.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted something that did not have a strong scent it.  </li>
            <li>In fact, our company has a policy against strong scents.</li>
            <li>Not too strong of scent.</li>
            <li>Using this, I&#x27;ve no worried about walking into a meeting after shaving and bothering everyone with a strong aftershave</li>
            <li>This aftershave smells wonderful and light, my wife loves it and the only downside is that it&#x27;s aroma dissipates fairly quickly over the course of the morning.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the best post shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this perfect aftershave, the smell, the freshness, the balance of odor - not too much , not too little, does not burn when applied, just everything about it.</li>
            <li>A refreshing cool, clean feel.</li>
            <li>Great scent, nice bottle, just a little too pricey.</li>
            <li>The box is nothing fancy, but one thing I enjoy is that this product is from Italy and they don&#x27;t hide from it.</li>
            <li>Its not overpowering at all, light yet smells manly, and the girlfriend LOVES it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available elsewhere on Amazon with Prime delivery for $13.95.  </li>
            <li>FREE TIP:</li>
            <li>In fact, if I could only use one thing and was given a choice between this and one of the great shaving creams that I use with my safety razor, I&#x27;d pick this.</li>
            <li>so it stays available for others.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, always been a big fan...</li>
            <li>/&gt;SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100&#x27;s on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream</li>
            <li>It is super refreshing when first applied with a very clean smell.</li>
            <li>This was very impressive because normally once aftershaves applied an hour later</li>
            <li>Nice pleasant scent that fades after a few hours.</li>
            <li>This is my first alcohol-type after shave in many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on after shave lotions or cologne, but this is really nice!</li>
            <li>but I followed the fellow reviews on here and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Well worth buying!</li>
            <li>Comfortable with a nice fresh feeling but not too much sting.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue - just a clean tingly feeling with a hint of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells clean doesnt linger so you can still use your cologne</li>
            <li>I splash this on and then clean up everything and the sink.</li>
            <li>&gt; - Makes your skin SUPER SMOOTH</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s great and my new favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li>Usually I use both, but I&#x27;ve tried shaving with just the Proraso Pre Shave Cream while in the field and it delivers a great and satisfying shave all by itself.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice tightening tingle, but you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve been slapped in the face like on those old commercials.  </li>
            <li>the very beginning the Proraso experience is uber enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy scents kind of a guy.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it smells totally different.</li>
            <li>That is everything but the satisfying experience of building a nice, thick, warm lather with my badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>but definitely the good part of the shaving.</li>
            <li>is truly invigorating and will leave your skin feeling fresh and silky smooth</li>
            <li>comes close to the fresh, light scent of Prosaro.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be particularly drying, but if you have especially dry skin it may not be the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li>Feels great and does what it should with the Witch Hazel and other toners.  </li>
            <li>A true classic, I love the mild scent.</li>
            <li>The good stuff costs a little more</li>
            <li>Fresh clean aroma&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It has a mild smell and a fragrence that is not overwellming.</li>
            <li>Not only did it cure my razor burn, but I am able to wear cologne on top of it and not have it conflict with the smell of the cologne.</li>
            <li>After trying bunch of different products, i finally found the best ones.</li>
            <li>The bottle is great too, it doesn&#x27;t spill half the bottle during application.</li>
            <li>slight burn in the beginning but then leaves your face feeling great.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product and all the Proraso products I have tried have been positive and I appreciate their good quality and consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review.</li>
            <li>Great, fresh everyday aftershave.</li>
            <li>Will make your skin feel really fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can safely use a very liberal amount with my face knowing I won&#x27;t stink up a room, and the lotions really help relieve any shaving burn I might feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading the reviews and must say that it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>(but you do get what you pay for which to me is worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a regular guy who wanted to provide a review based on my own experiences with this product.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I would like it better if it wasn&#x27;t so loud...</li>
            <li>The alcohol dries my face out and does NOT leave me with that fresh manly feel that witch hazel gives.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent, quick cooling action, and of course, it&#x27;s Italian.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the last this morning, and would like to have more, but it costs more than I&#x27;m willing to pay, I can get 2 bottles of Aqua Velva for the price of 1 bottle of Proraso, that&#x27;s a shame, I really like it.</li>
            <li>This is a good product I like using it, the low rating is for the high price.</li>
            <li>Proraso got it right with this aftershave.</li>
            <li>This Lotion is really good, it leaves a good cold sensation on your skin.</li>
            <li>The Italian firm Proraso manufactures an impressive line of shaving products.</li>
            <li>The smell is also light and refreshing and not overpowering like a lot of other aftershaves.</li>
            <li>This is not some old man after shave it is clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>To everyone who will use this product - when you first splash it on your face I want to to stop and think of ME.  </li>
            <li>While this has an invigorating scent when first applied, it diminishes over time, so you don&#x27;t go to the office smelling like the cologne counter at the department store.  </li>
            <li>Most alcohol-based aftershaves are about 40% and this is a close 2nd.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>This gives your face such as refreshing feeling, and you don&#x27;t get any oily/creamy feeling afterwards like you do with nivea or gillete.</li>
            <li>I have used the proraso shave cream before, but this was the first time using their aftershave.</li>
            <li>Overall I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have kept at it now for two years and have saved a lot of money in doing so and have a pleasurable shave with hot lather</li>
            <li>(yes, hot lather,lot nicer than a dollop of gel out of a can).  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be trying out others before deciding which will be my favorite.</li>
            <li>It stings pretty</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the old time smell of the Proraso as well as these products leave my skin.  </li>
            <li>This was my first bottle.</li>
            <li>A have ordered the preshave cream to use with the other two products and I cannot wait to see if it manages to make my shave even better!</li>
            <li>Will not affect a good balm from what I have done, I do let it soak in for a few minutes before applying any balm.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply it either like other aftershaves, it gives a nice sensation.</li>
            <li>Masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower its states a clean well groomed man.</li>
            <li>the scent is clean, masculine and not too over powering.</li>
            <li>There was something about splashing this aftershave on that left me feeling confident and ready to take on the day.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, it is clear and definitely has a splash on your face kind of use.  </li>
            <li>Also use an appropriate caliber razor with such a cream, I prefer straight razor.</li>
            <li>and it refreshes and leaves the skin feeling nice and tight without over-drying.</li>
            <li>A nice little snap to start the morning</li>
            <li>Alcolado Glacial, Musgo Real, Irisch Moos.    </li>
            <li>It is quite old-fashioned, though, very barber-shoppy.  </li>
            <li>it felt very moisturized.</li>
            <li>After shaving this lotion cooled my face and made my skin feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, the cooling effect, and the fact that it does not burn too much.  </li>
            <li>Very subdued fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very citrusy, with herbal undertones.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to commit so much money</li>
            <li>It does not take much and you don&#x27;t have to worry that you put too much on because it does not overwhelm.</li>
            <li>Also, I was REALLY amazed at the so called &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling of your face when you apply it after shaving.</li>
            <li>See other 5 star reviews for more details and believe the love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still a bit high, but much</li>
            <li>May cost a little more than Old Spice or Aqua Velva - but definitely worth it</li>
            <li>Not worth more than the $3 bottle from the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Short and sweet review here.  </li>
            <li>At first my girlfriend said that I smelled like an old man after I used this after shaving.</li>
            <li>off?You can still find this on many other sights for under $15!</li>
            <li>Do not pay more for a product you can get for less.  </li>
            <li>That is the main reason I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I received the bottle last night and quickly opened it up.  </li>
            <li>AND I am particular about NOT offending anyone.</li>
            <li>then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3&#x27;s are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.</li>
            <li>Nice cooling action, seems to help tame razor rash a bit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the new formula in the new bottle, which is a smaller glass square bottle, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 12 different aftershave splashes, looking for something invigorating, mentholated, fresh, soothing, great-smelling.  </li>
            <li>I honestly do not know how this junk gets so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The smell is faint but very nice</li>
            <li>and you find your new aftershave comes in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li>new in safety razor shaving...</li>
            <li>During the process of searching for new shaving products I came across Proraso.  </li>
            <li>I used to use those cheap generic aftershaves from nivea, gillete, but after using proraso I will never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li>This also gives you a tiny sting when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>I have several different aftershaves to choose from and I regularly go to this one to provide a refreshing splash to finish off my shave.</li>
            <li>The new alcohol version PALES in comparison to the old, luxurious witch hazel formula.</li>
            <li>use witch hazel/non alcohol aftershave for many reasons having to do with comfort but mainly because of a specific reason, I&#x27;m an alcoholic.</li>
            <li>The ultimate test:  my very scent-sensitive gal not only tolerates it, but really likes it.  </li>
            <li>thing I was concerned about before ordering was the burning, stinging slap from the old aqua velva type aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>I am completely sold on Proraso products.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone that is over sensitive to smells like I am.</li>
            <li>No lotion here, just a stinky green cheap smelling substance.</li>
            <li>not heavy..</li>
            <li>It does contain alcohol, but this formula have never dried my face out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(If you have sensitive skin, may I recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic, it&#x27;s manly but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using straight witch hazel instead and searching for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was ready to send it back, when I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I am obsessed with good shaving products, electric razors, after shave, cream, gels.....etc.</li>
            <li>you get a more accurate amount dispensed and less wastage (my previous aftershaves I would pour too much and end up letting a few drops slide in the sink)..</li>
            <li>As it turns out you don&#x27;t always get what you pay for; nothing could stop irritation, smell decent, and keep my face moisturized following a shave.</li>
            <li>Just be warned, the photo you see associate with this review and this product is apparently the old formula, and the old bottle.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little of this to do the job, so I expect this bottle to last many months.  </li>
            <li>As a life long Aqua Velva user this after shave was a real treat.  </li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing my first bottle of Proraso aftershave, I used a dozen or so more expensive options.</li>
            <li>It smelled refreshingly clean and was not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The scent is also very clean, and not too weak or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally like cologne smells or anything like that.</li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>Generally clears up any irritation caused by the shaving process.</li>
            <li>Must have some oils in the formula --- much like the other Proraso products.  </li>
            <li>The distribution cap is one of those plastic stoppers with a really small pinhole - allows for easy control of how much you&#x27;re putting on - though it&#x27;d be hard to overdo it with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really think the formula got adjusted because it feels different from the previous version.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> /&gt;The best part of the Proraso isn&#x27;t the bottle or the manly scent.</li>

            <li> Very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is old-school barbershop and the Italians are very good at recreating that feeling with their shaving products.</li>

            <li> Leaves a great post shave feeling.</li>
            <li> Smells Amazing!</li>
            <li> This is why most of their products are best sellers on amazon.</li>
            <li> Face tingles all day and smells good.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry/sensitive skin however, treat yourself to applying some Lubriderm or Nivea men&#x27;s lotion for the best after-shave experience available.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good aftershave.</li>
            <li> you may have been too agressive, but that acts as a good feedback so that you can adjust your shaving methods.</li>
            <li> The price was certainly good</li>
            <li> Good if you don&#x27;t mind the price</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a good price in today&#x27;s market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good fragrance and feels good on face after shave, etc</li>
            <li> It burns, but it burns so good.</li>
            <li> Perfect before a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> good smell and freshens your face after a shave and contains alcohol which is good.</li>
            <li> Has good moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> I even bought the Prosaro eucalyptus shaving cream although I have Taylor&#x27;s shaving cream because I loved the after shave.</li>
            <li> Now I know that it is just as good.</li>
            <li> I use Proraso&#x27;s soap in a bowl as well, wonderful scent and rich lather.  </li>
            <li> I would have paid more for it, it is that good!</li>
            <li> Always happy with Proraso products, aftershave soothing and refreshing to the skin with a pleasant aroma pleasing to my&lt;br /&gt;wife.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell without being amazing.</li>
            <li> exceptional product.</li>
            <li> I love how good it smells and how great it leaves my skin feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has that refreshing tingle when applied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this aftershave for about a week and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> However, i purchased this product on the strength of its reviews and have been very pleased with it, and have had no problems with dryness.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance, not too strong.</li>
            <li> leaves a nice refreshing feeling after a great shave.</li>
            <li> but it was better if it prevented pimples after shave as well!</li>
            <li> The feeling on application is pleasing and the smell is great, but also very mild.</li>
            <li> Smells good, (very light scent).</li>
            <li> This aftershave leaves my skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing face tingling feeling post shave</li>
            <li> Among them I&#x27;ve really liked 4711,</li>
            <li> Great product - great price - fast shipping.    </li>
            <li> and this was a nice purchase in regard to that</li>
            <li> This has a nice manly smell to it as well.</li>
            <li> BUUUURN!&lt;br /&gt;Burns nice, tightens your face and dries it out a bit - use a balm or cream after this aftershave - a must!&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Proraso post shave balm.  </li>
            <li> It has that nice aftershave tingle you expect, but does not have that burning sensation some do (think of that scene from Home Alone).  </li>
            <li> This smells nice, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> and I liked the cooling effect when applied.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> Has a nice sting to it</li>
            <li> - Nice smell</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Proraso aftershave user for years and have just loved it for so many reasons.</li>
            <li> but she say it smells nice now.</li>
            <li> Still, very light, very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Scent lasts for hours and smells refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great gift for the special man in your life.</li>
            <li> Best stuff around..leaves a nice fresh clean smell..</li>
            <li> so I guess that settles the most important question!!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; like many aftershaves...</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best aftershave I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily, goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t take much and my skin feels awesome for hours after a shave.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and great classic scent.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have dry/sensitive skin, you&#x27;re done and in awe of how clean shaven and good</li>
            <li> Smells great and seems to moisturize my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> scent fades relatively quickly which is a good thing imo.</li>
            <li> She disdains most fragrances, but of Proraso she said, \\&quot;Mmmmm...</li>
            <li> Apply after shaving and it will rid you of irritation (within reason, don&#x27;t shave the top 3 lays of your skin off and expect anything to help that).</li>
            <li> I was stating in the beginning of this review sometimes you don&#x27;t get what you pay for, but with Proraso Aftershave you get more than you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love the Prosaro line.</li>
            <li> Nivea for men post shave balms work the best at moisturizing your face and lasting all day.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but it smells better than anything I found in stores.</li>
            <li> I just converted from Norelco electrics that I&#x27;ve used for many years to manual shaving, and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> will by more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Proraso products and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I love the Proraso line of products.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Perfectly in the middle.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask from a aftershave</li>
            <li> This is my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> I have adopted this scent as &amp;#34;my scent&amp;#34; and love it.</li>
            <li> but I would expect so much more for the money.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.  </li>
            <li> Better yet, my wife loves it when I use it.  </li>
            <li> This product gives your face a really good fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and how it helps you to not have bumps</li>
            <li> , I am so glad I found it and without doubt, when I run out I will most definately replenish stocks!!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite after shave&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that most of them are fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this aftershave.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt or sting, feels quite refreshing after apply.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love with Proraso products?  </li>
            <li> there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li> This product does the job but the scent that you will get it&#x27;s mostly alcohol...</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after a shave.</li>
            <li> The square bottle looks better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is EVERYTHING they say and MORE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I went out of my &amp;#34;comfort zone&amp;#34; and decided to use this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this scent to finish off a good shave, and the tingling it just the right amount.</li>
            <li> scent is nice and clean; my wife likes it.  </li>
            <li> After used it my face a nice clean and soothing feel.</li>
            <li> Though not what I was expecting/wanting, it does have a nice, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> This morning I was able to shave with it for the first time and I must say, I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> Said that, this after shave is awsome and has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> I use this with their shaving cream, and my face feels nice and clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, mild menthol aroma that fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a great feeling because while it has alcohol, there are other qualities that make it feel good.  </li>
            <li> Great lively scent - not too strong -</li>
            <li> Fragrance is also very pleasant but doesn&#x27;t linger for long.</li>
            <li> Apply this product when your face is still damp (not dripping wet) from towelling off or after your bloc osma (USE THIS) treatment for best effect.  </li>
            <li> For the price this is a decent aftershave, but if you like a pleasant scent in the morning...</li>
            <li> this is a good product and smells great, but a little pricey.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted something that did not have a strong scent it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, our company has a policy against strong scents.</li>
            <li> Not too strong of scent.</li>
            <li> Using this, I&#x27;ve no worried about walking into a meeting after shaving and bothering everyone with a strong aftershave</li>
            <li> This aftershave smells wonderful and light, my wife loves it and the only downside is that it&#x27;s aroma dissipates fairly quickly over the course of the morning.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best post shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this perfect aftershave, the smell, the freshness, the balance of odor - not too much , not too little, does not burn when applied, just everything about it.</li>
            <li> A refreshing cool, clean feel.</li>
            <li> Great scent, nice bottle, just a little too pricey.</li>
            <li> The box is nothing fancy, but one thing I enjoy is that this product is from Italy and they don&#x27;t hide from it.</li>
            <li> Its not overpowering at all, light yet smells manly, and the girlfriend LOVES it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s available elsewhere on Amazon with Prime delivery for $13.95.  </li>
            <li> FREE TIP:</li>
            <li> In fact, if I could only use one thing and was given a choice between this and one of the great shaving creams that I use with my safety razor, I&#x27;d pick this.</li>
            <li> so it stays available for others.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, always been a big fan...</li>
            <li> /&gt;SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100&#x27;s on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream</li>
            <li> It is super refreshing when first applied with a very clean smell.</li>
            <li> This was very impressive because normally once aftershaves applied an hour later</li>
            <li> Nice pleasant scent that fades after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is my first alcohol-type after shave in many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on after shave lotions or cologne, but this is really nice!</li>
            <li> but I followed the fellow reviews on here and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Well worth buying!</li>
            <li> Comfortable with a nice fresh feeling but not too much sting.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue - just a clean tingly feeling with a hint of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells clean doesnt linger so you can still use your cologne</li>
            <li> I splash this on and then clean up everything and the sink.</li>
            <li> &gt; - Makes your skin SUPER SMOOTH</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s great and my new favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> Usually I use both, but I&#x27;ve tried shaving with just the Proraso Pre Shave Cream while in the field and it delivers a great and satisfying shave all by itself.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice tightening tingle, but you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve been slapped in the face like on those old commercials.  </li>
            <li> the very beginning the Proraso experience is uber enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy scents kind of a guy.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it smells totally different.</li>
            <li> That is everything but the satisfying experience of building a nice, thick, warm lather with my badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> but definitely the good part of the shaving.</li>
            <li> is truly invigorating and will leave your skin feeling fresh and silky smooth</li>
            <li> comes close to the fresh, light scent of Prosaro.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be particularly drying, but if you have especially dry skin it may not be the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li> Feels great and does what it should with the Witch Hazel and other toners.  </li>
            <li> A true classic, I love the mild scent.</li>
            <li> The good stuff costs a little more</li>
            <li> Fresh clean aroma&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It has a mild smell and a fragrence that is not overwellming.</li>
            <li> Not only did it cure my razor burn, but I am able to wear cologne on top of it and not have it conflict with the smell of the cologne.</li>
            <li> After trying bunch of different products, i finally found the best ones.</li>
            <li> The bottle is great too, it doesn&#x27;t spill half the bottle during application.</li>
            <li> slight burn in the beginning but then leaves your face feeling great.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product and all the Proraso products I have tried have been positive and I appreciate their good quality and consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review.</li>
            <li> Great, fresh everyday aftershave.</li>
            <li> Will make your skin feel really fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can safely use a very liberal amount with my face knowing I won&#x27;t stink up a room, and the lotions really help relieve any shaving burn I might feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the reviews and must say that it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li> (but you do get what you pay for which to me is worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a regular guy who wanted to provide a review based on my own experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I would like it better if it wasn&#x27;t so loud...</li>
            <li> The alcohol dries my face out and does NOT leave me with that fresh manly feel that witch hazel gives.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent, quick cooling action, and of course, it&#x27;s Italian.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the last this morning, and would like to have more, but it costs more than I&#x27;m willing to pay, I can get 2 bottles of Aqua Velva for the price of 1 bottle of Proraso, that&#x27;s a shame, I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product I like using it, the low rating is for the high price.</li>
            <li> Proraso got it right with this aftershave.</li>
            <li> This Lotion is really good, it leaves a good cold sensation on your skin.</li>
            <li> The Italian firm Proraso manufactures an impressive line of shaving products.</li>
            <li> The smell is also light and refreshing and not overpowering like a lot of other aftershaves.</li>
            <li> This is not some old man after shave it is clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> To everyone who will use this product - when you first splash it on your face I want to to stop and think of ME.  </li>
            <li> While this has an invigorating scent when first applied, it diminishes over time, so you don&#x27;t go to the office smelling like the cologne counter at the department store.  </li>
            <li> Most alcohol-based aftershaves are about 40% and this is a close 2nd.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This gives your face such as refreshing feeling, and you don&#x27;t get any oily/creamy feeling afterwards like you do with nivea or gillete.</li>
            <li> I have used the proraso shave cream before, but this was the first time using their aftershave.</li>
            <li> Overall I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have kept at it now for two years and have saved a lot of money in doing so and have a pleasurable shave with hot lather</li>
            <li> (yes, hot lather,lot nicer than a dollop of gel out of a can).  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be trying out others before deciding which will be my favorite.</li>
            <li> It stings pretty</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the old time smell of the Proraso as well as these products leave my skin.  </li>
            <li> This was my first bottle.</li>
            <li> A have ordered the preshave cream to use with the other two products and I cannot wait to see if it manages to make my shave even better!</li>
            <li> Will not affect a good balm from what I have done, I do let it soak in for a few minutes before applying any balm.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply it either like other aftershaves, it gives a nice sensation.</li>
            <li> Masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower its states a clean well groomed man.</li>
            <li> the scent is clean, masculine and not too over powering.</li>
            <li> There was something about splashing this aftershave on that left me feeling confident and ready to take on the day.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, it is clear and definitely has a splash on your face kind of use.  </li>
            <li> Also use an appropriate caliber razor with such a cream, I prefer straight razor.</li>
            <li> and it refreshes and leaves the skin feeling nice and tight without over-drying.</li>
            <li> A nice little snap to start the morning</li>
            <li> Alcolado Glacial, Musgo Real, Irisch Moos.    </li>
            <li> It is quite old-fashioned, though, very barber-shoppy.  </li>
            <li> it felt very moisturized.</li>
            <li> After shaving this lotion cooled my face and made my skin feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, the cooling effect, and the fact that it does not burn too much.  </li>
            <li> Very subdued fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very citrusy, with herbal undertones.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to commit so much money</li>
            <li> It does not take much and you don&#x27;t have to worry that you put too much on because it does not overwhelm.</li>
            <li> Also, I was REALLY amazed at the so called &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling of your face when you apply it after shaving.</li>
            <li> See other 5 star reviews for more details and believe the love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still a bit high, but much</li>
            <li> May cost a little more than Old Spice or Aqua Velva - but definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth more than the $3 bottle from the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet review here.  </li>
            <li> At first my girlfriend said that I smelled like an old man after I used this after shaving.</li>
            <li> off?You can still find this on many other sights for under $15!</li>
            <li> Do not pay more for a product you can get for less.  </li>
            <li> That is the main reason I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle last night and quickly opened it up.  </li>
            <li> AND I am particular about NOT offending anyone.</li>
            <li> then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3&#x27;s are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.</li>
            <li> Nice cooling action, seems to help tame razor rash a bit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the new formula in the new bottle, which is a smaller glass square bottle, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 12 different aftershave splashes, looking for something invigorating, mentholated, fresh, soothing, great-smelling.  </li>
            <li> I honestly do not know how this junk gets so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The smell is faint but very nice</li>
            <li> and you find your new aftershave comes in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> new in safety razor shaving...</li>
            <li> During the process of searching for new shaving products I came across Proraso.  </li>
            <li> I used to use those cheap generic aftershaves from nivea, gillete, but after using proraso I will never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> This also gives you a tiny sting when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> I have several different aftershaves to choose from and I regularly go to this one to provide a refreshing splash to finish off my shave.</li>
            <li> The new alcohol version PALES in comparison to the old, luxurious witch hazel formula.</li>
            <li> use witch hazel/non alcohol aftershave for many reasons having to do with comfort but mainly because of a specific reason, I&#x27;m an alcoholic.</li>
            <li> The ultimate test:  my very scent-sensitive gal not only tolerates it, but really likes it.  </li>
            <li> thing I was concerned about before ordering was the burning, stinging slap from the old aqua velva type aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> I am completely sold on Proraso products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone that is over sensitive to smells like I am.</li>
            <li> No lotion here, just a stinky green cheap smelling substance.</li>
            <li> not heavy..</li>
            <li> It does contain alcohol, but this formula have never dried my face out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (If you have sensitive skin, may I recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic, it&#x27;s manly but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using straight witch hazel instead and searching for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was ready to send it back, when I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with good shaving products, electric razors, after shave, cream, gels.....etc.</li>
            <li> you get a more accurate amount dispensed and less wastage (my previous aftershaves I would pour too much and end up letting a few drops slide in the sink)..</li>
            <li> As it turns out you don&#x27;t always get what you pay for; nothing could stop irritation, smell decent, and keep my face moisturized following a shave.</li>
            <li> Just be warned, the photo you see associate with this review and this product is apparently the old formula, and the old bottle.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little of this to do the job, so I expect this bottle to last many months.  </li>
            <li> As a life long Aqua Velva user this after shave was a real treat.  </li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing my first bottle of Proraso aftershave, I used a dozen or so more expensive options.</li>
            <li> It smelled refreshingly clean and was not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> The scent is also very clean, and not too weak or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally like cologne smells or anything like that.</li>
            <li> general</li>
            <li> Generally clears up any irritation caused by the shaving process.</li>
            <li> Must have some oils in the formula --- much like the other Proraso products.  </li>
            <li> The distribution cap is one of those plastic stoppers with a really small pinhole - allows for easy control of how much you&#x27;re putting on - though it&#x27;d be hard to overdo it with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really think the formula got adjusted because it feels different from the previous version.</li>
            <li> Proraso by far beats any other brand.</li>
            <li> And, hey, if SimplyBeautiful saw the light and reduced the price from the outrageous $19.95 rip-off price to a fair and rational level, vote for the review as a way of saying thanks for the community service.</li>
            <li> I would prefer that it didn&#x27;t last quite as long to avoid competition with my spray-on colognes.  </li>
            <li> (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY</li>
            <li> days where my skin feels dry, I follow this up with a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recomend it especially for wet shavers.</li>
            <li> It has a slight burn for the first few seconds, then transitions into a cooling/tightening feeling that lasts.  </li>
            <li> So this is a pretty serious</li>
            <li> Smells like those old barber shops that I went to as a little kid.</li>
            <li> Having eschewed modern razors and their expensive cartridges I switched to an old school double edge razor with soap and brush.  </li>
            <li> after finding this stuff, i am a life long fan.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; - Stops minor cuts a bit faster&lt;</li>
            <li> I am a life long customer.</li>
            <li> and you get a little tingle but not a sharp burn.</li>
            <li> will continue to use other Proraso products such as the shaving cream, but the aftershave is ruined.</li>
            <li> my face feels quite dry.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t immediately apparent from the product description that this product had alcohol in it, so hopefully this review will be helpful to a few out there.  </li>
            <li> This size bottle oughta last me somewhere around half a year (ballparking)?</li>
            <li> , this lotion has a refreshing kick without being painful.</li>
            <li> The burn is minimal.</li>
            <li> The alcohol dried out my skin and left it with that burning feeling-</li>
            <li> The only bad part is the smell fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to linger, though, which I was not expecting from other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Increasingly perfumes, colognes and other scents are being frowned upon in the workplace.</li>
            <li> I think it might have a lower alcohol content than some other aftershaves to prevent this.  </li>
            <li> I heard that phrase used quite often from other guys reviewing shaving products, and now I know what they meant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this after trying other proraso stuff</li>
            <li> These are like IPODS compared to all other music players.</li>
            <li> Not much of an aftershave person ... cant stand the smell of someone that has just soaked themselves down with aftershave.</li>
            <li> &amp; the cold sensation is subtle yet satisfying.</li>
            <li> There was a slight sting (from the alcohol) but other than that it did not burn.  </li>
            <li> &gt; - Can&#x27;t say it has made my skin break out less, but compared to other aftershaves this is good&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like how you have to shake the bottle upside down to get it to come out..</li>
            <li> Skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out afterwards like other alcohol-based aftershaves.</li>
            <li> I like how it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all greasy/oily like previous aftershaves I&#x27;ve used..</li>
            <li> let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mild all around - sting isn&#x27;t too bad, but it is astringent.</li>
            <li> That being said, I almost wish this stuff lingered stronger a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would buy if a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I dabbed a little on my finger and took a whiff.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product after having read several times that alcohol based aftershaves should be avoided as they have a tendency to dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have not tried their products yet, you are missing out.</li>
            <li> I have tried few aftershave lotions when i started shaving, 10+ years ago, but none of them worked.</li>
            <li> Even though it stated that ingredients can change, their ad was VERY specific to the point that I&#x27;d call it false advertisement.</li>
            <li> but you usually wind up using a little less</li>
            <li> I hate wearing any scents because they later smell old or alcohol based</li>
            <li> After using this aftershave no more razor burn.</li>
            <li> Smell is not overwhelming</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the smell grew on her or</li>
            <li> Invigorating, but not overwhelming like some can be.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Proraso cream.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the alcohol in it which will dry your skin.</li>
            <li> which is exactly what I was looking for since I hate overpowering fragrances..</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t press hard-</li>
            <li> Subtle.  </li>
            <li> Very subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This aftershave has some nostalgic fragrance which makes you feel like a man.</li>
            <li> Sadly, that&#x27;s over now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry for the crummy review, but I have to tell the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Inconvenient to get out of bottle.  </li>
            <li> I used to have bad razor burn using a Mach 3 and Gillette shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> will not be disappointed, I wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone Singh.</li>
            <li> Today I went to re-order and \\&quot;SimplyBeautiful\\&quot; is selling this for an outrageous $19.49.....  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This does have some alcohol in it. I don&#x27;t find it to be particularly drying, but if you have especially dry skin it may not be the perfect product for you. It has a pleasant, mild menthol aroma that fades fairly quickly. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue - just a clean tingly feeling with a hint of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days where my skin feels dry, I follow this up with a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 12 different aftershave splashes, looking for something invigorating, mentholated, fresh, soothing, great-smelling.  Among them I&#x27;ve really liked 4711, Alcolado Glacial, Musgo Real, Irisch Moos.    Proraso splash has beaten out the others.    The ultimate test:  my very scent-sensitive gal not only tolerates it, but really likes it.  She disdains most fragrances, but of Proraso she said, \\&quot;Mmmmm...you smell good!\\&quot;  Oh, Proraso it is!</li>
            <li> Great complement to Proraso&#x27;s shave cream. Will make your skin feel really fresh. Highly recommend this product.  Looking forward to purchasing additional Proraco products</li>
            <li> This is my first alcohol-type after shave in many years.  Since I recently started DE shaving, I&#x27;ve been exploring higher-end products.  This after shave fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I was concerned about before ordering was the burning, stinging slap from the old aqua velva type aftershaves.  Well, this one doesn&#x27;t have that.  There is a nice tightening tingle, but you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve been slapped in the face like on those old commercials.  Functionally, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and clean; my wife likes it.  It is quite old-fashioned, though, very barber-shoppy.  It does tend to linger, though, which I was not expecting from other reviews.  Perhaps that is because I have a goatee that holds the scent, but I can still smell it for 3 or 4 hours after use.  I would prefer that it didn&#x27;t last quite as long to avoid competition with my spray-on colognes.  For that reason only I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing my first bottle of Proraso aftershave, I used a dozen or so more expensive options. As it turns out you don&#x27;t always get what you pay for; nothing could stop irritation, smell decent, and keep my face moisturized following a shave. That is until I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the very beginning the Proraso experience is uber enjoyable. The box is nothing fancy, but one thing I enjoy is that this product is from Italy and they don&#x27;t hide from it. You see things written in both Italian and English. Open the box and you find your new aftershave comes in a glass bottle. It made a statement to me because I can&#x27;t stand the cheapy feeling of plastic. Again there&#x27;s nothing fancy about the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the Proraso isn&#x27;t the bottle or the manly scent. The best part is in it&#x27;s performance. Apply after shaving and it will rid you of irritation (within reason, don&#x27;t shave the top 3 lays of your skin off and expect anything to help that). It doesn&#x27;t stop there it provides your face with the moisture it needs... This was very impressive because normally once aftershaves applied an hour later my face feels quite dry. I didn&#x27;t realize this until I used Proraso because a couple hours after I applied it, I touched my face and to my amazement it felt very moisturized. It makes your realize the stuff you were using was garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was stating in the beginning of this review sometimes you don&#x27;t get what you pay for, but with Proraso Aftershave you get more than you pay for. The price is great and the product is even better!!!</li>
            <li> Recieved this as a Christmas gift.  As a life long Aqua Velva user this after shave was a real treat.  Smells great and has that refreshing tingle when applied.  I&#x27;ve used the last this morning, and would like to have more, but it costs more than I&#x27;m willing to pay, I can get 2 bottles of Aqua Velva for the price of 1 bottle of Proraso, that&#x27;s a shame, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Great aftershave, reminds me when i was in Florence Italy. It is made there by the way.</li>
            <li> Great product - great price - fast shipping.    Not as drying as some aftershaves.  Must have some oils in the formula --- much like the other Proraso products.  May cost a little more than Old Spice or Aqua Velva - but definitely worth it</li>
            <li> This shaving lotion is good stuff! After shaving this lotion cooled my face and made my skin feel fresh and soft. There was no alcohol burn.  I am completely sold on Proraso products.</li>
            <li> almost takes care of all your after shave needs !new in safety razor shaving...and this was a nice purchase in regard to that</li>
            <li> Love the Prosaro line. This aftershave leaves my skin feeling amazing. This has a nice manly smell to it as well.</li>
            <li> To everyone who will use this product - when you first splash it on your face I want to to stop and think of ME.  Yes, as your face burns you remember me baby - lol. BUUUURN!&lt;br /&gt;Burns nice, tightens your face and dries it out a bit - use a balm or cream after this aftershave - a must!&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Proraso post shave balm.  Face tingles all day and smells good.  Nivea for men post shave balms work the best at moisturizing your face and lasting all day.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, the cooling effect, and the fact that it does not burn too much.  It is pricey, but it smells better than anything I found in stores.</li>
            <li> Not much of an aftershave person ... cant stand the smell of someone that has just soaked themselves down with aftershave. This is the only shave lotion I have used that I can stand the smell of. Best of all, my wife also likes it. It has a mild smell and a fragrence that is not overwellming. I would recommend it for anyone that is over sensitive to smells like I am. That is the main reason I gave it 5 stars. It is a bit pricie.</li>
            <li> I just converted from Norelco electrics that I&#x27;ve used for many years to manual shaving, and glad I did.  I&#x27;m using a Gillette Profusion blades but planning to go DE at some point.  I&#x27;ve used this aftershave for about a week and am very pleased with it.  It has that nice aftershave tingle you expect, but does not have that burning sensation some do (think of that scene from Home Alone).  I wanted something that did not have a strong scent it.  Increasingly perfumes, colognes and other scents are being frowned upon in the workplace. In fact, our company has a policy against strong scents. While this has an invigorating scent when first applied, it diminishes over time, so you don&#x27;t go to the office smelling like the cologne counter at the department store.  After used it my face a nice clean and soothing feel. It only takes a little of this to do the job, so I expect this bottle to last many months.  I was so impressed by the product that I&#x27;m now using Proraso shaving soap as well.  Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t immediately apparent from the product description that this product had alcohol in it, so hopefully this review will be helpful to a few out there.  This product has alcohol in it, and I would guess 25-30% of it is alcohol.  Most alcohol-based aftershaves are about 40% and this is a close 2nd.  I still use it but then use immediately afterward (after drying) a lotion-based product such as Lubriderm 6-in-1 lotion or Nivea for Men aftershave lotion.  Apply this product when your face is still damp (not dripping wet) from towelling off or after your bloc osma (USE THIS) treatment for best effect.  If you don&#x27;t have dry/sensitive skin, you&#x27;re done and in awe of how clean shaven and good you smell ;)  If you have dry/sensitive skin however, treat yourself to applying some Lubriderm or Nivea men&#x27;s lotion for the best after-shave experience available.  Oh, and start your process with a SOAP, not a cream.</li>
            <li> No lotion here, just a stinky green cheap smelling substance. Not worth more than the $3 bottle from the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Best stuff around..leaves a nice fresh clean smell..not heavy..I use it several times a day.  Great shiping and great price..will by more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy scents kind of a guy. I don&#x27;t generally like cologne smells or anything like that. That being said, I almost wish this stuff lingered stronger a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general it&#x27;s mild all around - sting isn&#x27;t too bad, but it is astringent. Nice cooling action, seems to help tame razor rash a bit. The smell is nice, not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; like many aftershaves...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this product again. This size bottle oughta last me somewhere around half a year (ballparking)? The distribution cap is one of those plastic stoppers with a really small pinhole - allows for easy control of how much you&#x27;re putting on - though it&#x27;d be hard to overdo it with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Proraso products and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint. It has that sting I like in my aftershave and will leave your face tingling and feeling great afterwards. The smell is also light and refreshing and not overpowering like a lot of other aftershaves. The only bad thing is the alcohol in it which will dry your skin. Overall, it&#x27;s great and my new favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet review here.  I love the Proraso line of products.  I use the pre-shave cream, the shaving cream and this aftershave daily.  This smells nice, but not overpowering. It&#x27;s not oily, goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t take much and my skin feels awesome for hours after a shave.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite aftershave. It smells great! Its not overpowering at all, light yet smells manly, and the girlfriend LOVES it. It doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply it either like other aftershaves, it gives a nice sensation. The bottle is great too, it doesn&#x27;t spill half the bottle during application. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this stuff. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best aftershave I have ever used.  It has a slight burn for the first few seconds, then transitions into a cooling/tightening feeling that lasts.  The scent is also very clean, and not too weak or overpowering.  Perfectly in the middle.</li>
            <li> Masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower its states a clean well groomed man. What more can you ask from a aftershave</li>
            <li> It is just aftershave.  Still, very light, very refreshing.  Subtle.  Very subdued fragrance.  A hint of astringency but again, seems like the motto here is restraint.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I like it! Not too strong of scent. It keeps ingrown hairs away! I highly recommend this product. This is my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> This Lotion is really good, it leaves a good cold sensation on your skin. I would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good aftershave. After reading the reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I used to use those cheap generic aftershaves from nivea, gillete, but after using proraso I will never go back to anything else. This gives your face such as refreshing feeling, and you don&#x27;t get any oily/creamy feeling afterwards like you do with nivea or gillete. This also gives you a tiny sting when you first apply it. It&#x27;s just awesome.</li>
            <li> Just be warned, the photo you see associate with this review and this product is apparently the old formula, and the old bottle. I&#x27;ve only tried the new formula in the new bottle, which is a smaller glass square bottle, but I absolutely love it. It is super refreshing when first applied with a very clean smell. The smell is great, but goes dissipates within an hour or two. So if you aren&#x27;t one who enjoys a lingering scent, this stuff is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does sting a bit on areas you may have been too agressive, but that acts as a good feedback so that you can adjust your shaving methods. It does contain alcohol, but this formula have never dried my face out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to aftershave. I have adopted this scent as &amp;#34;my scent&amp;#34; and love it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product after having read several times that alcohol based aftershaves should be avoided as they have a tendency to dry your skin.  However, i purchased this product on the strength of its reviews and have been very pleased with it, and have had no problems with dryness.  I think it might have a lower alcohol content than some other aftershaves to prevent this.  The feeling on application is pleasing and the smell is great, but also very mild.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with hopes of it smelling like Proraso Shave Cream.  Surprisingly, it smells totally different. This isn&#x27;t a problem.  Though not what I was expecting/wanting, it does have a nice, clean smell.  According to my wife, it smells like a toned-down version of Nightflight; she definitely approves!</li>
            <li> Using this, I&#x27;ve no worried about walking into a meeting after shaving and bothering everyone with a strong aftershave scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can safely use a very liberal amount with my face knowing I won&#x27;t stink up a room, and the lotions really help relieve any shaving burn I might feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great scent, nice bottle, just a little too pricey. I know that proraso isn&#x27;t boutique but I would expect so much more for the money.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has some nostalgic fragrance which makes you feel like a man. Even though the smell is not overpowering, someone can still notice it if they get close enough - which is exactly what I was looking for since I hate overpowering fragrances.. One thing that I have to mention though: This aftershave definitely stings upon application! Its not a bish-slap in the face like aqua-velva but it&#x27;s still a slap in the face. I like how it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all greasy/oily like previous aftershaves I&#x27;ve used.. I also like how you have to shake the bottle upside down to get it to come out.. you get a more accurate amount dispensed and less wastage (my previous aftershaves I would pour too much and end up letting a few drops slide in the sink)..</li>
            <li> Smells clean doesnt linger so you can still use your cologne and it refreshes and leaves the skin feeling nice and tight without over-drying. Proraso got it right with this aftershave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got the perfect scent, perfect refreshing feeling after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Proraso soap for safety-razor shaving and it all works great together.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Scent lasts for hours and smells refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great gift for the special man in your life.</li>
            <li> I have used the proraso shave cream before, but this was the first time using their aftershave. If you like the scent of the cream, you will like the scent of the aftershave.</li>
            <li> Great, fresh everyday aftershave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on after shave lotions or cologne, but this is really nice! The smell is faint but very nice and you get a little tingle but not a sharp burn. Along with the Proraso shaving soap and a nice DE razor, the best a man can get!</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best post shave I have ever had. Feels great and does what it should with the Witch Hazel and other toners.  Smells good, (very light scent). I splash this on and then clean up everything and the sink. I use this without shaving every morning after washing up. Will not affect a good balm from what I have done, I do let it soak in for a few minutes before applying any balm.</li>
            <li> The price was certainly good and I liked the cooling effect when applied.  My girl friend like it so I guess that settles the most important question!!</li>
            <li> A true classic, I love the mild scent.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  Love the stuff.  Better yet, my wife loves it when I use it.  See other 5 star reviews for more details and believe the love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD PRICE. Today I went to re-order and \\&quot;SimplyBeautiful\\&quot; is selling this for an outrageous $19.49.....  Hey, I don&#x27;t want to be SimplyBeautiful anyway so I checked around by clicking on the Proraso link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD NEWS: It&#x27;s available elsewhere on Amazon with Prime delivery for $13.95.  Still a bit high, but much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FREE TIP: While your at it try Proraso Pre Shave Cream - 3.6 oz for $9.59 &#x27;Add-on Prime&#x27;.  I wouldn&#x27;t shave without it.  In fact, if I could only use one thing and was given a choice between this and one of the great shaving creams that I use with my safety razor, I&#x27;d pick this. Usually I use both, but I&#x27;ve tried shaving with just the Proraso Pre Shave Cream while in the field and it delivers a great and satisfying shave all by itself.  That is everything but the satisfying experience of building a nice, thick, warm lather with my badger hair brush. -- Here&#x27;s wishing you a great shave.  Truly one of the 5 great \\&quot;Ss\\&quot; when coming in from the field.  (S***, Shower, Shave, Steak, and... Sex.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful.  Vote for it so it stays available for others.  And, hey, if SimplyBeautiful saw the light and reduced the price from the outrageous $19.95 rip-off price to a fair and rational level, vote for the review as a way of saying thanks for the community service.</li>
            <li> but since i started using a safety razor, i include this as part of the routine.  my wife likes the smell of it too</li>
            <li> Nice smell. I have several different aftershaves to choose from and I regularly go to this one to provide a refreshing splash to finish off my shave.</li>
            <li> This is not some old man after shave it is clean and fresh.  I have been using it for years</li>
            <li> This aftershave works wonders, I will not switch to anything else ever again. I used to have bad razor burn using a Mach 3 and Gillette shaving cream. After using this aftershave no more razor burn. Not only did it cure my razor burn, but I am able to wear cologne on top of it and not have it conflict with the smell of the cologne. If I want to go for a no-smell atmosphere (ie. exam room, this is the aftershave for you).</li>
            <li> Great stuff, always been a big fan...</li>
            <li> Does a great job of soothing my razor burn, and closing up those nicks and cuts.  Nice pleasant scent that fades after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the reviews and must say that it&#x27;s worth the money.  The good stuff costs a little more but you usually wind up using a little less so it all works out.  Has a nice sting to it so you know it&#x27;s working.  Very subtle fragrance.  Will buy again.  My one \\&quot;issue\\&quot; is with the product name.  When I think \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; I think hand and body lotion consistency.  This has the consistency of vodka.</li>
            <li> this is a good product and smells great, but a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy if a little cheaper. Good if you don&#x27;t mind the price</li>
            <li> The Italian firm Proraso manufactures an impressive line of shaving products. Their aftershave is a great way to finish off a shave. It&#x27;s very citrusy, with herbal undertones. The burn is minimal. (If you have sensitive skin, may I recommend [[ASIN:B0007XBHIE Proraso Proraso Liquid Cream After-Shave 3.4oz]]. It has the same scent, but is a cream. I have them both, but actually prefer the aftershave. At around $16.00 for 3.4 oz, that works out to about $5.00/ounce. I think that&#x27;s a good price in today&#x27;s market.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is old-school barbershop and the Italians are very good at recreating that feeling with their shaving products. Oh, let me explain my review title. There is no such word in Italian as Dioibarba. Period. It&#x27;s DOPOBARBA, which means \\&quot;aftershave\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> leaves a nice refreshing feeling after a great shave. slight burn in the beginning but then leaves your face feeling great. highly recommended</li>
            <li> Good fragrance and feels good on face after shave, etc</li>
            <li> A nice little snap to start the morning, this lotion has a refreshing kick without being painful. Fragrance is also very pleasant but doesn&#x27;t linger for long. Overall I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Dude, this stuff smells kinda like that stuff your Grandpa used to use but it is freaking awesome. I use this after applying witch hazel and use a Merker safey razor. It burns, but it burns so good. Generally clears up any irritation caused by the shaving process.</li>
            <li> The best! Definite panty-dropper</li>
            <li> Save yourself $8.95 and keep looking, amazon has this same item in a square bottle which is what you get, for $10.00 on Prime. This is a good product I like using it, the low rating is for the high price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving now for 15 years and have used various aftershaves.  I recently started shaving with a de (double edged) blade.  During the process of searching for new shaving products I came across Proraso.  After some extensive research, including reading reviews of Proraso products and learning of the reputation of their company, I decided to purchase their shaving cream, pre-shave cream and this aftershave. I received the bottle last night and quickly opened it up.  I dabbed a little on my finger and took a whiff.  It smelled refreshingly clean and was not overwhelming.  This morning I was able to shave with it for the first time and I must say, I absolutely loved it.  There was a slight sting (from the alcohol) but other than that it did not burn.  There was something about splashing this aftershave on that left me feeling confident and ready to take on the day.  I heard that phrase used quite often from other guys reviewing shaving products, and now I know what they meant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fresh clean aroma&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t burn&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves skin feeling refreshed&lt;br /&gt;* Smell is not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Price (but you do get what you pay for which to me is worth it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone is looking for a liquid aftershave.  I&#x27;m just a regular guy who wanted to provide a review based on my own experiences with this product. It may not be for everyone but I followed the fellow reviews on here and was not disappointed.  I will definitely make this purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product gives your face a really good fresh feeling. I use it every time I shave and it helps prevent bumps form popping up.</li>
            <li> after finding this stuff, i am a life long fan. the scent is clean, masculine and not too over powering. scent fades relatively quickly which is a good thing imo. exceptional product.</li>
            <li> Love this scent to finish off a good shave, and the tingling it just the right amount. Skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out afterwards like other alcohol-based aftershaves. Perfect before a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Amazing face tingling feeling post shave but definitely the good part of the shaving. I love the scent and how it helps you to not have bumps</li>
            <li> good smell and freshens your face after a shave and contains alcohol which is good. but it was better if it prevented pimples after shave as well!</li>
            <li> I tried this after trying other proraso stuff but I will stick with their awesome pre/post cream. The alcohol dried out my skin and left it with that burning feeling- I guess some people can tolerate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100&#x27;s on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don&#x27;t press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I&#x27;ve tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don&#x27;t want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3&#x27;s are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this perfect aftershave, the smell, the freshness, the balance of odor - not too much , not too little, does not burn when applied, just everything about it. Will buy it for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> By far my favorite aftershave.  Gives just enough sting...just enough fragrance.  Not overpowering at all.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Having eschewed modern razors and their expensive cartridges I switched to an old school double edge razor with soap and brush.  I have kept at it now for two years and have saved a lot of money in doing so and have a pleasurable shave with hot lather (yes, hot lather,lot nicer than a dollop of gel out of a can).  I use Proraso&#x27;s soap in a bowl as well, wonderful scent and rich lather.  This aftershave smells wonderful and light, my wife loves it and the only downside is that it&#x27;s aroma dissipates fairly quickly over the course of the morning.  This is the only aftershave I use now.  Well worth buying!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with good shaving products, electric razors, after shave, cream, gels.....etc. After trying bunch of different products, i finally found the best ones. Proraso by far beats any other brand. This is why most of their products are best sellers on amazon. If you have not tried their products yet, you are missing out. These are like IPODS compared to all other music players. Said that, this after shave is awsome and has a nice clean smell. Must have for anyone.</li>
            <li> Look closely at the description, they are selling you a different product than the picture shows.  I received, for the second time, the one that costs $14.00 buying it with prime, but which is called Dopobarba.  Do not pay more for a product you can get for less.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> I have tried few aftershave lotions when i started shaving, 10+ years ago, but none of them worked. My skin is too sensitive. Since then I have never used an aftershave, noticed that was the best option not to get my face irritated. Based on reviews from amazon here, i gave this a shot. Will never stop using it or switch to anything else.</li>
            <li> This aftershave beats all others in its class!!&lt;br /&gt;It is truly invigorating and will leave your skin feeling fresh and silky smooth, I am so glad I found it and without doubt, when I run out I will most definately replenish stocks!!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed, I wasn&#x27;t and I know you won&#x27;t be either!!</li>
            <li> Smells like an aftershave should smell; does what an aftershave should do! Get some!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite after shave&#x27;s.  I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, it is clear and definitely has a splash on your face kind of use.  It is a great feeling because while it has alcohol, there are other qualities that make it feel good.  Overall, this product and all the Proraso products I have tried have been positive and I appreciate their good quality and consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic, it&#x27;s manly but not too heavy. &amp; the cold sensation is subtle yet satisfying. Will definitely be trying out others before deciding which will be my favorite.</li>
            <li> great aftershave convenient bottle</li>
            <li> Great lively scent - not too strong - the scent dissipates with an hour. Has good moisturizing properties. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> After finding Proraso pre-shave creme, I needed to try all of their products.  Historically I haven&#x27;t used any after-shave, but I will now with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits:&lt;br /&gt; - Nice smell&lt;br /&gt; - Makes your skin SUPER SMOOTH&lt;br /&gt; - Stops minor cuts a bit faster&lt;br /&gt; - No inflammation to my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuetral:&lt;br /&gt; - Can&#x27;t say it has made my skin break out less, but compared to other aftershaves this is good&lt;br /&gt; - Inconvenient to get out of bottle.  \\&quot;Splash\\&quot; application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use in future.</li>
            <li> I would like it better if it wasn&#x27;t so loud... I rinsed it off in the shower and she could still smell it...</li>
            <li> I SPECIFICALLY ordered the Proraso that has witch hazel, the stuff I was sent has alcohol. It&#x27;s advertised as witch hazel by SimplyBeautiful/Deeva Fullfillment. Even though it stated that ingredients can change, their ad was VERY specific to the point that I&#x27;d call it false advertisement. Especially since the witch hazel formula is out of production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use witch hazel/non alcohol aftershave for many reasons having to do with comfort but mainly because of a specific reason, I&#x27;m an alcoholic. I do what I can to avoid fooling around with anything containing alcohol. So this is a pretty serious fubar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try it once as a comparison. The new alcohol version PALES in comparison to the old, luxurious witch hazel formula. The alcohol dries my face out and does NOT leave me with that fresh manly feel that witch hazel gives. It stings pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Proraso aftershave user for years and have just loved it for so many reasons. Sadly, that&#x27;s over now. I&#x27;m currently using straight witch hazel instead and searching for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use other Proraso products such as the shaving cream, but the aftershave is ruined. I honestly do not know how this junk gets so many positive reviews. I&#x27;m thinking that most of them are fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry for the crummy review, but I have to tell the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did you change the formula and ruin this stuff Proraso? It was utterly PERFECT before you screwed it all up. And SimplyBeautiful, you need to change the description to reflect the truth of the situation. RIP Proraso aftershave. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone Singh.</li>
            <li> I like alcohol-based aftershaves. This proraso product is excellent, and may even replace my aquavelva. It has a pleasant scent, quick cooling action, and of course, it&#x27;s Italian.</li>
            <li> At first my girlfriend said that I smelled like an old man after I used this after shaving. I&#x27;m not sure if the smell grew on her or what but she say it smells nice now. I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s by the way. I like the smell. Smells like those old barber shops that I went to as a little kid.</li>
            <li> I love this aftershave. Very refreshing and great classic scent. It helps me avoid razerburn. I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance, not too strong. Doesn&#x27;t hurt or sting, feels quite refreshing after apply. I would definitely recomend it especially for wet shavers.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the old time smell of the Proraso as well as these products leave my skin.  I am a life long customer.</li>
            <li> but $39.95?You gotta be kidding!&lt;br /&gt;Why are you trying to rip people off?You can still find this on many other sights for under $15!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love with Proraso products?  This aftershave feels great when I put it on, and it smell great.  The only bad part is the smell fades quickly.  I use this with their shaving cream, and my face feels nice and clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a decent aftershave, but if you like a pleasant scent in the morning...there are better ones out there. This product does the job but the scent that you will get it&#x27;s mostly alcohol...I really think the formula got adjusted because it feels different from the previous version.</li>
            <li> Always happy with Proraso products, aftershave soothing and refreshing to the skin with a pleasant aroma pleasing to my&lt;br /&gt;wife.</li>
            <li> Comfortable with a nice fresh feeling but not too much sting. Pleasant smell without being amazing. Bought a second time, may buy again.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell. Love the way my face feels after a shave. Invigorating, but not overwhelming like some can be. This was my first bottle. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It may be my fault...but I wanted to buy AFTER SHAVE BALM...this item was listed in that category...however it is something called after shave &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;......&lt;br /&gt;It is a liquid.....however it is anything but a balm type of product !</li>
            <li> Smells Amazing! I love how good it smells and how great it leaves my skin feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li> This item is not as pictured above.  What you get is actually this... [[ASIN:B0085UECY2 Proraso Aftershave Lotion, Refresh, 100 ml]] which is a great product but I was looking for something else and the picture above made me think this was different.  It&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I use it with the proraso preshave balm and the  shave cream.  Excellent results, very pleased.  Leaves a great post shave feeling.</li>
            <li> Smells great and seems to moisturize my skin pretty well. Mine came in a rectangular glass bottle, unlike the supplied image of this product. The square bottle looks better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with the Proarso shave soap. The two make a wonderful shave when paired together. A refreshing cool, clean feel. A have ordered the preshave cream to use with the other two products and I cannot wait to see if it manages to make my shave even better! Also use an appropriate caliber razor with such a cream, I prefer straight razor.</li>
            <li> This is EVERYTHING they say and MORE. I hate wearing any scents because they later smell old or alcohol based AND I am particular about NOT offending anyone. I have tried colognes, after shaves, body sprays and nothing comes close to the fresh, light scent of Prosaro. I even bought the Prosaro eucalyptus shaving cream although I have Taylor&#x27;s shaving cream because I loved the after shave. It does not take much and you don&#x27;t have to worry that you put too much on because it does not overwhelm. I look forward to shaving now. Also, I was REALLY amazed at the so called &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling of your face when you apply it after shaving. GET THIS! I would have paid more for it, it is that good!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Proraso cream. I didn&#x27;t realize that I purchased the lotion until it arrived. I was ready to send it back, when I decided to give it a try. While I still like the cream. This isn&#x27;t bad at all. It does give you that refreshed feeling after using it. I&#x27;m glad that I went out of my &amp;#34;comfort zone&amp;#34; and decided to use this lotion. Now I know that it is just as good.</li>
