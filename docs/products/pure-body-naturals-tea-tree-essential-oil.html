            <li>So when I was offered this Organic Tea Tree Oil from Australia made by Pure Body Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a huge money saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for a review for free.  </li>

            <li>I use Tea Tree Oil for so many different things, so this was a great price for how much you get!</li>
            <li>the smell is super strong but it does go away, I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne</li>
            <li>I would suggest you google tea tree oil and read for yourself all the amazing things it is good for and then come back here and get this nice big bottle.  </li>
            <li>Or better yet, try using it first</li>
            <li>Smells clean and inhibits bacterial growth that produces odor.  </li>
            <li>I put it in body wash, shampoo, lotion, salves, but most often I use it straight out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Add 5 drops oil to 1 tbsp sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>Apply warm compresses directly to stye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunburn:</li>
            <li>Apply warm compresses directly to stye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunburn:</li>
            <li>This tea tree oil is highly potent it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>Now I now why  the saying, &amp;#34; you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, is true.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this oil was the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil has a ton of uses so this extra large bottle is great.</li>
            <li>Clear bottles etc, allow light in and it deteriorates the oil.&lt;br /&gt;~ Has so many uses!&lt;br</li>
            <li>very satisfied with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>But if you are new to EOs please remember safe use by always using a carrier oil like olive oil, or coconut oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I have used many brands of Tea Tree Oil, and this one works just as good, if not better for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product has a strong smell that I can&#x27;t really stand.</li>
            <li>personally add tea tree oil to almost everything, as its anti-bacterial properties can really help with skin issues, and the cooling sensation it brings is always pleasantly welcomed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of tea tree oil especially when I learned about the many valuable uses for it.</li>
            <li>Keeps your bathroom fresh.</li>
            <li>Rather than smelling medicinal and fresh, it smells musty.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree Oil is also good and safe for dealing with acne, no more worrying about drying out your skin!</li>
            <li>adding a few droppers full into your favorite shampoo and conditioner, or your favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>and they are smooth and very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals Organic Tea Tree Oil was my first choice!</li>
            <li>We first encountered using tea tree oil when there was a lice outbreak at one of my children&#x27;s schools.</li>
            <li>Add 1-2 drops to a pan of hot water and breath in the steam, or massage the oil over the chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruises:</li>
            <li>and I love what a big bottle it is!!!</li>
            <li>essential oil.so many beneficial qualities.</li>
            <li>I paid a discounted amount for it, and I really feel like it was worth my money and time.</li>
            <li>At first, my skin purged and I had some acne flare ups,</li>
            <li>It quickly dries up blemishes, which is my main use for this product.</li>
            <li>First time using this,and I will always keep this in my house</li>
            <li>The skin is very clear and clean as the bottom of a person&#x27;s feet should be...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how very much I needed the Tea Tree Oil Australia from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li>Keep your diaper pail clean and fresh with a spray of tea tree oil mixed with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Tea Tree Oil is stellar, especially because it comes in a huge 4OZ</li>
            <li>It is just as good as the small I purchased from the instructor and thanks to its size, it will last a good long while.  </li>
            <li>I bought Tea Tree Oil from Pure Body Naturals to treat my scalp in hopes that I could regrow some of my hair.</li>
            <li>This large 4 oz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure if this is truly pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>When I got the opportunity to get Pure Body Naturals&#x27; Tea Tree Oil on a promotion</li>
            <li>Whats not to like about pure tree tree oil??</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have large sores on my scalp because of scratching (my fault).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely buy from this seller, as this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen for this large of a bottle of tea tree oil,</li>
            <li>I found this brand to be very high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I am ready for whatever these kids bring home this year.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It seems that the lotions soak into the skin too fast and don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>Mix 1 TB coconut oil with 1 drop of tea tree and 1 drop of lavender and gently apply to sunburned areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tattoos:</li>
            <li>Mix 1 TB coconut oil with 1 drop of tea tree and 1 drop of lavender and gently apply to sunburned areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tattoos:</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Even I didn&#x27;t know how much I would need it.</li>
            <li>Very pine-solly / bathroom cleaner menthol smell.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not even really tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Use it in many applications so far and still have a lot left.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Boils: Apply a warm washcloth for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>All natural product with several interesting ways&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a few drops in a hot foot bath and it keeps my sweaty feet healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Athletes Foot: Clean feet thoroughly, especially between toes.</li>
            <li>Allow to dry completely on hands before touching anything.</li>
            <li>Allow to dry completely on hands before touching anything.</li>
            <li>but I am hoping Pure Body Naturals Tea Tree Oil will stimulate some new hair growth and make my scalp healthier.</li>
            <li>I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative.</li>
            <li>Mainly for headaches and applying it to my temples.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite essential oil brand that isn&#x27;t the big 2.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>Put all blankets and pillows high heat in dryer while we waited and bagged up all clothing and teddy bears for the 48 hr recommended time (do on a Friday).</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it is 100% natural and pure tea tree oil or because it comes from Australia.</li>
            <li>Or, mix with coconut oil (which is naturally healing and soothing itself) and gently apply to the infected areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or dilute 1 drop of tea tree with 1 cup of water and rinse the infected area 1-2 times a day, as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inflammation:  Massage over the inflamed areas, gently and always toward the heart, or diffuse and inhale the tea tree oil directly or indirectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had pretty much forgotten about the tea tree oil I had ordered and the next day when it came in, I decided that I&#x27;d tried everything else why not try that!</li>
            <li>I love this for making cleaning products, certain herbal remedies and other things similar to that.  </li>
            <li>A tell, tell sign that it&#x27;s strong and not watered down.</li>
            <li>I need a new dropper.</li>
            <li>I have been fighting skin problems with my new born and was recommended to tea tree oil to help reduce the outbreaks.</li>
            <li>I put 2 droppers our shampoo and no more dandruff. :)</li>
            <li>I am excited to try it for other purposes.</li>
            <li>I am accustomed to a much higher quality essential oil.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>and it comes in a large size bottle so it will last you for a while.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Organic Tea Tree Oil from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li>So I bought this and pure coconut oil at the same time.</li>

            <li>No other compensation has been given, nor is intended.</li>
            <li>The size of this bottle of Tea Tree Oil is huge and they offer a money back guarantee if you are not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>You can make a general tea tree cleaner by combining 2 teaspoons of tea tree oil with 2 cups of water in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Therapeutic-grade oils at a fraction of the price of what you&#x27;d pay for Young Living Essential Oils....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Canker Sores: Apply a drop or two of oil directly to infected area with a cotton swab, 2 times daily.</li>
            <li>Dilute if necessary for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dilute if necessary for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can mix this with water and one other oil that is made by the Pure Body Naturals...</li>
            <li>This bottle is large enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li>Really dries up my skin so I can only use it every other day</li>
            <li>I really needed a larger bottle of tea tree than I had been getting from other essential oil companies.</li>
            <li>I have to highly recommend this to other&#x27;s with feet issues as well as their faces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally suffer from psoriasis and lots of itching due to a fragrance allergy.</li>
            <li>Its so strong, Makes you smell like angry old people i threw it out</li>

            <li> I use Tea Tree Oil for so many different things, so this was a great price for how much you get!</li>
            <li> the smell is super strong but it does go away, I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne</li>
            <li> I would suggest you google tea tree oil and read for yourself all the amazing things it is good for and then come back here and get this nice big bottle.  </li>
            <li> Or better yet, try using it first</li>
            <li> Smells clean and inhibits bacterial growth that produces odor.  </li>
            <li> I put it in body wash, shampoo, lotion, salves, but most often I use it straight out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Add 5 drops oil to 1 tbsp sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> Apply warm compresses directly to stye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunburn:</li>
            <li> Apply warm compresses directly to stye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunburn:</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is highly potent it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> Now I now why  the saying, &amp;#34; you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, is true.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this oil was the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil has a ton of uses so this extra large bottle is great.</li>
            <li> Clear bottles etc, allow light in and it deteriorates the oil.&lt;br /&gt;~ Has so many uses!&lt;br</li>
            <li> very satisfied with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> But if you are new to EOs please remember safe use by always using a carrier oil like olive oil, or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I have used many brands of Tea Tree Oil, and this one works just as good, if not better for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product has a strong smell that I can&#x27;t really stand.</li>
            <li> personally add tea tree oil to almost everything, as its anti-bacterial properties can really help with skin issues, and the cooling sensation it brings is always pleasantly welcomed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of tea tree oil especially when I learned about the many valuable uses for it.</li>
            <li> Keeps your bathroom fresh.</li>
            <li> Rather than smelling medicinal and fresh, it smells musty.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is also good and safe for dealing with acne, no more worrying about drying out your skin!</li>
            <li> adding a few droppers full into your favorite shampoo and conditioner, or your favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> and they are smooth and very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals Organic Tea Tree Oil was my first choice!</li>
            <li> We first encountered using tea tree oil when there was a lice outbreak at one of my children&#x27;s schools.</li>
            <li> Add 1-2 drops to a pan of hot water and breath in the steam, or massage the oil over the chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruises:</li>
            <li> and I love what a big bottle it is!!!</li>
            <li> essential oil.so many beneficial qualities.</li>
            <li> I paid a discounted amount for it, and I really feel like it was worth my money and time.</li>
            <li> At first, my skin purged and I had some acne flare ups,</li>
            <li> It quickly dries up blemishes, which is my main use for this product.</li>
            <li> First time using this,and I will always keep this in my house</li>
            <li> The skin is very clear and clean as the bottom of a person&#x27;s feet should be...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how very much I needed the Tea Tree Oil Australia from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li> Keep your diaper pail clean and fresh with a spray of tea tree oil mixed with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Tea Tree Oil is stellar, especially because it comes in a huge 4OZ</li>
            <li> It is just as good as the small I purchased from the instructor and thanks to its size, it will last a good long while.  </li>
            <li> I bought Tea Tree Oil from Pure Body Naturals to treat my scalp in hopes that I could regrow some of my hair.</li>
            <li> This large 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if this is truly pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> When I got the opportunity to get Pure Body Naturals&#x27; Tea Tree Oil on a promotion</li>
            <li> Whats not to like about pure tree tree oil??</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have large sores on my scalp because of scratching (my fault).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely buy from this seller, as this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen for this large of a bottle of tea tree oil,</li>
            <li> I found this brand to be very high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am ready for whatever these kids bring home this year.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It seems that the lotions soak into the skin too fast and don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> Mix 1 TB coconut oil with 1 drop of tea tree and 1 drop of lavender and gently apply to sunburned areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tattoos:</li>
            <li> Mix 1 TB coconut oil with 1 drop of tea tree and 1 drop of lavender and gently apply to sunburned areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tattoos:</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Even I didn&#x27;t know how much I would need it.</li>
            <li> Very pine-solly / bathroom cleaner menthol smell.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not even really tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Use it in many applications so far and still have a lot left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Boils: Apply a warm washcloth for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> All natural product with several interesting ways&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a few drops in a hot foot bath and it keeps my sweaty feet healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Athletes Foot: Clean feet thoroughly, especially between toes.</li>
            <li> Allow to dry completely on hands before touching anything.</li>
            <li> Allow to dry completely on hands before touching anything.</li>
            <li> but I am hoping Pure Body Naturals Tea Tree Oil will stimulate some new hair growth and make my scalp healthier.</li>
            <li> I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative.</li>
            <li> Mainly for headaches and applying it to my temples.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite essential oil brand that isn&#x27;t the big 2.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> Put all blankets and pillows high heat in dryer while we waited and bagged up all clothing and teddy bears for the 48 hr recommended time (do on a Friday).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it is 100% natural and pure tea tree oil or because it comes from Australia.</li>
            <li> Or, mix with coconut oil (which is naturally healing and soothing itself) and gently apply to the infected areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or dilute 1 drop of tea tree with 1 cup of water and rinse the infected area 1-2 times a day, as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inflammation:  Massage over the inflamed areas, gently and always toward the heart, or diffuse and inhale the tea tree oil directly or indirectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had pretty much forgotten about the tea tree oil I had ordered and the next day when it came in, I decided that I&#x27;d tried everything else why not try that!</li>
            <li> I love this for making cleaning products, certain herbal remedies and other things similar to that.  </li>
            <li> A tell, tell sign that it&#x27;s strong and not watered down.</li>
            <li> I need a new dropper.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting skin problems with my new born and was recommended to tea tree oil to help reduce the outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I put 2 droppers our shampoo and no more dandruff. :)</li>
            <li> I am excited to try it for other purposes.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to a much higher quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and it comes in a large size bottle so it will last you for a while.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Organic Tea Tree Oil from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li> So I bought this and pure coconut oil at the same time.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a natural girl, with color in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have also applied it directly to my skin as a spot treatment for acne.</li>
            <li> Smells strongly of &amp;#34;natural pinesol&amp;#34; but if you just use a couple of drops it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops to my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s SAL SUDS cleaning product and, boy, was that the right move!</li>
            <li> When cool, drape a towel over head and breathe in for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I am one of those new to essential oils moms and have heard al kinds of things about tea tree oil and what it can do for Uku&#x27;s aka head lice.</li>
            <li> oil seemed watered down &amp; only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> No other compensation has been given, nor is intended.</li>
            <li> The size of this bottle of Tea Tree Oil is huge and they offer a money back guarantee if you are not completely satisfied.</li>

            <li> You can mix this with water and one other oil that is made by the Pure Body Naturals...</li>
            <li> This bottle is large enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Really dries up my skin so I can only use it every other day</li>
            <li> I really needed a larger bottle of tea tree than I had been getting from other essential oil companies.</li>
            <li> I have to highly recommend this to other&#x27;s with feet issues as well as their faces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally suffer from psoriasis and lots of itching due to a fragrance allergy.</li>
            <li> Its so strong, Makes you smell like angry old people i threw it out</li>
            <li> this brand,&lt;br /&gt;~ Comes in a large bottle, this will last a very long time&lt;br /&gt;~ Dark bottle, keeps the oil fresher longer.</li>
            <li> You will regret getting a smaller one - they dont last as long as this one!</li>
            <li> not only did not work but left our hair dry, brittle, and damaged.</li>
            <li> I must say I have been sleeping very well this past</li>
            <li> This particular brand does seem to be a little stronger than others I have tries but it still does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> &amp; Minor Cuts: After cleaning the area well, apply a few drops of the oil directly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of using harsh chemicals on my children&#x27;s hair, I wanted an all natural remedy.</li>
            <li> So after my kids brought them home last year from school and a ton of money was spent on stocking up on head lice treatments and sprays</li>
            <li> Larger bottle than I expected.</li>
            <li> Once the corn or calluses have become soft use tweezers to remove, and apply a few drops of tea tree oil and cover with bandage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Allergies: Use topically by massaging into the chest, abdomen or the reflex points of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arthritis: To help reduce pain associated with the swelling of arthritis, add 20 drops of tea tree oil to 2 ounces of grapeseed or other carrier oil.</li>
            <li> product has helped my dry feet.  </li>
            <li> Allow to dry, then dust with corn starch.</li>
            <li> but I guess it works to reduce and dry up acne</li>
            <li> give this product a try, What do you have to lose except acne, dry skin, dry scalp,and lice.</li>
            <li> Baking and cooking a lot leaves me with small burns and cuts that are some times hard to heal quickly.  </li>
            <li> : Add a drop to your normal cleansing routine or dab a very small amount on acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Blisters: Wash area carefully, then apply as for cuts and wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product and not ready to comment.</li>
            <li> Leaked way too much and dropper was broken as well.</li>
            <li> The only slight disappointment that I had with this order was that the eyedropper was completely broken when I opened the box, which has happened more than once actually.</li>
            <li> Treats psoriasis and other skin</li>
            <li> One dropper is all this takes and lasts longer than any other cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Or, add 10 drops oil to 1 tbsp of grapeseed or other carrier oil and massage on feet and between toes daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This product did not smell like any other tea tree oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I had an upper respiratory infection this past week and started putting 7 drops in my diffuser every night</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m saying is that if you have a flare on your skin that you just can&#x27;t FIX with other oils or lotions...</li>
            <li> Hope to try a small bottle from different carrier.</li>
            <li> Compared to other tea tree oils I have bought from different brands in the past, the scent of this one is off.</li>
            <li> The dropper was broken, the &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; has a chemically odor and does not represent what I am accustomed to as far as tea tree oils are concerned.</li>
            <li> Relieves asthma or other breathing conditions when a few drops are added to a humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;•  </li>
            <li> Control:  Household ants and other pests dislike Tea Tree oil, so a few drops put at the point of entry will deter them.</li>

            <li> Now they do send it in a little cardboard box with a slapped on label which says &amp;#34;Organic Tea Tree Oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> it burned a little, too</li>
            <li> it stings a little  </li>

            <li> I have been using this a few days now and already see a difference in improvement.</li>
            <li> My doctors appoint wasn&#x27;t for a few days</li>
            <li> There is still a bit of redness and a few bumps but that, too is healing.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops in my shampoo (to keep dandruff at bay) and a few drops in my body lotion every night.</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty bad.</li>
            <li> raw honey.</li>
            <li> a little bit of tea tree oil can help!</li>
            <li> Works as as antiseptic on small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;•  </li>
            <li> I have been mixing the Tea Tree Oil with a bit of Argan Oil and massaging my scalp with this mixture for the past week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update this in a few weeks and let everyone know my progress!</li>
            <li> With a dropper, drop a small amount into aching ear, tilting head to one side for a moment.</li>
            <li> So I purchased a small bottle from her to test out</li>
            <li> No more messing with keeping the dropper separate.  </li>
            <li> Usually oils come in 1 oz</li>
            <li> used it this past week on a small burn on my wrist and a small cut on my thumb.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed my scalp isn&#x27;t itching as badly as usual.</li>
            <li> My girls picked up lice this past summer.</li>
            <li> Since I use tea tree oil up close on my skin, I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely not tea tree oil and is being falsely advertised I would not recommend you use this at all because it is not what it is being sold as if I could give the product 0 stars</li>
            <li> I could hardly stand it.</li>
            <li> Naturally cures bad breath.</li>
            <li> Removes ticks; just add to skin, and the little stinker will usually unlatch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bladder Infection: In a shallow bath, add 10 – 15 drops of oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Burns: Run icy cold water on area.</li>
            <li> It actually smells horrible, like chemicals or something other than tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> my dropler arrived broken</li>
            <li> but my dropper was broken.</li>
            <li> This time it was my head and behind my ear.</li>
            <li> Just to see what would happen, I had my husband take a picture of the place behind my ear where it looked like a severe sunburn that was peeling.</li>
            <li> Came in broken with a broken cap.</li>
            <li> By far the worst smell in the world..</li>
            <li> I did not receive a discount when purchasing this product and it seems like to me the individuals who did receive the discount are leaving  fake reviews</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably because it had gotten to such a terrible state.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t get me wrong, and let me warn you...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was desperate.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, when you get as desperate as I was, you don&#x27;t care what it smells like.</li>
            <li> I start itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> When confronted with foul smells from cooking, musty orders from dampness or even the medicinal smell in a sick room, take a few out to freshen the air and remove the nasty smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, rinse as directed for bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carbuncles</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get as bad as mine.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I work in the school system and am constantly fearful of getting lice.</li>
            <li> Completely horrible product smell like chemicals mix with eucalyptus oil</li>
            <li> I also plan to use this oil as mosquito repellent!</li>
            <li> It was the worst tea tree oil I ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a staple in my medicine cabinet. I am always searching for a good quality brand and now I found it. I did order it through a special promotion to test it and share my honest opinion. I do use tea tree oil in the kids shampoo to avoid lice and I also use it diluted for cleaning solutions and for skin acne . This oil smells really good and it comes in a large size bottle so it will last you for a while. I am very happy with my purchase and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of tea tree oil especially when I learned about the many valuable uses for it. We first encountered using tea tree oil when there was a lice outbreak at one of my children&#x27;s schools. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of using harsh chemicals on my children&#x27;s hair, I wanted an all natural remedy. Pure Body Naturals Organic Tea Tree Oil was my first choice! I&#x27;ve read the reviews before purchasing and have had many friends recommend that I use Tea Tree Oil as a preventative from anyone getting lice. Works wonders for your hair also eliminating dandruff! Tea Tree Oil is also good and safe for dealing with acne, no more worrying about drying out your skin! If you have any type of skin issues (eczema/dry skin) a little bit of tea tree oil can help! Wonderful product will buy again when I run out! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This bottle is large enough to last a long time. I use this every day for many things! Mainly for headaches and applying it to my temples. This brand goes on great, has a dropper and is a great bargin. This product came on time and intact. I would recomend it to anyone. A discount was given for my review.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Use it in many applications so far and still have a lot left.</li>
            <li> I swear by tea tree oil.  This is a list (from keeperof thehome.com) of things that it does...&lt;br /&gt;•  Helps heal and soothe sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;•  Heals skin infections naturally.&lt;br /&gt;•  Relieves itchiness from rashes as well as helps reduce rashes.&lt;br /&gt;•  Can be used as an all-purpose cleaner: Fill a spray bottle with 1-2 tsp. of tea tree oil and the rest of the bottle with water.&lt;br /&gt;•  Treats acne.&lt;br /&gt;•  Helps to prevent lice naturally; just add a few drops to your shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;•  A few drops in your pets’ crates or beds keep the fleas away.&lt;br /&gt;•  Removes ticks; just add to skin, and the little stinker will usually unlatch.&lt;br /&gt;•  Cures toenail fungus and Athlete’s foot.&lt;br /&gt;•  Helps remove skin tags.&lt;br /&gt;•  Naturally cures bad breath. (Swish some tea tree oil and water in you mouth.)&lt;br /&gt;•  Can be used in a homemade toothpaste recipe.&lt;br /&gt;•  Has been found as an effective treatment for warts.&lt;br /&gt;•  Soothes insect bites.&lt;br /&gt;•  Treats ringworm.&lt;br /&gt;•  Treats psoriasis and other skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;•  Relieves asthma or other breathing conditions when a few drops are added to a humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;•  Works as as antiseptic on small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;•  Keeps your bathroom fresh. •  Relieves earaches; mix 1 drop of tea tree oil with 1 tsp. olive oil, drop mixture into the ear and then remove by tilting head.&lt;br /&gt;•  Freshen laundry: Add a few drops in your washing machine to scent your clothes. Also, if you forgot to put the clothes in the dryer, run again with tea tree oil to remove mildew. You can also scent wool dryer balls with tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;•  Helps freshen carpet.&lt;br /&gt;•  Can be used in several homemade kitchen cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;•  Cleans mold: Mix apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil and scrub mold; place outside to sun-dry.&lt;br /&gt;•  Can be used in a homemade natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my itchy scalp the most.  This is a huge bottle so it will last a long time. I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.s product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deal! Therapeutic-grade oils at a fraction of the price of what you&#x27;d pay for Young Living Essential Oils.... I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased to find this product!</li>
            <li> I am one of those new to essential oils moms and have heard al kinds of things about tea tree oil and what it can do for Uku&#x27;s aka head lice. So after my kids brought them home last year from school and a ton of money was spent on stocking up on head lice treatments and sprays, I decided that I needed to get some tea tree oil. So when I was offered this Organic Tea Tree Oil from Australia made by Pure Body Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. I am ready for whatever these kids bring home this year. I know that I just need to put some drops on the kids hair and let it soak overnight and in the morning wash it off and say Bye Felicia to the ukus. I definitely recommend this Organic Tea Tree Oil from Pure Body Naturals.</li>
            <li> It may be a good product but it is advertised as ORGANIC and no where does it say that on the bottle label.  Now they do send it in a little cardboard box with a slapped on label which says &amp;#34;Organic Tea Tree Oil&amp;#34;.  So who knows.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I use this tea tree oil everyday. My son puts it on his face before bed for his acne. I put 2 droppers our shampoo and no more dandruff. :)</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding oil. I use it every morning and its perfect. I love how it smells and feels. Great purchase. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Larger bottle than I expected. I use a few drops in a hot foot bath and it keeps my sweaty feet healthy. Smells strongly of &amp;#34;natural pinesol&amp;#34; but if you just use a couple of drops it is not overwhelming. Great natural product and very fast and secure shipping.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is great for a lot of different uses.  I love this for making cleaning products, certain herbal remedies and other things similar to that.  One dropper is all this takes and lasts longer than any other cleaner.  You can mix this with water and one other oil that is made by the Pure Body Naturals...aka Lemon.  It&#x27;s safer and more effective.  I absolutely love this.  I also highly recommend this.  It&#x27;s also a huge money saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped my dry feet.  I know it says to use on facial areas, but I wanted to see what it would do for my feet.  After removing the dead skin, I applied this with some tea tree oil and they are smooth and very soft to the touch.  The skin is very clear and clean as the bottom of a person&#x27;s feet should be... aka like a baby&#x27;s feet.  I love the way that my feet feel and how healthy that this has made them look!  I have to highly recommend this to other&#x27;s with feet issues as well as their faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for a review for free.  No other compensation has been given, nor is intended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tea Tree Oil which is something different than the type of lotions I&#x27;ve been trying for my eczema.  It seems that the lotions soak into the skin too fast and don&#x27;t work very well.  I tried tea tree oils and they have taken away the flakiness from my eczema.  It doesn&#x27;t itch anymore which is helping it to heal faster.  I&#x27;m glad I was offered this product to review for my truthful and unbiased thoughts.  This is one of the higher quality brands of tea tree oil that I have used and I am very happy with this brand.  It stays on my skin for a while to moisturize that spot and isn&#x27;t sticky or yucky feeling.  I would definitely recommend this to some one with eczema.</li>
            <li> It is a very good oil.</li>
            <li> I bought Tea Tree Oil from Pure Body Naturals to treat my scalp in hopes that I could regrow some of my hair. I have been mixing the Tea Tree Oil with a bit of Argan Oil and massaging my scalp with this mixture for the past week. So far my scalp feels wonderful and my hair looks shiny. I have been reading about the benefits of Castor Oil and it&#x27;s ability to regrow hair so I am thinking about making it a replacement for the Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we age we often have thinning hair and skin problems but I am hoping Pure Body Naturals Tea Tree Oil will stimulate some new hair growth and make my scalp healthier. I do intend to read more about the uses of Tea Tree Oil so I can put this huge bottle of oil to good use!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed this oil with some Lavender Oil and Rosemary Oil and put it in my diffuser. It is my understanding Tea Tree Oil is an excellent disinfectant but has a strong scent so I thought some of my favorite EO&#x27;s would make a lovely helpful mixture. I must say I have been sleeping very well this past week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this in a few weeks and let everyone know my progress!</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in essential oils. And this was a good purchase. Tea tree oil is probably my favorite oil. It is the most healing substance I have ever found. We use it on everything from cuts and scrapes to acne to fungus to rash to dandruff. I put it in body wash, shampoo, lotion, salves, but most often I use it straight out of the bottle. This large 4 oz. bottle is a big one. And you just can&#x27;t beat the price. If I could only buy one essential oil, Tea Tree would be the one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am including some uses of tea tree oil provided by my friends at backdoorsurvival.com. Hope they help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abrasions &amp; Minor Cuts: After cleaning the area well, apply a few drops of the oil directly. If a bandage is needed, allow a few drops of the oil to penetrate a cotton ball, then lay it face down on the wound with a bandage on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne: Add a drop to your normal cleansing routine or dab a very small amount on acne breakouts.  You can also add 20 – 40 drops of the oil to your regular face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air Freshener: Keep a supply of cotton balls soaked in tea tree oil packed away in a plastic bag or tin.  When confronted with foul smells from cooking, musty orders from dampness or even the medicinal smell in a sick room, take a few out to freshen the air and remove the nasty smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allergies: Use topically by massaging into the chest, abdomen or the reflex points of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arthritis: To help reduce pain associated with the swelling of arthritis, add 20 drops of tea tree oil to 2 ounces of grapeseed or other carrier oil. Massage into affected areas 2-3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asthma: Add a few drops of oil to a pan of water and heat on stove.

            <li> I LOVE TEA TREE OIL!!!! It works incredible for all kinds of things. I use it for all our fungal needs if and when we have had them. It works incredibly in dog shampoo and in the water to get rid of fleas and ticks. It also gets rid of lice, I put it in our shampoo bottles and conditioner bottles. I also use it on every cup, scrap, and bump to keep infection away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the Pro&#x27;s of this brand,&lt;br /&gt;~ Comes in a large bottle, this will last a very long time&lt;br /&gt;~ Dark bottle, keeps the oil fresher longer. Clear bottles etc, allow light in and it deteriorates the oil.&lt;br /&gt;~ Has so many uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found any cons as of yet. I just like this brand over the brands I have bought on Amazon before. Even the smell is better.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have used many brands of Tea Tree Oil, and this one works just as good, if not better for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for testing purposes. All opinions are of my own.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bc I really needed a larger bottle of tea tree than I had been getting from other essential oil companies. I was given a promo discount code to try out this product. So thankful bc I really like it. The smell is great and I love what a big bottle it is!!! I added a few drops to my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s SAL SUDS cleaning product and, boy, was that the right move! It made an already amazing cleaning product even better. The only slight disappointment that I had with this order was that the eyedropper was completely broken when I opened the box, which has happened more than once actually. Bummer. Other than that, I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This product did not smell like any other tea tree oil I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m unsure if this is truly pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I recently took a class on how to use essential oils and the instructor said that Tea Tree oil and Lavender were in her house at all times. So I purchased a small bottle from her to test out and I really liked all the uses that it had.  When I got the opportunity to get Pure Body Naturals&#x27; Tea Tree Oil on a promotion so I could review it and test it, I jumped at the chance.  Tea Tree oil has so many uses it would take me all day to list them but here is what we use it for in my house:  acne, cleaning ( LOVE it for this!), blepharitis (an eye infection my husband gets, it is like a sty and this cleans it up really fast), and cold sores (helps to heal faster than the over the counter stuff at the store).  I love that this product is organic and therapeutic grade.  It is just as good as the small I purchased from the instructor and thanks to its size, it will last a good long while.  I would suggest you google tea tree oil and read for yourself all the amazing things it is good for and then come back here and get this nice big bottle.  You will regret getting a smaller one - they dont last as long as this one!</li>
            <li> Completely horrible product smell like chemicals mix with eucalyptus oil my dropler arrived broken this is absolutely not tea tree oil and is being falsely advertised I would not recommend you use this at all because it is not what it is being sold as if I could give the product 0 stars I would I am returning this part of tomorrow I did not receive a discount when purchasing this product and it seems like to me the individuals who did receive the discount are leaving  fake reviews or i received something totally different than what  they did never again as the saying goes you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> the tea tree oil is fine but my dropper was broken. I need a new dropper.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite essential oil brand that isn&#x27;t the big 2. Their essential oils are the strongest and I have tried a bunch of the smaller brands. I had an upper respiratory infection this past week and started putting 7 drops in my diffuser every night and I started feeling better within 2 days. If you are still congested, mix 7 or 8 drops in jojoba oil and rub it on your chest and neck. You will feel better, but you will smell like a medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I have been fighting skin problems with my new born and was recommended to tea tree oil to help reduce the outbreaks. I have been using this a few days now and already see a difference in improvement. As I research more uses for tea tree oil I am excited to try it for other purposes. I was glad I was given the opportunity to try this free in return for my unbiased opinion. Hands down a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is highly potent it works really well for me. I&#x27;ve been having issues with scalp for a while now and and a friend suggested tea tree oil.Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the Tea Tree essential oil.so many beneficial qualities.Tea tree oil has a ton of uses so this extra large bottle is great. There are so many great uses for this therapeutic oil. But if you are new to EOs please remember safe use by always using a carrier oil like olive oil, or coconut oil. great household cleaner as well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how very much I needed the Tea Tree Oil Australia from Pure Body Naturals. Even I didn&#x27;t know how much I would need it. Let me say that I have seborrhea dermatitis, eczema and psoriasis. It all depends on where on my skin we are talking about. I get what I call &amp;#34;flares&amp;#34;... that&#x27;s when all of a sudden something on my skin seems to flare up and I have to figure out what I need to put where. This time it was my head and behind my ear. I could hardly stand it. My doctors appoint wasn&#x27;t for a few days so I decided to self-treat it. I tried everything I had from lotions to pills to ice packs and heat packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate. I had pretty much forgotten about the tea tree oil I had ordered and the next day when it came in, I decided that I&#x27;d tried everything else why not try that! Just to see what would happen, I had my husband take a picture of the place behind my ear where it looked like a severe sunburn that was peeling. That was about 5 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it is 100% natural and pure tea tree oil or because it comes from Australia. All I know is that it STOPPED THE ITCHING and it stopped from scratching myself to death. It calmed my skin... it burned a little, too but that&#x27;s probably because it had gotten to such a terrible state. It doesn&#x27;t burn when I put it on now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I went to the doctor and I had to show her the photo for her to know just how sever it had been. She couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. You can see by the before &amp; after photos, that the peeling is totally gone. There is still a bit of redness and a few bumps but that, too is healing. My Dr. suggested that rather than prescribe a medicated shampoo, I should keep using the tea tree oil. I promised I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, and let me warn you... Tea Tree oil does NOT smell good. HOWEVER, when you get as desperate as I was, you don&#x27;t care what it smells like. I proudly walk around smelling like tea tree oiland don&#x27;t mind it a bit. What I&#x27;m saying is that if you have a flare on your skin that you just can&#x27;t FIX with other oils or lotions... tea tree oil will probably fix it for you. It did for me. Or better yet, try using it first so it doesn&#x27;t get as bad as mine. Oh, and my arm, the Dr. said it could be Seborrhea but it is probably psoriasis and to start using tea tree oil on it. I took a picture just to remind me why I need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate to receive this product at a promotional cost in exchange for my HONEST &amp; UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product and not ready to comment. All natural product with several interesting ways&lt;br /&gt;to use for satisfaction. It works welll for acne skin which I do not have.  I have not yet used this product .</li>
            <li> this smells heavenly. I have used it as a lice treatment and also for acne. It helped both times. I will repurchase this</li>
            <li> By far the worst smell in the world.. I cannot get this smell out of my hair even after 3 washes. Its so strong, Makes you smell like angry old people i threw it out</li>
            <li> I use it instead of deodorant and it works great.  Smells clean and inhibits bacterial growth that produces odor.  Much better than over the counter stuff with all those chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love that it came with a glass dropper that can screw into the bottle for a permanent lid! No more messing with keeping the dropper separate.  I use Tea Tree Oil for so many different things, so this was a great price for how much you get!</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty bad. Very pine-solly / bathroom cleaner menthol smell. I was planning on returning it after I smelled it and had my family members complain about it, but product works! It&#x27;s helped my eczema and pimples. I mix a few drops in my shampoo (to keep dandruff at bay) and a few drops in my body lotion every night. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> bought it to remove skin tags...Totally works.  I went to re-apply &amp; they were GONE!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed. .this oil seemed watered down &amp; only 3/4 full. The dropper had a chipped tip..Will not order again. Hope to try a small bottle from different carrier. This had NO SCENT at all. I know my oils.When in doubt,throw it out!</li>
            <li> I got this product with a discount. I have dandruff issues and I want to try it out. I previously had used tea tree shampoo. This product has a strong smell that I can&#x27;t really stand. I have to admit it does give a mint cooling feeling when using it. And that feels good sometimes. I just don&#x27;t like it when I don&#x27;t wash my hair for one day I start itching like crazy. I am still in the process of seeing it this item makes my dandruff go away.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle of Tea Tree Oil - will definitely last a long time when I&#x27;m using it to try different diy facial treatments  for my oily skin</li>
            <li> I used this for a fungal infection of my nails.  After months of using another treatment recommended by my doctor, I read an article in Prevention Magazine where a doctor from U of A recommended this.  I used it for one month as directed, and the infection is finally gone!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I like the face that it comes in a larger bottle 4 oz. Usually oils come in 1 oz so I would have to order 4 different times to get 4 oz. So I really like the bigger size. Also this is a glass bottle which is really important to me when ordering oils. The dropper is also glass. I really like this tea tree oil as it has helped me with multiple bug bits and acne.  I would highly recommend this oil. I was given a slight discount to review this product.</li>
            <li> Whats not to like about pure tree tree oil?? As an RN, this stuff has so many medicinal uses for your skin. Burns, bug bites, dandruff, etc etc.I found this brand to be very high quality and I am using it for more reasons than I can list here! Purchased during promotion for honest evaluation.Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using Dessert Essence Tea tree oil for many years.  I wanted to try this out because it seemed like a real good deal for the 4 ounce bottle, so I decided to try it.  Now I now why  the saying, &amp;#34; you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, is true.  I don&#x27;&#x27;t know what they put in this but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the tea tree oil that I have been using.  It actually smells horrible, like chemicals or something other than tea tree oil.  I would NOT recommend this at all!  It&#x27;s probably not even really tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get some of this for quite some time.  Baking and cooking a lot leaves me with small burns and cuts that are some times hard to heal quickly.  I also wanted to add this to my emergency kit.&lt;br /&gt;I used it this past week on a small burn on my wrist and a small cut on my thumb.  I tried this without using Neosporin just too see how it did.  It definitely helped the healing process and keep the area moisturized so it did not continue to crack.  I used it 3x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Really dries up my skin so I can only use it every other day but I guess it works to reduce and dry up acne</li>
            <li> I use this every night on my face , 3 drops mixed with my face moisturizer it stings a little  the smell is super strong but it does go away, I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne I bought it hoping it would help with my acne scarring I see a little  improvement I still haven&#x27;t found something that works yet just trying out diffrent oils</li>
            <li> I normally suffer from psoriasis and lots of itching due to a fragrance allergy. Sometimes I have large sores on my scalp because of scratching (my fault). I&#x27;m a natural girl, with color in my hair. The first thing I noticed about this oil was the strong smell. A tell, tell sign that it&#x27;s strong and not watered down. I began using it on my twist out before I undo the twists and it worked perfectly.  I have also noticed my scalp isn&#x27;t itching as badly as usual. I paid a discounted amount for it, and I really feel like it was worth my money and time. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 days, and I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the results. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my acne.</li>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my skin since I received it. I have added it to my moisturizer and applied it a couple times. I have also applied it directly to my skin as a spot treatment for acne. At first, my skin purged and I had some acne flare ups, but by day 3 my skin began looking clearer, which is, obviously, a good thing. It quickly dries up blemishes, which is my main use for this product. I also added some to my shampoo last night and used it as a scalp soother. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product and would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to a much higher quality essential oil. The product did arrive on time, actually earlier than anticipated. However, I will not be purchasing again. This is the third mistake I made in an order of three separate &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; producers. I feel as though I&#x27;ve thrown my money away. The dropper was broken, the &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; has a chemically odor and does not represent what I am accustomed to as far as tea tree oils are concerned.</li>
            <li> First time using this,and I will always keep this in my house</li>
            <li> My girls picked up lice this past summer. Not fun! Over the counter lice treatment not only did not work but left our hair dry, brittle, and damaged. So I bought this and pure coconut oil at the same time. Mixed three drops into 2-3 oz if coconut oil coated the hair covered left on for two hours shampooed rinsed and bam. No lice. Put all blankets and pillows high heat in dryer while we waited and bagged up all clothing and teddy bears for the 48 hr recommended time (do on a Friday). Also put one drop in all shampoo bottles we use to prevent further outbreaks. Also, I used one drop on a pimple before bed next morning it was almost gone! Did that for two nights by morning three gone</li>
            <li> I bought this product for many members of my family ,including myself. I work in the school system and am constantly fearful of getting lice. I was told by a co-worker, that if you put tea tree oil in your shampoo, you won&#x27;t get lice. I;m gonna do this for me and my granddaughter&#x27;s. Can you imagine the savings not having to buy all of those chemicals to kill lice and the embarrassment. I also have a couple of family members who still get occassional acne,and the anti bacterial properties help with acne without drying your skin out. This would be perfect for preteens and teens. My husband also has skin problem and this product will be perfect for him also. The size of this bottle of Tea Tree Oil is huge and they offer a money back guarantee if you are not completely satisfied. give this product a try, What do you have to lose except acne, dry skin, dry scalp,and lice. I bought  this product at a free or discounted price and this is my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This Tea Tree Oil is stellar, especially because it comes in a huge 4OZ bottle!&lt;br /&gt;The product ships with a glass dripper which is almost essential for using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally add tea tree oil to almost everything, as its anti-bacterial properties can really help with skin issues, and the cooling sensation it brings is always pleasantly welcomed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try adding a few droppers full into your favorite shampoo and conditioner, or your favorite face wash. I look at tea tree oil as almost being a panacea or cure all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy from this seller, as this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen for this large of a bottle of tea tree oil, ever!&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product for my unbiassed and thorough review!</li>
            <li> Came in broken with a broken cap. Leaked way too much and dropper was broken as well. Plus it&#x27;s not ORGANIC! Beware.</li>
            <li> I love this tea tree oil! I used it on my scalp mixed with olive oil and my dandruff is now gone! It only took 4 shampoos! I also plan to use this oil as mosquito repellent!</li>
            <li> Works great! This particular brand does seem to be a little stronger than others I have tries but it still does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil a lot. This one smelled like dirt or something rotten. I returned it. It was the worst tea tree oil I ever used.</li>
            <li> Compared to other tea tree oils I have bought from different brands in the past, the scent of this one is off. Rather than smelling medicinal and fresh, it smells musty. Since I use tea tree oil up close on my skin, I can&#x27;t get past the smell. Would not buy. Would not recommend.</li>
