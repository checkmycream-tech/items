            <li>lovely smell,will buy again,very good price,lasts long too,you will love buying this!</li>
            <li>So many rose-based floral perfumes smell antique-y and \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;, but Clinique Happy Heart is youthful and fresh!</li>
            <li>, that I think that there is a good possibility that it just might become my new go-to/signature fragrance!</li>
            <li>Makes my gift buying selection easy.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong...</li>
            <li>And it got to me in a good decent timly manner.</li>
            <li>and it is strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh , and exotic smell.</li>
            <li>She loves the simple lightly floral very clean not over baring scent of clinque happy hearts.</li>
            <li>and I feel it is perfect for a young adult.</li>
            <li>This is genuine Clinique Happy Heart, smells just like my last bottle that I bought from Clinique, scent lasts all day!</li>
            <li>This is the second purchase of Happy Heart.  </li>
            <li>This perfume smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only perfume I wear anymore, and it&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
            <li>I hope it will always be available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is a light floral scent.</li>
            <li>it smells fabulous, and so femine.  </li>
            <li>it stays, its not too strong, and its just right! &lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it smells so pretty.</li>
            <li>THEY WERE VERY POLITE&amp;HELPFUL! :)</li>
            <li>Will last for many hours, it is nice for every season, but it makes you think of summer days.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and never overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the  clean fresh  flower smell of this perfume</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend likes the smell but cant spray it close to her face, it is to strong, she sprays it on her legs or it is over powering, just plain Happy</li>
            <li>A fresh and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>As far as scents go, I know that association is the most important part.</li>
            <li>It is a super price and savings compared to department store prices.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipment and quality product.</li>
            <li>On of my ultimate favorite fragances, I love the sweet and fresh scent, I&#x27;d recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone.</li>
            <li>This has no musk and a very crisp scent.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pretty scent.</li>
            <li>This is a sweet and fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been wearing Happy Heart for a few years now and always requests it for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite new scent and everyone is asking me about it.</li>
            <li>Great perfume but a little pricey.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a fan of pleasures and Light Blue), but it smells great all the same.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday</li>
            <li>Like any perfume, it&#x27;s worth trying on for yourself to see if it works with your chemistry</li>
            <li>Citrus - floral - soft and lovely.</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for years and this is a nice big bottle!!  </li>
            <li>I got lucky ;)</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and pretty.</li>
            <li>Very much one of those staples of her collection.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper here than at Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>and it looks and smells exactly like I remember.</li>
            <li>First of all, it won&#x27;t be delivered in 2 days which it does state, but if you&#x27;re used to ordering things through Prime</li>
            <li>My one and only favorite perfume smell</li>
            <li>After using \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot; by Clinique, and being somewhat disappointed that the fragrance quickly disappeared after it was applied, I decided to try \\&quot;HAPPY HEART\\&quot;, to see if it had more \\&quot;staying power\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier and quicker ordering fr here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a young, fresh, smell</li>
            <li>Trust me order this one it is the real deal I normaly</li>
            <li>Fast ship.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this stuff and it is very affordable.</li>
            <li>It really smells like freshly-cut flowers.</li>
            <li>it &#x27;smell un-sniffed&#x27; (instead of sight unseen!), and decided that I would use it, regardless of whether or not I truly liked the fragrance, since I can&#x27;t spend half of a c-note on something, and then just leave it sit untouched!  </li>
            <li>I get more compliments about this perfume than any other that I wear.  </li>
            <li>Same clean smell I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>However, I will admit I first got it when I was an high school, bought it a few more times when I was in college and decided after years of forgetting about it, repurchased a bottle.</li>
            <li>Lastly, when I got on amazon to check what was going on with this I realized that in parentheses on the full website the date of Nov 2, 2005 was underneath it.  </li>
            <li>I think that this is a fragrance that would appeal to ALL age groups; it&#x27;s light and soft, with just a hint of floral, and a subtle musky quality, which may be the reason that the fragrance endures longer than \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot;, since \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot; was more of a blend of floral and citrus.  </li>
            <li>At red robbin that same night I got many compliments.</li>
            <li>Affordable perfume, high quality scent that lingers all day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is my second whole bottle - I get lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li>So sealed does not  mean anything.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this perfume than other perfume!!!</li>
            <li>Price was much higher locally...</li>
            <li>Third, it smelled funny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little too old for this smell now, but I do still enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my 26year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;do not waste your money&lt;</li>
            <li>the night I surprised her with it</li>
            <li>I get frequent compliments on this parfum.</li>
            <li>but really you or I could buy the paper at a craft store and seal it the same.</li>
            <li>Its a little more bold than my taste usually go for</li>
            <li>But, in general, provides a fresh scent that is appropriate for casual and professional settings.</li>
            <li>but, lasts the whole day long.</li>
            <li>I should last me for a long time since I ordered the large bottle.</li>
            <li>After it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually like the fragrance of</li>
            <li>not Happy Heart is better in her opinion.</li>
            <li>it has not long lasting scense, it smells like alcohol, I have another one that I bought in clinique</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Arrived very securely packaged and free of damage.</li>

            <li> I love this perfume it has a mild scent and the price was better than others</li>
            <li> lovely smell,will buy again,very good price,lasts long too,you will love buying this!</li>
            <li> So many rose-based floral perfumes smell antique-y and \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;, but Clinique Happy Heart is youthful and fresh!</li>
            <li> , that I think that there is a good possibility that it just might become my new go-to/signature fragrance!</li>
            <li> Makes my gift buying selection easy.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong...</li>
            <li> And it got to me in a good decent timly manner.</li>
            <li> and it is strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh , and exotic smell.</li>
            <li> She loves the simple lightly floral very clean not over baring scent of clinque happy hearts.</li>
            <li> and I feel it is perfect for a young adult.</li>
            <li> This is genuine Clinique Happy Heart, smells just like my last bottle that I bought from Clinique, scent lasts all day!</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase of Happy Heart.  </li>
            <li> This perfume smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only perfume I wear anymore, and it&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
            <li> I hope it will always be available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is a light floral scent.</li>
            <li> it smells fabulous, and so femine.  </li>
            <li> it stays, its not too strong, and its just right! &lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it smells so pretty.</li>
            <li> THEY WERE VERY POLITE&amp;HELPFUL! :)</li>
            <li> Will last for many hours, it is nice for every season, but it makes you think of summer days.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and never overpowering.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the  clean fresh  flower smell of this perfume</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend likes the smell but cant spray it close to her face, it is to strong, she sprays it on her legs or it is over powering, just plain Happy</li>
            <li> A fresh and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> As far as scents go, I know that association is the most important part.</li>
            <li> It is a super price and savings compared to department store prices.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipment and quality product.</li>
            <li> On of my ultimate favorite fragances, I love the sweet and fresh scent, I&#x27;d recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone.</li>
            <li> This has no musk and a very crisp scent.</li>
            <li> It has a light, pretty scent.</li>
            <li> This is a sweet and fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been wearing Happy Heart for a few years now and always requests it for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite new scent and everyone is asking me about it.</li>
            <li> Great perfume but a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a fan of pleasures and Light Blue), but it smells great all the same.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday</li>
            <li> Like any perfume, it&#x27;s worth trying on for yourself to see if it works with your chemistry</li>
            <li> Citrus - floral - soft and lovely.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for years and this is a nice big bottle!!  </li>
            <li> I got lucky ;)</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and pretty.</li>
            <li> Very much one of those staples of her collection.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper here than at Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> and it looks and smells exactly like I remember.</li>
            <li> First of all, it won&#x27;t be delivered in 2 days which it does state, but if you&#x27;re used to ordering things through Prime</li>
            <li> My one and only favorite perfume smell</li>
            <li> After using \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot; by Clinique, and being somewhat disappointed that the fragrance quickly disappeared after it was applied, I decided to try \\&quot;HAPPY HEART\\&quot;, to see if it had more \\&quot;staying power\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier and quicker ordering fr here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a young, fresh, smell</li>
            <li> Trust me order this one it is the real deal I normaly</li>
            <li> Fast ship.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> It really smells like freshly-cut flowers.</li>
            <li> it &#x27;smell un-sniffed&#x27; (instead of sight unseen!), and decided that I would use it, regardless of whether or not I truly liked the fragrance, since I can&#x27;t spend half of a c-note on something, and then just leave it sit untouched!  </li>
            <li> I get more compliments about this perfume than any other that I wear.  </li>
            <li> Same clean smell I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> However, I will admit I first got it when I was an high school, bought it a few more times when I was in college and decided after years of forgetting about it, repurchased a bottle.</li>
            <li> Lastly, when I got on amazon to check what was going on with this I realized that in parentheses on the full website the date of Nov 2, 2005 was underneath it.  </li>
            <li> I think that this is a fragrance that would appeal to ALL age groups; it&#x27;s light and soft, with just a hint of floral, and a subtle musky quality, which may be the reason that the fragrance endures longer than \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot;, since \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot; was more of a blend of floral and citrus.  </li>
            <li> At red robbin that same night I got many compliments.</li>
            <li> Affordable perfume, high quality scent that lingers all day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my second whole bottle - I get lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li> So sealed does not  mean anything.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this perfume than other perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Price was much higher locally...</li>
            <li> Third, it smelled funny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little too old for this smell now, but I do still enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 26year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;do not waste your money&lt;</li>
            <li> the night I surprised her with it</li>
            <li> I get frequent compliments on this parfum.</li>
            <li> but really you or I could buy the paper at a craft store and seal it the same.</li>
            <li> Its a little more bold than my taste usually go for</li>
            <li> But, in general, provides a fresh scent that is appropriate for casual and professional settings.</li>
            <li> but, lasts the whole day long.</li>
            <li> I should last me for a long time since I ordered the large bottle.</li>
            <li> After it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually like the fragrance of</li>
            <li> not Happy Heart is better in her opinion.</li>
            <li> it has not long lasting scense, it smells like alcohol, I have another one that I bought in clinique</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Second, it arrived in a box from \\&quot;Amazon Returns\\&quot; center which I thought was a red flag.  </li>
            <li> I thought that my wife had this perfume before and ran out, but it turned out she didn&#x27;t she had just wanted it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> In 5 years of being a loyal Amazon customer I have only written one other negative review for something that was falsely advertised through another vendor and sold through amazon.  </li>
            <li> everything exactly as expected and on time</li>
            <li> sometimes you miss the green warning of \\&quot;extra processing\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a problem and thought maybe I was just imagining things because of the returns center labeling on the package.</li>
            <li> I did break out in a rash a few minutes later on my arms where I had applied it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn other scents, but never with this reaction.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with many perfumes that have a musk base.  </li>
            <li> I now use this as my everyday scent when I&#x27;m not really going any where.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less than at the department store or on Clinique online!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in both Amazon and Clinique</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is going on here</li>
            <li> My husband had just passed and it was hard for me to get out and shop for anyone.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, she loves it and</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent!</li>
            <li> SUM BAD RATINGZ</li>
            <li> SOO DONT ALWAYZ LISTEN 2 BAD REVIEWZ</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance, it smells so pretty. I get so many compliments. People always ask me what I am wearing and the scent stays in your clothes as well. I always purchase mine at harmons face values, the price is really good.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend likes the smell but cant spray it close to her face, it is to strong, she sprays it on her legs or it is over powering, just plain Happy not Happy Heart is better in her opinion.</li>
            <li> She loves the simple lightly floral very clean not over baring scent of clinque happy hearts. Very much one of those staples of her collection.</li>
            <li> Great perfume. Just what it is.</li>
            <li> We had to do some shopping to find a perfume that she liked and I wasn&#x27;t allergic to... this was it.  I have a problem with many perfumes that have a musk base.  This has no musk and a very crisp scent.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Sealed and great price- this is my go-to, daily perfume!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Yet another perfume that I like! Its a little more bold than my taste usually go for (I&#x27;m a fan of pleasures and Light Blue), but it smells great all the same. I would classify this as a middle-scent fragrance, with a floral theme. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> A fresh and clean fragrance. The scent lasts most of the day.  This is my second whole bottle - I get lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a birthday gift for my daughter in law - she loved it. It has a light, pretty scent.</li>
            <li> On of my ultimate favorite fragances, I love the sweet and fresh scent, I&#x27;d recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone.</li>
            <li> Same clean smell I was hoping for. 4/5 bc it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping. Big fan of smell and price.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on my lady.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter at Christmas.  She&#x27;s been wearing Happy Heart for a few years now and always requests it for special occasions.  It&#x27;s a very pleasant scent...she always receives compliments when she wears it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my preferred perfumes. It smells delicious, citric and flowery at the same time. Will last for many hours, it is nice for every season, but it makes you think of summer days.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> All I can say is it smells great; my wife&#x27;s favorite, and she gets plenty of compliments on it.  Makes my gift buying selection easy.  Like any perfume, it&#x27;s worth trying on for yourself to see if it works with your chemistry and if it&#x27;s what you want in a perfume.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this perfume &amp; the Happy fragrance too. Now I&#x27;m going to have to buy a bottle of it too. Much cheaper here than at Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes me feel pretty!</li>
            <li> I have never bought this perfume but I wanted something different than what I had. I love it! It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh , and exotic smell. I&#x27;ve gotten two compliments just in passing . I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Price was much higher locally...gotta love Amazon :) Happy Heart By Clinique is my wife&#x27;s favorite and mine as well.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she loved it.  My husband had just passed and it was hard for me to get out and shop for anyone.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite. Citrus - floral - soft and lovely. This perfume, used daily, can last me over 3 months. Love. Affordable perfume, high quality scent that lingers all day. Basically, it makes my heart happy.  !</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; soothing smell. Very pleased. Happy to find an alternative to mall stores. Wanted a larger bottle &amp; this was perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived in good condition and much better than I had imagined to make the purchase, recommend the product</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. However, I will admit I first got it when I was an high school, bought it a few more times when I was in college and decided after years of forgetting about it, repurchased a bottle. I&#x27;m a little too old for this smell now, but I do still enjoy it. I now use this as my everyday scent when I&#x27;m not really going any where. It&#x27;s a young, fresh, smell and I feel it is perfect for a young adult.</li>
            <li> not the same smell  been wearing it 10 plus years&lt;br /&gt;AWFUL&lt;br /&gt;do not waste your money&lt;br /&gt;should tell you that there is a&lt;br /&gt;NO RETURN POLICY</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. Its too floral for my taste. I wish I would have smelled it in the store before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells clean and never overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. It is not overpowering and I get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Ooh this smells soooo good.  I love it, my husband loves it and it lingers.  It smells better as the day goes on.  I was a huge fan of DKNY be delicious but I think this one is even better.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume but have not been able to find it in stores anywhere! Now that I&#x27;ve started wearing it again I get compliments from everyone that walks by me how great I smell! :)</li>
            <li> Came as described and made the perfect gift. Arrived on time too.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! This is genuine Clinique Happy Heart, smells just like my last bottle that I bought from Clinique, scent lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it has a mild scent and the price was better than others</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume for my wife. I bought this for her and it looks and smells exactly like I remember.</li>
            <li> Beware before buying this.  My husband ordered this for me through Amazon Prime for Valentine&#x27;s because he was out of town.  First of all, it won&#x27;t be delivered in 2 days which it does state, but if you&#x27;re used to ordering things through Prime sometimes you miss the green warning of \\&quot;extra processing\\&quot;.  Second, it arrived in a box from \\&quot;Amazon Returns\\&quot; center which I thought was a red flag.  Third, it smelled funny and I only say this because I only use Clinique perfume and I know what it should smell like.  I have never had a problem and thought maybe I was just imagining things because of the returns center labeling on the package. I did break out in a rash a few minutes later on my arms where I had applied it.  That has never happened to me with any perfume before.  Lastly, when I got on amazon to check what was going on with this I realized that in parentheses on the full website the date of Nov 2, 2005 was underneath it.  Packaging date perhaps?  It does not have this date on the mobile site.  In 5 years of being a loyal Amazon customer I have only written one other negative review for something that was falsely advertised through another vendor and sold through amazon.  However, I truly feel this product is not what people believe they are purchasing.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in both Amazon and Clinique which is who the product was sold by.  I&#x27;m not sure what is going on here but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will be fighting for a return and no longer purchasing perfume through amazon.</li>
            <li> it has not long lasting scense, it smells like alcohol, I have another one that I bought in clinique and it is strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicious. It arrived in the time indicated. The price is very good.</li>
            <li> As far as scents go, I know that association is the most important part. Probably like it because I have a good memory attached to it. But, in general, provides a fresh scent that is appropriate for casual and professional settings.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes for women. I get alot of compliments with this scent.</li>
            <li> I thought that my wife had this perfume before and ran out, but it turned out she didn&#x27;t she had just wanted it for a long time.  Needless to say, she loves it and the night I surprised her with it I got lucky ;)</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go, people say they love my perfume and even know I&#x27;ve arrived by smelling it pleasantly in the air. I&#x27;ve worn other scents, but never with this reaction.</li>
            <li> All time favorite fragrance. It&#x27;s my signature. I&#x27;m always complemented on it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume...many compliments!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells absolutely fantastic. It&#x27;s the only perfume I wear anymore, and it&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
            <li> i read people review it made me upset to think i was getting BS.But when it came i open the box and sprayed it on me.Trust me order this one it is the real deal I normaly paid 100 for it at the mall.This one is Happy Heart by Clinique !i will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved the price and received it on time.</li>
            <li> lovely smell,will buy again,very good price,lasts long too,you will love buying this!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance!  Nice and light and goes with any kind of body lotion that you use....I would purchase it again in a second and it&#x27;s less than at the department store or on Clinique online!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my daughter for Christmas. I am sure she like&#x27;s it because that is what she ask for.</li>
            <li> After using \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot; by Clinique, and being somewhat disappointed that the fragrance quickly disappeared after it was applied, I decided to try \\&quot;HAPPY HEART\\&quot;, to see if it had more \\&quot;staying power\\&quot;.  So I purchased it &#x27;smell un-sniffed&#x27; (instead of sight unseen!), and decided that I would use it, regardless of whether or not I truly liked the fragrance, since I can&#x27;t spend half of a c-note on something, and then just leave it sit untouched!  After it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually like the fragrance of \\&quot;HAPPY HEART\\&quot; MORE than \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot;, and \\&quot;HAPPY HEART\\&quot; DOES have more \\&quot;staying power\\&quot;, as well!  I think that this is a fragrance that would appeal to ALL age groups; it&#x27;s light and soft, with just a hint of floral, and a subtle musky quality, which may be the reason that the fragrance endures longer than \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot;, since \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot; was more of a blend of floral and citrus.  I am so delighted with \\&quot;HAPPY HEART\\&quot;, that I think that there is a good possibility that it just might become my new go-to/signature fragrance!</li>
            <li> I get more compliments about this perfume than any other that I wear.  It is a super price and savings compared to department store prices.  I hope it will always be available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good price and shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal-package came quickly and it made my whole Christmas to get this</li>
            <li> I love Clinique&#x27;s Happy Heart! It is a light floral scent. I get frequent compliments on this parfum. They always ask what the brand is and where it can be purchased. I&#x27;m happy to tell them the best place to go (Amazon.com!!).</li>
            <li> Great smell...great Mother&#x27;s Day gift!  Received it in great time.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This fragrance works so well for me. It is light and summery, which is a good smell for this Florida gal! People always say I smell so good.</li>
            <li> I have brought this before and I enjoy the  clean fresh  flower smell of this perfume</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance....it&#x27;s my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34;....it smells fabulous, and so femine.  I receive lots of compliments, and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Fast ship. Great product</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and quality product.</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to Clinique especially this perfume. This came in a sealed package like at the department store but really you or I could buy the paper at a craft store and seal it the same. So sealed does not  mean anything. It smells great at first then wears off in 2 hours. It&#x27;s like you put on diluted water for $55! Clinique happy heart lasts 6 hours minimum and I always get compliments about the smell. Not one compliment since I&#x27;ve been using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this purfume. Great for everyday</li>

            <li> So many rose-based floral perfumes smell antique-y and \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;, but Clinique Happy Heart is youthful and fresh! It really smells like freshly-cut flowers. It is my favorite new scent and everyone is asking me about it. I love this scent!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and came in perfect packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a sweet and fresh fragrance.  I should last me for a long time since I ordered the large bottle.</li>
