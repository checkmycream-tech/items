            <li>My co-workers started saying things like, &amp;#34;you look so happy and bright today.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I waited 7 minutes and saw the wonderful tightening effect--actually more than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very fair, so I imagine the residue might show up more on darker complexions.</li>
            <li>The good news is</li>
            <li>I thought this was a good product and would buy again.</li>
            <li>This product is good for temporarily tightening your skin so that wrinkles do not show.  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for someone that doesn&#x27;t need or use make up</li>
            <li>and my daughter commented on how good I look.  </li>
            <li>You will look  good  when you have it on</li>
            <li>and I looked good all day</li>
            <li>this helps others get a good result.  </li>
            <li>Good 4-6 hour tightening.</li>
            <li>These applications were with a good quality foundation brush.  </li>
            <li>I put a good amount from the tube of Loreal and used the sponge to spread it out</li>
            <li>received quickly and LOVE this product...!!!</li>
            <li>Very glad I saw this on Today</li>
            <li>My dictor even adked if I had a chemical peel because my skin looked great and smooth!</li>
            <li>Not quite as effective but still good.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>I have this in the Eye Firmx and love it, works amazingly well!</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it once you&#x27;ve tried it!  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this to try and fell in love!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product and the polish it gives to the skin!</li>
            <li>FirmX is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing products.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I would say this was effective in giving my neck area a smoother appearance.</li>
            <li>My wife used and liked.</li>
            <li>It is perfect and real.</li>
            <li>I liked the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased a product that achieved this kind of results.  </li>
            <li>Plumps up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice when applied.</li>
            <li>The product now goes on beautifully, dries quickly and does what it says it should.}  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and amazing product!!</li>
            <li>And I am talking about a smooth face for a good twelve hours.</li>
            <li>I use it for special occasions and people always comment on how good I look - guess it must be working  :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Foundation and eye concealer don&#x27;t smooth out with this under it, they kind of caked.</li>
            <li>I also thought I would try it on my neck, just to see if it does anything, it seems to make my neck appear more wrinkled.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>love it.......</li>
            <li>used mineral powder on top of it....</li>
            <li>yes, I LOVE.  </li>
            <li>You will then also LOVE this</li>
            <li>This will last quite a while very happy with it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product and use it twice a day; no practice, just dab it on.  </li>
            <li>But if you put makeup on top then the effect ends</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But the principal effect, the real propose is great.</li>
            <li>This is a much better</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I need more 10 years on my face to like this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>the fact you can&#x27;t wear make up on top of it is not helpful.</li>
            <li>For this price there are many options.</li>
            <li>I then use a mineral-type makeup over the top.</li>
            <li>So I apply, and then you a darker mineral makeup over the top.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it lasts a while.</li>
            <li>show and more amazed that it wasn&#x27;t over- stated.</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT IS OKAY.  </li>
            <li>and maybe I will discover the magic method...</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake it well.</li>
            <li>you will be amazed at the outstanding results you will get.  </li>
            <li>Lovely this is</li>
            <li>Was expecting much more out of this product.</li>
            <li>Could not find a routine that I could count on to be able to do, without the possibility that I would have to undo it, and then do my make up in a shortened amount of time .</li>
            <li>Once I learned how to use this product, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>This gives me the best result without any white residue.  </li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>The rest of the face I tapped on a bit more liberally.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that depends on skin coloring.  </li>
            <li>This may work great for some, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad  I bought this</li>
            <li>THIS IS PRETTY GOOD STUFF .JUST BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair skinned though.  </li>
            <li>Most pleased with the quick way it diminshed under eye bags - for hours!</li>
            <li>but honestly I havent really seen anything spectacular.  </li>
            <li>When washed off gently you do look somewhat better but not as good as when product was on and drying.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing and worth the money.</li>
            <li>LOL I guess I just don&#x27;t look all that old because I noticed no difference in my face, and just a bit of effect to my neck.</li>
            <li>This product is the next best thing to getting a face full of Botox injections, and I have had that done when I could afford it.</li>
            <li>I have used this many times and it works well to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found that it works best on clean dry skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll try mixing my foundation in with it as one person suggested however I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this at the department store.</li>
            <li>THEN APPLY WHAT MAKES YOU BEAUTIFUL FOR YOUR PUBLIC!  </li>
            <li>I now love this product and just ordered the full size.</li>
            <li>Occassionally, I will add make-up, but normally just some concealer and dusting of powder is good.</li>
            <li>I think most of us want a quick fix and an easy fix.</li>
            <li>lines over lip, frown lines and fine line wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Roth&#x27;s Instant FirmX is a wonderful product; it firms and tightens exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Instead of water I use a light moisturizer on the excess edges.  </li>
            <li>(important)</li>
            <li>look great and even though it says it only works for a day, it seems to keep firming the wrinkles for a while afterwards.  </li>
            <li>However, just an light application will make your skin look lighter.</li>
            <li>I never thought I could smooth those lines out.  </li>
            <li>the wrinkles are now smooth and this lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>At 73 years old I do have &#x27;good&#x27; skin anyway...</li>
            <li>I also use Roth&#x27;s Laser-Free Regenerator Moisturizing Gel Cream at night, also in the morning on clean skin, then a light film of FirmX, under my makeup.</li>
            <li>If this is your first time using, it may take a little while to figure out the best way for you to apply it, I would recommend everyone watching the youtube video&#x27;s on various application techniques to really get the best results from this.</li>
            <li>It does take years off, it doesn&#x27;t last all day but it is amazing!  </li>
            <li>YES  - THIS WOKS - DON&#x27;T FORGET AFTER APPLICATION - TAP LIGHTLY WITH COOL WATER -</li>
            <li>So excited about the product when I received it.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>Skin tightens significantly.  </li>
            <li>I Love this stuff, it really works!</li>
            <li>I might add that I use a very light touch of bronzer on nose, chin, forehead and cheeks to add more natural color.  </li>
            <li>The effect is temporary, but it is a nice lift that makes you appear more refreshed, especially around the eyes and on the forehead.</li>
            <li>It works absolute wonders for the fine lines and crows feet around the eyes!  </li>
            <li>Also VERY important to keep that area very still for about 5 mins after applying.</li>
            <li>I have been lucky enough to pretty much try the \\&quot;best of the best\\&quot; for anti ageing skincare.  </li>
            <li>Peter Thomas Roth has a good following and his products are pricey</li>
            <li>Ordering the full size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff only looks good if you want your skin to be gray-colored.</li>
            <li>this is good but do not wear base,foundation,or powders because it will turn white</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t really focused on the pore tightening/smoothing aspect &amp; that&#x27; what&#x27;s really pleased me.</li>
            <li>Please PTR, don&#x27;t ever change a single thing about this amazing product!</li>
            <li>I seriously hope they never stop making this - it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li>I look much younger and feel more confident.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this regularly, but will try to use more product for even greater improvement.</li>
            <li>I use it immediately after washing my face in the a.m., followed by a light moisturizer and the effect becomes more natural for about 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Overall I am quite pleased with the results - works better than Oil of Olay and Loreal collagen wrinkle filler.</li>
            <li>The price is decent and if you want an ok fixer</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend</li>
            <li>Because it may leave a residue you have to experiment with it, you might not be able to walk right out the door as your face may need to be dabbed gently in order to remove any residue.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample from theskinstore.com and the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>For very mature skin, you need much more than this can provide.</li>
            <li>This facial cream is very good for firming the skin for a brief time period.  </li>
            <li>One important  thing to remember is don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>but once you smile or add moisturizers, the effects go away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about a 3 star - not as good as I expected</li>
            <li>A thin coat works best and afterwards you should keep your expression motionless for about 7 to 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Good product true to claim , easy to apply take a good five to ten years off if applied thin no need to remove</li>
            <li>All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li>I have used this product and it practically erases lines right before your eyes.</li>
            <li>Using under my eyes will have to wait until I can figure out how to make it work right with makeup.</li>
            <li>Had to play around with it to get the right amount</li>
            <li>(went right to Amazon to buy it).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I applied it one time and got it right.  </li>
            <li>and I bought it right away.  </li>
            <li>I would always find something that wasn&#x27;t quite right.  </li>
            <li>Gone are the large pores and acne scars also!</li>
            <li>Thought to try this for same purpose and found it works great and actually is a bit milder.</li>
            <li>is a very reasonably price brush.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, your skin will feel too tight and more doesn&#x27;t meen better -- if after applying everywhere</li>
            <li>It kind of looked like salt stains on clothing when you get them wet in the snow in places.</li>
            <li>I actually feel so much more confident about my appearance when I am wearing Instant FirmX,</li>
            <li>I put my foundation on first (mineral, not liquid) , use the size of a medium pea and split it between two fingers.  </li>
            <li>This product really really works!</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Unlike the eye cream, you can use this more liberally (you need only a dot under each eye with Eye FirmX).</li>
            <li>This works really well!</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>This definitely needs to go ON TOP of your makeup.</li>
            <li>I read and heard about this product and thought it would do alot better job than it actually does.</li>
            <li>This should last  most folks almost a year</li>
            <li>Love the instant wrinkle removal.</li>
            <li>I love this and definitely recommend to anyone who is concerned about aging.</li>
            <li>I tried it by itself and then adding foundation after or foundation first and Firmx after.  </li>
            <li>First I applied to forehead 11 lines, then under each eye.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really worked right.  </li>
            <li>you feel you need a touch-up, just apply a very slight amount -- you will be good to go.</li>
            <li>I also use it along my laugh lines and over my upper lip where there are fine lines.  </li>
            <li>The product really does not last for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li>It is the first product that my husband and I have used that really decreases bags under our eyes.</li>
            <li>and it pretty much lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It does not last quite as long as advertised, but otherwise does a good job.</li>
            <li>but I find that as soon as I put moisturizer or makeup on over top of this product it does loose some of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I did wet it VERY lightly</li>
            <li>Then I tapped it over the area where the Firmx is very lightly and carefully.  </li>
            <li>I thought that only surgery would decrease the huge bags under my eyes that medications, genetics, and age have created.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to do the neck and face....</li>
            <li>You have to experiment to determine how much to use for your skin.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>Did really nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Product works - but is VERY detectable.</li>
            <li>this product works very well; it does tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li>Very flakey.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the under eye one  </li>
            <li>I work 5-6 hours shifts and this lasts the whole time.</li>
            <li>This stuff has to be used very sparingly or you will look like the Queen of Botox  (or KIng).  </li>
            <li>I always shake it very well which I think helps.  </li>
            <li>and it would either be to much or just not fix..</li>
            <li>This product absolutely works.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it does what it claims, which is, it tightens temporarily.  </li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>You have to shake it really,</li>
            <li>It seems very hit or miss.</li>
            <li>For me--it&#x27;s the whole day until I wash it off--</li>
            <li>Instantly I could see a huge difference, it really does give your face a firmer and vibrant look.</li>
            <li>The cream is very good and works as promissed although not very good when combined with other creams.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m only using it between my eyebrows for the \\&quot;ll\\&quot; wrinkles and large pores, but have to use a lot of moisturizer to make the while film stay at bay.</li>
            <li>This is not a lasting wrinkle or line reducer but is good for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this product, but it did not work as I hoped.</li>
            <li>Short of a face lift, there are only two products out there that I have tried and can say the results were significant, and those were Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder and Algenist , and as of this writing, Algenist is first place in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many high-priced products which make little difference.  </li>
            <li>and I keep my new one in a plastic bag to keep it as fresh as possible.  </li>
            <li>Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firmx is really easy to use and, shortly after you apply it, the lines in your face are gone.  </li>
            <li>This product instantly tightens your skin and makes fine (and some deep) lines soften and even disappear.</li>
            <li>I like to follow-up with a very careful application of a light moisturizer after it has set in -- after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>This particular product claims to give us a wash off when done young looking skin</li>
            <li>If you use too much you&#x27;ll end up looking like you got hit in the face with a chalkboard eraser, as applying too much will create a white film residue.  </li>
            <li>It leaves too much of the white residue, I felt like it did not do much in reducing the wrinkles</li>
            <li>also was dismayed by the white film at first, but discovered that if you don&#x27;t use too much and really massage it in, the white film doesn&#x27;t occur.</li>
            <li>and I finally smoothed the cake-iness away and the white blended better however 20 minutes later</li>
            <li>One tube lasts for a long time and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The issue with the residue after it dries can easily be Smoothed in with moisturizer or a little toner on a pad.</li>
            <li>I found the new Loreal Visible Lift Blur foundation in Creamy Natural works well with the ingredients in Firmx.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing what just a little bit does and how long it lasts!  </li>
            <li>At first it had appeared my skin was much smoother and all the lines in my forehead seemed to actually disappear however, 20 minutes later, all the lines are there.</li>
            <li>The trick is to shake the tube and apply a teeny tiny bit, with this less is more.</li>
            <li>In fact I now buy the large economy size just so I would never run out and keep the smaller size in my travel purse in my car in case I stay overnight somewhere</li>
            <li>you first use it, it&#x27;ll take a little practice but first remember to SHAKE IT UP..</li>
            <li>but I put a  little moisturizer on top of it which also takes care of the white film it leaves sometimes.  </li>
            <li>Hard to keep your face frozen for the three or more minutes &amp; when applying makeup over it it flaked off.</li>
            <li>While this product is purely cosmetic, it really does make a drastic visual difference when applied properly.  </li>
            <li>This works very well, but be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>So far I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>my daughter, 40 yrs old loves it and of course she has not one wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>Firms face completely.  </li>
            <li>My skins looks refreshed and young.</li>
            <li>look but within minutes of using this stuff, I could see and feel a considerable difference.  </li>
            <li>Put it all over my 47-yr old forehead and sat for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>really well otherwise it may leave a white residue (which can be dabbed off with a Q-tip or tissue and water).  </li>
            <li>My fiance even noticed and I got a \\&quot;Wow.....</li>
            <li>If the product becomes white on your face, you have used too much.</li>
            <li>This gel has caused my usually sensitive skin no problems.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re also more likely to get the residue if you slather the stuff on too heavily.</li>
            <li>It does leave a small residue but that is easily remedied; makeup covers it up well.</li>
            <li>I use Roth&#x27;s Instant Firmx on special occasions, when I&#x27;m going out for the evening and have been told I look about ten years younger.</li>
            <li>This really works but instead of using my fingers I use a flat brush #10 Filbert from Art supplies in any craft store.</li>
            <li>tightens and smooths out the small fine</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not shaking it up enough but it leaves kind of a white powdery residue on my face that I&#x27;m not real happy with.</li>
            <li>but it is very drying for gentle skin under eyes and my skin got so dry in 3 days that I had to use extra lotions and creams to return all back to normal .</li>
            <li>Several hours later there was some light white residue but easily brushed off.</li>
            <li>But all in all it does what it says and lasts for a few hours for those special occasions.</li>
            <li>You must be careful not to apply too much, also to blend it so that you don&#x27;t end up with flaking or caking, but overall, it really is miraculous.</li>
            <li>and while it didn&#x27;t clear them completely (they are very deep)</li>
            <li>It really works; smooths out even your deep forehead wrinkles for an entire day!  </li>
            <li>I ordered the full size and plan on spritzing my face or thinning the cream down with a drop or two of water to see if I can make it last while still seeing the results.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only temporary, how long it lasts really depends on how oily your skin gets as people with oily skin will notice the tightening effect start diminishing after about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Need to tap in completely because it dries to a white color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update....  product worked very well but left me red in the applied areas on the 3rd day.  </li>
            <li>It does what it says as far as pulling skin taut, and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it leaving a white residue.</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any problems with applying this product and I totally LOVE the results.</li>
            <li>This was on QVC and theirs was half as much for twice the price!</li>
            <li>or it will completely crystallize and sense it has no long term effects just short</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 2 years and absolutely would not go without it or buy any other.  </li>
            <li>The dry white residue does have to be damp patted off  unless 1 wants to go around with white flakes all over the face.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and it definitely makes me look younger</li>
            <li>(I use Bare Minerals Bareskin) with a dime size portion of Instant Firmx.  </li>
            <li>Put the product on, allow to dry and then gently moisten face and pat dry to remove any white residue.</li>
            <li>In the morning after my shower I put it on lightly and lay down for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>The results do not warrant such a time-consuming regimen, and I think you need to put this on pretty heavy if you want an overall lift for an aging face.</li>
            <li>Just mix a little Firm X with your moisture, let it dry, and in five minutes most of your lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin is temporarily history.</li>
            <li>But it leaves a residue no matter how much or how little I apply.</li>
            <li>I use it as a mask, and my skin looks tight and smooth, but this only lasts for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I think it actually does provide a little lift, but because you have to take so much time to get the white residue off, it is a deal breaker for me.</li>

            <li> I waited 7 minutes and saw the wonderful tightening effect--actually more than I wanted.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very fair, so I imagine the residue might show up more on darker complexions.</li>
            <li> The good news is</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good product and would buy again.</li>

            <li> Maybe good for someone that doesn&#x27;t need or use make up</li>
            <li> and my daughter commented on how good I look.  </li>
            <li> You will look  good  when you have it on</li>
            <li> and I looked good all day</li>
            <li> this helps others get a good result.  </li>
            <li> Good 4-6 hour tightening.</li>
            <li> These applications were with a good quality foundation brush.  </li>
            <li> I put a good amount from the tube of Loreal and used the sponge to spread it out</li>

            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I would say this was effective in giving my neck area a smoother appearance.</li>

            <li> It is perfect and real.</li>
            <li> I liked the product.</li>

            <li> Plumps up nicely.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice when applied.</li>
            <li> The product now goes on beautifully, dries quickly and does what it says it should.}  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and amazing product!!</li>
            <li> And I am talking about a smooth face for a good twelve hours.</li>
            <li> I use it for special occasions and people always comment on how good I look - guess it must be working  :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Foundation and eye concealer don&#x27;t smooth out with this under it, they kind of caked.</li>
            <li> I also thought I would try it on my neck, just to see if it does anything, it seems to make my neck appear more wrinkled.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> love it.......</li>
            <li> used mineral powder on top of it....</li>
            <li> yes, I LOVE.  </li>
            <li> You will then also LOVE this</li>
            <li> This will last quite a while very happy with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and use it twice a day; no practice, just dab it on.  </li>
            <li> But if you put makeup on top then the effect ends</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But the principal effect, the real propose is great.</li>
            <li> This is a much better</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I need more 10 years on my face to like this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> the fact you can&#x27;t wear make up on top of it is not helpful.</li>
            <li> For this price there are many options.</li>
            <li> I then use a mineral-type makeup over the top.</li>
            <li> So I apply, and then you a darker mineral makeup over the top.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> show and more amazed that it wasn&#x27;t over- stated.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS OKAY.  </li>
            <li> and maybe I will discover the magic method...</li>
            <li> Make sure you shake it well.</li>
            <li> you will be amazed at the outstanding results you will get.  </li>
            <li> Lovely this is</li>
            <li> Was expecting much more out of this product.</li>
            <li> Could not find a routine that I could count on to be able to do, without the possibility that I would have to undo it, and then do my make up in a shortened amount of time .</li>
            <li> Once I learned how to use this product, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> This gives me the best result without any white residue.  </li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> The rest of the face I tapped on a bit more liberally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that depends on skin coloring.  </li>
            <li> This may work great for some, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad  I bought this</li>
            <li> THIS IS PRETTY GOOD STUFF .JUST BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li> I am pretty fair skinned though.  </li>
            <li> Most pleased with the quick way it diminshed under eye bags - for hours!</li>
            <li> but honestly I havent really seen anything spectacular.  </li>
            <li> When washed off gently you do look somewhat better but not as good as when product was on and drying.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing and worth the money.</li>
            <li> LOL I guess I just don&#x27;t look all that old because I noticed no difference in my face, and just a bit of effect to my neck.</li>
            <li> This product is the next best thing to getting a face full of Botox injections, and I have had that done when I could afford it.</li>
            <li> I have used this many times and it works well to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found that it works best on clean dry skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll try mixing my foundation in with it as one person suggested however I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this at the department store.</li>
            <li> THEN APPLY WHAT MAKES YOU BEAUTIFUL FOR YOUR PUBLIC!  </li>
            <li> I now love this product and just ordered the full size.</li>
            <li> Occassionally, I will add make-up, but normally just some concealer and dusting of powder is good.</li>
            <li> I think most of us want a quick fix and an easy fix.</li>
            <li> lines over lip, frown lines and fine line wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Roth&#x27;s Instant FirmX is a wonderful product; it firms and tightens exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Instead of water I use a light moisturizer on the excess edges.  </li>
            <li> (important)</li>
            <li> look great and even though it says it only works for a day, it seems to keep firming the wrinkles for a while afterwards.  </li>
            <li> However, just an light application will make your skin look lighter.</li>
            <li> I never thought I could smooth those lines out.  </li>
            <li> the wrinkles are now smooth and this lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> At 73 years old I do have &#x27;good&#x27; skin anyway...</li>
            <li> I also use Roth&#x27;s Laser-Free Regenerator Moisturizing Gel Cream at night, also in the morning on clean skin, then a light film of FirmX, under my makeup.</li>
            <li> If this is your first time using, it may take a little while to figure out the best way for you to apply it, I would recommend everyone watching the youtube video&#x27;s on various application techniques to really get the best results from this.</li>
            <li> It does take years off, it doesn&#x27;t last all day but it is amazing!  </li>
            <li> YES  - THIS WOKS - DON&#x27;T FORGET AFTER APPLICATION - TAP LIGHTLY WITH COOL WATER -</li>
            <li> So excited about the product when I received it.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> Skin tightens significantly.  </li>
            <li> I Love this stuff, it really works!</li>
            <li> I might add that I use a very light touch of bronzer on nose, chin, forehead and cheeks to add more natural color.  </li>
            <li> The effect is temporary, but it is a nice lift that makes you appear more refreshed, especially around the eyes and on the forehead.</li>
            <li> It works absolute wonders for the fine lines and crows feet around the eyes!  </li>
            <li> Also VERY important to keep that area very still for about 5 mins after applying.</li>
            <li> I have been lucky enough to pretty much try the \\&quot;best of the best\\&quot; for anti ageing skincare.  </li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth has a good following and his products are pricey</li>
            <li> Ordering the full size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff only looks good if you want your skin to be gray-colored.</li>
            <li> this is good but do not wear base,foundation,or powders because it will turn white</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t really focused on the pore tightening/smoothing aspect &amp; that&#x27; what&#x27;s really pleased me.</li>
            <li> Please PTR, don&#x27;t ever change a single thing about this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I seriously hope they never stop making this - it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li> I look much younger and feel more confident.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this regularly, but will try to use more product for even greater improvement.</li>
            <li> I use it immediately after washing my face in the a.m., followed by a light moisturizer and the effect becomes more natural for about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Overall I am quite pleased with the results - works better than Oil of Olay and Loreal collagen wrinkle filler.</li>
            <li> The price is decent and if you want an ok fixer</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend</li>
            <li> Because it may leave a residue you have to experiment with it, you might not be able to walk right out the door as your face may need to be dabbed gently in order to remove any residue.  </li>
            <li> I got a free sample from theskinstore.com and the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> For very mature skin, you need much more than this can provide.</li>
            <li> This facial cream is very good for firming the skin for a brief time period.  </li>
            <li> One important  thing to remember is don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li> but once you smile or add moisturizers, the effects go away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about a 3 star - not as good as I expected</li>
            <li> A thin coat works best and afterwards you should keep your expression motionless for about 7 to 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Good product true to claim , easy to apply take a good five to ten years off if applied thin no need to remove</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it practically erases lines right before your eyes.</li>
            <li> Using under my eyes will have to wait until I can figure out how to make it work right with makeup.</li>
            <li> Had to play around with it to get the right amount</li>
            <li> (went right to Amazon to buy it).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I applied it one time and got it right.  </li>
            <li> and I bought it right away.  </li>
            <li> I would always find something that wasn&#x27;t quite right.  </li>
            <li> Gone are the large pores and acne scars also!</li>
            <li> Thought to try this for same purpose and found it works great and actually is a bit milder.</li>
            <li> is a very reasonably price brush.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, your skin will feel too tight and more doesn&#x27;t meen better -- if after applying everywhere</li>
            <li> It kind of looked like salt stains on clothing when you get them wet in the snow in places.</li>
            <li> I actually feel so much more confident about my appearance when I am wearing Instant FirmX,</li>
            <li> I put my foundation on first (mineral, not liquid) , use the size of a medium pea and split it between two fingers.  </li>
            <li> This product really really works!</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> Unlike the eye cream, you can use this more liberally (you need only a dot under each eye with Eye FirmX).</li>
            <li> This works really well!</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> This definitely needs to go ON TOP of your makeup.</li>
            <li> I read and heard about this product and thought it would do alot better job than it actually does.</li>
            <li> This should last  most folks almost a year</li>
            <li> Love the instant wrinkle removal.</li>
            <li> I love this and definitely recommend to anyone who is concerned about aging.</li>
            <li> I tried it by itself and then adding foundation after or foundation first and Firmx after.  </li>
            <li> First I applied to forehead 11 lines, then under each eye.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really worked right.  </li>
            <li> you feel you need a touch-up, just apply a very slight amount -- you will be good to go.</li>
            <li> I also use it along my laugh lines and over my upper lip where there are fine lines.  </li>
            <li> The product really does not last for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> It is the first product that my husband and I have used that really decreases bags under our eyes.</li>
            <li> and it pretty much lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It does not last quite as long as advertised, but otherwise does a good job.</li>
            <li> but I find that as soon as I put moisturizer or makeup on over top of this product it does loose some of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I did wet it VERY lightly</li>
            <li> Then I tapped it over the area where the Firmx is very lightly and carefully.  </li>
            <li> I thought that only surgery would decrease the huge bags under my eyes that medications, genetics, and age have created.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to do the neck and face....</li>
            <li> You have to experiment to determine how much to use for your skin.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> Did really nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Product works - but is VERY detectable.</li>
            <li> this product works very well; it does tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li> Very flakey.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the under eye one  </li>
            <li> I work 5-6 hours shifts and this lasts the whole time.</li>
            <li> This stuff has to be used very sparingly or you will look like the Queen of Botox  (or KIng).  </li>
            <li> I always shake it very well which I think helps.  </li>
            <li> and it would either be to much or just not fix..</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does what it claims, which is, it tightens temporarily.  </li>
            <li> It was so much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> You have to shake it really,</li>
            <li> It seems very hit or miss.</li>
            <li> For me--it&#x27;s the whole day until I wash it off--</li>
            <li> Instantly I could see a huge difference, it really does give your face a firmer and vibrant look.</li>
            <li> The cream is very good and works as promissed although not very good when combined with other creams.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m only using it between my eyebrows for the \\&quot;ll\\&quot; wrinkles and large pores, but have to use a lot of moisturizer to make the while film stay at bay.</li>
            <li> This is not a lasting wrinkle or line reducer but is good for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product, but it did not work as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Short of a face lift, there are only two products out there that I have tried and can say the results were significant, and those were Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder and Algenist , and as of this writing, Algenist is first place in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many high-priced products which make little difference.  </li>
            <li> and I keep my new one in a plastic bag to keep it as fresh as possible.  </li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firmx is really easy to use and, shortly after you apply it, the lines in your face are gone.  </li>
            <li> This product instantly tightens your skin and makes fine (and some deep) lines soften and even disappear.</li>
            <li> I like to follow-up with a very careful application of a light moisturizer after it has set in -- after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This particular product claims to give us a wash off when done young looking skin</li>
            <li> If you use too much you&#x27;ll end up looking like you got hit in the face with a chalkboard eraser, as applying too much will create a white film residue.  </li>
            <li> It leaves too much of the white residue, I felt like it did not do much in reducing the wrinkles</li>
            <li> also was dismayed by the white film at first, but discovered that if you don&#x27;t use too much and really massage it in, the white film doesn&#x27;t occur.</li>
            <li> and I finally smoothed the cake-iness away and the white blended better however 20 minutes later</li>
            <li> One tube lasts for a long time and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The issue with the residue after it dries can easily be Smoothed in with moisturizer or a little toner on a pad.</li>
            <li> I found the new Loreal Visible Lift Blur foundation in Creamy Natural works well with the ingredients in Firmx.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing what just a little bit does and how long it lasts!  </li>
            <li> At first it had appeared my skin was much smoother and all the lines in my forehead seemed to actually disappear however, 20 minutes later, all the lines are there.</li>
            <li> The trick is to shake the tube and apply a teeny tiny bit, with this less is more.</li>
            <li> In fact I now buy the large economy size just so I would never run out and keep the smaller size in my travel purse in my car in case I stay overnight somewhere</li>
            <li> you first use it, it&#x27;ll take a little practice but first remember to SHAKE IT UP..</li>
            <li> but I put a  little moisturizer on top of it which also takes care of the white film it leaves sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Hard to keep your face frozen for the three or more minutes &amp; when applying makeup over it it flaked off.</li>
            <li> While this product is purely cosmetic, it really does make a drastic visual difference when applied properly.  </li>
            <li> This works very well, but be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> my daughter, 40 yrs old loves it and of course she has not one wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> Firms face completely.  </li>
            <li> My skins looks refreshed and young.</li>
            <li> look but within minutes of using this stuff, I could see and feel a considerable difference.  </li>
            <li> Put it all over my 47-yr old forehead and sat for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> really well otherwise it may leave a white residue (which can be dabbed off with a Q-tip or tissue and water).  </li>
            <li> My fiance even noticed and I got a \\&quot;Wow.....</li>
            <li> If the product becomes white on your face, you have used too much.</li>
            <li> This gel has caused my usually sensitive skin no problems.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re also more likely to get the residue if you slather the stuff on too heavily.</li>
            <li> It does leave a small residue but that is easily remedied; makeup covers it up well.</li>
            <li> I use Roth&#x27;s Instant Firmx on special occasions, when I&#x27;m going out for the evening and have been told I look about ten years younger.</li>
            <li> This really works but instead of using my fingers I use a flat brush #10 Filbert from Art supplies in any craft store.</li>
            <li> tightens and smooths out the small fine</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not shaking it up enough but it leaves kind of a white powdery residue on my face that I&#x27;m not real happy with.</li>
            <li> but it is very drying for gentle skin under eyes and my skin got so dry in 3 days that I had to use extra lotions and creams to return all back to normal .</li>
            <li> Several hours later there was some light white residue but easily brushed off.</li>
            <li> But all in all it does what it says and lasts for a few hours for those special occasions.</li>
            <li> You must be careful not to apply too much, also to blend it so that you don&#x27;t end up with flaking or caking, but overall, it really is miraculous.</li>
            <li> and while it didn&#x27;t clear them completely (they are very deep)</li>
            <li> It really works; smooths out even your deep forehead wrinkles for an entire day!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the full size and plan on spritzing my face or thinning the cream down with a drop or two of water to see if I can make it last while still seeing the results.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only temporary, how long it lasts really depends on how oily your skin gets as people with oily skin will notice the tightening effect start diminishing after about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Need to tap in completely because it dries to a white color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update....  product worked very well but left me red in the applied areas on the 3rd day.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says as far as pulling skin taut, and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it leaving a white residue.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any problems with applying this product and I totally LOVE the results.</li>
            <li> This was on QVC and theirs was half as much for twice the price!</li>
            <li> or it will completely crystallize and sense it has no long term effects just short</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 2 years and absolutely would not go without it or buy any other.  </li>
            <li> The dry white residue does have to be damp patted off  unless 1 wants to go around with white flakes all over the face.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and it definitely makes me look younger</li>
            <li> (I use Bare Minerals Bareskin) with a dime size portion of Instant Firmx.  </li>
            <li> Put the product on, allow to dry and then gently moisten face and pat dry to remove any white residue.</li>
            <li> In the morning after my shower I put it on lightly and lay down for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The results do not warrant such a time-consuming regimen, and I think you need to put this on pretty heavy if you want an overall lift for an aging face.</li>
            <li> Just mix a little Firm X with your moisture, let it dry, and in five minutes most of your lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin is temporarily history.</li>
            <li> But it leaves a residue no matter how much or how little I apply.</li>
            <li> I use it as a mask, and my skin looks tight and smooth, but this only lasts for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I think it actually does provide a little lift, but because you have to take so much time to get the white residue off, it is a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> I really want botox, but am unable to afford it right now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather costly, but if used properly -it will last a long time</li>
            <li> Plus if I use a certain moisturizer or foundation, it leaves a neon yellow-ish green mark!</li>
            <li> What I noticed was that if your face isn&#x27;t meaty, it actually pulls the skin so tight it makes you look old in a different way.</li>
            <li> However, it does not last long.</li>
            <li> The tube also lasts for a long time, so it&#x27;s totally affordable.  </li>
            <li> IMPORTANT NOTE: to avoid white, chalky residue use very little!!!  </li>
            <li> A tiny amount goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> - I find that applying  a bit of dry oil  helps to erase that white film and hold firmness -</li>
            <li> ...then I always first apply a little under eye cream using a small cosmetic brush then with the same brush apply the Instant Firmx.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to use; you must get it right the first time</li>
            <li> As for the white film residue it leaves on your skin, just brush some loose powder over it and it&#x27;s not an issue.  </li>
            <li> Please, if its not working for you because of white residue, try a TON less and work your way back up to just between working well and white residue...  </li>
            <li> I tried all the different ways to apply it recommended on the packaging and saw no real difference before and after</li>
            <li> A thin layer was a fast remedy for those lines over upper lip,  and those between my eyes &amp; upper nose.</li>
            <li> I am also curious what would happen if I left the stuff on and applied my moisturizer and make up over it.</li>
            <li> Just enough to wet the tip of your finger should do both eyes (below the eye).</li>
            <li> Botox is MUCH more expensive and only lasts a few months.  </li>
            <li> Threw it in the garbage after several tries.</li>
            <li> I use PTR on a daily basis combined with other name brand products.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend mixing with anything, because even a little amount mixed with moisturizer or foundation leaves a white residue.  </li>
            <li> I use a powder makeup for the rest of my face, so using between my eyebrows is a bit easier although I have to be very careful just to dab a tiny bit of powder with my makeup brush.</li>
            <li> Have tried a dry cloth but doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of the residue.</li>
            <li> I even tried letting it dry and then washing it off but as soon as you wash it off the product no longer works.</li>
            <li> I used the suggested thick layer as a facial mask a couple times &amp; wow</li>
            <li> I did notice an ever so slight improvement in the pores in my skin, BUT if you&#x27;ve ever tried a product like this, you can imagine your face feeling so tight you really don&#x27;t want to smile because you&#x27;re afraid any wrinkles you had will just appear worse if you smile!</li>
            <li> It takes away not only the wrinkles and bags under my eyes, but also takes away the dark circles I get under my eyes.</li>
            <li> If its really thick in tube add just a little water in top shake and apply with this brush just use very small amount on brush apply and let dry.</li>
            <li> (think overly dry!)</li>
            <li> but I did not feel facial hair pulling tight</li>
            <li> and i tried various amounts and even touch a little moisture to the area</li>
            <li> That tightening effect, however, fades as soon as you rinse it off a few minutes later.  </li>
            <li> IT WILL LAST FOR A FEW HOURS ,BUT CAN BE TOUCHED UP IF NEEDED.</li>
            <li> Learned a few ways to keep the white / flaking at a minimum.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I only use this to firm around the eye area and diminish the eyebags and it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> It also turned white on your face when it dried.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the white effect of the product - which the directions tell you to dampen your face just slightly, and pat dry to get rid of the dried product.</li>
            <li> When applied it leaves a white film that is not easy to remove</li>
            <li> Initially gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s not easy to use.</li>
            <li> I considered ditching this sample 0.5 size tube because I found it frustrating much like other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I apply in a thin layer and actually use a blow dryer on low to dry</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t say I see any long term benefits from using this, as claimed - but if you feel like looking a little less tired or old for the evening - just get home before the pumpkin turns back into a carriage.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Trust everyone when they say a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sure if using it every day will help it last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Instant Firmx on a small part of my neck, as well as the nasolabial folds around my nose, and around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USDED OTHER PRODUCTS THAT CLAIMED TO DO WHAT THIS DOES ,BUT DIDN&#x27;T.</li>
            <li> i have a few and will say i saw alittle difference but not much and did not last but a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I will probably try the FIRMX for the eye for my husband, due to</li>
            <li> All you need is a small amount, especially around your eyes.</li>
            <li> SO AS TO REDUCE THE EXTREME INFLAMMATION CAUSED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to experimenting with mixing it with other moisturizers,etc.</li>
            <li> The product makes your face feel very tight, and it does dry with a whitish residue.</li>
            <li> Pat it under your eyes, (not too close or you&#x27;ll get a pulled down effect}  </li>
            <li> I tried it as directed (washed &amp; dried face, shook it and applied a very thin coat) for the first time today.</li>
            <li> it is leaving such weird  white film on some part f application place that you can not wear it as is-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just not a nice feeling product at all - it literally feels like what dried glue might feel like, and for the $48 I paid for this Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firmx, no thank you!</li>
            <li> I also slightly moisten my finger with water before squeezing the gel onto it -</li>
            <li> I mix it in with a slightly darker foundation.</li>
            <li> I use it for crows feet, and notice wrinkle fade slightly.  </li>
            <li> The material will leave a white film, even a very thin white film that makes our skin look ashy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;you can&#x27;t use any make-up as it leaves a sticky mess on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried to use this, it looks like its a mess to use, I didn&#x27;t use it to go out yet.</li>
            <li> so I mix mine with a little moisturizer, but not all moisturizers work well with it.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to figure out, but I will always keep this in stock.</li>
            <li> I, too, would emphasize just a little of the firmx.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s no better than the other cheaper \\&quot;instant\\&quot; under eye firmers that I have used.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I found that when I followed the directions to remove the dried excess it did compromise the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; a little.  </li>
            <li> Without a little color added to the makeup, my face looks too pale.  </li>
            <li> But if you apply moisturaiser before this Firm that it does not give you effect of firmness you want-  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the white residue that the product leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> It does not appear to firm or tighten.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you buy it by the barrel and soak in it for a month or two you may see something Firm up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I have a tendency to put it on too heavy and with makeup it rolls off.</li>
            <li> I moisturize my face and wait a few minutes and then wipe with a toner before applying.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind side effects like a firm, discoloration where you placed the stuff.  </li>
            <li> sometimes the way it dried, it actually made my undereye wrinkles worse.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that is negative, but is irrelevant, is the fact that the skin stay a little dry.</li>
            <li> I apply the instant firmx eye on with a small make up brush in one sweep thinly just like Peter Roths video</li>
            <li> I think the secret is to keep patting it until it&#x27;s tacky and then let it dry.  </li>
            <li> With a little patience this will amaze you!</li>
            <li> If you have very little sagging of your face, maybe this will provide what you need.</li>
            <li> It takes very little at a time.  </li>
            <li> (I used very, VERY little)</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to use as a white film</li>
            <li> appears even if I use a small amount, and I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it underneath makeup concealer.</li>
            <li> I can usually fix that by mixing it with my foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose is.</li>
            <li> but  not sure on this one</li>
            <li> but it does work if your not ok with having Botox injections.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of this on my problem areas and boom.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount between the fingers - rub your fingers together and pat under your eyes and wait a minute.......</li>
            <li> usually I buy it at Sephora but it has been out of stock.</li>
            <li> so it was a small amount on the sponge.  </li>
            <li> but if you put too much it gives you a white nasty peeling look.</li>
            <li> I keep hearing about this terrible white residue, but have only had a little trouble with that.</li>
            <li> The secret is to use way, way less than what you think you need.  </li>
            <li> I was having a hard time till I went looking for a brush to apply this</li>
            <li> I bought it on a lark because I have been wanting to see for myself in spite of the negative reviews, but I must say, I am agreeing with them.</li>
            <li> My bones were sticking out in a weird way that made me look hollow.</li>
            <li> shook the product well, as directed, applied a thin amount to the areas I wanted to treat, and remained expressionless until the product dried.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is quite thick.  </li>
            <li> It is too thick, and it remains on my face, and it appears funny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I mean, the product disappears when I use liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount and spread a thin amount out beyond the \\&quot;wrinkled\\&quot; area that needs correcting.</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have really bad bags under my eyes since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li> area was not burning or painful, just red.</li>
            <li> , maybe I use the wrong, maybe my face cream is not suitable for it, and probably should beat the way, but I rubbing mud, and it is not moisturizing, and eye cream, they are wrong to try to use them properly for me too much trouble, bad master.</li>
            <li> I used it every day, to erase how tired I looked.  </li>
            <li> I put it on thin......</li>
            <li> It is so thick and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This product is not only expensive but worthless if you put a very thin layer it will not do anything</li>
            <li> BUT, when I rinse it off - the bags return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reread the directions thinking I am doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Expensive for a product that does not work.</li>
            <li> The excess is difficult to remove .. .</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I am addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but gave it a try AND</li>
            <li> Even a very thin coat leaves a residue.  </li>
            <li> It was really an unpleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t so bad until I put my foundation over it.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> Remain expressionless for about 6 minutes and you will be shocked at the results.</li>
            <li> So disappointed because I needed something to decrease the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I hate sagging flesh, but this don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> She hated it...</li>
            <li> It has a horrible color</li>
            <li> CAUSED ME AN AWFUL ALLERGIC REACTION THAT NECESSITATED THE USE OF CORTICOSTEROID PILLS  </li>
            <li> The residue is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> I noticed no differences in appearance. My skin does feel tighter, but I saw no change visually. I would not bother getting it again</li>
            <li> I purchased this because Dr. Oz raved about the firming ability of this product. However, it does not last long. It tightens the skin very nicely but once you smile or add moisturizers, the effects go away. Not sure if using it every day will help it last. I have used it for 2 weeks and no permanent results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it practically erases lines right before your eyes. You feel it tightning and it is so easy to use. It does not lose it&#x27;s tightning effect with moisturizer or makeup. Wish I had found this sooner. Love it.</li>
            <li> The good news is Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firmx is really easy to use and, shortly after you apply it, the lines in your face are gone.  That tightening effect, however, fades as soon as you rinse it off a few minutes later.  So, what&#x27;s the purpose of this stuff?</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good product and would buy again. It doesn&#x27;t take much to do the neck and face....a white tint will appear if you are too generous with the application.</li>
            <li> Package was so oversized that it was embarassing to open it and find all this wrapping.</li>
            <li> it does instantly shrink the bags under my eyes - BUT, when I rinse it off - the bags return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reread the directions thinking I am doing something wrong. IF I could leave it on - it would be great!!!</li>
            <li> This product is good for temporarily tightening your skin so that wrinkles do not show.  It does not last quite as long as advertised, but otherwise does a good job.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I tried this product.  He uses it under his eyes to tighten the sagging muscles and I use it on my cheeks to tighten the skin.  It works great, just as it is advertised.  You have to experiment to determine how much to use for your skin.</li>
            <li> I use it - i like the effect but it is very drying for gentle skin under eyes and my skin got so dry in 3 days that I had to use extra lotions and creams to return all back to normal . But if you apply moisturaiser before this Firm that it does not give you effect of firmness you want-  so - tricky .&lt;br /&gt;please it is leaving such weird  white film on some part f application place that you can not wear it as is- must wash off- and lose your lifting effect  - I find that applying  a bit of dry oil  helps to erase that white film and hold firmness -</li>
            <li> I tried it as directed (washed &amp; dried face, shook it and applied a very thin coat) for the first time today. Yes, I saw the white residue but it wasn&#x27;t so bad until I put my foundation over it. Foundation and eye concealer don&#x27;t smooth out with this under it, they kind of caked. It kind of looked like salt stains on clothing when you get them wet in the snow in places. I did wet it VERY lightly and I finally smoothed the cake-iness away and the white blended better however 20 minutes later, the effects of it seemed to be gone. I did NOT wash it off, I can still feel the tautness of it now but the lines and wrinkles are back. At first it had appeared my skin was much smoother and all the lines in my forehead seemed to actually disappear however, 20 minutes later, all the lines are there. I&#x27;ll try it again as I bought it and I&#x27;ll try mixing my foundation in with it as one person suggested however I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this at the department store. So far I can&#x27;t recommend it. If I see it improves as I use it, I&#x27;ll come back and write another review. I also thought I would try it on my neck, just to see if it does anything, it seems to make my neck appear more wrinkled. It doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for the neck though but thought I&#x27;d try it... Going to wash that off now before I go out!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after the eye firmx was recommeded by Dr Oz. He uses that product under his eyes, where they&#x27;re puffy, and there was a visible difference. I wanted a tightening effect but not under my eyes. I&#x27;ve used the Instant Firmx on a small part of my neck, as well as the nasolabial folds around my nose, and around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shook the product well, as directed, applied a thin amount to the areas I wanted to treat, and remained expressionless until the product dried. The directions say to look in the mirror at this point, which I did, &amp; you&#x27;ll look years younger. LOL I guess I just don&#x27;t look all that old because I noticed no difference in my face, and just a bit of effect to my neck. I didn&#x27;t like the white effect of the product - which the directions tell you to dampen your face just slightly, and pat dry to get rid of the dried product. I did notice an ever so slight improvement in the pores in my skin, BUT if you&#x27;ve ever tried a product like this, you can imagine your face feeling so tight you really don&#x27;t want to smile because you&#x27;re afraid any wrinkles you had will just appear worse if you smile! (think overly dry!) I&#x27;m used to pampering my skin, and just can&#x27;t justify putting something on it which feels drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not a nice feeling product at all - it literally feels like what dried glue might feel like, and for the $48 I paid for this Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firmx, no thank you!</li>
            <li> Found this on my last trip to Las Vegas.  I used it every day, to erase how tired I looked.  It does take years off, it doesn&#x27;t last all day but it is amazing!  My husband even tried it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...be patient and work with it so it works for you!</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any problems with applying this product and I totally LOVE the results. It makes such a difference in minimizing the flaws and wrinkles. I actually feel so much more confident about my appearance when I am wearing Instant FirmX, -with or without makeup. I am completely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Its a facelift in a tube,You can actually feel it working. I look much younger and feel more confident. Thankyou Peter.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product, but it did not work as I hoped. I find it difficult to use as a white film appears even if I use a small amount, and I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it underneath makeup concealer. I&#x27;ve mixed it with concealer and it doesn&#x27;t work well. Right now I&#x27;m only using it between my eyebrows for the \\&quot;ll\\&quot; wrinkles and large pores, but have to use a lot of moisturizer to make the while film stay at bay. Using under my eyes will have to wait until I can figure out how to make it work right with makeup. I use a powder makeup for the rest of my face, so using between my eyebrows is a bit easier although I have to be very careful just to dab a tiny bit of powder with my makeup brush. Hope you find this helpful.</li>
            <li> I was hooked on this stuff like 4 months ago and it is great in between botox and fillers!</li>
            <li> This works great for me. I keep hearing about this terrible white residue, but have only had a little trouble with that. My skin is very fair, so I imagine the residue might show up more on darker complexions. You&#x27;re also more likely to get the residue if you slather the stuff on too heavily. A little goes a long way. I have some very deep frown lines between my eyes and this stuff makes them go away for hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the white residue that the product leaves behind.  Even when the residue is wiped off&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t use any make-up as it leaves a sticky mess on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried mixing with my moisturizer, didn&#x27;t work.  Mixed with my make-up, that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> THIS IS PRETTY GOOD STUFF .JUST BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. IT WILL LAST FOR A FEW HOURS ,BUT CAN BE TOUCHED UP IF NEEDED. I&#x27;VE USDED OTHER PRODUCTS THAT CLAIMED TO DO WHAT THIS DOES ,BUT DIDN&#x27;T.</li>
            <li> Finally a product to make you look younger !! I really love this product !!</li>
            <li> Once you get around the learning curve this stuff is amazing! The trick is to shake the tube and apply a teeny tiny bit, with this less is more. Remain expressionless for about 6 minutes and you will be shocked at the results. PTR please, don&#x27;t ever discontinue this miracle.</li>
            <li> I have been lucky enough to pretty much try the \\&quot;best of the best\\&quot; for anti ageing skincare.  I use PTR on a daily basis combined with other name brand products.  This particular product claims to give us a wash off when done young looking skin but honestly I havent really seen anything spectacular.  I have purchased it and plan on keeping it and using it when I am in no hurry to get to work or anywhere else for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again? No I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Does temporally remove wrinkles. People with brown or non-white skin can not wear in public. The material will leave a white film, even a very thin white film that makes our skin look ashy. I imagine it will not show this on white skin tones. I would say it last about 2 or 3 hours on me. I wish it would last all day and I wish I could wear it in public.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a love/hate relationship with this product.  My friend and I both bought this... She hated it... I ABSOULTELY love it!!!!  The secret is to use way, way less than what you think you need.  I find the product too white to use on my face, but for under your eyes, this is the bomb.  I put my foundation on first (mineral, not liquid) , use the size of a medium pea and split it between two fingers.  Pat it under your eyes, (not too close or you&#x27;ll get a pulled down effect}  I think the secret is to keep patting it until it&#x27;s tacky and then let it dry.  Works absolutely AWESOME and I would highly recommend it!  Sometimes they sell sample sizes (Ulta) and you can see if it works for you!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0040QG46E Peter Thomas Roth Instant FirmX 3.4 fl oz NEW]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best firming and wrinkle filling product I have ever used --- and I have tried many of them!!  The lightweight cream fills in the wrinkles and even with makeup on, it lasts all day.  Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Pat B.</li>
            <li> The product leaves a white film on your skin.  It does not appear to firm or tighten.  Expensive for a product that does not work.</li>
            <li> Leaves residue on your skin.  Does not &amp;#34;instantly firm&amp;#34;.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the issues with the white film as others have had but I find that as soon as I put moisturizer or makeup on over top of this product it does loose some of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> If you have very little sagging of your face, maybe this will provide what you need. The product makes your face feel very tight, and it does dry with a whitish residue. I think it actually does provide a little lift, but because you have to take so much time to get the white residue off, it is a deal breaker for me. The results do not warrant such a time-consuming regimen, and I think you need to put this on pretty heavy if you want an overall lift for an aging face. I bought it on a lark because I have been wanting to see for myself in spite of the negative reviews, but I must say, I am agreeing with them. For very mature skin, you need much more than this can provide. Short of a face lift, there are only two products out there that I have tried and can say the results were significant, and those were Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder and Algenist , and as of this writing, Algenist is first place in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It works.  Need to tap in completely because it dries to a white color.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works..but can get flakey on the skin.</li>
            <li> YES  YES  YES  - THIS WOKS - DON&#x27;T FORGET AFTER APPLICATION - TAP LIGHTLY WITH COOL WATER - THEN APPLY WHAT MAKES YOU BEAUTIFUL FOR YOUR PUBLIC!  P.S.  I HAVE WORN IT TO BED - TO KEEP MY FACE STILL - YOU KNOW YOU FACE GOES THROUGH ALL SORTS OF STUFF WHILE YOU SLEEP - SO I USE THIS OCCASIONALLY TO &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34; MY FACE IN PLACE - YOU LOOK 10 YEARS YOUNGER IN THE A.M.</li>
            <li> Good product true to claim , easy to apply take a good five to ten years off if applied thin no need to remove</li>
            <li> Maybe if you buy it by the barrel and soak in it for a month or two you may see something Firm up.</li>
            <li> This facial cream is very good for firming the skin for a brief time period.  I use this firming cream as a facial mask  before I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> I received this and tried it....it is awesome.....after already using the firmx eye tightener I decided to try this.......I put it on thin......no white residue........  love it.......used mineral powder on top of it....awesome is the word.  I apply the instant firmx eye on with a small make up brush in one sweep thinly just like Peter Roths video...perfect..........</li>
            <li> Really great alternative, yes it&#x27;s temporary, but it can be instantly reapplied, lasts all day for me! Great product.</li>
            <li> This product instantly tightens your skin and makes fine (and some deep) lines soften and even disappear. The effect is temporary, but it is a nice lift that makes you appear more refreshed, especially around the eyes and on the forehead.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s only temporary.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  It comes with no instructions for use and my face felt like it was enclosed in a mask.</li>
            <li> I have really bad bags under my eyes since I was a teen.  It&#x27;s genetic.  I have tried everything.  This product really really works!</li>
            <li> I have this in the Eye Firmx and love it, works amazingly well! I decided to purchase this to address my crepey neck. It worked pretty well. Unlike the eye cream, you can use this more liberally (you need only a dot under each eye with Eye FirmX). I would say this was effective in giving my neck area a smoother appearance. Would estimate there was about a 30% improvement in appearance. I don&#x27;t use this regularly, but will try to use more product for even greater improvement. My opinion only, is that I believe using these products ongoingly will help keep you skin tightened and firmer. I base this on using the Eye Firmx regularly and can see my under eye sag greatly improved. I haven&#x27;t tried this under my eyes yet, but this product is for the entire face, so I think you could use under your eyes as well. I haven&#x27;t needed this for my face, just my neck area.</li>
            <li> Love!!  yes, I LOVE.  Got it for the &amp;#34;II&amp;#34; between brows....  and while it didn&#x27;t clear them completely (they are very deep), I can no longer hide a car in them.  Please, if its not working for you because of white residue, try a TON less and work your way back up to just between working well and white residue...  You will then also LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update....  product worked very well but left me red in the applied areas on the 3rd day.  area was not burning or painful, just red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost two years and it works just as described. The product provides a temporary tightening of the skin. Put the product on, allow to dry and then gently moisten face and pat dry to remove any white residue. It will last all day.</li>
            <li> So excited about the product when I received it. Did really nothing for me. I tried all the different ways to apply it recommended on the packaging and saw no real difference before and after</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  I wish however, it could be made in different tones such as flesh colors</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Just like Botox, but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> This really works but instead of using my fingers I use a flat brush #10 Filbert from Art supplies in any craft store. If its really thick in tube add just a little water in top shake and apply with this brush just use very small amount on brush apply and let dry.Then put on foundation etc works for hours may need touch up after 5 hours. I was having a hard time till I went looking for a brush to apply this is a very reasonably price brush. No white residue after using brush method very similar to derm exclusive in tube for $59 dollars. This will last quite a while very happy with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and use it twice a day; no practice, just dab it on.  It really works; smooths out even your deep forehead wrinkles for an entire day!  As for the white film residue it leaves on your skin, just brush some loose powder over it and it&#x27;s not an issue.  The tube also lasts for a long time, so it&#x27;s totally affordable.  Please PTR, don&#x27;t ever change a single thing about this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I was amazed.  I thought that only surgery would decrease the huge bags under my eyes that medications, genetics, and age have created.  I initially purchased the product that is marketed just for eyes - but saw that this was the same price for over 3 times the product so purchased it.  Both seem to work equally as well for my bags.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely have had a learning curve, and am still learning.  I have found that I must wash the skin around my eyes with soap before applying.  When I just rinse the skin to &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34; it, I end up with the white residue problem.  I also slightly moisten my finger with water before squeezing the gel onto it - it seems to go on smoother.  And, remember to SHAKE the tube before using it!</li>
            <li> my daughter, 40 yrs old loves it and of course she has not one wrinkle.  i have a few and will say i saw alittle difference but not much and did not last but a few hours.  so maybe it is just me</li>
            <li> Product works - but is VERY detectable. Edges crack and don&#x27;t blend no matter what I try, water, moisturizer, makeup, etc</li>
            <li> This works really well! Maybe I&#x27;m not shaking it up enough but it leaves kind of a white powdery residue on my face that I&#x27;m not real happy with. I can usually fix that by mixing it with my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product ever. it does leave a bit of a white film so I mix mine with a little moisturizer, but not all moisturizers work well with it. It takes a little time to figure out, but I will always keep this in stock.</li>
            <li> My wife used and liked. But if you put makeup on top then the effect ends she thinks the ideal is to use powder makeup, like foundation and concealer powder.</li>
            <li> The cream is very good and works as promissed although not very good when combined with other creams. Still learning to use it.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this, it looks like its a mess to use, I didn&#x27;t use it to go out yet.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> So disappointed because I needed something to decrease the bags under my eyes. When applied it leaves a white film that is not easy to remove and I saw no difference in my problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My wife says it&#x27;s very effective. Firms face completely.  A little goes a long way.  A tube lasts about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is perfect and real. The only thing that is negative, but is irrelevant, is the fact that the skin stay a little dry. But the principal effect, the real propose is great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t leave home without it...takes 10 years off</li>
            <li> This product is the next best thing to getting a face full of Botox injections, and I have had that done when I could afford it. Just mix a little Firm X with your moisture, let it dry, and in five minutes most of your lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin is temporarily history. And I am talking about a smooth face for a good twelve hours. This product is amazing and worth the money.</li>
            <li> My skins looks refreshed and young. Learned a few ways to keep the white / flaking at a minimum. I mix it in with a slightly darker foundation.</li>
            <li> Excelent product ! Arrived on time ! perfect</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend</li>
            <li> This product really works!  You do need to figure out how to use it correctly though to decrease the excess whiteness.  Instead of water I use a light moisturizer on the excess edges.  It is the first product that my husband and I have used that really decreases bags under our eyes.</li>
            <li> I find the product does work immediately. But it leaves a residue no matter how much or how little I apply. Then I have to dab it off, but then it&#x27;s gone, so I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose is. Plus if I use a certain moisturizer or foundation, it leaves a neon yellow-ish green mark! I wish I could return it now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the one on TV...  This is a much better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 2 years and absolutely would not go without it or buy any other.  In fact I now buy the large economy size just so I would never run out and keep the smaller size in my travel purse in my car in case I stay overnight somewhere unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first use it, it&#x27;ll take a little practice but first remember to SHAKE IT UP..(important)...then I always first apply a little under eye cream using a small cosmetic brush then with the same brush apply the Instant Firmx.  You MUST remain still for 3-5 minutes while it sets up.  TRY NOT TO BLINK.  I also use it along my laugh lines and over my upper lip where there are fine lines.  It works!!  You&#x27;ll love it once you&#x27;ve tried it!  And you, too,  will NEVER go without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about a 3 star - not as good as I expected but the results are acceptable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many high-priced products which make little difference.  I use Roth&#x27;s Instant Firmx on special occasions, when I&#x27;m going out for the evening and have been told I look about ten years younger. The effect seems to last six-eight hours.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use; you must get it right the first time or you have to remove it and re-apply.</li>
            <li> FirmX is amazing. I apply mine with a moist brush that makes it go on smoother. It takes away not only the wrinkles and bags under my eyes, but also takes away the dark circles I get under my eyes. I will leave the house without makeup but never without FirmX.</li>
            <li> A thin layer was a fast remedy for those lines over upper lip,  and those between my eyes &amp; upper nose. Firmx also pulled in the \\&quot;bags\\&quot; under my eyes.  With no make up, sunscreen or moisturizer it was like a miracle fix. It did flake some &amp; I found that when I followed the directions to remove the dried excess it did compromise the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; a little.  I mix it with my moisturizer now.  Not quite as effective but still good.  Most pleased with the quick way it diminshed under eye bags - for hours! A tiny amount goes a very long way.  I&#x27;m 62 &amp; will buy again.</li>
            <li> This was on QVC and theirs was half as much for twice the price! I love you Amazon!!!!! Oh yes the product works too!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  I got a free sample from theskinstore.com and the first time I tried it I was amazed.  I have been complimented on my skin before and I don&#x27;t use a lot of high-dollar-high-maintenence things because I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;tried too hard&amp;#34; look but within minutes of using this stuff, I could see and feel a considerable difference.  the directions talk about taking a damp cloth and removing the white residue before applying moisturizer but I never had any residue at all.  I am pretty fair skinned though.  It says to use sparingly which I try to do but this stuff is quite thick.  I ordered the full size and plan on spritzing my face or thinning the cream down with a drop or two of water to see if I can make it last while still seeing the results.  I am also curious what would happen if I left the stuff on and applied my moisturizer and make up over it.</li>
            <li> this product works very well; it does tighten the skin.  It does leave a small residue but that is easily remedied; makeup covers it up well.</li>
            <li> Very flakey. Hard to keep your face frozen for the three or more minutes &amp; when applying makeup over it it flaked off. Not for me. Maybe good for someone that doesn&#x27;t need or use make up</li>
            <li> I liked the product. Instant Firmx fills wrinkles within minutes. The only problem is a white layer on the skin. The excess is difficult to remove .. .</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!  Tightens under eye skin and bags and wrinkles virtually disappear.  I&#x27;ve never purchased a product that achieved this kind of results.  You must be careful not to apply too much, also to blend it so that you don&#x27;t end up with flaking or caking, but overall, it really is miraculous.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product with a 0.05 oz sample. Peter Thomas Roth has a good following and his products are pricey so I was excited to try this. Initially gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s not easy to use. I think most of us want a quick fix and an easy fix. If you read som This was my experience so I hope it helps. If you have patience and the time to work this product, you too may get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Updated to 5 stars ***  Twice I considered ditching this sample 0.5 size tube because I found it frustrating much like other reviewers. I decided to hold onto it and consider that I may be the one that needs the learning curve.  I now love this product and just ordered the full size. {I added a couple drops of water to it inside the tube and shook it well. I also dab hyaluronic acid under the eyes before applying. The product now goes on beautifully, dries quickly and does what it says it should.}  It cannot be overstated to use only a miniscule amount. Just enough to wet the tip of your finger should do both eyes (below the eye). I never get the white edges anymore and I have olive complexion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The white substance is present no matter how you put it on.  And this outweighs any help it may have with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is not for me. I really didn&#x27;t like it. It is too thick, and it remains on my face, and it appears funny.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like it. Maybe I need more 10 years on my face to like this product.</li>
            <li> Well before I purchase this item I went to Sephora and got a sample. Instantly I could see a huge difference, it really does give your face a firmer and vibrant look. Trust everyone when they say a little goes a long way. I moisturize my face before putting it on and then again after I&#x27;ve put it on and that works perfectly. I&#x27;ve had my sample now for two weeks and doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;ve used it at all. But this product  will always be in my beauty bag. Love it.</li>
            <li> I  am still trying to see if I can make this stuff work I really like the under eye one  but  not sure on this one</li>
            <li> I tried Peter Roth&#x27;s FirmX after seeing it reviewed by Dr. Oz. I don&#x27;t have bags under my eyes. I tried it for smoothing out some wrinkles. I have a tendency to put it on too heavy and with makeup it rolls off. The wrinkles I am trying to cover up are too deep. I realize the only thing that will get rid of my deep wrinkles is CO2 laser resurfacing.  BUT!!! My husband is using it around his eyes and like Dr.Oz it smooths out the bags. It is an amazing products. When I replace it I will probably try the FIRMX for the eye for my husband, due to that is where he needs it. I found it on Amazon less expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought a travel size at my local Ulta store to try it out. Had to play around with it to get the right amount so I would not have any white powder residue. I use this between my eyebrows for my furrows. Works like a charm. I found that it works best on clean dry skin. I moisturize my face and wait a few minutes and then wipe with a toner before applying. Use a small amount and spread a thin amount out beyond the \\&quot;wrinkled\\&quot; area that needs correcting. Also VERY important to keep that area very still for about 5 mins after applying. I use it under my mineral powder and you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there. Of course it&#x27;s pricey and temporary (so is Botox) but it does work if your not ok with having Botox injections.</li>
            <li> A waste of money. You cannot wear it w/ make up or it will completely crystallize and sense it has no long term effects just short the fact you can&#x27;t wear make up on top of it is not helpful. For this price there are many options.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! I have no complaints against this product.</li>
            <li> While this product is purely cosmetic, it really does make a drastic visual difference when applied properly.  If this is your first time using, it may take a little while to figure out the best way for you to apply it, I would recommend everyone watching the youtube video&#x27;s on various application techniques to really get the best results from this.</li>
            <li> I am soooooo happy with this product...it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also was dismayed by the white film at first, but discovered that if you don&#x27;t use too much and really massage it in, the white film doesn&#x27;t occur.</li>
            <li> It seem that this product should work because your face does feel tighter where you put it, but the instructions say to take off the excess with a damp cloth and when I do the tightness goes away and it doesnt seem that the wrinkles stay gone after that. The problem is if you don&#x27;t get rid of the excess you have a white powdery residue on your face. Have tried a dry cloth but doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of the residue. I will keep trying it though.</li>
            <li> This is the best!  I did a test on my friend (on a really deep wrinkle) and she was amazed (went right to Amazon to buy it).&lt;br /&gt;I look great and even though it says it only works for a day, it seems to keep firming the wrinkles for a while afterwards.  I use it for special occasions and people always comment on how good I look - guess it must be working  :)</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this to try and fell in love! Put it all over my 47-yr old forehead and sat for 5 minutes. After looking in the mirror I could not believe it - my lines, including the deep ones between my eyes - were gone! However, I then tried to apply my foundation and that didn&#x27;t work. This definitely needs to go ON TOP of your makeup. Several hours later there was some light white residue but easily brushed off. This stuff works for several hours. I couldn&#x27;t believe how it made even the deepest of my wrinkles disappear! Ordering the full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am addicted to this stuff! It does take some trial and error to learn to use - but the results are incredible! Tip: when I use this, I apply to clean,dry skin. I then use a mineral-type makeup over the top. Foundations do not work with this. I work 5-6 hours shifts and this lasts the whole time. When you need to re&#x3D;apply, simply use a facewipe to remove it and reapply. It does not leave a white residue unless you over-apply. However, just an light application will make your skin look lighter. So I apply, and then you a darker mineral makeup over the top. I seriously hope they never stop making this - it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li> It is so thick and uncomfortable.  It was really an unpleasant experience.  I saw no improvement.  I would like to return it for a refund.  It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff has to be used very sparingly or you will look like the Queen of Botox  (or KIng).  This is not a lasting wrinkle or line reducer but is good for a few hours. It&#x27;s rather costly, but if used properly -it will last a long time - I can&#x27;t say I see any long term benefits from using this, as claimed - but if you feel like looking a little less tired or old for the evening - just get home before the pumpkin turns back into a carriage.  It works - but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that anyone count on this to help in any permanant way.</li>
            <li> This stuff only looks good if you want your skin to be gray-colored. It has a horrible color so I think the only way to use it and not look weird would be to put gobs of makeup on top to cover it up, if it would even do so. Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I love it.  It is a bit drying but I put a  little moisturizer on top of it which also takes care of the white film it leaves sometimes.  I always shake it very well which I think helps.  I leave it on for about 30 minutes before I apply makeup and it pretty much lasts all day.  I am 60 years old and it definitely makes me look younger and my daughter commented on how good I look.  I do not use it on my entire face, just on my problem areas...lines over lip, frown lines and fine line wrinkles.  Plumps up nicely.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I use it immediately after washing my face in the a.m., followed by a light moisturizer and the effect becomes more natural for about 6 hours. By the end of the day it&#x27;s effects are gone.</li>
            <li> Very good. The only problem is when I use the makeup together with it. I mean, the product disappears when I use liquid makeup. Otherwise the product is awasome.</li>
            <li> This product works. I use it for crows feet, and notice wrinkle fade slightly.  However, it lasts only for a short time. Skin tightens significantly.  Feels nice when applied. The effects only lasts a couple hours, but what can you expect?  Botox is MUCH more expensive and only lasts a few months.  I feel a bit younger when the product is applied.  IMPORTANT NOTE: to avoid white, chalky residue use very little!!!  I only dab a tiny bit (about the size of a pea) under eyes. Overall I am quite pleased with the results - works better than Oil of Olay and Loreal collagen wrinkle filler.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I only use this to firm around the eye area and diminish the eyebags and it works like a charm.  One tube lasts for a long time and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind side effects like a firm, discoloration where you placed the stuff.  If you follow directions and &amp;uuml;se a bit of water to remove the stiffness and discoloration, you get rid of the firming.  I hate sagging flesh, but this don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. It left a film on my skin that peels off if you rub it. I would not order it again.</li>
            <li> The price is decent and if you want an ok fixer this is good but do not wear base,foundation,or powders because it will turn white and i tried various amounts and even touch a little moisture to the area and it would either be to much or just not fix..</li>
            <li> I try and I reconcile cream in a 1:1 ratio to use it, but I did not feel facial hair pulling tight, maybe I use the wrong, maybe my face cream is not suitable for it, and probably should beat the way, but I rubbing mud, and it is not moisturizing, and eye cream, they are wrong to try to use them properly for me too much trouble, bad master.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works. The issue with the residue after it dries can easily be Smoothed in with moisturizer or a little toner on a pad. I love it and it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does what it claims, which is, it tightens temporarily.  I use it as a mask, and my skin looks tight and smooth, but this only lasts for a few hours.  I would not recommend mixing with anything, because even a little amount mixed with moisturizer or foundation leaves a white residue.  I wish the effect would last longer and be cumulative.  But all in all it does what it says and lasts for a few hours for those special occasions.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Worked as it said it would and lasts quite a bit longer than advertised. Very glad I saw this on Today show and more amazed that it wasn&#x27;t over- stated. Having said that, please don&#x27;t stop making it!!!!</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS OKAY.  SOMEONETOLD ME ABOUT IT AND I ORDERED IT.  I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND IT TO FRIENDS OR FAMUILY</li>
            <li> Seen this on tv and decided to try it.  It takes very little at a time.  It is not a miracle solution but does work.  I use a cream to powder make up and I gently put that on after the firm cream.</li>
            <li> This product works well however leaves&lt;br /&gt;a residue. The white residue when washed off takes the product&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AT-Brooklyn, NY</li>
            <li> just so-so, and left residual white streaks. Will keep working with it and maybe I will discover the magic method...</li>
            <li> I read and heard about this product and thought it would do alot better job than it actually does. It works for awhile, but continues to cake up under your eyes.</li>
            <li> This works very well, but be careful not to use too much. All you need is a small amount, especially around your eyes. If you use too much, your skin will feel too tight and more doesn&#x27;t meen better -- if after applying everywhere you feel you need a touch-up, just apply a very slight amount -- you will be good to go. I have used this many times and it works well to smooth out my skin. I like to follow-up with a very careful application of a light moisturizer after it has set in -- after about 10 minutes. Occassionally, I will add make-up, but normally just some concealer and dusting of powder is good.</li>
            <li> The product really does not last for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> You need to experment on yourself the best way to use this. Do not use too much or you will waste it. Make sure you shake it well. You will look  good  when you have it on and it is drying. Wrinkles disappear.  When washed off gently you do look somewhat better but not as good as when product was on and drying.  If I did not have to wash it off and I looked good all day it would be perfect.  Very expensive.</li>
            <li> received quickly and LOVE this product...!!! mahalo</li>
            <li> Does a great job at temporarily tightening skin and smoothing out wrinkles.  One important  thing to remember is don&#x27;t use too much.  Start with about a dime size and move up accordingly.  If you use too much you&#x27;ll end up looking like you got hit in the face with a chalkboard eraser, as applying too much will create a white film residue.  This product requires some practice in application to ensure optimal results, but once you get the hang of it you will be amazed at the outstanding results you will get.  Too bad it&#x27;s only temporary, how long it lasts really depends on how oily your skin gets as people with oily skin will notice the tightening effect start diminishing after about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Lovely this is product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;My care is beautiful now. Felicitation for sale..&lt;br /&gt;Good, goog morning for all. Kisses</li>
            <li> Roth&#x27;s Instant FirmX is a wonderful product; it firms and tightens exactly as promised. At 73 years old I do have &#x27;good&#x27; skin anyway...however, the FirmX makes a noticeable improvement. I receive compliments, saying my &amp;#34;skin looks like porcelain&amp;#34;! I also use Roth&#x27;s Laser-Free Regenerator Moisturizing Gel Cream at night, also in the morning on clean skin, then a light film of FirmX, under my makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is not only expensive but worthless if you put a very thin layer it will not do anything but if you put too much it gives you a white nasty peeling look. If you try to fix it with foundation or water the effect gets eliminated. Products similar to this have been in and out of the market for the same reason, I wish Peter luck hopefully he finds a way to improve his formula.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year for $95 at an Ulta makeup store.  It was so much cheaper on Amazon.  This should last  most folks almost a year and I keep my new one in a plastic bag to keep it as fresh as possible.  You have to shake it really, really well otherwise it may leave a white residue (which can be dabbed off with a Q-tip or tissue and water).  A thin coat works best and afterwards you should keep your expression motionless for about 7 to 10 minutes.  It works absolute wonders for the fine lines and crows feet around the eyes!  I never thought I could smooth those lines out.  It really does make you look much younger and refreshed in only a few minutes.  Because it may leave a residue you have to experiment with it, you might not be able to walk right out the door as your face may need to be dabbed gently in order to remove any residue.  This product is excellent!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I have been using this for a while and pray it NEVER gets discontinued!!! Takes a while to get application right but when you do, orepare to be amazed! Under eye bags, gone! Drooping cheeks, gone!!! Eyelids, lifted!!!! This is literally a face lift in a tube! I apply in a thin layer and actually use a blow dryer on low to dry and my face is pulled to perfection.  Gone are the large pores and acne scars also! I am constantly getting asked if I have had peels or work done! My dictor even adked if I had a chemical peel because my skin looked great and smooth! With a little patience this will amaze you!</li>
            <li> Order by mistake as  I meant to order the eye Firmex. Thought to try this for same purpose and found it works great and actually is a bit milder. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and amazing product!!</li>
            <li> Works great on temporary basis</li>
            <li> I am 39, raised in Florida and have VERY deep forehead lines and under eye issues that I cannot stand. I really want botox, but am unable to afford it right now. I use a small amount of this on my problem areas and boom. Instantly those lines and creases are softened quite a bit. Does it leave a white residue.....yes. But I just take a make-up removing cloth and pat the residue away. very simple. I read somewhere that they are discontinuing this product. God I hope not. My fiance even noticed and I got a \\&quot;Wow.....that stuff did that?????\\&quot; When I read the review of the woman that tried this then threw it in the garbage I wanted to cry. This stuff is awesome. The Pro-s TOTALLY outweigh the Con-s![[ASIN:B004OF7Q2C Instant Firmx Temporary Face Tightener]]</li>
            <li> CAUSED ME AN AWFUL ALLERGIC REACTION THAT NECESSITATED THE USE OF CORTICOSTEROID PILLS  SO AS TO REDUCE THE EXTREME INFLAMMATION CAUSED.</li>
            <li> this goes on before your makeup. tightens and smooths out the small fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it was advertized on Dr. Oz.  Was expecting much more out of this product. It also turned white on your face when it dried.  Threw it in the garbage after several tries.</li>
            <li> I have not yet found a way to apply this and make it last with make up.  I applied it one time and got it right.  but I could not replicate it.  It seems very hit or miss. sometimes the way it dried, it actually made my undereye wrinkles worse.  tried patting it on, mixing it with makeup, sweeping upward....nada.  Could not find a routine that I could count on to be able to do, without the possibility that I would have to undo it, and then do my make up in a shortened amount of time . I have read all the reviews that were 5 star, followed all their suggestions.  If someone has another suggestion, I&#x27;ll give it a go.  giving it three stars for the possibility that maybe I&#x27;ll get it.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff, it really works! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> My daughter told me about this product and I bought it right away.  In the morning after my shower I put it on lightly and lay down for a few minutes.  I can feel my skin tightening and when I look in the mirror, I see some years have vanished!  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with a residue yet.  My co-workers started saying things like, &amp;#34;you look so happy and bright today.&amp;#34;  I just ordered the eye cream as well and I can&#x27;t wait for it to get here.</li>
            <li> great results! loved it!</li>
            <li> Use this daily. Love the instant wrinkle removal.</li>
            <li> Once I learned how to use this product, I fell in love with it.  Just a small amount between the fingers - rub your fingers together and pat under your eyes and wait a minute....... the wrinkles are now smooth and this lasts all day.  If the product becomes white on your face, you have used too much.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but def takes some time and experimentation to find the way it works best for you.  That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  The best method I&#x27;ve found is to wash my face and leave it damp.  Mix a dot of foundation (I use Bare Minerals Bareskin) with a dime size portion of Instant Firmx.  While face is still damp, apply the mixture to the face, blending well.  Remain expressionless until it dries.  This gives me the best result without any white residue.  No powder is needed at all-gives a beautiful, matte finish!  Hope this helps others get a good result.  LOVE this product and the polish it gives to the skin!</li>
            <li> It leaves too much of the white residue, I felt like it did not do much in reducing the wrinkles but I did use it in the masque form, which seems to tighten pores</li>
            <li> Good 4-6 hour tightening.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but gave it a try AND IT WORKS! I found putting it on over makeup works best and it lasts. It does take years off.  I bought the 3.4 oz tube and will definitely but again.  You must shake it up as others have said.</li>
            <li> I love this product...usually I buy it at Sephora but it has been out of stock.</li>
            <li> Works instantly to hide any any lines or wrinkles.  I love this and definitely recommend to anyone who is concerned about aging.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple of weeks ago and tried to apply it the way it explained in the video online and also in the box.  I would always find something that wasn&#x27;t quite right.  These applications were with a good quality foundation brush.  I tried mixing it with foundation, face cream etc.  I tried it by itself and then adding foundation after or foundation first and Firmx after.  Nothing really worked right.  THEN--as a last try, I used my finger to apply.  First I applied to forehead 11 lines, then under each eye.  I waited 7 minutes and saw the wonderful tightening effect--actually more than I wanted.  Then I decided to use a cosmetic sponge to apply the makeup.  I found the new Loreal Visible Lift Blur foundation in Creamy Natural works well with the ingredients in Firmx.  I put a good amount from the tube of Loreal and used the sponge to spread it out so it was a small amount on the sponge.  Then I tapped it over the area where the Firmx is very lightly and carefully.  The rest of the face I tapped on a bit more liberally.  Then I used a cream blush and tapped the areas where I wanted blush.  It looks great!  I might add that I use a very light touch of bronzer on nose, chin, forehead and cheeks to add more natural color.  Without a little color added to the makeup, my face looks too pale.  I&#x27;m sure that depends on skin coloring.  I, too, would emphasize just a little of the firmx.  It is amazing what just a little bit does and how long it lasts!  For me--it&#x27;s the whole day until I wash it off--which I do every night and then add night cream.  This stuff works but for me, only the way I described.</li>
            <li> Meh. It does what it says as far as pulling skin taut, and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it leaving a white residue. (I used very, VERY little) What I noticed was that if your face isn&#x27;t meaty, it actually pulls the skin so tight it makes you look old in a different way. My bones were sticking out in a weird way that made me look hollow. This may work great for some, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple days but wanted to write this while I have the chance. This gel has caused my usually sensitive skin no problems. I used the suggested thick layer as a facial mask a couple times &amp; wow, it&#x27;s strong. At 1st, I used it on 1/2 my face to compare &amp; there&#x27;s a difference. I&#x27;m not saying I looked like a different person but definitely refreshed. I hadn&#x27;t really focused on the pore tightening/smoothing aspect &amp; that&#x27; what&#x27;s really pleased me. I&#x27;ve also mixed it 50;50 with ale vera gel &amp; that worked well around the tender eye skin. I&#x27;m looking forward to experimenting with mixing it with other moisturizers,etc. as mentioned on the package. I&#x27;d like to use it as a body treatment. The dry white residue does have to be damp patted off  unless 1 wants to go around with white flakes all over the face. I&#x27;m glad  I bought this &amp; if it the results stay the same, I&#x27;ll rebuy.</li>
            <li> I put this on and my wrinkles smoothed out and were gone, I am in shock and how much younger I look. I think I look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  However, it&#x27;s no better than the other cheaper \\&quot;instant\\&quot; under eye firmers that I have used.  It also leaves the visible residue just as the cheaper brands do.</li>
            <li> The residue is horrible. Even a very thin coat leaves a residue.  I even tried letting it dry and then washing it off but as soon as you wash it off the product no longer works.</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase I have made of this product. It delivers the performance as promised. I will continue to use it.</li>
