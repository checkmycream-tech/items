    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>These are the best blotter papers I have ever used</li>
            <li>This one from Gatsby is excellent at blotting up oil.</li>
            <li>Work beautifully.</li>
            <li>Really great product.</li>
            <li>Still, they work very nicely.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>good for men&#x27;s oil face, I like this.</li>
            <li>Nice price for a great product.</li>
            <li>The product was perfect and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Works great on go and a nice quick and easy way to absorb unwanted shine.</li>
            <li>Whatever it&#x27;s made out of, it&#x27;s super effective!</li>
            <li>Face feels a lot more matter after using this.</li>
            <li>You will enjoy them!  </li>
            <li>I think this one pulls more oil from the face as well, so I go longer without re-blotting.</li>
            <li>Before I hit the town, I use the Instant Fix Oil Control by Anthony before heading out, which does an awesome job removing the shine.  </li>
            <li>Such good quality!</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I can buy this great Gatsby oil control films</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>But other than that they work much better than any paper sheets I&#x27;ve ever used (they&#x27;re made of some kind of plastic sheet)!</li>
            <li>Like all oil sheets, however, these won&#x27;t keep the oil away for long but are great if you need something to get the oil off for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>They work, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I bought a good supply, but I will definitely reorder when I need to.</li>
            <li>It worked on my dad&#x27;s face as well, and his face is super oily...</li>
            <li>Nothing else removes my facial oil better than Gatsby!</li>
            <li>This one really absorbs and removes the oil and leaves my face looking and feeling smooth and powder fresh.</li>
            <li>Toilet paper is just as effective and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>A bit larger than the the Clear and Easy paper, this paper covers more territory.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first blotting sheet that I have ever used that was made out of...plastic?</li>
            <li>I like the way this work will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the clean and clear ones as the sheets are bigger and the color of the pack is white instead of a bright blue</li>
            <li>My only concern is how environmentally friendly these sheets are, they don&#x27;t seem biodegradable!</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended...</li>
            <li>Really grateful.</li>
            <li>He uses them at school and really likes them.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been very problematic for me....</li>
            <li>Bought a different pack for myself (same kind), but bought these for fianc&amp;eacute;, since it says &amp;#34;for man.&amp;#34; Doesn&#x27;t matter...packaging is completely illegible anyway.</li>
            <li>I also like the color of the paper, black, which matches more of my nighttime wardrobe.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say that these work any better than other brands of oil sheets, but these are a little bit larger than others and they are a dark gray color which I like better than the usual blue sheets.  </li>
            <li>I have a very oily skin, especially in the T-zone and this is the only oil blotting film that ACTUALLY REMOVED OIL FROM MY FACE.</li>
            <li>Work really well to soak up oils from my face without messing up my makeup, and the sheets are bigger than the blue ones that other brands make!</li>

            <li> I have an oily complexion. I don&#x27;t always get the chance to wash the oil off when called into a meeting. No problem now just wipe it away. I always carry a pack in my pocket. You never know when you need it.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Provides a matte finish for your face if you got oily acne prone skin. It&#x27;s better than the clean and clear ones as the sheets are bigger and the color of the pack is white instead of a bright blue</li>
            <li> good for men&#x27;s oil face, I like this.</li>
            <li> Works great on go and a nice quick and easy way to absorb unwanted shine.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I can buy this great Gatsby oil control films and I am grateful. Really grateful. Nothing else removes my facial oil better than Gatsby!</li>
            <li> Works great! Face feels a lot more matter after using this. A must have for summer!</li>
            <li> They are a dark gray and just as small as all the others found at the store. They work, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my son, who is 16, and has oily skin. He uses them at school and really likes them.</li>
            <li> A bit larger than the the Clear and Easy paper, this paper covers more territory. I also like the color of the paper, black, which matches more of my nighttime wardrobe. However, I am still searching for bigger sheets.</li>
            <li> The product was perfect and exactly what I was looking for. I bought a good supply, but I will definitely reorder when I need to.</li>
            <li> Amazing! It&#x27;s the first blotting sheet that I have ever used that was made out of...plastic? I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but it feels like some sort of man-made polymer. Whatever it&#x27;s made out of, it&#x27;s super effective! It sucks up ALL the oil on my face (that sounds gross). It worked on my dad&#x27;s face as well, and his face is super oily...</li>
            <li> I like the way this work will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product! I keep one in my bag, and one in my inside breast pocket of each of my jackets! Such good quality! My only concern is how environmentally friendly these sheets are, they don&#x27;t seem biodegradable! But other than that they work much better than any paper sheets I&#x27;ve ever used (they&#x27;re made of some kind of plastic sheet)!</li>
            <li> I have a very oily skin, especially in the T-zone and this is the only oil blotting film that ACTUALLY REMOVED OIL FROM MY FACE. All the others would only absorb sweat. This one really absorbs and removes the oil and leaves my face looking and feeling smooth and powder fresh.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Doesn&#x27;t disturb your makeup unless of course apply enough makeup to be considered a circus clown!!  These are the best blotter papers I have ever used and I have used a plethora of them.  You will enjoy them!  T</li>
            <li> Work beautifully. Bought a different pack for myself (same kind), but bought these for fianc&amp;eacute;, since it says &amp;#34;for man.&amp;#34; Doesn&#x27;t matter...packaging is completely illegible anyway. Still, they work very nicely. Soaks up lots of oil per sheet. Nice price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Work really well to soak up oils from my face without messing up my makeup, and the sheets are bigger than the blue ones that other brands make!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and I like it a lot. I used to use the blue blotting film you get from the drugstore, but I didn&#x27;t like the fact that those contained mineral oil. Even though they claim it won&#x27;t clog pores, mineral oil definitely clogs pores!  This one from Gatsby is excellent at blotting up oil. I also like the fact that it&#x27;s dark and not that awful bright blue color that&#x27;s so obvious. I think this one pulls more oil from the face as well, so I go longer without re-blotting.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and it&#x27;s been very problematic for me....I shave my head, and it literally looks like a chrome dome due to my oily skin.  I heard about this product in a recent issue of Details magazine, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Wow...what a difference!  Now, whenever I go out, I keep a pack of these in my back pocket, and use it to remove oil from my face from time to time.  Before I hit the town, I use the Instant Fix Oil Control by Anthony before heading out, which does an awesome job removing the shine.  When I need to touch up, I use these blotting papers.  Very highly recommended...especially if you&#x27;re bothered by oily skin, as I am.</li>
            <li> Toilet paper is just as effective and a lot cheaper. After applying one of these sheets there was still a lot of oil on my face. A square of toilet paper did the job. I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say that these work any better than other brands of oil sheets, but these are a little bit larger than others and they are a dark gray color which I like better than the usual blue sheets.  Like all oil sheets, however, these won&#x27;t keep the oil away for long but are great if you need something to get the oil off for an hour or so.</li>
