            <li>Best shampoo and conditioner for your hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>Best of all it works as a cleansing conditioner, I don&#x27;t like to shampoo my hair, this conditioner keeps my hair from getting greasy and has no build up.</li>
            <li>And it smells delicious!</li>

            <li>I am SO IN LOVE with this product!</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, too!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, is creamy, I like the pump bottle.</li>
            <li>When they mix the two odors it results in a kind of spicy smell.</li>
            <li>Love it and love the smell!</li>
            <li>If you want a more sporty good for anytime light smell that isn&#x27;t over powering with excellent results for dry itchy skin then this is a great fit.</li>
            <li>lots of compliments on the smell :-)</li>
            <li>I need 7 more words for this.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never use anything else :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad the formula hasn&#x27;t changed at all.</li>
            <li>For lack of a better word, I would call it a unisex scent.</li>
            <li>But I find it more handsome than pretty.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t wear cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>The smell is so nice and my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>I started with the tea tree special and my skin cleared up in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li>Lavender has a sweet pine-like scent.</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Which is one of the most important things for me because my nose is just as sensitive as my skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely smells great after washing and makes the hair soft.  </li>
            <li>It could possibly(loosely) be equated to sandal wood or maybe a mixture of some other incense but in a good way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not extremely moisturizing, I would describe it more as balancing.</li>
            <li>Perfect to help my haircuts last a little longer and keep my curls from looking too kooky.</li>
            <li>I also like the idea of healthy hair starting at the scalp with the tea tree oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>And when mixed with tea tree and mint, it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>All around this product is perfect for long dry hair and it will help clear up your acne.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender at all - which smells like a cross between a man&#x27;s cheap aftershave and first aid spray - and that&#x27;s exactly what this product smells like.  </li>
            <li>Well it seems real and it works ok, but I was sworn to by Paul Mitchell that it is phony and that the real Paul Mitchell products can only be purchased from a salon or a place like Ulta where there is a salon in the store.</li>
            <li>and I needed more moisture for my very long hair.</li>
            <li>Great smell and only a little needed for conditioning your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey, but not so much as Wen.  </li>
            <li>It really help with breakage smell like mint and give that relax feeling</li>
            <li>Who wants to go around with their hair smelling like THAT?  </li>
            <li>This is a nice smell for either male or female.</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t be more wrong as most will attest to in their reviews.</li>
            <li>The product arrived as expected and came with its own pump applicator which we initially did not expect.</li>
            <li>Even our older boys like using it.</li>
            <li>They moisturize my hair, but leave it feeling clean, full, and soft, not weighed down or coated.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it serve as aroma therapy in the shower, but the smooth, clean feel if the hair matches any other salon brand.  </li>
            <li>Hair is so soft!!</li>
            <li>I have recommend this to few more of my friends .</li>
            <li>Very like conditioner that leaves hair soft but not heavy!</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>However, my hair, which tends to be dry, does not feel more dry after using this vs other super intensive type conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just cheap, but I was a little unprepared for the nearly &amp;30 per bottle tag.</li>
            <li>It is non-drying and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Bottle came broken, but the actual conditioner is amazing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Bottle came broken, but the actual conditioner is amazing</li>
            <li> i add an inch or so of water after using a couple inches - makes it easier to apply since it is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used less expensive conditioning cleansers that left my hair in much better condition with minimal tangling, but this stuff not only made my hair smell funky</li>
            <li> and I figured the product would work well on my long, baby-fine hair (it doesn&#x27;t.)  </li>
            <li> , it seemed to dry it out.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t blow dry, ever.</li>
            <li> Cover was loose, lotion spilled out, pump was not locked.</li>
            <li> I try to buy other hair products because this is SO expensive, but I always end up going right back to this.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry skin which for me can be a problem during the cold winter.</li>
            <li> This conditioner paired with a wide tooth comb will make you say goodbye to split ends forever, if that&#x27;s all you do to it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how it works with the matching shampoo, but I do not feel like my hair would benefit from using both, unless I was trying to get a lot of hairspray or other product out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Let me start by admitting that I have very little hair.</li>
            <li> I also like the pump on the bottle because I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and frizzy, but feels so conditioned and tame after I use it.</li>
            <li> In response to an earlier 3 star post by Bella that said this smells like dirty hippie.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help with dandruff and it really didn&#x27;t work, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Even products designed for clearing acne will make my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> They told me I had to wash and rinse my hair with cold water to get rid of dandruff.</li>
            <li> Smells like dirty hippy</li>
            <li> dirty hippie, No.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product to any but the dirty hippies.</li>

            <li> Yes I do love the smell of this conditioner!  It is pricey, but not so much as Wen.  Even considering buying shampoo and conditioner, this is still a deal over Wen.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair everyday. The smell is so nice and my hair is so soft! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> great smell and conditioning. on my second bottle. i add an inch or so of water after using a couple inches - makes it easier to apply since it is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Smells like dirty hippy</li>
            <li> The smell is AMAZING and so relaxing!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It smells nice, is creamy, I like the pump bottle.

            <li> Love the smell of this conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law is my hair dresser and she uses this at her salon.  It is super moisturizing without being greasy.  Perfect to help my haircuts last a little longer and keep my curls from looking too kooky. I also like the pump on the bottle because I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.  I like the smell but the moisturizing part lacks.  I need 7 more words for this.</li>
            <li> Let me start by admitting that I have very little hair. I actually use this for a body wash. In response to an earlier 3 star post by Bella that said this smells like dirty hippie. She couldn&#x27;t be more wrong as most will attest to in their reviews. If your expecting it to smell like lavender or mint it doesn&#x27;t. When they mix the two odors it results in a kind of spicy smell. It could possibly(loosely) be equated to sandal wood or maybe a mixture of some other incense but in a good way. Perhaps that&#x27;s where her comment comes from, but dirty hippie, No. It leaves me feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry skin which for me can be a problem during the cold winter. This is a nice smell for either male or female. If you are hoping to smell like baby powder ask Bella what she recommends. If you want a more sporty good for anytime light smell that isn&#x27;t over powering with excellent results for dry itchy skin then this is a great fit. I would recomend this product to any but the dirty hippies. Ps my wife has a 1969 VW Camper Van So I know what a hippie smells like. Myself I drive a corvette and I don&#x27;t wear cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> Cover was loose, lotion spilled out, pump was not locked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I bought this.  I don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender at all - which smells like a cross between a man&#x27;s cheap aftershave and first aid spray - and that&#x27;s exactly what this product smells like.  Who wants to go around with their hair smelling like THAT?  But I thought the mint would overpower the lavender (it doesn&#x27;t) and I figured the product would work well on my long, baby-fine hair (it doesn&#x27;t.)  I&#x27;ve used less expensive conditioning cleansers that left my hair in much better condition with minimal tangling, but this stuff not only made my hair smell funky, it seemed to dry it out.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great price for a good quality conditioner that does not test on animals</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo.  They moisturize my hair, but leave it feeling clean, full, and soft, not weighed down or coated.  And it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Great!!  Very like conditioner that leaves hair soft but not heavy!</li>
            <li> Great product! Works really well!</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff. My hair is so thick and frizzy, but feels so conditioned and tame after I use it. Smells lovely, too!</li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected and came with its own pump applicator which we initially did not expect. My wife was very happy with this purchase and enjoys using it every day.</li>
            <li> He loves to use this conditioner since it smells minty and it feels tingly on his head.  Definitely smells great after washing and makes the hair soft.  Even our older boys like using it.</li>
            <li> Not only does it serve as aroma therapy in the shower, but the smooth, clean feel if the hair matches any other salon brand.  Maybe I&#x27;m just cheap, but I was a little unprepared for the nearly &amp;30 per bottle tag.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and prone to break outs. Even products designed for clearing acne will make my skin worse. My biggest problem areas were my back and hairline. For years, I was fighting a losing battle, trying every body wash and medication on the market. I had no idea my body acne was being caused by my conditioner. I started with the tea tree special and my skin cleared up in a matter of weeks. But winter was coming and I needed more moisture for my very long hair. I switched to the lavender mint and swore off all others. Now it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used anything else and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The scent is wonderful. Which is one of the most important things for me because my nose is just as sensitive as my skin. I get compliments all the time. I try to treat my hair with care and respect. I don&#x27;t use dyes or bristle brushes. And I don&#x27;t blow dry, ever. This conditioner paired with a wide tooth comb will make you say goodbye to split ends forever, if that&#x27;s all you do to it. All around this product is perfect for long dry hair and it will help clear up your acne. I&#x27;ll never use anything else :)  (Update, 2017) I&#x27;m still using the same conditioner. I&#x27;m so glad the formula hasn&#x27;t changed at all. And if any men out there are thinking they might want to try this but don&#x27;t know if the scent would be too flowery, it&#x27;s not. Lavender has a sweet pine-like scent. And when mixed with tea tree and mint, it&#x27;s even better. For lack of a better word, I would call it a unisex scent. But I find it more handsome than pretty. My boyfriend and I both use it and so does his best friend (also a guy.)</li>
