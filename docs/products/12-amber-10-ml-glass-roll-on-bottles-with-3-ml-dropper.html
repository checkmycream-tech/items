            <li>Wish the dropper was a little stronger plastic but over all great product for great price.</li>
            <li>They have worked great so far.</li>
            <li>The bottles are great to put your favorite essential oils in to use as a roll on..  </li>
            <li>Easy on off of cap ball.</li>
            <li>Easy to put the rollers in and out.</li>
            <li>Although I have not used all 12 of the bottles yet, the tops have been easy to put on and take off when I need to do so.</li>
            <li>Balls roll out very quickly.</li>
            <li>But I love it even more when it arrives and is STILL exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li>The roller balls will not stay in the bottles when you have filled them with oil.</li>
            <li>These work great with my essential oils and carrier oils.</li>
            <li>Every time I use these cheap a</li>
            <li>Great to use with my essential oils!</li>
            <li>Roller balls fly off and you loose everything in bottle.</li>
            <li>The amber bottles are the only good part of this product.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>so I could mix my own essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li>I fixed it by taping the seam on the top where it broke and has worked ever sense)</li>
            <li>Received these rollerball quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These bottles were exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>these do not leak at all will be back for more</li>
            <li>, it broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these (as long as you don&#x27;t need the dropper) and will be getting these if/when I need more!</li>
            <li>I can &amp;#34;insert&amp;#34; the roller top and literally poke it out with a single finger.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a single fluke roller top either; it was all of them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Work really well.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, a nice bottle and lid are rendered totally useless for oils when the roller bottle top doesn&#x27;t click in and stay in.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the dropper for filling the bottles is very cheap and broke the first time I filled the bottles.</li>
            <li>I can live without the roller ball.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get my roller bottles to more easily apply my essential oils for my eczema but was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li>The bottles and caps are fine and comparable to aromatools, but the plastic roller tops are super thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li>The roller ball seems to lock in fine initially but after minimal use they pop out.</li>
            <li>I really prefer the glass roller ball to plastic when I&#x27;m using essential oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 4 of my 12 and 3 of them so far the rollers fall out.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used about half of these so far - and so far, they&#x27;ve been exactly what I wanted/needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchase 4 different colors of roller bottles from 4 different companies and these roll on the easiest by far!</li>
            <li>I previously purchased another brand and had trouble getting the rollers to work properly and they broke easily.</li>
            <li>These should be absolutely lock tight to keep oils in.</li>

            <li> I have only used one bottle so far, and unfortunately the roller ball has broke on it already.  </li>

            <li> Rollers either &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; out or won&#x27;t roll or are hard to get off or on the on about half of the bottles.  </li>
            <li> Since I need small bottles I will use these anyway.</li>
            <li> Plastic Rollerball part didn&#x27;t work on some of them or the balls were hard to roll.</li>
            <li> Frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Sadly all 4 that have tried have leaked, no chance I could trust them in my purse.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend as bottle is useless without functioning rollerball.</li>
            <li> So irritating!</li>
            <li> Very very frustrating....</li>
            <li> While the seller sent the bottles in a timely manor, the bottles just aren&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen tops that were this bad.  </li>
            <li> Have had a lot of oils spilled out from these bottles, which is annoying and wasteful.  </li>

            <li> Do not buy these from PSC products via Amazon. The bottles and caps are fine and comparable to aromatools, but the plastic roller tops are super thin and flimsy. I can &amp;#34;insert&amp;#34; the roller top and literally poke it out with a single finger. These should be absolutely lock tight to keep oils in. It wasn&#x27;t a single fluke roller top either; it was all of them. Unfortunately, a nice bottle and lid are rendered totally useless for oils when the roller bottle top doesn&#x27;t click in and stay in. Super disappointed; I had roller bottles to make.</li>
            <li> The bottles are great to put your favorite essential oils in to use as a roll on..  I use these for several oils that I carry with me.  Perfect size to toss in your purse.  Price is great too.</li>
            <li> Sadly all 4 that have tried have leaked, no chance I could trust them in my purse.</li>
            <li> Plastic Rollerball part didn&#x27;t work on some of them or the balls were hard to roll. I probably won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Great bottles.. Nice thicker glass that will hold up in purse!! Just what I needed&#x27;</li>
            <li> Great purchase.. good quality and I would buy again</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I needed! and I love them! The dropper broke after the second use but I didn&#x27;t buy this for that, so I wasn&#x27;t upset. Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> Very very frustrating....While the seller sent the bottles in a timely manor, the bottles just aren&#x27;t cutting it.  The roller balls will not stay in the bottles when you have filled them with oil. They just keep fallling out after trying repeatedly to get them to stay.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my roller bottles to more easily apply my essential oils for my eczema but was sadly disappointed. i would say roughly 30% of the time I would use it, the ball would fall out. Frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> Received these rollerball quickly and exactly as described. They have worked great so far.</li>
            <li> Several roller balls fall out when using. Not well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about half of these so far - and so far, they&#x27;ve been exactly what I wanted/needed. The pieces fit together perfectly and work exactly as intended. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order them again.</li>
            <li> These bottles were exactly what I was looking for so I could mix my own essential oil blends.  I have only used one bottle so far, and unfortunately the roller ball has broke on it already.  I am hoping that this is the only defective bottle.</li>
            <li> These work great with my essential oils and carrier oils. I previously purchased another brand and had trouble getting the rollers to work properly and they broke easily. These seem to be much better.</li>
            <li> a great price, but the rollerballs fall out when inverted and rolling on your oil.</li>

            <li> Just what I was looking for for my EO concoctions. Very good quality (except for the dropper, it broke the first time I used it. I fixed it by taping the seam on the top where it broke and has worked ever sense) I would highly recommend these (as long as you don&#x27;t need the dropper) and will be getting these if/when I need more!</li>
            <li> thay are the best for what Ineed  thank you</li>
            <li> The little plastic balls after using twice falls off the roller.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase this item from here again.</li>
            <li> These worked out well. Easy to put the rollers in and out.</li>
            <li> Every time I use these cheap a** rollers the ball falls out!! DO NOT BUY THESE!!!  So irritating!</li>
            <li> Great roller bottles for blending your own Essential oils together to create our own blends. will be buying again soon!</li>
            <li> The roller ball seems to lock in fine initially but after minimal use they pop out. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I love it when I read the description and it&#x27;s exactly what I want.  But I love it even more when it arrives and is STILL exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use these roll on bottles for blends with EO ....the price is great with fast ship time.</li>
            <li> Is what it is good product.</li>
            <li> Roller ball keeps falling out on all the ones I purchased.  Also leaked oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 of my 12 and 3 of them so far the rollers fall out.  Poor quality.  I will not be a repeat purchaser.</li>
            <li> Love the bottles. Have to be careful with roller balls, they like to pop out and oils can leak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 of these since the was received.  The roller ball on 2 of them broke off immediately. Since I need small bottles I will use these anyway. I can live without the roller ball. But I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these roll-on bottles. Although I have not used all 12 of the bottles yet, the tops have been easy to put on and take off when I need to do so. Great to use with my essential oils!</li>
            <li> The amber bottles are the only good part of this product. All of the rollers on the bottles pop out after a few uses. I have never seen tops that were this bad.  Have had a lot of oils spilled out from these bottles, which is annoying and wasteful.  Guess that&#x27;s what I get for splurging of the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; bottles! I would not purchase these bottles ever again!</li>
            <li> Would not order again. Roller balls fly off and you loose everything in bottle.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these. Every single roller is defective as they will not stay in the holder when turning them upside down.</li>
            <li> Balls roll out very quickly.</li>
            <li> The ball portion falls out of the caps. Not good quality.</li>
            <li> All of the roller  balls fallout. Do not order.</li>
