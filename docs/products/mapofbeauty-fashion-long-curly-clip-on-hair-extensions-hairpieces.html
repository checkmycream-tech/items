    <ol>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t expect it to be perfect.  </li>
            <li>I just put product in it and shape it with my fingers and that works best.</li>
            <li>lol hope this helps!</li>
            <li>I thought this piece was beautiful--</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good quality for $10 and they match well with my hair color (ion&#x27;s blue-black demi).</li>
            <li>The quality of the extensions not so good.</li>
            <li>but it still is  a good amount of hair.</li>
            <li>I paid good money for this product and now it is GARBAGE.</li>
            <li>It is one piece which is very nice and easy to put in.</li>
            <li>The product did shed some, but hey, the price is amazing</li>
            <li>keep in mind it is synethic hair, but for 5.00 and free shipping it was a great deal.</li>
            <li>I really liked this.</li>
            <li>it look beautiful and silky and first, but</li>
            <li>blends right in great with my hair.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love these extensions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 5 clips and it&#x27;s pretty good quality</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good to me, but I need to find one that will match my hair....</li>
            <li>Other than that it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>So worth the money, I was so pleased I ordered two more..</li>
            <li>5 bucks plus free shipping????</li>
            <li>They are nice and looks real</li>
            <li>I secured it in place with bobby pins as the product on it&#x27;s own wouldn&#x27;t have stayed secure in my hair without some extra help.  </li>
            <li>This almost caused a FIRE and my whole house filled with smoke.</li>
            <li>Perfect, they are very abundant fails some pictures for other people.</li>
            <li>Maybe add a tad go super glue to the edge to help it from shedding so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this peice!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and curly and they look good as long as you use 2.</li>
            <li>Looks very real and made very well.</li>
            <li>That for real.</li>
            <li>Daughter uses if for CosPlay and really likes the uses.</li>
            <li>They were very tangled when I pulled them out of the package so I tried applying hair products but that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>I will buy the straight ones from now on.</li>
            <li>I am very upset.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels real.  </li>
            <li>even IF I had used a higher temperature, these are marked 100% HEAT RESISTANT.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft feels almost real and is wavy just like the picture.</li>
            <li>I barely touch it because I think if you applied real pressure to it the curls would turn into a frizzy</li>
            <li>When I contacted this seller and told them what happened they promptly brushed me off and tried to put the blame on me by saying that maybe I put the temperature too high</li>
            <li>When I attempted to use light heat to curl these extensions, the extensions melted into a hard glob of plastic.</li>
            <li>I wear these extensions for fun or to take photos - NOT for everyday use.</li>

            <li> and between dark brown and black, so the black did stand out too much for my taste, but still managed to blend in enough to where it didn&#x27;t look so unnatural.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very long (keep in mind these extensions are long!)</li>
            <li> falls off the tracks and the clips are so loose .</li>
            <li> the clips don&#x27;t want to hold in my hair tight enough.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful about brushing--</li>
            <li> it came faster then i expected.</li>
            <li> I got back and my hair is off black to dark brown..</li>
            <li> I was steered away from ordering dark brown because of some of the reviews on here saying they ordered dark brown and received a red/brown product.  </li>
            <li> Dont buy it cause I was in this grey small plastic bag</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I ordered black when I should&#x27;ve ordered dark brown--</li>
            <li> mess--</li>
            <li> and I mean real thin u will have to buy 7 to cover a full head</li>
            <li> it looks and feel like doll hair, wasted money..</li>
            <li> Not very good extensions.</li>
            <li> Not every or u will regret throwing your hard earn money away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not as thick looking as in the picture</li>
            <li> .. UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
            <li> My only problem has been the clips that hold it in place are sometimes painful.</li>
            <li> but after I used them for a day I came back home and the hair got so tangled and ugly</li>
            <li> and it is way to thin ..</li>
            <li> Plus they gave me the wrong Color Don&#x27;t buy from MapofBeauty.</li>

            <li> Suprised at the quality! I really liked this.</li>
            <li> I wear these extensions for fun or to take photos - NOT for everyday use. That being said, I love these extensions. They&#x27;re soft and curly and they look good as long as you use 2. They&#x27;re good quality for $10 and they match well with my hair color (ion&#x27;s blue-black demi).

            <li> Perfect, they are very abundant fails some pictures for other people.</li>
            <li> This hair is 2 short ,It do not go from side 2 side Plus they gave me the wrong Color Don&#x27;t buy from MapofBeauty. Not every or u will regret throwing your hard earn money away. That for real.</li>
            <li> it looks and feel like doll hair, wasted money..</li>
            <li> Dont buy it cause I was in this grey small plastic bag and it ant human hair and it stink bad and it is way to thin .. and I mean real thin u will have to buy 7 to cover a full head so u do the math and the hair falls off the tracks and the clips are so loose . I want buy again</li>
            <li> I really like this peice! My only problem has been the clips that hold it in place are sometimes painful. I have very thin hair so that might be why. Other than that it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Daughter uses if for CosPlay and really likes the uses.</li>
            <li> Not very good extensions. It is one piece which is very nice and easy to put in. The quality of the extensions not so good. They were very tangled when I pulled them out of the package so I tried applying hair products but that didn&#x27;t work either. I will buy the straight ones from now on.</li>
            <li> it came faster then i expected. it look beautiful and silky and first, but over time it sheded and tangled like crazy. keep in mind it is synethic hair, but for 5.00 and free shipping it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I give it 4stars because it wasn&#x27;t my hair color and that&#x27;s my fault. I got back and my hair is off black to dark brown.. The hair is soft feels almost real and is wavy just like the picture. It&#x27;s 5 clips and it&#x27;s pretty good quality but it sheds! Maybe add a tad go super glue to the edge to help it from shedding so much. It&#x27;s probably not as thick looking as in the picture but it still is  a good amount of hair. 5 bucks plus free shipping????! It&#x27;s pretty good to me, but I need to find one that will match my hair....or I should just dye it...lol hope this helps!</li>
            <li> They are nice and looks real (: but after I used them for a day I came back home and the hair got so tangled and ugly</li>
            <li> This seller is a liar. They put 100% Heat Resistant. They ARE NOT. When I attempted to use light heat to curl these extensions, the extensions melted into a hard glob of plastic. And the parts that didnt harden, are nappy and fried! This almost caused a FIRE and my whole house filled with smoke. When I contacted this seller and told them what happened they promptly brushed me off and tried to put the blame on me by saying that maybe I put the temperature too high.. UNBELIEVABLE! I had used the lowest heat possible and regardless of that- even IF I had used a higher temperature, these are marked 100% HEAT RESISTANT. I paid good money for this product and now it is GARBAGE. I am very upset. I WARN YOU, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> So worth the money, I was so pleased I ordered two more.. Looks very real and made very well.</li>
            <li> blends right in great with my hair. people didn,t even know it was a clip in.only problem I have is the clips don&#x27;t want to hold in my hair tight enough.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels real.  Lasted about a month with daily use.</li>
