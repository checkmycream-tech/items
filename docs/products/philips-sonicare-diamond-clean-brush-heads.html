            <li>The compact heads are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>

            <li>Glad I was able to find them online to order them!</li>
            <li>The full size brush heads are great, but the compact are better for me.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love the compact heads for my Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Great Product, they were exactly what I ordered and used before.</li>
            <li>I love the compact heads</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Subscribe and Save feature on these heads (plus coupon at the time of purchase) really made these a great deal.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t feel any difference, all the Sonicare brushes are way better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It seemed like too many gimmicks but now that I&#x27;m used to it, i like it.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect size for cleaning the back teeth and maneuvering inside the gums.</li>
            <li>Love these compact toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I was having difficulty with the Sonicare Plus, but it is better now with this head.</li>
            <li>Love my Sonic Care.</li>
            <li>I LOVE mine.  </li>
            <li>So many ads are hype.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li>but I decided to try it see if it was worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I love my Phillips toothbrush and the brush heads</li>
            <li>However, my teeth have never been better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They are easier to use, more like Oral-B&#x27;s precision brush heads.</li>
            <li>My guess is that Philips did this to sell more toothbrush bases.</li>
            <li>Love Sonicare... need more?</li>
            <li>The brushes magically appear on schedule and my wife and I are reminded to change the brush head on time.</li>
            <li>the compact size is better for the shape of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>the best for reaching back to Wisdom teeth and molars as well as compact close areas like aterials.</li>
            <li>I found that the compact do a better job of reaching all parts of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The compact heads are better at cleaning the corners of you mouth.</li>
            <li>Gets into the crevices better.</li>
            <li>These heads are the perfect size to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li>So, looks like I&#x27;ll be changing them monthly instead of every 6 weeks which will be more costly.  </li>
            <li>glad I found them.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect size for a smaller mouth and it cleans so well.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and definitely recommend it to anyone using a Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I found a better deal (cheaper) $ at Costco after I had purchased these.</li>
            <li>These brushes are better for children.</li>
            <li>I love the DIAMOND by Phillips.</li>
            <li>Love Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love going to the dentist now and having my teeth cleaned because the build up I used to have no longer exists.</li>
            <li>After buying a Sonicare electric toothbrush, for the first time in my life, I have had good reports at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, my teeth feel very clean and gums are in better condition</li>
            <li>I like the smaller heads - they clean great!</li>
            <li>The difference from a regular toothbrush is incredible.</li>
            <li>Phillips Sonicare has always made fantastic product, and the service is top rate</li>
            <li>Love the Diamond Clean heads on our Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Do they clean better?</li>
            <li>Love the clean feel when I use these brushes.</li>
            <li>I used the Pro Results brush head before, but this Diamond Clean is much better.</li>
            <li>I received these brush heads very quickly.</li>
            <li>And I was pleased to try the newest product - the Diamond Clean.  </li>
            <li>The compact head fits easily in my mouth.........</li>
            <li>I love these brush heads for my Diamond Clean toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For me, these are much better than the full size.  </li>
            <li>so we have a month&#x27;s worth of spares on hand, but they leave your teeth feeling nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>New in package, good price.</li>
            <li>My dentist says my gums and teeth are fine.  </li>
            <li>But they arrived much more quickly than indicated</li>
            <li>The head can be easily maneuvered when brushing and is great for smaller jaw sizes.</li>
            <li>I like the Diamond Clean brushes as they seem to clean just &amp;#34;that much&amp;#34; better than the Pro Results.</li>
            <li>Excellent brush to get to tight, overlapping teeth.  </li>
            <li>We found the standard heads to be too large, but these are perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect size to get the job down without feeling like I have to dislocate my jaw just to use it!</li>
            <li>Great product, I prefer this smaller size to the Standart replacements.</li>
            <li>It arrives in perfect condition within a few days.</li>
            <li>though I ordered the correct replacement  heads for my sonicare Advanced 4000</li>
            <li>Always trying to find the cheapest available.</li>
            <li>Good size and soft.</li>
            <li>I quickly found that most of these brush heads are compatible with the Flexcare and Diamond Clean, with the Essence being a low-budget line.</li>
            <li>These fit both Diamond Clean AND Flexcare handles, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>The compact heads are especially good for people with small mouths.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is worth the splurge believe me!</li>
            <li>They are small, and when looking at them I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>the small size makes it perfect to brush your teeth with.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the diamond clean brush</li>
            <li>Like others, I&#x27;d recommend that you get a cheaper handle and get these brush heads to save money on the Diamond Clean</li>
            <li>I like how clean they leave my teeth feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Diamond Clean toothbrush for about nine months.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making replacement heads so I can continue to use the Diamond Clean brush.</li>
            <li>There didn&#x27;t seem to be a difference in performance between the Flexcare Plus or the DIamond Clean, so I ordered and received the Flexcare, and used the compact Diamond Head brush for my</li>
            <li>I like how these brushes clean</li>
            <li>They clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>replacement toothbrush for diamond clean toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After I replace it with another Diamond Clean brush head (there were 2 in a pack), I&#x27;ll see if that one lasts longer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>They fit better in my mouth and allow me to control where I am brushing much easier.  </li>
            <li>I have that just from the dentist clean every day.</li>
            <li>The item is listed as Diamond Clean on the website and also on the brush head that I was trying to replace.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s Oral B has lost the ability to hold a good charge, and when it finally dies will get the Diamond Clean to replace it.</li>
            <li>My favorite Sonicare brush heads in a compact format, great for small mouths and teeth.</li>
            <li>I cannot find these compact and softer replacement heads in any store locally, so was delighted to discover them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t know if it works better or not.</li>
            <li>I have only implants in my lower jaw &amp; this brush gets in and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Having used the ProResults heads, I was used to their full bristles.  </li>
            <li>They are as advertised,  Replacement brushes are a necessary item so these are as good as any.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are particularly good for cleaning.</li>
            <li>It does last a good while.</li>
            <li>I have better control and clean my teeth much better then with a standard brush.  </li>
            <li>That said, the Diamond Clean brush heads are softer when they&#x27;re new which might be better for the gums.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great buy for the price, much cheaper than the local the stores...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and would highly recommend the purchase of them.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is great compared to other retailers too!</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that I am truly impressed with the performance of Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, if you have trouble with Sonicare&#x27;s full-sized brushes, I highly recommend going with the compact brush heads.</li>
            <li>The brushes are the best and last a long time.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought the Diamond Clean brush heads.</li>
            <li>Are they worth</li>
            <li>The compact brushes are far better for getting into every nook and cranny.</li>
            <li>Worth the difference.</li>
            <li>They are more comfortable than the larger ones.</li>
            <li>Really worth the money.</li>
            <li>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</li>
            <li>A tooth is a powerful thing.</li>
            <li>Maybe these should be more clearly labeled as for a child.</li>
            <li>Though I love my Sonicare,  I find it intensely aggravating that I have to pay MORE for a SMALLER head on my toothbrush, and that is the reason for the loss of a star.  </li>
            <li>... which means that my girlfriend told me to buy this specific kind of brush head because she likes them.</li>
            <li>I can say that it is worth every penny and the ease at the dentist</li>
            <li>now makes it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>In addition, the Diamond Clean model feels to give a more complete brush, since one can feel the bristles being more compactly together than with the standard model.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WORTH USING!!!</li>
            <li>I am not 100% sure that it is so much better than the other brush heads they produce</li>
            <li>When I use this toothbrush, my teeth feel clean and smooth, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Original product, cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li>While that brush head does clean the surface quite well, I find it to be much rougher on the gums.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen results with something that won&#x27;t make my teeth more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My wife love&#x27;s these cute, little guys.  </li>
            <li>You simply can not brush by hand and do anywhere near as good as this thing does.</li>
            <li>I just replaced my older model with the Diamond Clean -</li>
            <li>The heads are smaller than the ones they replaced, but they are definitely more powerful.</li>
            <li>Sounds good, but after less than 3 weeks, the brush head looks like it needs to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>This head seems super small at first, but it is perfect to get to your back teeth and enjoy an extra clean mouth.</li>
            <li>These Diamond clean brushes are smaller and feel better on your teeth than the older style brushes.</li>
            <li>It feels as though the yellow middle portion of the brush is better designed to allow for more effective cleaning in the long run.</li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean was fairly new when I ordered them and they had a higher price</li>
            <li>Compact cleans better than regular.</li>
            <li>I brush with the Sensodyne Protect and Repair toothpaste (which I also love), so it&#x27;s definitely not the toothpaste that&#x27;s whitening my teeth</li>
            <li>I think this is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever left, despite buying many products online and valuing the reviews from others.</li>
            <li>I read that it helped much better than the regular one because it goes to places</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of teeth, small and close together like mine, you&#x27;ll find the compact head toothbrush to be significantly more comfortable and effective than the regular size brush head.  </li>
            <li>Love these compact heads for getting into places that the regular heads couldn’t reach.</li>
            <li>I have tried Sonicare brushes in different sizes and I am sure the compact size gives better results for the back molars.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are better than the standard size brushes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I order replacement heads</li>
            <li>(it had been more than six months since he changed them) and I had none of our others left</li>
            <li>I prefer the compact brush, it preforms better when comparing it to the standard brush.</li>
            <li>and I think I will grade this higher in another month or two.</li>
            <li>Compact brush heads so much easier to use!</li>
            <li>Standard is better.</li>
            <li>They do a much better job than the larger ones.</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking!</li>
            <li>These compact brush heads are so much better than the regular sized ones.  </li>
            <li>I switched to the electric toothbrush due to arthritis in my hands and really enjoying how clean my teeth feel with the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I think that the cleaning is good but the sonic action is a very strange feeling in the mouth.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great for people with very small mouths.</li>
            <li>I really like the toothbrush and the heads are soft and comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I was using 2 of the ProResults and 1 of the Diamond Clean equally with my rotation method of usage, and this Diamond Clean brush head wore out much faster</li>
            <li>The compact heads are good for small kids or if you tend to gag when you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>Small mouth and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I like the compact size because it is easy to use on back teeth.</li>
            <li>They do a really good job, I usually let both girls brush their own teeth and then do a little spot brushing once they&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li>There is not much to say, these are original equipment and clean well.</li>
            <li>I also prefer this compact size head over the standard size sold with most new Sonicare handles.</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare and this brush is my new standard.</li>
            <li>This Diamond Clean compact head is perfect - small enough to get into all those little spaces and does a tremendous job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>my last scheduled visit for a teeth cleaning the hygienist was very surprised and pleased to see the condition of my gums.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how Sonicare really &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; the tooth brush 31,000 times a minute because I can certainly tell.</li>
            <li>The compact Diamond Clean has a much higher bristle density, with lots of tiny bristles packed into an area for maximum cleaning.</li>
            <li>They have something that looks similar but it doesn&#x27;t really fit with out a large gap.</li>
            <li>Finally I found this available here on Amazon - thank heavens, because I had to use the Pro Results compact head in the meantime.  </li>
            <li>But my teeth are much cleaner since using Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really keen on the diamond.</li>
            <li>Work very well on my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I especially like how I can easily reach my back teeth and clean around them.  </li>
            <li>These work very well for cleaning and whitening.</li>
            <li>There are no mechanical moving parts with these brushes, the brush head just &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; rapidly causing the toothpaste/fluid mixture to agitate and flow through gum lines and in-between teeth, while the brush works gently and rapidly to remove stains/debris from the teeth.</li>
            <li>and I agree, this brush head really helps take of stains.</li>
            <li>They are the real deal</li>
            <li>Overall a fantastic product</li>
            <li>I have gingivitis and really have to watch plaque build-up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 weeks now and really see and feel a difference.  </li>
            <li>the product really does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the dentist drill and bill away.</li>
            <li>The tiny size of these heads allows me to use my electric toothbrush comfortably</li>
            <li>You can really focus on every area.</li>
            <li>but the brushes are much smaller than original brushes I was replacing.</li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean works much better than the ProResults brush due to the higher bristle density.than the ProResults brush due to the higher bristle density.</li>
            <li>I noticed the Diamond Clean was the most expensive but highly rated tooth brush available, with 7x the cleaning power.</li>
            <li>Compact heads are great for small mouths, just wish you can get them in a larger package for a cheaper price!!</li>
            <li>I can clean each tooth individually, even the insides of my molars!  </li>
            <li>You also need the larger ones, if you have the Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Want really clean teeth, spend the money and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
            <li>These are OK, but after trying both for a few weeks I strongly prefer the Sonicare-Intercare brush heads with the protruding extra hairs</li>
            <li>I routinely use Diamond clean replacement heads, tried to save time by ordering and these are very small - more like a child&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended for my special needs child and I started using the extra brush.  </li>
            <li>the price was slightly better than average.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s not worth spending more for a brush that I have to replace sooner.</li>
            <li>full sized ProResults brush was too big</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that...paying more for less.</li>
            <li>Like these compact brush heads in particular.</li>
            <li>I think the head is too small compare with my original diamond clean head.</li>
            <li>but I do agree that this is a bit high priced for what it is.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>just love this smaller size, easy to clean all those difficult areas.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It could be that my expectations were sky high or that I&#x27;m resistant to change.</li>
            <li>I love these little guys, but cheaper at costco...</li>
            <li>The standard size is too large to fit in the small space available in that part of the mouth.</li>
            <li>My 2-year old really enjoys &amp;#34;using&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li>much too small)and too soft.  </li>
            <li>Every brushing leaves our mouths feeling dentist fresh, and the wife loves the smaller compact head size.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize these heads were so small when I bought them, but my husband and I agree that they&#x27;re superior to the larger heads because they go into places</li>
            <li>I bought these for the Sonicare handle, but I prefer the round Oral-B brushes much better.</li>
            <li>I like the compact heads because I feel that they clean my teeth better as they can fit behind my back teeth and get into crevices that the larger heads cannot reach.  </li>
            <li>Since we are new to this product, I guess we will have to continue trying different heads until we find the right one.  </li>
            <li>compared to the pro version, this one seems to clean slightly better, but the brush wore down (blue bristles turning white) very quickly - within about a month and a half using twice a day.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that these are compact, I don&#x27;t have an overly large mouth so some toothbrushes and head attachments are often too big and cause discomfort.</li>
            <li>given that you  only get two to the set, insead of three, and they cost more, not sure the performance is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, had the toothbrushed heads that came with the original product</li>
            <li>I also like how the color fades in the brush informing you that you need a new brush.</li>
            <li>I know that eBay sells new product, but it&#x27;s a TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li>Got a new Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Completely enjoy these brush heads, it gets in the hard to reach places with the right amount of stiffness in the bristles.  </li>
            <li>But, I usually do not get 3 months out of the brush head as advertised.</li>
            <li>these are $25.51 for two, while the regular Proresults compact brushes are $24.95 for three; more than 50% more expensive per head.</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and love the compact brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love these small heads.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the smaller ones since I can get them behind my back teeth more easily.</li>
            <li>Too darn expensive but love the clean teeth I get.</li>
            <li>My teeth do not feel clean with any other brush.  </li>
            <li>The will fit in my standard toothbrush holder as long as I have the plastic guard on it.  </li>
            <li>the smaller brush more effectiveleaning behind rear teeth and special massage spots</li>
            <li>Much more vigorous action than the previous model but at the same time easier on the gums.  </li>
            <li>Better than the regular size for tight spaces</li>
            <li>Surface area for the brush is about half of the original size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am too accustomed to Sellers on Amazon clearly stating whether the packaging is &#x27;bulk packaging&#x27;, before the purchase, NOT afterwards in a note sent along with the product.  </li>
            <li>Really like the compact size for getting to the back teeth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and cannot use whitening products like those strips or mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>They feel a bit softer than the Proresults brushes, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>There are so many options, that it is confusing.</li>
            <li>What a difference between an old brush and one just opened from the package.</li>
            <li>These last much longer for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow, I have the slickest teeth in the world now.  </li>
            <li>I use these for my 2 and 5 year old girls.  </li>
            <li>He says that my gums are just sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive gums require me to have control over my tooth brush so that I don&#x27;t cause bleeding or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the smaller brush head since I have a narrow mouth.</li>
            <li>You could buy 3-4 Good toohbrushes or 5-6 mediocre ones with this price.</li>
            <li>Good basic item without unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>These wear down within two months of daily use whereas the ProResults brush heads lasted 4-5 months without becoming noticeably worn out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the new toothbrush or the fancy Diamond Clean brushes, but it does seem like my teeth are getting cleaner than the old (ancient) toothbrush was getting them.</li>
            <li>similar to the other versions, not sure it really functions differently, but seems to be good quality construction.  </li>
            <li>I was always going through the full size so fast because I&#x27;d have to press hard to try to make contact with 2 or 3 teeth together.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is, they loose their color quickly which indicates that its time to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order more of these or settle for the standard size brush heads.</li>
            <li>They reach small areas in the mouth better than the larger heads.  </li>
            <li>So I am stuck between paying the high price financially, or paying the price in the dental chair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit cheaper and also doesn&#x27;t require remembering the next time to buy a new set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes do feel a bit stiffer than the usual Sonicare brushes and they really do help remove stains, very noticeable after just a couple of uses!</li>
            <li>They were not available locally and not even available on the Philips website.</li>
            <li>No other sonic toothbrush compares to this one.</li>
            <li>Work well small crevices get clean</li>
            <li>Small compact head makes it easier to reach and clean all the surfaces of your teeth efficiently.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pricey little devils but worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I am able to angle the head easier into the tough to reach</li>
            <li>They are small enough to fit in tighter spaces in my mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be returning these and make my next purchase directly from the Sonicare website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of these brush heads came with my Diamond Clean toothbrush when I first purchased it - however, I discovered after I needed a replacement, that I was unable to purchase them in any of our stores.  </li>
            <li>brush heads arrived in a clear, plastic envelope (similar to Ziploc bags), and not in the standard retail packaging that was displayed online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth with large teeth and sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these compact Diamond Clean heads after extensively researching Sonicare&#x27;s confusing line of brush heads, before I actually bought a Sonicare toothbrush.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t feel any difference, all the Sonicare brushes are way better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It seemed like too many gimmicks but now that I&#x27;m used to it, i like it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for cleaning the back teeth and maneuvering inside the gums.</li>
            <li> Love these compact toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I was having difficulty with the Sonicare Plus, but it is better now with this head.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonic Care.</li>
            <li> I LOVE mine.  </li>
            <li> So many ads are hype.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try it see if it was worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I love my Phillips toothbrush and the brush heads</li>
            <li> However, my teeth have never been better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They are easier to use, more like Oral-B&#x27;s precision brush heads.</li>
            <li> My guess is that Philips did this to sell more toothbrush bases.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare... need more?</li>
            <li> The brushes magically appear on schedule and my wife and I are reminded to change the brush head on time.</li>
            <li> the compact size is better for the shape of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> the best for reaching back to Wisdom teeth and molars as well as compact close areas like aterials.</li>
            <li> I found that the compact do a better job of reaching all parts of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The compact heads are better at cleaning the corners of you mouth.</li>
            <li> Gets into the crevices better.</li>
            <li> These heads are the perfect size to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li> So, looks like I&#x27;ll be changing them monthly instead of every 6 weeks which will be more costly.  </li>
            <li> glad I found them.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for a smaller mouth and it cleans so well.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and definitely recommend it to anyone using a Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I found a better deal (cheaper) $ at Costco after I had purchased these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are better for children.</li>
            <li> I love the DIAMOND by Phillips.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love going to the dentist now and having my teeth cleaned because the build up I used to have no longer exists.</li>
            <li> After buying a Sonicare electric toothbrush, for the first time in my life, I have had good reports at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, my teeth feel very clean and gums are in better condition</li>
            <li> I like the smaller heads - they clean great!</li>
            <li> The difference from a regular toothbrush is incredible.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare has always made fantastic product, and the service is top rate</li>
            <li> Love the Diamond Clean heads on our Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Do they clean better?</li>
            <li> Love the clean feel when I use these brushes.</li>
            <li> I used the Pro Results brush head before, but this Diamond Clean is much better.</li>
            <li> I received these brush heads very quickly.</li>
            <li> And I was pleased to try the newest product - the Diamond Clean.  </li>
            <li> The compact head fits easily in my mouth.........</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads for my Diamond Clean toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For me, these are much better than the full size.  </li>
            <li> so we have a month&#x27;s worth of spares on hand, but they leave your teeth feeling nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> New in package, good price.</li>
            <li> My dentist says my gums and teeth are fine.  </li>
            <li> But they arrived much more quickly than indicated</li>
            <li> The head can be easily maneuvered when brushing and is great for smaller jaw sizes.</li>
            <li> I like the Diamond Clean brushes as they seem to clean just &amp;#34;that much&amp;#34; better than the Pro Results.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush to get to tight, overlapping teeth.  </li>
            <li> We found the standard heads to be too large, but these are perfect.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect size to get the job down without feeling like I have to dislocate my jaw just to use it!</li>
            <li> Great product, I prefer this smaller size to the Standart replacements.</li>
            <li> It arrives in perfect condition within a few days.</li>
            <li> though I ordered the correct replacement  heads for my sonicare Advanced 4000</li>
            <li> Always trying to find the cheapest available.</li>
            <li> Good size and soft.</li>
            <li> I quickly found that most of these brush heads are compatible with the Flexcare and Diamond Clean, with the Essence being a low-budget line.</li>
            <li> These fit both Diamond Clean AND Flexcare handles, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> The compact heads are especially good for people with small mouths.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is worth the splurge believe me!</li>
            <li> They are small, and when looking at them I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li> the small size makes it perfect to brush your teeth with.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the diamond clean brush</li>
            <li> Like others, I&#x27;d recommend that you get a cheaper handle and get these brush heads to save money on the Diamond Clean</li>
            <li> I like how clean they leave my teeth feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Diamond Clean toothbrush for about nine months.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for making replacement heads so I can continue to use the Diamond Clean brush.</li>
            <li> There didn&#x27;t seem to be a difference in performance between the Flexcare Plus or the DIamond Clean, so I ordered and received the Flexcare, and used the compact Diamond Head brush for my</li>
            <li> I like how these brushes clean</li>
            <li> They clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> replacement toothbrush for diamond clean toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After I replace it with another Diamond Clean brush head (there were 2 in a pack), I&#x27;ll see if that one lasts longer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> They fit better in my mouth and allow me to control where I am brushing much easier.  </li>
            <li> I have that just from the dentist clean every day.</li>
            <li> The item is listed as Diamond Clean on the website and also on the brush head that I was trying to replace.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s Oral B has lost the ability to hold a good charge, and when it finally dies will get the Diamond Clean to replace it.</li>
            <li> My favorite Sonicare brush heads in a compact format, great for small mouths and teeth.</li>
            <li> I cannot find these compact and softer replacement heads in any store locally, so was delighted to discover them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t know if it works better or not.</li>
            <li> I have only implants in my lower jaw &amp; this brush gets in and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Having used the ProResults heads, I was used to their full bristles.  </li>
            <li> They are as advertised,  Replacement brushes are a necessary item so these are as good as any.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are particularly good for cleaning.</li>
            <li> It does last a good while.</li>
            <li> I have better control and clean my teeth much better then with a standard brush.  </li>
            <li> That said, the Diamond Clean brush heads are softer when they&#x27;re new which might be better for the gums.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great buy for the price, much cheaper than the local the stores...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and would highly recommend the purchase of them.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is great compared to other retailers too!</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that I am truly impressed with the performance of Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, if you have trouble with Sonicare&#x27;s full-sized brushes, I highly recommend going with the compact brush heads.</li>
            <li> The brushes are the best and last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought the Diamond Clean brush heads.</li>
            <li> Are they worth</li>
            <li> The compact brushes are far better for getting into every nook and cranny.</li>
            <li> Worth the difference.</li>
            <li> They are more comfortable than the larger ones.</li>
            <li> Really worth the money.</li>
            <li> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</li>
            <li> A tooth is a powerful thing.</li>
            <li> Maybe these should be more clearly labeled as for a child.</li>
            <li> Though I love my Sonicare,  I find it intensely aggravating that I have to pay MORE for a SMALLER head on my toothbrush, and that is the reason for the loss of a star.  </li>
            <li> ... which means that my girlfriend told me to buy this specific kind of brush head because she likes them.</li>
            <li> I can say that it is worth every penny and the ease at the dentist</li>
            <li> now makes it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> In addition, the Diamond Clean model feels to give a more complete brush, since one can feel the bristles being more compactly together than with the standard model.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WORTH USING!!!</li>
            <li> I am not 100% sure that it is so much better than the other brush heads they produce</li>
            <li> When I use this toothbrush, my teeth feel clean and smooth, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Original product, cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li> While that brush head does clean the surface quite well, I find it to be much rougher on the gums.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen results with something that won&#x27;t make my teeth more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My wife love&#x27;s these cute, little guys.  </li>
            <li> You simply can not brush by hand and do anywhere near as good as this thing does.</li>
            <li> I just replaced my older model with the Diamond Clean -</li>
            <li> The heads are smaller than the ones they replaced, but they are definitely more powerful.</li>
            <li> Sounds good, but after less than 3 weeks, the brush head looks like it needs to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> This head seems super small at first, but it is perfect to get to your back teeth and enjoy an extra clean mouth.</li>
            <li> These Diamond clean brushes are smaller and feel better on your teeth than the older style brushes.</li>
            <li> It feels as though the yellow middle portion of the brush is better designed to allow for more effective cleaning in the long run.</li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean was fairly new when I ordered them and they had a higher price</li>
            <li> Compact cleans better than regular.</li>
            <li> I brush with the Sensodyne Protect and Repair toothpaste (which I also love), so it&#x27;s definitely not the toothpaste that&#x27;s whitening my teeth</li>
            <li> I think this is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever left, despite buying many products online and valuing the reviews from others.</li>
            <li> I read that it helped much better than the regular one because it goes to places</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of teeth, small and close together like mine, you&#x27;ll find the compact head toothbrush to be significantly more comfortable and effective than the regular size brush head.  </li>
            <li> Love these compact heads for getting into places that the regular heads couldn’t reach.</li>
            <li> I have tried Sonicare brushes in different sizes and I am sure the compact size gives better results for the back molars.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are better than the standard size brushes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I order replacement heads</li>
            <li> (it had been more than six months since he changed them) and I had none of our others left</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact brush, it preforms better when comparing it to the standard brush.</li>
            <li> and I think I will grade this higher in another month or two.</li>
            <li> Compact brush heads so much easier to use!</li>
            <li> Standard is better.</li>
            <li> They do a much better job than the larger ones.</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking!</li>
            <li> These compact brush heads are so much better than the regular sized ones.  </li>
            <li> I switched to the electric toothbrush due to arthritis in my hands and really enjoying how clean my teeth feel with the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I think that the cleaning is good but the sonic action is a very strange feeling in the mouth.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for people with very small mouths.</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush and the heads are soft and comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I was using 2 of the ProResults and 1 of the Diamond Clean equally with my rotation method of usage, and this Diamond Clean brush head wore out much faster</li>
            <li> The compact heads are good for small kids or if you tend to gag when you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> Small mouth and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like the compact size because it is easy to use on back teeth.</li>
            <li> They do a really good job, I usually let both girls brush their own teeth and then do a little spot brushing once they&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li> There is not much to say, these are original equipment and clean well.</li>
            <li> I also prefer this compact size head over the standard size sold with most new Sonicare handles.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare and this brush is my new standard.</li>
            <li> This Diamond Clean compact head is perfect - small enough to get into all those little spaces and does a tremendous job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> my last scheduled visit for a teeth cleaning the hygienist was very surprised and pleased to see the condition of my gums.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how Sonicare really &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; the tooth brush 31,000 times a minute because I can certainly tell.</li>
            <li> The compact Diamond Clean has a much higher bristle density, with lots of tiny bristles packed into an area for maximum cleaning.</li>
            <li> They have something that looks similar but it doesn&#x27;t really fit with out a large gap.</li>
            <li> Finally I found this available here on Amazon - thank heavens, because I had to use the Pro Results compact head in the meantime.  </li>
            <li> But my teeth are much cleaner since using Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really keen on the diamond.</li>
            <li> Work very well on my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I especially like how I can easily reach my back teeth and clean around them.  </li>
            <li> These work very well for cleaning and whitening.</li>
            <li> There are no mechanical moving parts with these brushes, the brush head just &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; rapidly causing the toothpaste/fluid mixture to agitate and flow through gum lines and in-between teeth, while the brush works gently and rapidly to remove stains/debris from the teeth.</li>
            <li> and I agree, this brush head really helps take of stains.</li>
            <li> They are the real deal</li>
            <li> Overall a fantastic product</li>
            <li> I have gingivitis and really have to watch plaque build-up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 weeks now and really see and feel a difference.  </li>
            <li> the product really does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the dentist drill and bill away.</li>
            <li> The tiny size of these heads allows me to use my electric toothbrush comfortably</li>
            <li> You can really focus on every area.</li>
            <li> but the brushes are much smaller than original brushes I was replacing.</li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean works much better than the ProResults brush due to the higher bristle density.than the ProResults brush due to the higher bristle density.</li>
            <li> I noticed the Diamond Clean was the most expensive but highly rated tooth brush available, with 7x the cleaning power.</li>
            <li> Compact heads are great for small mouths, just wish you can get them in a larger package for a cheaper price!!</li>
            <li> I can clean each tooth individually, even the insides of my molars!  </li>
            <li> You also need the larger ones, if you have the Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Want really clean teeth, spend the money and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
            <li> These are OK, but after trying both for a few weeks I strongly prefer the Sonicare-Intercare brush heads with the protruding extra hairs</li>
            <li> I routinely use Diamond clean replacement heads, tried to save time by ordering and these are very small - more like a child&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended for my special needs child and I started using the extra brush.  </li>
            <li> the price was slightly better than average.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not worth spending more for a brush that I have to replace sooner.</li>
            <li> full sized ProResults brush was too big</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that...paying more for less.</li>
            <li> Like these compact brush heads in particular.</li>
            <li> I think the head is too small compare with my original diamond clean head.</li>
            <li> but I do agree that this is a bit high priced for what it is.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> just love this smaller size, easy to clean all those difficult areas.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> It could be that my expectations were sky high or that I&#x27;m resistant to change.</li>
            <li> I love these little guys, but cheaper at costco...</li>
            <li> The standard size is too large to fit in the small space available in that part of the mouth.</li>
            <li> My 2-year old really enjoys &amp;#34;using&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> much too small)and too soft.  </li>
            <li> Every brushing leaves our mouths feeling dentist fresh, and the wife loves the smaller compact head size.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these heads were so small when I bought them, but my husband and I agree that they&#x27;re superior to the larger heads because they go into places</li>
            <li> I bought these for the Sonicare handle, but I prefer the round Oral-B brushes much better.</li>
            <li> I like the compact heads because I feel that they clean my teeth better as they can fit behind my back teeth and get into crevices that the larger heads cannot reach.  </li>
            <li> Since we are new to this product, I guess we will have to continue trying different heads until we find the right one.  </li>
            <li> compared to the pro version, this one seems to clean slightly better, but the brush wore down (blue bristles turning white) very quickly - within about a month and a half using twice a day.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that these are compact, I don&#x27;t have an overly large mouth so some toothbrushes and head attachments are often too big and cause discomfort.</li>
            <li> given that you  only get two to the set, insead of three, and they cost more, not sure the performance is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, had the toothbrushed heads that came with the original product</li>
            <li> I also like how the color fades in the brush informing you that you need a new brush.</li>
            <li> I know that eBay sells new product, but it&#x27;s a TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> Got a new Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Completely enjoy these brush heads, it gets in the hard to reach places with the right amount of stiffness in the bristles.  </li>
            <li> But, I usually do not get 3 months out of the brush head as advertised.</li>
            <li> these are $25.51 for two, while the regular Proresults compact brushes are $24.95 for three; more than 50% more expensive per head.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and love the compact brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love these small heads.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the smaller ones since I can get them behind my back teeth more easily.</li>
            <li> Too darn expensive but love the clean teeth I get.</li>
            <li> My teeth do not feel clean with any other brush.  </li>
            <li> The will fit in my standard toothbrush holder as long as I have the plastic guard on it.  </li>
            <li> the smaller brush more effectiveleaning behind rear teeth and special massage spots</li>
            <li> Much more vigorous action than the previous model but at the same time easier on the gums.  </li>
            <li> Better than the regular size for tight spaces</li>
            <li> Surface area for the brush is about half of the original size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am too accustomed to Sellers on Amazon clearly stating whether the packaging is &#x27;bulk packaging&#x27;, before the purchase, NOT afterwards in a note sent along with the product.  </li>
            <li> Really like the compact size for getting to the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and cannot use whitening products like those strips or mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> They feel a bit softer than the Proresults brushes, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> There are so many options, that it is confusing.</li>
            <li> What a difference between an old brush and one just opened from the package.</li>
            <li> These last much longer for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow, I have the slickest teeth in the world now.  </li>
            <li> I use these for my 2 and 5 year old girls.  </li>
            <li> He says that my gums are just sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive gums require me to have control over my tooth brush so that I don&#x27;t cause bleeding or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the smaller brush head since I have a narrow mouth.</li>
            <li> You could buy 3-4 Good toohbrushes or 5-6 mediocre ones with this price.</li>
            <li> Good basic item without unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> These wear down within two months of daily use whereas the ProResults brush heads lasted 4-5 months without becoming noticeably worn out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the new toothbrush or the fancy Diamond Clean brushes, but it does seem like my teeth are getting cleaner than the old (ancient) toothbrush was getting them.</li>
            <li> similar to the other versions, not sure it really functions differently, but seems to be good quality construction.  </li>
            <li> I was always going through the full size so fast because I&#x27;d have to press hard to try to make contact with 2 or 3 teeth together.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is, they loose their color quickly which indicates that its time to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order more of these or settle for the standard size brush heads.</li>
            <li> They reach small areas in the mouth better than the larger heads.  </li>
            <li> So I am stuck between paying the high price financially, or paying the price in the dental chair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit cheaper and also doesn&#x27;t require remembering the next time to buy a new set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes do feel a bit stiffer than the usual Sonicare brushes and they really do help remove stains, very noticeable after just a couple of uses!</li>
            <li> They were not available locally and not even available on the Philips website.</li>
            <li> No other sonic toothbrush compares to this one.</li>
            <li> Work well small crevices get clean</li>
            <li> Small compact head makes it easier to reach and clean all the surfaces of your teeth efficiently.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pricey little devils but worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I am able to angle the head easier into the tough to reach</li>
            <li> They are small enough to fit in tighter spaces in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be returning these and make my next purchase directly from the Sonicare website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of these brush heads came with my Diamond Clean toothbrush when I first purchased it - however, I discovered after I needed a replacement, that I was unable to purchase them in any of our stores.  </li>
            <li> brush heads arrived in a clear, plastic envelope (similar to Ziploc bags), and not in the standard retail packaging that was displayed online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth with large teeth and sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these compact Diamond Clean heads after extensively researching Sonicare&#x27;s confusing line of brush heads, before I actually bought a Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My only slight disappointment is that they only come with the white colored bases and not additional colors to change for different family members, since there are just two of us left side and right side works fine.</li>
            <li> The vibration is less than regular electric toothbrushes and not as loud either.  </li>
            <li> The small heads are so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted, and cost a little bit less than the local stores here in Singapore.</li>
            <li> have chronic dry mouth, so my teeth are constantly furry</li>
            <li> These smaller heads are much harder to find in the stores and they are never offered in any of the larger &amp;#34;value packs&amp;#34; from either Philips nor the makers of the alternative, just like, use in place of, etc... toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer something a little bigger but not as big as the standard.  </li>
            <li> I want the 15 minutes of my life back that was spent opening this package.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it was what I expected, I like the compact heads and overall the diamond head cleanbrush and heads</li>
            <li> The smaller size allowed me to focus on tight spots as well as cover the larger surface areas (flat parts of teeth, biting surfaces, etc...</li>
            <li> there were with the actual Diamond Clean tooth brush versus a less expensive model such as the Essence or Flexcare series.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that such a small item can deliver such big results.  </li>
            <li> However, they won&#x27;t dry over 2 days with this cover on.  </li>
            <li> With the &#x27;standard&#x27; size brushes I always had to open my mouth wider than usual so that all of the brushes made contact with my teeth.</li>
            <li> The next time I used the compact brush head, it lasted 4 weeks - a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> I always have 3 brush heads that I alternate because I have found that each brush head lasts a little longer instead of using one brush head continuously.</li>
            <li> but wish the toothbrush were a little bigger</li>
            <li> and I can guess why others complained that they only seem to last a month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curious as to why - given its&#x27; popularity</li>
            <li> still don&#x27;t know, having only used them a few times.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the toothbrush itself is that it vibrates really loudly and sometimes unevenly.  </li>
            <li> I was curious to see what differences (if any)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Including this pair, the last few replacements heads we&#x27;ve ordered</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth, so this smaller size is what I need in order to get to all of the back teeth with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I will probably buy it again if it lasts as long as previous flexcare brush heads did.  </li>
            <li> No complaints other than the steep price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical at first, and I had been using Oral-B&#x27;s brush system since around 1996, but always knew about Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads used to have distinctive shapes (eg, one had a triangle and the other had a square)</li>
            <li> that distinguishes the from each other.  </li>
            <li> Other power brushes weren&#x27;t &#x27;fulfilling&#x27; but this is.  </li>
            <li> No cavities &amp; minimal cleaning (scraping) makes me less nervous about those dental visits.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have found that they wear down pretty quickly, on average within two months.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally and</li>
            <li> I recommend it for those with hard to reach areas or smaller sized mouths.</li>
            <li> I have used the earlier compact brush heads for the  Philips Sonicare toothbrush that lasted at least 2 months.</li>
            <li> This makes it more difficult to for family members to share the same base, especially on trips  </li>
            <li> Bristles are denser than previous models.</li>
            <li> I have less issues with my gums with the compact heads</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the angled neck, but these are minor things and hardly justify the cost difference between these and the ProResults brushes.</li>
            <li> I like this product for it&#x27;s ability to get in tight places</li>
            <li> I also like the up and down movement rather than round and round.</li>
            <li> but I feel it uses to little toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> - it is not available in our stores.</li>
            <li> A little small.</li>
            <li> 4 stars, but only because I think they are a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Too bad they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li> I use very little toothpaste because i worry about wearing away my enamel</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact brush heads over the standard size - but the price difference is difficult to justify.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the compact heads are pretty expensive for the 2-pak.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order these again unless my dental hygienist and dentist note an improvement.</li>
            <li> WAY too small.  </li>
            <li> I usually use ProResults Compact Brush Heads.</li>
            <li> my Philips Sonicare HX6733/90 red too！I was so sad about this！</li>
            <li> I prefer the small brush heads.</li>
            <li> They are too small.</li>
            <li> Drawing on it the base with a Sharpie doesn&#x27;t last long; it wipes off after a few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be confused by other toothbrushes that say diamond.</li>
            <li> I did not realize when I ordered them that they would be coming all the way from England, and initially was disappointed in the email giving the expected delivery time.</li>
            <li> That being said, I think they will both need replacing at least every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I am not going to lie and say I like going to the dentist, but at least I am not a wreck for a week in anticipation of going.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing braces and have to brush teeth very carefully at least 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> However these are very small.  </li>
            <li> Much less expensive than what you would pay in the store.</li>
            <li> but I feel it is ridiculously overprices for what it is.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to find and so expensive.</li>
            <li> my wisdom teeth &amp; the fleshy gum behind them!  </li>
            <li> So Why Are They SO EXPENSIVE?  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just REALLY expensive, IMO.</li>
            <li> However, as always, the price is outrageous.</li>

            <li> One of these brush heads came with my Diamond Clean toothbrush when I first purchased it - however, I discovered after I needed a replacement, that I was unable to purchase them in any of our stores.  Finally I found this available here on Amazon - thank heavens, because I had to use the Pro Results compact head in the meantime.  While that brush head does clean the surface quite well, I find it to be much rougher on the gums.  This Diamond Clean compact head is perfect - small enough to get into all those little spaces and does a tremendous job of cleaning.  LOVE this brush head!!  Curious as to why - given its&#x27; popularity - it is not available in our stores.</li>
            <li> Compact cleans better than regular.</li>
            <li> Phillips makes a great product.  This toothbrush has made my dental checkups improve immensely!</li>
            <li> Really like the compact size for getting to the back teeth. But, I usually do not get 3 months out of the brush head as advertised.</li>
            <li> Compact heads are great for small mouths, just wish you can get them in a larger package for a cheaper price!!</li>
            <li> This product is just as described. I love the compact heads but I do agree that this is a bit high priced for what it is. But my teeth are much cleaner since using Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact brush heads over the standard size - but the price difference is difficult to justify.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order more of these or settle for the standard size brush heads.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got these brush heads.  I have sensitive teeth and cannot use whitening products like those strips or mouthwash.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen results with something that won&#x27;t make my teeth more sensitive.  I noticed the increase in whiteness after about 1 week of using the brush.  I brush with the Sensodyne Protect and Repair toothpaste (which I also love), so it&#x27;s definitely not the toothpaste that&#x27;s whitening my teeth, it&#x27;s the diamond clean brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush and these fit perfectly.  I like the compact heads because I feel that they clean my teeth better as they can fit behind my back teeth and get into crevices that the larger heads cannot reach.  Like others, I&#x27;d recommend that you get a cheaper handle and get these brush heads to save money on the Diamond Clean system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Subscribe and Save feature on these heads (plus coupon at the time of purchase) really made these a great deal.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the compact heads for my Sonicare toothbrush! The head can be easily maneuvered when brushing and is great for smaller jaw sizes. With the &#x27;standard&#x27; size brushes I always had to open my mouth wider than usual so that all of the brushes made contact with my teeth. Plus, the tips wore out faster than the rest of the brush. Unfortunately, the compact heads are pretty expensive for the 2-pak. I switched to the electric toothbrush due to arthritis in my hands and really enjoying how clean my teeth feel with the Sonicare toothbrush.  I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love the Diamond Clean heads on our Philips Sonicare.  Every brushing leaves our mouths feeling dentist fresh, and the wife loves the smaller compact head size.</li>
            <li> these work great with the electric tooth brush.  The knockoff ones can not compare.  Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I have problems with plaque built up on my lower teeth.  This system keeps it a bay.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Completely enjoy these brush heads, it gets in the hard to reach places with the right amount of stiffness in the bristles.  Hard to find locally and the price was slightly better than average.</li>
            <li> I bought these to go with the Philips Sonicare HX6972/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush as another reviewer had mentioned, they fit perfectly! The brushes do feel a bit stiffer than the usual Sonicare brushes and they really do help remove stains, very noticeable after just a couple of uses! My only slight disappointment is that they only come with the white colored bases and not additional colors to change for different family members, since there are just two of us left side and right side works fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for gum care</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than electric toothbrush head</li>
            <li> As of this writing (July 2013) these are $25.51 for two, while the regular Proresults compact brushes are $24.95 for three; more than 50% more expensive per head. Are they worth it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t know, having only used them a few times. They feel a bit softer than the Proresults brushes, which surprised me. Do they clean better? I can&#x27;t feel any difference, all the Sonicare brushes are way better than a manual toothbrush. So, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order these again unless my dental hygienist and dentist note an improvement.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrush heads are all good!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really keen on the diamond. It seemed like too many gimmicks but now that I&#x27;m used to it, i like it. The compact heads are good for small kids or if you tend to gag when you brush your teeth. You can use the smaller head to aim around each tooth just like the hygienist.  I use very little toothpaste because i worry about wearing away my enamel</li>
            <li> Cannot find the compact heads in retail stores. This is the perfect size for cleaning the back teeth and maneuvering inside the gums.</li>
            <li> One head came with an irregular brush pattern, I don&#x27;t know how this could make it thief uh quality control</li>
            <li> Love these compact toothbrush heads. Work very well on my Philips Sonicare toothbrush. I like how clean they leave my teeth feeling.</li>
            <li> I was having difficulty with the Sonicare Plus, but it is better now with this head. Good size and soft.</li>
            <li> The compact brushes are far better for getting into every nook and cranny. However, as always, the price is outrageous.</li>
            <li> I cannot find these compact and softer replacement heads in any store locally, so was delighted to discover them on Amazon. I did not realize when I ordered them that they would be coming all the way from England, and initially was disappointed in the email giving the expected delivery time. But they arrived much more quickly than indicated and I am completely happy with the. Now I wish I had ordered more than two!</li>
            <li> Worth the difference.</li>
            <li> these are great but pricy.</li>
            <li> Works great and good size to reach all teeth.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush to get to tight, overlapping teeth.  Used this for years and always get good reviews from my hygenist and Dentist.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It is addition to my regular brush.</li>
            <li> Great price for these refills.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonic Care. The brushes are the best and last a long time. I will continue to purchase these .</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. Bristles are denser than previous models.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry when it&#x27;s time to chsnge toothbrussh heads.  it also makes sense to get the reduced price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Diamond Clean toothbrush for about nine months.  My wife bought a comparable Oral B model at the same time.  I LOVE mine.  She likes hers.  The smaller brush heads and varied brushing modes satisfy a range of brushing needs, from regular, to whitening, to gum massage and touch up.  I especially like how I can easily reach my back teeth and clean around them.  I replace the heads quarterly through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my last scheduled visit for a teeth cleaning the hygienist was very surprised and pleased to see the condition of my gums.  She couldn&#x27;t believe it had been six months since my last office cleaning.  So many ads are hype.  This models does as it says.  I have recommended it to family and friends.  My wife&#x27;s Oral B has lost the ability to hold a good charge, and when it finally dies will get the Diamond Clean to replace it.</li>
            <li> Original product, cleans teeth really well. No complaints other than the steep price. Sigh.</li>
            <li> These are great.  The Diamond Clean electric toothbrush is great.  Thank you for making replacement heads so I can continue to use the Diamond Clean brush.</li>
            <li> good products for electronic toothbrush oral care.</li>
            <li> I think this is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever left, despite buying many products online and valuing the reviews from others. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these toothbrush heads. My teeth literally feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist from a cleaning every time after I brush them. The difference from a regular toothbrush is incredible.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush and electric handle are great for my teeth and gums. They are more comfortable than the larger ones.</li>
            <li> We ordered the compact head as we felt the standard one was a bit big.  However these are very small.  I would prefer something a little bigger but not as big as the standard.  Since we are new to this product, I guess we will have to continue trying different heads until we find the right one.  There are so many options, that it is confusing.</li>
            <li> WAY too small.  I routinely use Diamond clean replacement heads, tried to save time by ordering and these are very small - more like a child&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, my teeth feel very clean and gums are in better condition they were.  My dentist recommended for my special needs child and I started using the extra brush.  The vibration is less than regular electric toothbrushes and not as loud either.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Much more vigorous action than the previous model but at the same time easier on the gums.  I use it every day.  You simply can not brush by hand and do anywhere near as good as this thing does.</li>
            <li> My favorite Sonicare brush heads in a compact format, great for small mouths and teeth.</li>
            <li> The small heads are so much easier to use.  Glad I was able to find them online to order them!</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for many years. This is the first time I bought the Diamond Clean brush heads. I usually use ProResults Compact Brush Heads. The Diamond Clean was fairly new when I ordered them and they had a higher price but I decided to try it see if it was worthwhile. I always have 3 brush heads that I alternate because I have found that each brush head lasts a little longer instead of using one brush head continuously. I was using 2 of the ProResults and 1 of the Diamond Clean equally with my rotation method of usage, and this Diamond Clean brush head wore out much faster and I really don&#x27;t know if it works better or not. For me, it&#x27;s not worth spending more for a brush that I have to replace sooner.</li>
            <li> I own the sonicare toothbrush and these replacements are awesome, but it&#x27;s a tad pricey. You could buy 3-4 Good toohbrushes or 5-6 mediocre ones with this price.</li>
            <li> Work well small crevices get clean</li>
            <li> I love my Phillips toothbrush and the brush heads I have purchased separately have been just great.  My only complaint about the toothbrush itself is that it vibrates really loudly and sometimes unevenly.  However, my teeth have never been better.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is the first time I am using the small toothbrush and it works. I read that it helped much better than the regular one because it goes to places the big one cannot go. it works for me. i will continue buying this kind.</li>
            <li> makes my teeth feel like the dentist cleaned them</li>
            <li> Love the clean feel when I use these brushes.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, it arrived in five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads arrived in a clear, plastic envelope (similar to Ziploc bags), and not in the standard retail packaging that was displayed online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am too accustomed to Sellers on Amazon clearly stating whether the packaging is &#x27;bulk packaging&#x27;, before the purchase, NOT afterwards in a note sent along with the product.  Seller&#x27;s note inside the delivered package claimed, \\&quot;All of my Philips Sonicare toothbrush heads are packed in frustration-free packaging\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this was not mentioned anywhere in the product&#x27;s description online.  Taking the time to open a standard retail package of a tooth brush is not an issue.  I would rather have the product&#x27;s photo *match* what was delivered, and not have a bulk or re-packaged item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head looks flimsy....and I can guess why others complained that they only seem to last a month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning these and make my next purchase directly from the Sonicare website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_</li>
            <li> These work very well for cleaning and whitening. My dentist is happy.</li>
            <li> Love the smaller brush head since I have a narrow mouth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these heads were so small when I bought them, but my husband and I agree that they&#x27;re superior to the larger heads because they go into places that others can&#x27;t.  I also like how the color fades in the brush informing you that you need a new brush.</li>
            <li> Great products never disappointed.....teeth always feel like you&#x27;ve been to a dentist. The compact heads are especially good for people with small mouths.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find and so expensive.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of teeth, small and close together like mine, you&#x27;ll find the compact head toothbrush to be significantly more comfortable and effective than the regular size brush head.  I assume the compact one is best for children&#x27;s teeth too.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love these compact heads for getting into places that the regular heads couldn’t reach. It has made our Sonicare even better!</li>
            <li> I like the smaller brush size for doing a thorough cleaning job.  I also like the up and down movement rather than round and round.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love my Sonicare toothbrush.  I just replaced my older model with the Diamond Clean - it is perfect.  My teeth do not feel clean with any other brush.  Sonicare is worth the splurge believe me!</li>
            <li> I purchased these compact Diamond Clean heads after extensively researching Sonicare&#x27;s confusing line of brush heads, before I actually bought a Sonicare toothbrush. I noticed the Diamond Clean was the most expensive but highly rated tooth brush available, with 7x the cleaning power. I was curious to see what differences (if any) there were with the actual Diamond Clean tooth brush versus a less expensive model such as the Essence or Flexcare series. I quickly found that most of these brush heads are compatible with the Flexcare and Diamond Clean, with the Essence being a low-budget line. There didn&#x27;t seem to be a difference in performance between the Flexcare Plus or the DIamond Clean, so I ordered and received the Flexcare, and used the compact Diamond Head brush for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full sized ProResults brush was too big and I didn&#x27;t like the feel. The compact Diamond Clean has a much higher bristle density, with lots of tiny bristles packed into an area for maximum cleaning. The smaller size allowed me to focus on tight spots as well as cover the larger surface areas (flat parts of teeth, biting surfaces, etc...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first, and I had been using Oral-B&#x27;s brush system since around 1996, but always knew about Sonicare. I didn&#x27;t realize how Sonicare really &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; the tooth brush 31,000 times a minute because I can certainly tell. There are no mechanical moving parts with these brushes, the brush head just &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; rapidly causing the toothpaste/fluid mixture to agitate and flow through gum lines and in-between teeth, while the brush works gently and rapidly to remove stains/debris from the teeth. Bottom line is that I am truly impressed with the performance of Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, if you have trouble with Sonicare&#x27;s full-sized brushes, I highly recommend going with the compact brush heads. They are easier to use, more like Oral-B&#x27;s precision brush heads. The Diamond Clean works much better than the ProResults brush due to the higher bristle density.than the ProResults brush due to the higher bristle density.</li>
            <li> I have only implants in my lower jaw &amp; this brush gets in and does a good job.</li>
            <li> My wife love&#x27;s these cute, little guys.  She&#x27;s happy...I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads used to have distinctive shapes (eg, one had a triangle and the other had a square) that distinguishes the from each other.  The one before that had different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including this pair, the last few replacements heads we&#x27;ve ordered do not.  Drawing on it the base with a Sharpie doesn&#x27;t last long; it wipes off after a few days.  This makes it more difficult to for family members to share the same base, especially on trips  My guess is that Philips did this to sell more toothbrush bases.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. Feels good in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great product, I prefer this smaller size to the Standart replacements.</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush and the heads are soft and comfortable in my mouth. Unfortunately I have found that they wear down pretty quickly, on average within two months.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare... need more?</li>
            <li> Small mouth and much more comfortable. My dentist insists they have this size here in town. They have something that looks similar but it doesn&#x27;t really fit with out a large gap. These work great.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can count on to always have this product in stock.It arrives in perfect condition within a few days.</li>
            <li> I have tried Sonicare brushes in different sizes and I am sure the compact size gives better results for the back molars. The standard size is too large to fit in the small space available in that part of the mouth. In addition, the Diamond Clean model feels to give a more complete brush, since one can feel the bristles being more compactly together than with the standard model.</li>
            <li> It just turn red! I don&#x60;t know why？ Anybody happened like me？it take my Philips Sonicare HX6733/90 red too！I was so sad about this！</li>
            <li> These brush heads are better than the standard size brushes. I think they get my teeth cleaner. It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> I have the brush heads on Subscribe and Save and never have to think about it anymore.  The brushes magically appear on schedule and my wife and I are reminded to change the brush head on time.</li>
            <li> This was the best price that I could find for this Including eBay. I know that eBay sells new product, but it&#x27;s a TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> I though I ordered the correct replacement  heads for my sonicare Advanced 4000 but they did not fit.&lt;br /&gt;I will call the company and see if they can help me!</li>
            <li> So happy that I was able to find these refill heads on Amazon. I use the compact size as they are perfect for the size of my mouth. They were not available locally and not even available on the Philips website. They are perfect and just what I need. I am pleased with the product and would highly recommend the purchase of them.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted, and cost a little bit less than the local stores here in Singapore. *thumbs up!!*</li>
            <li> best tooth brush on the market</li>
            <li> I just started using this brush head yesterday, and I do already see a difference. Really worth the money. I read reviews and I agree, this brush head really helps take of stains. I used the Pro Results brush head before, but this Diamond Clean is much better. I like the compact size because it is easy to use on back teeth.</li>
            <li> I like how these brushes clean my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;And the compact size is better for the shape of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Well made.</li>
            <li> the best for reaching back to Wisdom teeth and molars as well as compact close areas like aterials. Better than the regular size for tight spaces but ooh the price.</li>
            <li> These are great replacement heads. I found that the compact do a better job of reaching all parts of my teeth. I recommend them to anyone who owns the Sonicare HX6072/66</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They are the real deal</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pricey little devils but worth it.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. A tooth is a powerful thing.</li>
            <li> Great, pricey, but great.  I am targeting a pocket and in 4 months it improved 2mm.  Other power brushes weren&#x27;t &#x27;fulfilling&#x27; but this is.  I prefer the small brush heads.</li>
            <li> I received these brush heads very quickly. The package was sealed and the quality is great. Much less expensive than what you would pay in the store.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say, these are original equipment and clean well. The compact heads are better at cleaning the corners of you mouth.</li>
            <li> just love this smaller size, easy to clean all those difficult areas.  philips is a great product.  good price</li>
            <li> Small compact head makes it easier to reach and clean all the surfaces of your teeth efficiently. Dont be fooled by the low priced generic versions, they do not work as well as these!</li>
            <li> They clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> These Diamond clean brushes are smaller and feel better on your teeth than the older style brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are tiny.  Should have gotten the regular size</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I order replacement heads and I did not like these. They are too small. Next time will go for the regular size. I just did not like the feeling...</li>
            <li> Compact is THE WAY TO GO. Gets into the crevices better. Too bad they&#x27;re more expensive. I don&#x27;t get that...paying more for less.</li>
            <li> These heads are the perfect size to reach back teeth. I find if easier to work around and in between teeth. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> similar to the other versions, not sure it really functions differently, but seems to be good quality construction.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The heads are smaller than the ones they replaced, but they are definitely more powerful. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My son and I use the same Sonicare toothbrush.  His toothbrush heads were falling apart (it had been more than six months since he changed them) and I had none of our others left so I ordered these.  They are small, and when looking at them I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  Having used the ProResults heads, I was used to their full bristles.  These seemed somewhat sparse and I didn&#x27;t feel they would do a good job.  However, I have no complaints from my son as of yet, and he&#x27;s been using his for a number of weeks.  When I start using mine I will update this review.  I also didn&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t add color to these brush heads; the ProResults had a band you could change but these don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They are as advertised,  Replacement brushes are a necessary item so these are as good as any. I would recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> Have used Philips Sonicare for almost 8 years. Great battery life. The smaller brushes are particularly good for cleaning. Overall a fantastic product</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact brush, it preforms better when comparing it to the standard brush. I recommend it for those with hard to reach areas or smaller sized mouths.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and love the compact brushes.  What a difference between an old brush and one just opened from the package.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! Good basic item without unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller heads - they clean great!</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that these are compact, I don&#x27;t have an overly large mouth so some toothbrushes and head attachments are often too big and cause discomfort. This is the perfect size to get the job down without feeling like I have to dislocate my jaw just to use it!</li>
            <li> The diamond brushes are the best!!!</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads.</li>
            <li> For me, these are much better than the full size.  I can clean each tooth individually, even the insides of my molars!  I was always going through the full size so fast because I&#x27;d have to press hard to try to make contact with 2 or 3 teeth together.  These last much longer for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have chronic dry mouth, so my teeth are constantly furry (yes, it&#x27;s gross!) these get into all the nooks, crannies, &amp; crevices.  They even get in between my wisdom teeth &amp; the fleshy gum behind them!  Wow, I have the slickest teeth in the world now.  You know that cliche, &amp;#34;just from the dentist clean?&amp;#34;  Yeah, I have that!</li>
            <li> Bristles are actually softer than the last generation...</li>
            <li> These fit both Diamond Clean AND Flexcare handles, which I prefer. I also prefer this compact size head over the standard size sold with most new Sonicare handles. My last checkup indicated no gum issues.</li>
            <li> Nothing easier than using these heads on the Philips Sonicare toothbrush. On the gum mode you get a great gum massage at the end, strengthens the gums and makes dental visits quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> compared to the pro version, this one seems to clean slightly better, but the brush wore down (blue bristles turning white) very quickly - within about a month and a half using twice a day. given that you  only get two to the set, insead of three, and they cost more, not sure the performance is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> All the Philips products I&#x27;ve used have been top notch!</li>
            <li> I have gingivitis and really have to watch plaque build-up which is the reason I purchased these brush heads.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 weeks now and really see and feel a difference.  Only thing is, they loose their color quickly which indicates that its time to replace it.  So, looks like I&#x27;ll be changing them monthly instead of every 6 weeks which will be more costly.  Oh well!  It&#x27;s cheaper than gum surgery!</li>
            <li> I use these for my 2 and 5 year old girls.  They do a really good job, I usually let both girls brush their own teeth and then do a little spot brushing once they&#x27;re done.  My 2-year old really enjoys &amp;#34;using&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare and happy to have replacements so readily available. If you share the Sonicare, good to order in two sizes to distinguish, as they do not come color coded.</li>
            <li> Very handy and does the job. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> the smaller head makes it a lot easier to reach the back teeth where the space is a lot tighter</li>
            <li> This head seems super small at first, but it is perfect to get to your back teeth and enjoy an extra clean mouth. I love Sonicare and this brush is my new standard.</li>
            <li> I like the heads and they work and feel great.  I have had them for a couple of months and rotate using them with each brushing.  That being said, I think they will both need replacing at least every 6 months.  Of course it is recommended you replace your brush every 3 months anyway, so that works out.  The will fit in my standard toothbrush holder as long as I have the plastic guard on it.  However, they won&#x27;t dry over 2 days with this cover on.  4 stars, but only because I think they are a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I think that the cleaning is good but the sonic action is a very strange feeling in the mouth. I am getting used to it and I think I will grade this higher in another month or two.</li>
            <li> Great Product, they were exactly what I ordered and used before. It&#x27;s a great buy for the price, much cheaper than the local the stores...</li>
            <li> I like this product for it&#x27;s ability to get in tight places but I feel it uses to little toothpaste.  It does last a good while.</li>
            <li> replacement toothbrush for diamond clean toothbrush. this is the best toothbrush ever. Phillips Sonicare has always made fantastic product, and the service is top rate</li>
            <li> Compact brush heads so much easier to use!</li>
            <li> Year are really small (I guess that is why they are labeled &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34;). Maybe these should be more clearly labeled as for a child.</li>
            <li> I love these little guys, but cheaper at costco...</li>
            <li> Nice but wish the toothbrush were a little bigger</li>
            <li> Surface area for the brush is about half of the original size. Product not what is supposed to be!!</li>
            <li> I like the Diamond Clean brushes as they seem to clean just &amp;#34;that much&amp;#34; better than the Pro Results.</li>
            <li> Can buy this in Canada, not in compact size.  Regardless of what price. glad I found them.Its good but a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> the smaller brush more effectiveleaning behind rear teeth and special massage spots</li>
            <li> We found the standard heads to be too large, but these are perfect.  They seem to last about 3 months, so expect to replace them regularly.  My only complaints are that the brush heads are relatively expensive and that we haven&#x27;t been able to buy them in a 4-pack so we have a month&#x27;s worth of spares on hand, but they leave your teeth feeling nice and clean.  They have also improved dental checkups for our family.  Great product from Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Works as expected, had the toothbrushed heads that came with the original product and they seem to be identical to those.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for a smaller mouth and it cleans so well.  I highly recommend this product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that such a small item can deliver such big results.  When I use this toothbrush, my teeth feel clean and smooth, just like they do after a professional cleaning.  I am very happy with this product and definitely recommend it to anyone using a Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the small size makes it perfect to brush your teeth with. I like Philips products. They are all perfectly made.</li>
            <li> A little small. Standard is better. I found a better deal (cheaper) $ at Costco after I had purchased these.</li>
            <li> So Why Are They SO EXPENSIVE?  After buying a Sonicare electric toothbrush, for the first time in my life, I have had good reports at the dentist.  No cavities &amp; minimal cleaning (scraping) makes me less nervous about those dental visits.  I am not going to lie and say I like going to the dentist, but at least I am not a wreck for a week in anticipation of going.  Though I love my Sonicare,  I find it intensely aggravating that I have to pay MORE for a SMALLER head on my toothbrush, and that is the reason for the loss of a star.  I have a very small mouth, so this smaller size is what I need in order to get to all of the back teeth with the Sonicare.  These smaller heads are much harder to find in the stores and they are never offered in any of the larger &amp;#34;value packs&amp;#34; from either Philips nor the makers of the alternative, just like, use in place of, etc... toothbrush heads.  So I am stuck between paying the high price financially, or paying the price in the dental chair.  Guess which one I am going with.</li>
            <li> just as advertised. will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have used the earlier compact brush heads for the  Philips Sonicare toothbrush that lasted at least 2 months. And I was pleased to try the newest product - the Diamond Clean.  Sounds good, but after less than 3 weeks, the brush head looks like it needs to be replaced.  That&#x27;s a problem.  After I replace it with another Diamond Clean brush head (there were 2 in a pack), I&#x27;ll see if that one lasts longer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The next time I used the compact brush head, it lasted 4 weeks - a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> Works as described but I feel it is ridiculously overprices for what it is.  I am not 100% sure that it is so much better than the other brush heads they produce but it does feel good using it.  I will probably buy it again if it lasts as long as previous flexcare brush heads did.  It feels as though the yellow middle portion of the brush is better designed to allow for more effective cleaning in the long run.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the Sonicare handle, but I prefer the round Oral-B brushes much better. These brushes are better for children. I just ordered another Oral-B for travel and will probably give the Philips away, even though I paid about $100.</li>
            <li> These were recommended by my dentist.  I have been happy with the Diamond Clean Brush Heads.  They are small enough to fit in tighter spaces in my mouth. They do a much better job than the larger ones.</li>
            <li> Great price on these replacement brushes for the newest Sonicare electric toothbrush. These brushes are the shorter ones, used to reach smaller areas in the mouth. You also need the larger ones, if you have the Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean electric toothbrush. This was an awesome price for the package of two replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> New in package, good price.</li>
            <li> the product really does what it says it does.  and it wouldn&#x27;t go back to a reg toothbrush.  Unthinkably good.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth with large teeth and sensitive gums.  I brush my teeth 3 times a day and floss a minimum of twice a day.  My gums bleed every time I floss.  My dentist says my gums and teeth are fine.  He says that my gums are just sensitive.  The sensitive gums require me to have control over my tooth brush so that I don&#x27;t cause bleeding or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Sonicare is the best purchase I have made for taking care of my teeth.  I have better control and clean my teeth much better then with a standard brush.  The full size brush heads are great, but the compact are better for me.  They fit better in my mouth and allow me to control where I am brushing much easier.  I have less issues with my gums with the compact heads and I am able to angle the head easier into the tough to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon seems to be the only place I can get them so I will be purchasing often.</li>
            <li> No other sonic toothbrush compares to this one. THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WORTH USING!!! I love the DIAMOND by Phillips. Don&#x27;t be confused by other toothbrushes that say diamond.</li>
            <li> Love the Diamond Head Sonicare Toothbrush!  The compact head fits easily in my mouth.........pleased to find these replacements!  Thanks for asking!</li>
            <li> I want the 15 minutes of my life back that was spent opening this package. When will manufacturers learn that good user experience starts with getting the product out of the package. C&#x27;mon Philips!!!</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare. Will never go back to using anything else!!! Like these compact brush heads in particular. They will reach any tooth you want it to.</li>
            <li> Want really clean teeth, spend the money and don&#x27;t look back. works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the dentist drill and bill away.</li>
            <li> ... which means that my girlfriend told me to buy this specific kind of brush head because she likes them. I did. Now she&#x27;s happy. That means that they did their job.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it was what I expected, I like the compact heads and overall the diamond head cleanbrush and heads do the best job. I love going to the dentist now and having my teeth cleaned because the build up I used to have no longer exists. I use the white setting (2.5 minutes basically) twice a day and it gets the job done. I have that just from the dentist clean every day. Yes this brush is pricy but both my husband and I can say that it is worth every penny and the ease at the dentist now makes it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Both former Rodadent uses.</li>
            <li> What is there to say...they are as advertised...genuine Sonicare product. I suggest adding them to your monthly delivery schedule. It&#x27;s a bit cheaper and also doesn&#x27;t require remembering the next time to buy a new set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, Rob</li>
            <li> The compact heads are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for people with very small mouths. The standard size brushes were way too big for me. The tiny size of these heads allows me to use my electric toothbrush comfortably</li>
            <li> These compact brush heads are so much better than the regular sized ones.  They do a wonderful job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li> I think the head is too small compare with my original diamond clean head.</li>
            <li> I love these small heads.  They reach small areas in the mouth better than the larger heads.  They&#x27;re just REALLY expensive, IMO.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads for my Diamond Clean toothbrush. The price on Amazon is great compared to other retailers too! I always purchase the compact brush heads because in my own opinion they make brushing easier. The compact design allows me to thoroughly brush around my molars which I don&#x27;t feel larger brush heads allow.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the toothbrush. It could be that my expectations were sky high or that I&#x27;m resistant to change.</li>
            <li> Got a new Sonicare toothbrush and I couldn&#x27;t find these smaller brush heads anywhere locally. I much prefer the smaller ones since I can get them behind my back teeth more easily. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the new toothbrush or the fancy Diamond Clean brushes, but it does seem like my teeth are getting cleaner than the old (ancient) toothbrush was getting them. I do wish these came in larger quantities - I&#x27;d buy a 5-pack of them.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hygienist, dentist, and I are all doing the happy dance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming I&#x27;ll like these.  I bought them with the Sonicare Flexcare Platinum toothbrush.  I haven&#x27;t needed to change to these yet.</li>
            <li> This brush helps you get into all areas of the mouth.  You can really focus on every area.</li>
            <li> good price on a great product.</li>
            <li> love it!! I&#x27;ve been wearing braces and have to brush teeth very carefully at least 4 times a day. Sonicare helpes brush my teeth very clean!</li>
            <li> Wanted compact, got compact.</li>
            <li> Good price but the brushes are much smaller than original brushes I was replacing.</li>
            <li> These are OK, but after trying both for a few weeks I strongly prefer the Sonicare-Intercare brush heads with the protruding extra hairs</li>
            <li> Way overpriced for this product. Always trying to find the cheapest available. Considering generic version next time.</li>
            <li> The item is listed as Diamond Clean on the website and also on the brush head that I was trying to replace.  On the item that was delivered it says Plillips Sonicare and it is NOT the same size(it&#x27;s much too small)and too soft.  I feel taken.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Too darn expensive but love the clean teeth I get.</li>
            <li> These wear down within two months of daily use whereas the ProResults brush heads lasted 4-5 months without becoming noticeably worn out.  That said, the Diamond Clean brush heads are softer when they&#x27;re new which might be better for the gums.  I also appreciate the angled neck, but these are minor things and hardly justify the cost difference between these and the ProResults brushes.</li>
            <li> Same name but smaller the what you get from Costco. The heads are noticeably smaller than what you get at Costco.</li>
    </ol>
