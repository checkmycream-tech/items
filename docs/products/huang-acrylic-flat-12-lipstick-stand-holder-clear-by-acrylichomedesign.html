I had looked over many of the ones in play, some that hold many lipsticks but none seemed to be for me.  Then I found this one and I knew it was \\&quot;the one\\&quot; for me.  I am happy I ordered it and now have it in use. Yes, I ordered it from Amazon.</li>

            <li> Love my case! The acrylic is very chic and glam! I displayed all my fav. Lipcolors, the shipping was so fast! I&#x27;m 30 yrs old and I like to keep my vanity very elegant looking and this is a must have! I plan on ordering another one!</li>
            <li> I like it, but should have gotten the bigger one.</li>
            <li> Does what it is advertised to do, keep lipstick held together in an acrylic holder.</li>
            <li> I just bought this acrylic lipstick holder. It is perfect for all my Baby Lips and lip glosses (I&#x27;m not big on lipsticks). It&#x27;s very sturdy and really helps with space saving. However save yourself the money, I got it at Marshall&#x27;s today for $2.99. Anytime I want to buy a makeup organizer on Amazon I check Marshall&#x27;s first, they always have them much cheaper :).</li>
            <li> Love it got it early and I still use it. It&#x27;s great if your just starting a lip stick collection.</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick holder for my daughter.  She asked for it specifically.  It is very well made and very pretty.  It holds her lipsticks in a nice practical fashion as well as looking \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; on her vanity.</li>
