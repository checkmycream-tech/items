            <li> Be careful if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> It is not exactly what I was looking for in that it does not feel as moisturizing as other Oil of Olay products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Also it burns my face a little.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t look so tired.</li>

            <li> should have gone to cvs</li>
            <li> Love this night cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream; I;&#x27;ve been using Olay for 30 years.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. It is not exactly what I was looking for in that it does not feel as moisturizing as other Oil of Olay products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Lotion feels good and does not make my skin burn when I apply it like other night creams I have tried.  I have only been using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> A trusted brand. A fine product. No miracle results. Sufficient moisturizer. Did not cause any adverse skin reactions for those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> very light night cream - sometimes night creams are too heavy and clog the pores but, not this one it lets your skin breath.</li>
            <li> It gives you an oily, shinny looking appearance.  Not quite penetrate into skin.  Be careful if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I got this to use because I have severe dry skin and flaking from it. I would also like to deter the aging process while I still can (I&#x27;m only 20.) Doesn&#x27;t last too long only about 1 month-1 month &amp; 1/2 for me. I use it every night. The cream does a good job of moisturizing my skin, but I don&#x27;t like the slightly blue tint it leaves behind. Not on the skin but in the cream itself. Also it burns my face a little. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has experienced this? Or if it&#x27;s because of my excema. Overall okay product, great for the amount of money you spend. I feel like there are better anti-aging night creams out there though.</li>
            <li> I order from jack discount. I received made in EU not made in Poland .Too hot my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the stores does not carry this anymore. I was so glad Amazon have this cream; my skin was dried and itchy and this cream does wonders for me, skin now is smooth and cream has a very light pleasant smell.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I liked other Olay night products better than this one. this doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> excellent night cream .. i loved the refreshing scent most.. its smooth and non greasy ..</li>

The stores here don&#x27;t carry it anymore for some reason. I have combo skin and this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> Olay works as advertised in every product I&#x27;ve tried.  It leaves my skin soft and moisturized without any added scent. Feels good on my face, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Aunt, she loves the Olay brand of face cream. This is the 2nd or third time buying this variety and the umpteenth time I have bought Olay. All of their products are always fantastic and make great gifts for those women in your life who are always a bit worried about the onset of aging.</li>
            <li> Wonderful goes on really smooth looking forward to seeing results</li>
            <li> I really like Olay products they don&#x27;t clog my pores and cause acne. It makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
