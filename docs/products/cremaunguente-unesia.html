            <li> Tried oral meds through my podiatrist, but only got serious side effects.&lt;br /&gt;My dad recommended UNESIA since it got rid of his toe nail fungus that he had for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a month, and the problem is going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;File your nail before using UNESIA so it penetrates the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a day (at night)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once visible fungus goes away, I&#x27;m planning on using this product for 1 or 2 weeks just in case some fungus was left behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product. I&#x27;ll recommend.</li>
            <li> my spouse used this product and received great results from it!!!</li>
            <li> Used for 2 months and never got any results</li>
            <li> So I ordered this because my Mom used it along with some pills and her results were absolutely AMAZING! To the point where she almost cried of happiness. She hadn&#x27;t worn sandals in YEARS! And now she can! I began using it about 3 weeks ago and I did notice that the nails that are growing aren&#x27;t thick anymore, but still somewhat yellow.. I&#x27;m hoping to have the same amazing results as my Mom!! :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product it is so much better than any product I have purchased at pharmacies, and it works faster than I imagined it would</li>
            <li> amazed at how much this product really works. its so easy yet so quick. loved this product and worth ur money!</li>
            <li> I have had &amp;#34;dermatitis&amp;#34; on thumb tips and pointer fingers for years. Besides looking terrible, my fingers continuously formed tiny splits due to the dryness, I guess. Dermatologist after dermatologist after m.d. I tried at least 20 creams or ointments. All these pale against Unesia. Friend dermatologist saw my fingers and brought me to buy it OVER-THE-COUNTER. Works like a charm. Three days of using ointment three/four times a day, my problem disappeared. When it comes back, is I have had my Have a nice day sweetheart in water, a lot, bam, on it  goes, and so does my dermatitis. ALSO: Heads up, people.  If and when i Deleon a fever blister, I am reaching for my Unesia!  Why? Because, I just developed a crack in the corner of my mouth and it was killing me...applied Unevia and with application, the pain subsided almost immediately and within three days, GONE,  like magic. MAGIC Should be its name? It costs me (OTC) in Mexico, approx. $6USD.</li>
            <li> I am using the product a few days ago I am waiting for results....</li>
            <li> So far look like is working.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this product in Mexico a couple years ago.  Just recently located it on Amazon.  Delivery was fast.  This appears to working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried previously</li>
            <li> Giving it a 4 star rating because I haven&#x27;t used it much, but my parents swear by it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product</li>
            <li> I just want to say that im so happy because this cream is working for me there has been points in my life that i would actually cry in the bathroom just looking at my toes while taking a shower i would cry and cry and say why didnt i take care of this earlier. I wouldnt even look at my toes i was disgusted with myself . Im 21 years old and till now i have not went to the beach or inside a pool because of how embarrassed i am with myself. I have been using unesia for 3 weeks and i could see that a new nail is appearing . Im so happy i even feel like crying while writing this down. I have been with my husband for 3 years and i still have not shown him my feet.  Its so embarrassing fpr me to say this but i know if i keep using this cream correctly in a few months i will be happy to show my feet. The way i apply the cream is before i take a shower i clip my nails and i dont know how to say ( Limar las u&amp;ntilde;as) in English but i do that .then i take a shower i dry my feet and i apply the cream to my nails while massaging them i let tge cream dry a little bit and then putvmy socks on because im still embarrassed  i live with mt huaband and have no time to let the cream absorb into my nail but i would recommend you to let the cream absorb into your nail and thats it . Sorry if it was too long for you to read.  I thank you if you had the time to read my little story.</li>
