            <li>The good news...</li>

            <li>I loved this bath treatment.</li>
            <li>Loved the aroma and silky smoothness</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift and the person loved it.  </li>
            <li>good price, too.</li>
            <li>This saves my skin and means that I get to enjoy a warm bath!!!</li>
            <li>Life is good.</li>
            <li>but helps you relax and skin feels good after.</li>
            <li>However, it has been a good addition to his skincare for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give this 5 starts, because I&#x27;ve heard good things.</li>
            <li>good shipping times.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bath product ever!</li>
            <li>I have been using Aveeno bath treaments for years and love them!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love the oatmeal baths!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING Aveeno is amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is amazing for diaper rash.  </li>
            <li>This product works amazing on my daughter.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s as effective for some reason.</li>
            <li>Have to soak in it 15-20 minutes to be effective; also have to stir up powder in bath to dissolve, (might leave ring in tub that can be washed off.)  </li>
            <li>Nice warm soak in it and</li>
            <li>After a nice warm bath with this the scratching stops and she sleeps like a baby.  </li>
            <li>Nice but would prefer a stronger aroma ...</li>
            <li>The content of each package was lumpy and did not blend well in the warm water.</li>
            <li>I fill the baby tub with warm water and this treatment, and use like a sitz bath for baby, even after she outgrew the tub.  </li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t but about 50 cents difference, get the good stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Nice smell too.</li>
            <li>A nice bath soak and it helps my itchy skin.</li>
            <li>After using it though I will probably just try grinding up oatmeal on my own since this seems to be all the product is.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found a nice soak in Aveeno does a world of good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this feels really good and soothes your skin :) give it a try</li>
            <li>excellent product, fast shipping and fantastic and fair price.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and allergies and this stuff is great!.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product I recommend it for light to mild rashes.</li>
            <li>I heard oatmeal in fine powder in a warm bath could help out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I love the Aveeno colloidal oatmeal.</li>
            <li>After just one soak my feet felt so much better.</li>
            <li>This was an okay bath soak product</li>
            <li>I bathed my son using one packet and he was finally able to get some relief.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should sue more then one pack a bath, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything with this at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I love a bubble bath</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the next best thing...</li>
            <li>We love using these bath soaks.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it has value, but it just seemed to make clumps in the bath tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite Bath soothing.</li>
            <li>I feel more relaxed and my skin is softer.</li>
            <li>Oh, this oatmeal bath makes my skin so silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>Aveeno Bath Treatment keeps my family from itching and we love.</li>
            <li>Make sure you mix it with your water.</li>
            <li>I have been a severe psoriasis suffer (erythrodermic psoriasis) for more than 20 years, and the oatmeal baths are part of my regime (once to twice per week)</li>
            <li>I did more than 10 years of chemo for my severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, which has caused all kinds of problems for me now.</li>
            <li>Did a pretty good job softening the baby&#x27;s skin but to minimize the eczema, need to take a collaborative approach with this, skin lotions, and the like.</li>
            <li>It works great, so far he hasn&#x27;t seemed to have any issues with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to have healthy skin, and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you have Eczema then make sure that the bath water is on the warm rather than the hot side.</li>
            <li>and he felt some more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I was too embarrassed of the condition of my skin to leave the house, so I was excited to find this bath treatment available on Prime Now!</li>
            <li>I bought these for convenience but grinding up my own oatmeal in my Magic Bullet is SO MUCH CHEAPER</li>
            <li>I started searching online and was glad to see Aveeno, a brand which I&#x27;d tried for shower gels and heard much good things about, offers an already ground oatmeal powder for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>I chalk it up to a really strong heart and the miracles of God.</li>
            <li>I know you can grind oatmeal in a blender, but doubt the result would be quite as fine or dissolve so easily in the bath.</li>
            <li>After mixing the bath treatment with warm water and sponging it on him, he doesn&#x27;t try to rub nearly as much!  </li>
            <li>No artificial scent or ingredients - just oatmeal ground very fine.</li>
            <li>Although I whizzed up a batch of oatmeal in the blender, finely processing it, my concoction did not mix with the water like the Aveeno product did.</li>
            <li>but still some pieces weren&#x27;t as fine.  </li>
            <li>I also know that if I run out and am in a jam, I can grind up oats really fine</li>
            <li>Husband got this after two wks of struggling and gettting super irritated and uncomefortable!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel super healthy and well taken care of.</li>
            <li>those worried about clumping, they generally go away if you use very warm water for your bath.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Fragrance Free Soothing Bath Treatment.  </li>
            <li>She even requests it so that proves to me it makes it all better.  </li>
            <li>(it looks like light chocolate milk), but she loves the way it makes her feel if she has bug</li>
            <li>It also soothes the skin and makes it feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I tossed this in the tub, filled it, and climbed in.</li>
            <li>I love hot showers in the winter...</li>
            <li>This is a great product for winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The directions indicate that the bath will clean your body while you soak.</li>
            <li>It does work, and you will feel clean and refreshed after your bath.</li>
            <li>Great for dry, itchy skin &amp; eczema.  </li>
            <li>I put it in a bowl with very hot water and whisk it smooth and then add that mixture to the running bath water.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see this Aveeno bath treatment provided some much needed relief with his skin and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I need to use two for a full tub of water.</li>
            <li>BUT NOT BAD.</li>
            <li>If you pour it in while HOT water is started in the tub, it will melt fine even crumble the powder between your fingers.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and love the convenience of ordering several boxes at a time through Amazon prime.</li>
            <li>My son has a mild case of eczema.  </li>
            <li>Prime got it to me really quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and really soothes itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I wish I figured this out with my first born!</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest these products!!!</li>
            <li>Does a great job of removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>She also thinks its fun to sprinkle in the bath herself, since I let her (with supervision) since these come in portioned packets.  </li>
            <li>so I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I used this on my first child with mild eczema.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using this right now</li>
            <li>I run the oatmeal in a lukewarm bath and break up some of the clumps right away when I pour it in.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty good for any itches and rashes due to mosquitoes</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>Has been effective and is working for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin comes out feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Can only assume it works just as well for humans, too! :)</li>
            <li>like I do savoring the hot water.</li>
            <li>She sits for 5- 10 mins for as many nights as necessary before bed and the rash is cured.  </li>
            <li>A combination of daily use of Aquaphor and weekly baths of 3 packets have made him irritation-free for th most part.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li>Aveeno gives a thicker mix in the water, tending to leasve crumps sometimes, which bothered me at first</li>
            <li>I was more than 80% covered back in 1992 when I was first diagnosed.</li>
            <li>but you better believe when I stop using it, the eczema comes back!</li>
            <li>The powder takes a bit to get mixed into the water, but it did make my legs feel much better once I soaked for a while.  </li>
            <li>I also use the ice packs after the bath and use Aveeno Eczema lotion at night and it has helped me so much!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products at lesser cost and found them OK but not quite as effective.  </li>
            <li>I am now managing a severe eczema spots on my third baby and this product keeps his skin clean, itch free, and it is gentle.</li>
            <li>After grinding up about 1 cup of rolled oats in the food processor a few times, I noticed most of oats would get milled to a fine powder</li>
            <li>We live in Costa Rica and my son gets rashes when he sweats, all I need to do is soak him in this product and it instantly goes away instead of becoming a full blown rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if the great price on this product is due to the fact that the bags were not sealed properly, some with holes in them.</li>
            <li>Been using these for a long time and love them well.</li>
            <li>If you are really worried about the clumping, or do not desire a hotter bath, combine the contents of the packet with hot water in a cup with a lid and shake it until it&#x27;s dissolved.</li>
            <li>I developed a severe rash on most of my body that was so itchy I could barely stand it.  </li>
            <li>I itch all over at certain times of the year and this really helps.</li>
            <li>Though its messier, its much cheaper to put oatmeal in nylons or socks and rubberband it for the tub.</li>
            <li>Taking a bath with Aveeno really helps sooth itching from Eczema.</li>
            <li>She has psoriasis and says that this product really helps soothe her discomfort.</li>
            <li>Very pleased,good for you skin..</li>
            <li>It really helps to soothe his itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend has skin which gets irritated when he sweats, which is very often considering he dances so much.</li>
            <li>we used this for my baby, it worked really well.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t really tell if it did anything.</li>
            <li>really well there is no residue.</li>
            <li>and it has made a real difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Doctors said they do not know of anyone who has had as much chemo as me, and to still be living is a miracle.</li>
            <li>Hope this review helps others to maintain this very debilitating condition.</li>
            <li>Lotions hurt him and didn&#x27;t really help and frankly even just the cortizone cream or oatmeal bath alone didn&#x27;t make it go away</li>
            <li>Very soothing to skin.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and softens skin.</li>
            <li>for about 30 minutes caused my intense itching to go away immediately.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>She says this really helps but will not cure it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than I would have liked, but it&#x27;s an Aveeno product</li>
            <li>It is ground finer than other brands, so it become suspended in your bath water better.</li>
            <li>My rash is getting much better and is way less itchy now</li>
            <li>This has been a godsend to me and there most definitely IS a difference between Aveeno brand and the generic!</li>
            <li>The regular bath treatment is the same ingredients as the baby treatment, there is just more of it and its cheaper</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for babies and for anyone with skin problems, eczema, etc.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using in conjunction with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Just be sure to rinse down the tub afterward!</li>
            <li>Even if the item is gentle to sensitive skin, it does not encourage me to keep using because of the residue it leaves on the bath tub.</li>
            <li>This, plus Amazon&#x27;s discounted pricing, make it worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Overall worth the buy...</li>
            <li>Left my baby dry more than ever</li>
            <li>The 8 packettes are packaged in a sturdy box which is easy to store to use as needed and provides at least a week&#x27;s worth of product if you use a packette a day.  </li>
            <li>definitely notice an improvement in the rash area after use.&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent to this packet and the oatmeal dissolves right into the water.</li>
            <li>your skin feels new.</li>
            <li>Simple product that does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Does wonders for kiddos with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>and it really does help calm down my itchy skin.</li>
            <li>and it really helps calm down her itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this product to use with my pet hedgehog (they have very sensitive skin and certain allergies to fragrances).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I was pretty much forced to use this by my lovely mother after I broke out in hives all over my entire body.</li>
            <li>waking up from my nap after using this, not only was I significantly less itchy but many of my hives had begun to fade in appearance.</li>
            <li>I have also used this on my 3 year old niece</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>Son is also looking at food sensitivities for young girl.</li>
            <li>My son is 2 yrs old and has eczema.  </li>
            <li>If there is too much, you can always use 1/2 packet and fold up the remainder for the next bath!</li>
            <li>I continue to use it now because of how soothing it is and how soft it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old son has had eczema since he was a baby and</li>
            <li>Now my three year old has eczema and we use it in her bath water to help reduce inflammation and itching.</li>
            <li>I have been battling my 6 month old daughter&#x27;s eczema and a diaper rash for weeks and couldn&#x27;t get rid of either.</li>
            <li>both problems were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>This aveeno bath treatment helped keep the skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>but my skin does seem sensitive and irritable sometimes</li>
            <li>She uses it for about a week and said it works so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than what it&#x27;s worth though.</li>
            <li>The medication I was taking to counteract the allergic reaction was slow to work, and I needed more immediate relief.</li>
            <li>I first started using this product when I developed unbearably itchy, dry skin during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This product is extremely helpful to calm and relieve itching.</li>
            <li>It left a little bit of extra oatmeal in the bath the first time I used it - which was a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>Keep it on hand, particularly during the summer when sunburn and bugs bites are likely.</li>
            <li>It also left my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>So I keep an extra box on hand now as I have very sensitive skin and can see another flare up happening during allergy season.  </li>
            <li>Found it helpful and left skin soft and silky feeling.  </li>
            <li>Initially it wont have a soothing effect while in the tub, but her skin soaks it up and feels moisturized and soft after.</li>
            <li>After no success with lotions and bath oils, this was the first product to provide me with relief.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OK NOT GREAT</li>
            <li>Great for dry winter months with itchy legs that drive a person crazy.</li>
            <li>Like the other review watch getting in and out of the tub can be very slippery.</li>
            <li>who&#x27;s skin is really itchy due to his allergies.  </li>
            <li>Soothing, thick and rich bath treatment that my daughter loves.  </li>
            <li>I live in Utah, and the winter makes my skin so dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally have sensitive skin, but after an encounter with a particular body spray, my skin broke out in a rash and hives that worsened over the course of a few days.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive, eczema-prone skin that gets extremely itchy in the winter, particularly my legs.</li>
            <li>It has been the only thing to really help knock down the itching!  </li>

            <li> The good news...</li>
            <li> She loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved this bath treatment.</li>
            <li> Loved the aroma and silky smoothness</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the person loved it.  </li>
            <li> good price, too.</li>
            <li> This saves my skin and means that I get to enjoy a warm bath!!!</li>
            <li> Life is good.</li>
            <li> but helps you relax and skin feels good after.</li>
            <li> However, it has been a good addition to his skincare for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this 5 starts, because I&#x27;ve heard good things.</li>
            <li> good shipping times.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath product ever!</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno bath treaments for years and love them!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the oatmeal baths!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING Aveeno is amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for diaper rash.  </li>
            <li> This product works amazing on my daughter.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s as effective for some reason.</li>
            <li> Have to soak in it 15-20 minutes to be effective; also have to stir up powder in bath to dissolve, (might leave ring in tub that can be washed off.)  </li>
            <li> Nice warm soak in it and</li>
            <li> After a nice warm bath with this the scratching stops and she sleeps like a baby.  </li>
            <li> Nice but would prefer a stronger aroma ...</li>
            <li> The content of each package was lumpy and did not blend well in the warm water.</li>
            <li> I fill the baby tub with warm water and this treatment, and use like a sitz bath for baby, even after she outgrew the tub.  </li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t but about 50 cents difference, get the good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> A nice bath soak and it helps my itchy skin.</li>
            <li> After using it though I will probably just try grinding up oatmeal on my own since this seems to be all the product is.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found a nice soak in Aveeno does a world of good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this feels really good and soothes your skin :) give it a try</li>
            <li> excellent product, fast shipping and fantastic and fair price.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and allergies and this stuff is great!.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product I recommend it for light to mild rashes.</li>
            <li> I heard oatmeal in fine powder in a warm bath could help out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I love the Aveeno colloidal oatmeal.</li>
            <li> After just one soak my feet felt so much better.</li>
            <li> This was an okay bath soak product</li>
            <li> I bathed my son using one packet and he was finally able to get some relief.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should sue more then one pack a bath, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything with this at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love a bubble bath</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the next best thing...</li>
            <li> We love using these bath soaks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it has value, but it just seemed to make clumps in the bath tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite Bath soothing.</li>
            <li> I feel more relaxed and my skin is softer.</li>
            <li> Oh, this oatmeal bath makes my skin so silky smooth!  </li>
            <li> Aveeno Bath Treatment keeps my family from itching and we love.</li>
            <li> Make sure you mix it with your water.</li>
            <li> I have been a severe psoriasis suffer (erythrodermic psoriasis) for more than 20 years, and the oatmeal baths are part of my regime (once to twice per week)</li>
            <li> I did more than 10 years of chemo for my severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, which has caused all kinds of problems for me now.</li>
            <li> Did a pretty good job softening the baby&#x27;s skin but to minimize the eczema, need to take a collaborative approach with this, skin lotions, and the like.</li>
            <li> It works great, so far he hasn&#x27;t seemed to have any issues with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to have healthy skin, and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you have Eczema then make sure that the bath water is on the warm rather than the hot side.</li>
            <li> and he felt some more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was too embarrassed of the condition of my skin to leave the house, so I was excited to find this bath treatment available on Prime Now!</li>
            <li> I bought these for convenience but grinding up my own oatmeal in my Magic Bullet is SO MUCH CHEAPER</li>
            <li> I started searching online and was glad to see Aveeno, a brand which I&#x27;d tried for shower gels and heard much good things about, offers an already ground oatmeal powder for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> I chalk it up to a really strong heart and the miracles of God.</li>
            <li> I know you can grind oatmeal in a blender, but doubt the result would be quite as fine or dissolve so easily in the bath.</li>
            <li> After mixing the bath treatment with warm water and sponging it on him, he doesn&#x27;t try to rub nearly as much!  </li>
            <li> No artificial scent or ingredients - just oatmeal ground very fine.</li>
            <li> Although I whizzed up a batch of oatmeal in the blender, finely processing it, my concoction did not mix with the water like the Aveeno product did.</li>
            <li> but still some pieces weren&#x27;t as fine.  </li>
            <li> I also know that if I run out and am in a jam, I can grind up oats really fine</li>
            <li> Husband got this after two wks of struggling and gettting super irritated and uncomefortable!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel super healthy and well taken care of.</li>
            <li> those worried about clumping, they generally go away if you use very warm water for your bath.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Fragrance Free Soothing Bath Treatment.  </li>
            <li> She even requests it so that proves to me it makes it all better.  </li>
            <li> (it looks like light chocolate milk), but she loves the way it makes her feel if she has bug</li>
            <li> It also soothes the skin and makes it feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I tossed this in the tub, filled it, and climbed in.</li>
            <li> I love hot showers in the winter...</li>
            <li> This is a great product for winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The directions indicate that the bath will clean your body while you soak.</li>
            <li> It does work, and you will feel clean and refreshed after your bath.</li>
            <li> Great for dry, itchy skin &amp; eczema.  </li>
            <li> I put it in a bowl with very hot water and whisk it smooth and then add that mixture to the running bath water.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to see this Aveeno bath treatment provided some much needed relief with his skin and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need to use two for a full tub of water.</li>
            <li> BUT NOT BAD.</li>
            <li> If you pour it in while HOT water is started in the tub, it will melt fine even crumble the powder between your fingers.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and love the convenience of ordering several boxes at a time through Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> My son has a mild case of eczema.  </li>
            <li> Prime got it to me really quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and really soothes itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I figured this out with my first born!</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest these products!!!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> She also thinks its fun to sprinkle in the bath herself, since I let her (with supervision) since these come in portioned packets.  </li>
            <li> so I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this on my first child with mild eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using this right now</li>
            <li> I run the oatmeal in a lukewarm bath and break up some of the clumps right away when I pour it in.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty good for any itches and rashes due to mosquitoes</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> Has been effective and is working for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin comes out feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Can only assume it works just as well for humans, too! :)</li>
            <li> like I do savoring the hot water.</li>
            <li> She sits for 5- 10 mins for as many nights as necessary before bed and the rash is cured.  </li>
            <li> A combination of daily use of Aquaphor and weekly baths of 3 packets have made him irritation-free for th most part.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li> Aveeno gives a thicker mix in the water, tending to leasve crumps sometimes, which bothered me at first</li>
            <li> I was more than 80% covered back in 1992 when I was first diagnosed.</li>
            <li> but you better believe when I stop using it, the eczema comes back!</li>
            <li> The powder takes a bit to get mixed into the water, but it did make my legs feel much better once I soaked for a while.  </li>
            <li> I also use the ice packs after the bath and use Aveeno Eczema lotion at night and it has helped me so much!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products at lesser cost and found them OK but not quite as effective.  </li>
            <li> I am now managing a severe eczema spots on my third baby and this product keeps his skin clean, itch free, and it is gentle.</li>
            <li> After grinding up about 1 cup of rolled oats in the food processor a few times, I noticed most of oats would get milled to a fine powder</li>
            <li> We live in Costa Rica and my son gets rashes when he sweats, all I need to do is soak him in this product and it instantly goes away instead of becoming a full blown rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if the great price on this product is due to the fact that the bags were not sealed properly, some with holes in them.</li>
            <li> Been using these for a long time and love them well.</li>
            <li> If you are really worried about the clumping, or do not desire a hotter bath, combine the contents of the packet with hot water in a cup with a lid and shake it until it&#x27;s dissolved.</li>
            <li> I developed a severe rash on most of my body that was so itchy I could barely stand it.  </li>
            <li> I itch all over at certain times of the year and this really helps.</li>
            <li> Though its messier, its much cheaper to put oatmeal in nylons or socks and rubberband it for the tub.</li>
            <li> Taking a bath with Aveeno really helps sooth itching from Eczema.</li>
            <li> She has psoriasis and says that this product really helps soothe her discomfort.</li>
            <li> Very pleased,good for you skin..</li>
            <li> It really helps to soothe his itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend has skin which gets irritated when he sweats, which is very often considering he dances so much.</li>
            <li> we used this for my baby, it worked really well.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t really tell if it did anything.</li>
            <li> really well there is no residue.</li>
            <li> and it has made a real difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing to itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Doctors said they do not know of anyone who has had as much chemo as me, and to still be living is a miracle.</li>
            <li> Hope this review helps others to maintain this very debilitating condition.</li>
            <li> Lotions hurt him and didn&#x27;t really help and frankly even just the cortizone cream or oatmeal bath alone didn&#x27;t make it go away</li>
            <li> Very soothing to skin.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and softens skin.</li>
            <li> for about 30 minutes caused my intense itching to go away immediately.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> She says this really helps but will not cure it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than I would have liked, but it&#x27;s an Aveeno product</li>
            <li> It is ground finer than other brands, so it become suspended in your bath water better.</li>
            <li> My rash is getting much better and is way less itchy now</li>
            <li> This has been a godsend to me and there most definitely IS a difference between Aveeno brand and the generic!</li>
            <li> The regular bath treatment is the same ingredients as the baby treatment, there is just more of it and its cheaper</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for babies and for anyone with skin problems, eczema, etc.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using in conjunction with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Just be sure to rinse down the tub afterward!</li>
            <li> Even if the item is gentle to sensitive skin, it does not encourage me to keep using because of the residue it leaves on the bath tub.</li>
            <li> This, plus Amazon&#x27;s discounted pricing, make it worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Overall worth the buy...</li>
            <li> Left my baby dry more than ever</li>
            <li> The 8 packettes are packaged in a sturdy box which is easy to store to use as needed and provides at least a week&#x27;s worth of product if you use a packette a day.  </li>
            <li> definitely notice an improvement in the rash area after use.&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent to this packet and the oatmeal dissolves right into the water.</li>
            <li> your skin feels new.</li>
            <li> Simple product that does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for kiddos with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> and it really does help calm down my itchy skin.</li>
            <li> and it really helps calm down her itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product to use with my pet hedgehog (they have very sensitive skin and certain allergies to fragrances).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was pretty much forced to use this by my lovely mother after I broke out in hives all over my entire body.</li>
            <li> waking up from my nap after using this, not only was I significantly less itchy but many of my hives had begun to fade in appearance.</li>
            <li> I have also used this on my 3 year old niece</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> Son is also looking at food sensitivities for young girl.</li>
            <li> My son is 2 yrs old and has eczema.  </li>
            <li> If there is too much, you can always use 1/2 packet and fold up the remainder for the next bath!</li>
            <li> I continue to use it now because of how soothing it is and how soft it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son has had eczema since he was a baby and</li>
            <li> Now my three year old has eczema and we use it in her bath water to help reduce inflammation and itching.</li>
            <li> I have been battling my 6 month old daughter&#x27;s eczema and a diaper rash for weeks and couldn&#x27;t get rid of either.</li>
            <li> both problems were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> This aveeno bath treatment helped keep the skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> but my skin does seem sensitive and irritable sometimes</li>
            <li> She uses it for about a week and said it works so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than what it&#x27;s worth though.</li>
            <li> The medication I was taking to counteract the allergic reaction was slow to work, and I needed more immediate relief.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product when I developed unbearably itchy, dry skin during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely helpful to calm and relieve itching.</li>
            <li> It left a little bit of extra oatmeal in the bath the first time I used it - which was a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> Keep it on hand, particularly during the summer when sunburn and bugs bites are likely.</li>
            <li> It also left my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> So I keep an extra box on hand now as I have very sensitive skin and can see another flare up happening during allergy season.  </li>
            <li> Found it helpful and left skin soft and silky feeling.  </li>
            <li> Initially it wont have a soothing effect while in the tub, but her skin soaks it up and feels moisturized and soft after.</li>
            <li> After no success with lotions and bath oils, this was the first product to provide me with relief.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK NOT GREAT</li>
            <li> Great for dry winter months with itchy legs that drive a person crazy.</li>
            <li> Like the other review watch getting in and out of the tub can be very slippery.</li>
            <li> who&#x27;s skin is really itchy due to his allergies.  </li>
            <li> Soothing, thick and rich bath treatment that my daughter loves.  </li>
            <li> I live in Utah, and the winter makes my skin so dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally have sensitive skin, but after an encounter with a particular body spray, my skin broke out in a rash and hives that worsened over the course of a few days.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive, eczema-prone skin that gets extremely itchy in the winter, particularly my legs.</li>
            <li> It has been the only thing to really help knock down the itching!  </li>
            <li> and before it was time for her to get out of the tub, I washed her with the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Body Wash with Natural Oatmeal.</li>
            <li> My legs started feeling a bit itchy a few months ago, so I bought this for the bath hoping to get my legs back to normal.  </li>
            <li> When a loved one was suffering with very painful blisters from shingles, I had been researching what natural methods could help alleviate the pain and speed up the skin healing.  </li>
            <li> within a matter of a few days the eczema was almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> (Anything serious should be consulted with dermatologist first)</li>
            <li> The other day I started breaking out in tiny red itchy bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time already.</li>
            <li> I gave my son multiple bathes using this product and each time his rash would look less red</li>
            <li> My son got bite several times at the river the other day and was itching and scratching by nightfall.</li>
            <li> I use this in my son&#x27;s bath water, and this was actually all I used while he was really little because it actually cleans and moisturizes the skin by just being in it and moving the water.</li>
            <li> This stuff plus Aveeno&#x27;s Eczema lotion help me get through dry winters without scratching my skin off.</li>
            <li> and it helps quite a bit with his dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry skin, itchy seasonal allergy skin, and for eczema.</li>
            <li> If you or your child has dry skin or allergies</li>
            <li> Our son has dry skin and it does not help he is a swimmer, Aveeno oatmeal bath has helped his skin to stay moisturized after practice in the chlorinated pools.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, so I like using this product when I have irritation or ichyness.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; and his dry skin.</li>
            <li> Does not cure, but certainly helps make a necessary evil (bath taking for kids with eczema) more tolerable.  </li>
            <li> So soothing on dry sensitve skin!</li>
            <li> If suffer from itchy dry skin, this is a must!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra on this powdered colloidal oatmeal soak.</li>
            <li> only other issue is that it doesn&#x27;t break down in the water as well as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way cheaper, obviously, but so messy</li>
            <li> Did not really help with my itchy symptoms.</li>
            <li> She occured a breakout due to an unknown cause</li>
            <li> It has NO nasty chemicals that are bad for sensitive baby skin, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the baby shampoos and stuff that have bad chemicals and fragrance in them.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my other infant son.</li>
            <li> These are so helpful for hives or other itching.</li>
            <li> So soothing for my son who has extreme eczema.</li>
            <li> It has no smell or any other harmful inactive ingredient, so that was a plus due to her skin</li>
            <li> The doctors always said to use Vaseline or other petroleum based products but that never helped.</li>
            <li> Now I just use the oatmeal bath on him every other night and it keeps it away</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter, who is troubled by constant itching due to eczema.</li>
            <li> Day one down</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I rubbed her down with the Aveeno Skin Relief 24 Hour Moisturizing Lotion.</li>
            <li> to help keep the scales smoothed down and under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Soothing Bath Treatment for previous skin problems</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS - you can get this for much less at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> We just put a quarter to half a pack in each time he bathes and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I ordered it very late at night, along with other Aveeno skin relief products and they were all on my doorstep the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the tub a grimy mess</li>
            <li> My wife bought this after getting pregnant about 8 months she started getting an allergic reaction on her feet and some really bad itching.</li>
            <li> We have a itchy little girl who scratches all the time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;15-20 minutes seems to do the trick with a little bit of epsom salt tossed in too.</li>
            <li> It is a little cumbersome to do it that way</li>
            <li> I had a few packets of this stuff from my friend.</li>
            <li> A FEW TIMES FOR MY SKIN .</li>
            <li> Expensive though &amp; found the same thing (store brand) at my grocery store for half the price.</li>
            <li> i use a small amount in a foot basin for my feet.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I have.</li>
            <li> No more chemotherapy for me.</li>
            <li> not sure and</li>
            <li> usually 20-25.  </li>
            <li> I also soak in Dead Sea salt three times per week, and I use a cold pressed coconut oil to put on topically.</li>
            <li> I have her soak her eczema in it for at least 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I soak for at least 15 minutes but</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, and uncomfortable and itchy to say the least, and I really did not feel like taking a bath in my uncomfortable state.</li>
            <li> Both boys have dry skin problems and get eczema in severe cold weather.</li>
            <li> Seriously, for everything that makes your skin itch, this provides relief.</li>
            <li> Especially my poor 8 year old.</li>
            <li> Some issues with the oatmeal clumping if just &amp;#34;dumped&amp;#34; into the tub but slow shakes and mixing the water helps!</li>
            <li> Having dry, itchy skin is distracting and annoying - makes me cranky.</li>
            <li> This is too expensive for oatmeal to me.  </li>
            <li> After taking them to the doctors, they were still horribly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any weird additives.</li>
            <li> During the cold winter months I use this product to keep his skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Had bad skin problem, and this was recommended by doctor.  </li>
            <li> I had this bad reaction to an antibiotic, where I had a bad rash with hives.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s bad for my skin.</li>
            <li> Helped soothe kids skin after some bad mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> It was awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> perfect for winter skin</li>
            <li> These are pretty good for any itches and rashes due to mosquitoes</li>
            <li> This is too expensive for oatmeal to me.  Though its messier, its much cheaper to put oatmeal in nylons or socks and rubberband it for the tub.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and really soothes itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to buy oatmeal for the bath. I thought I could do it myself. Although I whizzed up a batch of oatmeal in the blender, finely processing it, my concoction did not mix with the water like the Aveeno product did. Mine clumped where Aveeno mixed well, making a &amp;#34;milky,&amp;#34; soothing bath.</li>
            <li> Taking a bath with Aveeno really helps sooth itching from Eczema. Simple product that does exactly what it says. The powder in the Aveeno product is finer and dissolves easier than the generic brands. This, plus Amazon&#x27;s discounted pricing, make it worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and love the convenience of ordering several boxes at a time through Amazon prime. I have dry, sensitive, eczema-prone skin that gets extremely itchy in the winter, particularly my legs. Everyone knows oatmeal helps soothe itchies, and I have used &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; oatmeal in baths before. It&#x27;s way cheaper, obviously, but so messy and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s as effective for some reason. It could just be a placebo affect... but I don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra on this powdered colloidal oatmeal soak. It doesn&#x27;t make the tub a grimy mess and it really does help calm down my itchy skin. Will continue to purchase! This stuff plus Aveeno&#x27;s Eczema lotion help me get through dry winters without scratching my skin off.</li>
            <li> Did a pretty good job softening the baby&#x27;s skin but to minimize the eczema, need to take a collaborative approach with this, skin lotions, and the like. Also, it recommends babies to sit in a bath for over 20 minutes - can be quite the task with a fussy baby.</li>
            <li> Had bad skin problem, and this was recommended by doctor.  It works great.</li>
            <li> i use a small amount in a foot basin for my feet.  Does a great job of removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the stuff and uses it regularly.  She has psoriasis and says that this product really helps soothe her discomfort.</li>
            <li> I use this product in every bath. My skin comes out feeling soft and smooth. This product was recommended to me years ago by an MD and it is still the best.</li>
            <li> My son has a mild case of eczema.  During the cold winter months I use this product to keep his skin moisturized.  The summer months in the pool also require this product to keep his skin moisturized.  I also use this on my other infant son.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if the great price on this product is due to the fact that the bags were not sealed properly, some with holes in them. My box arrived with oatmeal all over it. I don&#x27;t mind buying factory rejects, but I&#x27;d like to know that that is what I&#x27;m getting before I order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I love the Aveeno colloidal oatmeal. It is ground finer than other brands, so it become suspended in your bath water better.</li>
            <li> My son is prone to diaper rash so we pour a packet into his bath at night.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely notice an improvement in the rash area after use.&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent to this packet and the oatmeal dissolves right into the water. This is a staple in our bathroom closet.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Fragrance Free Soothing Bath Treatment.  I used this bath powder treatment after rashes from reactions to Antibiotics.  Found it helpful and left skin soft and silky feeling.  Have to soak in it 15-20 minutes to be effective; also have to stir up powder in bath to dissolve, (might leave ring in tub that can be washed off.)  P Baum</li>
            <li> Great to help with chickenpox.</li>
            <li> Great for dry winter months with itchy legs that drive a person crazy.</li>
            <li> As of today, this one is \\&quot;best priced\\&quot; at 80cents per 42 gram packet if ordered on \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; basis.  8-17-11 comment.</li>
            <li> These are so helpful for hives or other itching.</li>
            <li> Very nice bath treatment. Worked well with eczema.</li>
            <li> I itch all over at certain times of the year and this really helps. No clumps if you keep stirring or use a strainer and sift it in. Like the other review watch getting in and out of the tub can be very slippery. The good news... if you do fall and knock yourself unconscious the itching goes away!</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product to use with my pet hedgehog (they have very sensitive skin and certain allergies to fragrances). It works great, so far he hasn&#x27;t seemed to have any issues with it and it helps quite a bit with his dry skin. Can only assume it works just as well for humans, too! :)</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as her skin had been itching a lot. She loved it.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING Aveeno is amazing on my skin. I have sensitive skin and allergies and this stuff is great!. Nice warm soak in it and your skin feels new. My son got bite several times at the river the other day and was itching and scratching by nightfall. I suggested a bath with this and he said the itching stopped.</li>
            <li> Used it in my 8mo baby bath to help with the eczema but it didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Did not really help with my itchy symptoms. I had to use two packets at the same time but the amount is still not enough. Need to use anti-itch cream instead.</li>
            <li> Very pleased,good for you skin..</li>
            <li> Having dry, itchy skin is distracting and annoying - makes me cranky. This product provides immediate relief, and is pleasant to use. No artificial scent or ingredients - just oatmeal ground very fine. I know you can grind oatmeal in a blender, but doubt the result would be quite as fine or dissolve so easily in the bath. I look forward to this bath each morning, and find that my skin appreciates the care. It&#x27;s important to have healthy skin, and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Left my baby dry more than ever</li>
            <li> Did not know what to expect as dealing with itchy Eczema flares proved to be illusive. However, this product did help to contain the situation without adding complications. If you have Eczema then make sure that the bath water is on the warm rather than the hot side. Soaking for 10-15 minutes with the oatmeal provides a level of relief that is welcome. Moisturizing the skin after the soak is a must.</li>
            <li> Amazing! So soothing for my son who has extreme eczema. Ge used to scream every time he had a bath. Now he will actually stay in and play.</li>
            <li> I have been quite satisfies with this product. I bought this for my 7 year old daughter, who is troubled by constant itching due to eczema. The soothing bath has eased her itching to quite and extent and provided some degree of relief. People with similar problem, can give it a try. If not fully, you may see a noticeable difference in easing your problem.</li>
            <li> Soothing, thick and rich bath treatment that my daughter loves.  We have a itchy little girl who scratches all the time.  After a nice warm bath with this the scratching stops and she sleeps like a baby.  She even requests it so that proves to me it makes it all better.  Staple in our house from now on.</li>
            <li> Nice but would prefer a stronger aroma ... only other issue is that it doesn&#x27;t break down in the water as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry skin, itchy seasonal allergy skin, and for eczema. I have also used this on my 3 year old niece and it really helps calm down her itchy skin. If you or your child has dry skin or allergies I would recommend having a box on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> My diabetic feet itch all the time. I couldn&#x27;t seem to find any product to give me relief. Then I remember about Aveeno Soothing Bath. I ordered a box from Amazon . After just one soak my feet felt so much better.</li>
            <li> This was an okay bath soak product but I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it can be a bit lumpy.</li>
            <li> My hubby and son recently came into contact with Poison Oak. It was awful! After taking them to the doctors, they were still horribly uncomfortable. Especially my poor 8 year old. He couldn&#x27;t sleep and would cry at night from the rash. I had a few packets of this stuff from my friend. I bathed my son using one packet and he was finally able to get some relief. I ordered 2 boxes of the Aveeno Soothing Bath Treatment, with next day delivery from Amazon Prime. I gave my son multiple bathes using this product and each time his rash would look less red and he felt some more comfortable. Anytime the icth would get out of control we would run him a bath. I would  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good for dry skin. This helped me with the itchiness during pregnancy. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than what it&#x27;s worth though.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for kiddos with sensitive skin! #loveit</li>
            <li> When this product arrived, the box looked like it was once opened and resealed.  The content of each package was lumpy and did not blend well in the warm water. Even if the item is gentle to sensitive skin, it does not encourage me to keep using because of the residue it leaves on the bath tub.</li>
            <li> The other day I started breaking out in tiny red itchy bumps. I had no idea what caused them but I knew immediately what would help. I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Soothing Bath Treatment for previous skin problems so I went to the local pharmacy and bought  a box of 8 packets. Worked like a charm. Calms the skin and keeps the itch away. Keep it on hand, particularly during the summer when sunburn and bugs bites are likely.</li>
            <li> I bought these for convenience but grinding up my own oatmeal in my Magic Bullet is SO MUCH CHEAPER and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any weird additives.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely helpful to calm and relieve itching. I had this bad reaction to an antibiotic, where I had a bad rash with hives. This product was helpful in easing the itching, redness and swelling that I was dealing with.</li>
            <li> This is very good to put into your bath for your skin.  Hopefully it will come back to Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> Does not dissolve as stated!</li>
            <li> Does not cure, but certainly helps make a necessary evil (bath taking for kids with eczema) more tolerable.  We would not bathe without it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should sue more then one pack a bath, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything with this at all. my skin felt no change.</li>
            <li> I loved this bath treatment. I was really surprised. Loved the aroma and silky smoothness it gave to the water. I&#x27;ll use it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the person loved it.  I have a box, too and plan to use it in the tub soon.  good price, too.</li>
            <li> Bought for grandchildren. Has been effective and is working for very dry skin. Son is also looking at food sensitivities for young girl.</li>
            <li> Our son has dry skin and it does not help he is a swimmer, Aveeno oatmeal bath has helped his skin to stay moisturized after practice in the chlorinated pools.</li>
            <li> great for my sons exzama</li>
            <li> So soothing on dry sensitve skin! I love hot showers in the winter... I know it&#x27;s bad for my skin. I know it dries my skin out and I know I shouldn&#x27;t stand there like I do savoring the hot water. But I do - every time. This saves my skin and means that I get to enjoy a warm bath!!! Life is good.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I have. But there red itchy patchy bumps. Itch like craaaazy! Husband got this after two wks of struggling and gettting super irritated and uncomefortable! Helps relieve the itching and clears the bumps up after one use. Hopfully goes away soon! Day one down</li>
            <li> I bathe in this product daily and have for years....excellent product, fast shipping and fantastic and fair price.  I will order again at this price</li>
            <li> Great for treating insect bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter doesn&#x27;t like the way that the water looks (it looks like light chocolate milk), but she loves the way it makes her feel if she has bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15-20 minutes seems to do the trick with a little bit of epsom salt tossed in too.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for diaper rash.  I fill the baby tub with warm water and this treatment, and use like a sitz bath for baby, even after she outgrew the tub.  She sits for 5- 10 mins for as many nights as necessary before bed and the rash is cured.  I wish I figured this out with my first born!</li>
            <li> Been using these for a long time and love them well. Each bath I take for sore back, an extra bath after gardening or running errands in the summer, whatever, I use the oatmeal packets and feel soothed and radiant after I get out.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS ITEM . I USED IT A FEW TIMES FOR MY SKIN . IT&#x27;S OK NOT GREAT BUT NOT BAD.</li>
            <li> I love a bubble bath but my skin does not, so I found this it&#x27;s the next best thing...no bubbles but helps you relax and skin feels good after.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath product ever! My skin feels so wonderful after using it, even if I was practically an alligator to start off with. I always have a stock of it at my house. It goes best with candles, trashy magazines, and a fuzzy robe to wear after use.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel good all over!</li>
            <li> My son is 2 yrs old and has eczema.  We have used this product since he was born.  It really helps to soothe his itchy skin.</li>
            <li> One customer said that it is \\&quot;too thick\\&quot; and another \\&quot;clumpy\\&quot;.  If you pour it in while HOT water is started in the tub, it will melt fine even crumble the powder between your fingers. If there is too much, you can always use 1/2 packet and fold up the remainder for the next bath! Do remember to stir it around on the bottom of your tub prior to getting in, as it can make the floor slippery!  This has been a godsend to me and there most definitely IS a difference between Aveeno brand and the generic! There really isn&#x27;t but about 50 cents difference, get the good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> We love using these bath soaks. Boyfriend has skin which gets irritated when he sweats, which is very often considering he dances so much. A combination of daily use of Aquaphor and weekly baths of 3 packets have made him irritation-free for th most part. Of course, we still have to watch out for animal fur, fragranced beauty products, etc. However, it has been a good addition to his skincare for years. Thanks Aveeno!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this 5 starts, because I&#x27;ve heard good things. I haven&#x27;t used it yet though!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great for adults and children.  Very gentle.</li>
            <li> we used this for my baby, it worked really well.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t really tell if it did anything. I&#x27;m a big fan of Aveeno products so I&#x27;m sure it has value, but it just seemed to make clumps in the bath tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - you can get this for much less at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> This products helps a lot with baby excema!</li>
            <li> My favorite Bath soothing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time already. Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> I use this in my son&#x27;s bath water, and this was actually all I used while he was really little because it actually cleans and moisturizes the skin by just being in it and moving the water. It has NO nasty chemicals that are bad for sensitive baby skin, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the baby shampoos and stuff that have bad chemicals and fragrance in them. I highly recommend this for babies and for anyone with skin problems, eczema, etc. So good!</li>
            <li> These are great!! I actually use them for my horse who&#x27;s skin is really itchy due to his allergies.  Makes a massive difference! After mixing the bath treatment with warm water and sponging it on him, he doesn&#x27;t try to rub nearly as much!  Can&#x27;t say how it works on humans, but can only imagine that it would help as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno bath treaments for years and love them!  Great for poison ivy and all kinds of skin irritations!  Just be sure to rinse down the tub afterward!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last 3 to 4 years.  I&#x27;ve used other products at lesser cost and found them OK but not quite as effective.  Aveeno gives a thicker mix in the water, tending to leasve crumps sometimes, which bothered me at first but they are readily crushed and gives soothing effects if pushed directly against affected area/s.</li>
            <li> Helped soothe kids skin after some bad mosquito bites. Now they always ask for oatmeal bath</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, so I like using this product when I have irritation or ichyness. It makes the bath water smell awesome! It left a little bit of extra oatmeal in the bath the first time I used it - which was a pain to clean. But I figured if I just stir in the product really well there is no residue. Overall worth the buy... Prime got it to me really quickly. I live in Utah, and the winter makes my skin so dry. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing on my daughter. She occured a breakout due to an unknown cause and I decided to buy this for her. I let her soak in this treatment for about 15 minutes and before it was time for her to get out of the tub, I washed her with the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Body Wash with Natural Oatmeal. Afterwards, I rubbed her down with the Aveeno Skin Relief 24 Hour Moisturizing Lotion. She no longer complains of itching and irritation. It has no smell or any other harmful inactive ingredient, so that was a plus due to her skin being irritated. I would highly suggest these products!!!</li>
            <li> If suffer from itchy dry skin, this is a must!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for 2 weeks and it has made a real difference in the way my skin feels. I feel more relaxed and my skin is softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using this right now but I plan to use it on an irregular basis. It&#x27;s a wonderful skin calmer. Found it not advisable to soak in the tub with Eczema. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have my daughter take baths in this when her eczema flares up. Initially it wont have a soothing effect while in the tub, but her skin soaks it up and feels moisturized and soft after. I have her soak her eczema in it for at least 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin softer than it&#x27;s ever been!  The softness lasts all day.  Makes your skin feel super healthy and well taken care of.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for winter dry skin.  I thought I had to be getting a deal on Amazon but found out I could buy this for $2 cheaper at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I recently had an allergic reaction to a medication and used several boxes of it! I had hives for over a week. It is very soothing to itchy skin. It also left my skin feeling very soft. I had never used the oatmeal bath treatment before. I continue to use it now because of how soothing it is and how soft it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> Oh, this oatmeal bath makes my skin so silky smooth!  The box says it is for itchy skin or rashes but honestly, I just use it to pamper myself!</li>
            <li> Yes. Aveeno Bath Treatment keeps my family from itching and we love.</li>
            <li> It is a soothing bath and cleaner, in one. The directions indicate that the bath will clean your body while you soak. This is without a lot of scrubbing and rinsing. It does work, and you will feel clean and refreshed after your bath. Just add the product to your bath water as you are filling the tub.</li>
            <li> Has helped solve our baby&#x27;s persistent eczema. Using this with the Aveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream has helped reduce our baby&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help with my eczema. Works well. Make sure you mix it with your water. It did help with my itching.</li>
            <li> Love the oatmeal baths! I have been a severe psoriasis suffer (erythrodermic psoriasis) for more than 20 years, and the oatmeal baths are part of my regime (once to twice per week) to help keep the scales smoothed down and under control. I also soak in Dead Sea salt three times per week, and I use a cold pressed coconut oil to put on topically. No more chemotherapy for me. I did more than 10 years of chemo for my severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, which has caused all kinds of problems for me now. (The last one, Remicade, which caused drug-induced Lupus.) Been chemo-free since 2007. The chemo was only a temporary fix to a chronic disease. I was more than 80% covered back in 1992 when I was first diagnosed. I looked like a leper. Doctors said they do not know of anyone who has had as much chemo as me, and to still be living is a miracle. I chalk it up to a really strong heart and the miracles of God. Hope this review helps others to maintain this very debilitating condition. I have given my regime to a couple dozen people over the years, and they all say it definitely helps them.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son has had eczema since he was a baby and this product along with cortizone cream has been the only thing to make it go away. The doctors always said to use Vaseline or other petroleum based products but that never helped. Lotions hurt him and didn&#x27;t really help and frankly even just the cortizone cream or oatmeal bath alone didn&#x27;t make it go away either but when I used the two products together.... within a matter of a few days the eczema was almost completely gone! Now I just use the oatmeal bath on him every other night and it keeps it away but you better believe when I stop using it, the eczema comes back! The regular bath treatment is the same ingredients as the baby treatment, there is just more of it and its cheaper so it works best for me.</li>
            <li> The only things that soothe my daughter&#x27;s eczema outbreaks at bay and soothes them when inevitable!  She also thinks its fun to sprinkle in the bath herself, since I let her (with supervision) since these come in portioned packets.  I highly recommend using in conjunction with [[ASIN:B003O7IBZC Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 7.3 oz.]]!</li>
            <li> I first started using this product when I developed unbearably itchy, dry skin during my pregnancy. After no success with lotions and bath oils, this was the first product to provide me with relief. Now my three year old has eczema and we use it in her bath water to help reduce inflammation and itching.</li>
            <li> We have a child with eczema. This stuff is AMAZING at helping relive the dryness and itchiness of it! We just put a quarter to half a pack in each time he bathes and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> We live in Costa Rica and my son gets rashes when he sweats, all I need to do is soak him in this product and it instantly goes away instead of becoming a full blown rash.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; and his dry skin. He uses it every night! I should have ordered extra so he&#x27;d have a never ending supply.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to skin. Some issues with the oatmeal clumping if just &amp;#34;dumped&amp;#34; into the tub but slow shakes and mixing the water helps!</li>
            <li> When a loved one was suffering with very painful blisters from shingles, I had been researching what natural methods could help alleviate the pain and speed up the skin healing.  I heard oatmeal in fine powder in a warm bath could help out.  After grinding up about 1 cup of rolled oats in the food processor a few times, I noticed most of oats would get milled to a fine powder but still some pieces weren&#x27;t as fine.  I started searching online and was glad to see Aveeno, a brand which I&#x27;d tried for shower gels and heard much good things about, offers an already ground oatmeal powder for this purpose.  The 8 packettes are packaged in a sturdy box which is easy to store to use as needed and provides at least a week&#x27;s worth of product if you use a packette a day.  I was glad to see this Aveeno bath treatment provided some much needed relief with his skin and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were prescribed to me years back by my dermatologist when I had a side effect rash to a skin cream. While taking Allegra orally and using 1 bath a day, my rash disappeared within a week. Remembering that, I used this when I formed a heat rash and it worked again. It also soothes the skin and makes it feel smooth. It&#x27;s a great product I recommend it for light to mild rashes. (Anything serious should be consulted with dermatologist first)</li>
            <li> A nice bath soak and it helps my itchy skin. After using it though I will probably just try grinding up oatmeal on my own since this seems to be all the product is.</li>
            <li> Great for dry, itchy skin &amp; eczema.  Use it for myself &amp; my toddler.  Expensive though &amp; found the same thing (store brand) at my grocery store for half the price.</li>
            <li> .Great product, has helped greatly with my ezema</li>
            <li> I have been battling my 6 month old daughter&#x27;s eczema and a diaper rash for weeks and couldn&#x27;t get rid of either. I used this along with the lotion and by the following morning both problems were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> My legs started feeling a bit itchy a few months ago, so I bought this for the bath hoping to get my legs back to normal.  The powder takes a bit to get mixed into the water, but it did make my legs feel much better once I soaked for a while.  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than I would have liked, but it&#x27;s an Aveeno product so I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Both boys have dry skin problems and get eczema in severe cold weather. This aveeno bath treatment helped keep the skin soft and moist. Product lives up to all the claims.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have rashes or any severe medical issue like that but my skin does seem sensitive and irritable sometimes and I&#x27;ve found a nice soak in Aveeno does a world of good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the trick to Aveeno is to pre-mix.  If you just toss it into the bathwater that will work but it is a bit lumpy that way.  I put it in a bowl with very hot water and whisk it smooth and then add that mixture to the running bath water.  It is a little cumbersome to do it that way but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used it for a severe rash. Worked wonderfully. It is very soothing and softens skin.</li>
            <li> as described. good shipping times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally have sensitive skin, but after an encounter with a particular body spray, my skin broke out in a rash and hives that worsened over the course of a few days. The medication I was taking to counteract the allergic reaction was slow to work, and I needed more immediate relief. I was too embarrassed of the condition of my skin to leave the house, so I was excited to find this bath treatment available on Prime Now! I ordered it very late at night, along with other Aveeno skin relief products and they were all on my doorstep the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking for about 30 minutes caused my intense itching to go away immediately. Love this product! It will be my go-to if I ever have any king of itchiness or irritation in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those worried about clumping, they generally go away if you use very warm water for your bath. If you are really worried about the clumping, or do not desire a hotter bath, combine the contents of the packet with hot water in a cup with a lid and shake it until it&#x27;s dissolved. Then pour that into your bath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was pretty much forced to use this by my lovely mother after I broke out in hives all over my entire body. I was skeptical, and uncomfortable and itchy to say the least, and I really did not feel like taking a bath in my uncomfortable state. Regardless, I tossed this in the tub, filled it, and climbed in. The bath itself was just a bath, and once I got out I climbed into bed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon waking up from my nap after using this, not only was I significantly less itchy but many of my hives had begun to fade in appearance. It was brilliant. I imagine the results would vary between folks but if you&#x27;re itchy and hivey, I would definitely recommend this. Hopefully this never happens again but if it does, I know what to use.</li>
            <li> I developed a severe rash on most of my body that was so itchy I could barely stand it.  I didn&#x27;t know where it came from, allergies, infection..not sure and the doc&#x27;s didn&#x27;t know either.  I started taking 3 antihistimines (per my doc) and using ice packs.  I found a package of this in my linen closet and thought I would give it a try.  It has been the only thing to really help knock down the itching!  I have been taking an oatmeal bath now twice a day, once in the am and once in the pm before bed.  I also use the ice packs after the bath and use Aveeno Eczema lotion at night and it has helped me so much!  I run the oatmeal in a lukewarm bath and break up some of the clumps right away when I pour it in.  I soak for at least 15 minutes but usually 20-25.  My rash is getting much better and is way less itchy now and I&#x27;ve been so thankful for this product!!  I also know that if I run out and am in a jam, I can grind up oats really fine and it would work too.  But I find this easier and know that it works well.  So I keep an extra box on hand now as I have very sensitive skin and can see another flare up happening during allergy season.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  Seriously, for everything that makes your skin itch, this provides relief.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this after getting pregnant about 8 months she started getting an allergic reaction on her feet and some really bad itching. She says this really helps but will not cure it. She uses it for about a week and said it works so far.</li>
            <li> this feels really good and soothes your skin :) give it a try</li>
            <li> Was a gift. Recipient Loves it!</li>
            <li> The best product on the market to help soothe itchy eczematous skin, even during flares.  Sometimes I need to use two for a full tub of water.</li>
            <li> I used this on my first child with mild eczema. I contribute the mildness to the use of this product for daily baths followed by a moisturizer. I am now managing a severe eczema spots on my third baby and this product keeps his skin clean, itch free, and it is gentle. I use this is our regular routine for babys bathing or as needed. Thank you Aveeno!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure my son’s eczema, but it definitely helps alleviate his itchiness.</li>
            <li> Helps my granddaughter&#x27;s dermatitis. That&#x27;s what matters to me.</li>
