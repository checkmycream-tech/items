            <li>Which I toned down with a purple toner and now it is a lovely blonde.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) I use the White Chocolate to hold me over and it covers VERY WELL for someone who&#x27;s hair is naturally as dark as mine.  </li>
            <li>It took me about 20-25 minutes to complete the application so some areas of my hair had  60 minutes of contact with the product.</li>

            <li> I am dark blonde naturally.  </li>
            <li> My hair is the same condition as before I bleached it &amp; it left very little red left in my hair after (not much red).</li>
            <li> Other hair colors have left my hair orange-Garnier White Chocolate and other permanent hair colors.  </li>
            <li> Even though I have tried to bleach my own hair in the past and gotten some scary (bright orange) results, I decided to give it another try and maybe spare myself a long, uncomfortable, and expensive salon</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde/light brown hair that I have been lightening to bleach blonde for about a year.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark blonde/light brown with gray, and the front is mostly white (yikes).</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and noticed that people w/orange results did not leave the product on long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair a few days before using this with born blonde ultra blue dye, I had dark brown hair, and it turned orange as expected.</li>
            <li> Next time I will leave it on a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am mosltly platinum and had a few yellow tones and brassy streaks that I wanted toned out..  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid if your hair looks super yellow and uneven when it&#x27;s still wet, because it blow dries evenly and lightens up.</li>
            <li> Usually these kits don&#x27;t lighten the hair enough or it&#x27;s just...</li>
            <li> (this is something i&#x27;ve done before with other brands with no problem)</li>
            <li> Now, in the past, I had used Clairol&#x27;s Born Blonde.</li>
            <li> This box color is not for dark hair at all</li>
            <li> and i had dyed black hair</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a very dark brown</li>
            <li> The ORANGE looks like that of a goth preteen/teen trying to go from BLACK to BLONDE over night with a bad home dye job.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product at walmart for $10...  waste of money!!  </li>
            <li> Maybe the others who have had bad results have naturally dark hair, or had hair dye in  their hair  from before.  </li>
            <li> I have been going to the salon and shelling out $50 and 2 awkward hours of small talk to touch up my roots every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> however, this formula is so crazy thick</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different hair bleaches but this one turned out to be the worst I ever tried!!!</li>
            <li> my hair never was in such terrible condition!!!nothing helps it now..</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because I am wasting my money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> The hair turned orange-thats alright,but the damage to my hair was crazy!!!!!</li>

            <li> This dye is good it comes with like 2 packets of bleach it&#x27;s damaging but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not as damaging as regular bleach i used 2 boxes of the loreal feria I don&#x27;t know if it will get you platinum but it is a good box bleach</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this monthly for a couple of years.  I get platinum results just like the box.  I am dark blonde naturally.  Maybe the others who have had bad results have naturally dark hair, or had hair dye in  their hair  from before.  People can&#x27;t believe I get such blonde platinum results at home by myself, and I have this product to thank.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing i had orange tones to my hair and this stuff made my hair white &amp;lt;3 i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for darker hair though  this hair dye was actually also not damaging to my hair it left it soft and beautiful......</li>
            <li> Usually these kits don&#x27;t lighten the hair enough or it&#x27;s just...yellow. This one gives a very light blonde and the tone of it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have salt and pepper hair/silver white and darkest brown.  In order to get blonde results, the product must be left on for 55-60 minutes.  I read other reviews and noticed that people w/orange results did not leave the product on long enough.&lt;br /&gt;The product is wonderfully conditioning and feels great after bleaching.  Other hair colors have left my hair orange-Garnier White Chocolate and other permanent hair colors.  To achieve blonde results, this bleaching product is excellent...just remember to leave it on for 55-60 minutes.</li>
            <li> Okay, let&#x27;s start off by saying I typically use GARNIER White Chocolate (Lightest ASH Blonde is what it is, I think? Can&#x27;t remember the color #) and typically I am fine bleaching/coloring with the GARNIER White Chocolate on my roots in-between a salon color/bleach visit.  It always gives me great cover until I get the professional job done every 3 months.  I decided to try something NEW by using this L&#x27;Oreal Feria Extra Bleach Blonde 205 kit.  Although this did NOT work for me and my hair color, I would never say it won&#x27;t work for someone else.  My hair is naturally a very dark brown and I&#x27;m getting silver/white hair coming through (thanks to my mom for her Mediterranean Heritage :) I use the White Chocolate to hold me over and it covers VERY WELL for someone who&#x27;s hair is naturally as dark as mine.  Feria Extra Blonde 205 did turn my hair a bit orange and I will call my stylist in the morning to shamefully admit I did this and express the \\&quot;urgency\\&quot; to get an appointment to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; what I did.  The ORANGE looks like that of a goth preteen/teen trying to go from BLACK to BLONDE over night with a bad home dye job.  Again, it didn&#x27;t work for me, but that&#x27;s not saying it won&#x27;t work for someone else. P.S.  I left the formula in for 27 mins because the \\&quot;ORANGE\\&quot; color on my head was freaking me out.  Who knows, perhaps if I left it in longer I could have been a PLATINUM blonde!  Just not for me, I am going back to my stand-by with Garnier White Chocolate.</li>
            <li> This did lift my medium brown hair to a yellow blonde. Which I toned down with a purple toner and now it is a lovely blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it in for 40 minutes after applying it to my hair. It took me about 20-25 minutes to complete the application so some areas of my hair had  60 minutes of contact with the product. That hair came out completely blonde. Next time I will leave it on a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left my hair in great condition in comparison to other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I hope my review helps somebody out there.  I used this product after having to dye my fine, porous hair reddish brown, then frosting it with the intention of going lighter again.  My hair turned a brassy yellow with orange streaks, but it DID lighten substantially.  If you&#x27;ve had the same problem, do NOT bleach your hair again unless you want total damage.  I called the toll free number on the side of the box, and the people at L&#x27;Oreal Paris were very helpful.  The operator recommended an 8A (medium to dark ash blonde), and, though it&#x27;s a touch darker than I wanted, it fixed the problem beautifully.  That&#x27;s my advice.  If you use this lightener, make sure you keep the number on the box handy in case it doesn&#x27;t work out.  Good luck, and I hope yours turns out as well as mine ended up.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair a few days before using this with born blonde ultra blue dye, I had dark brown hair, and it turned orange as expected. I bought Feria bleach blonde thinkin it would bring it to a strawberry or yellow blonde..WRONG. It colored my roots blonde and thats it. Still have the same color orange everywhere else and I left it in for an hour. I am so disappointed because I am wasting my money on this garbage. Good thing was it was on sale at Walmart.  Next time I will go to the salon...or to Sally&#x27;s and get the good stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different hair bleaches but this one turned out to be the worst I ever tried!!! The hair turned orange-thats alright,but the damage to my hair was crazy!!!!! my hair never was in such terrible condition!!!nothing helps it now..I&#x27;ll never ever buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde/light brown hair that I have been lightening to bleach blonde for about a year. I have been going to the salon and shelling out $50 and 2 awkward hours of small talk to touch up my roots every 6 weeks. Even though I have tried to bleach my own hair in the past and gotten some scary (bright orange) results, I decided to give it another try and maybe spare myself a long, uncomfortable, and expensive salon trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did! I reversed the steps (I did my roots first, because they were darker than the rest of my hair) but followed the rest of the directions exactly. Don&#x27;t be afraid if your hair looks super yellow and uneven when it&#x27;s still wet, because it blow dries evenly and lightens up. It turned out exactly like the picture on the box. Well worth $8.</li>
            <li> I usely buy this blonding kit after 3 month,  I love putting streaks in my hair. I saw Wiz Khalifa doing I always wanted to streak it.When I was done I was very pleased with it after it was done.</li>
            <li> Bought this product at walmart for $10...  waste of money!!  I am mosltly platinum and had a few yellow tones and brassy streaks that I wanted toned out..  I&#x27;ve used feria before but just the darker brown colors.  It did tone out the yellow.. not so much the brass though....  the damage is horrid!!  It feels like it did the first day a bleached it from black..  save your money and your hair and go to sally&#x27;s and get a quality lightening cream.</li>
            <li> If you do not want to outright bleach your hair this is the product for you. It combines a bleach kit and a color. My hair is outright bleached without color,so this was the best I have found, and the price is decent. I reccomend this product for anyone with extremely light blonde hair or blonde who wants to go very light.</li>
            <li> I wanted a coppery orange color and i had dyed black hair so i picked this up to strip the color out (this is something i&#x27;ve done before with other brands with no problem) however, this formula is so crazy thick it didnt spread at all and my hair turned out so splotchy because of it. This product was not meant to be your standard bleaching kit, its for people with already light hair who want to go lighter, If your dark like me and wanted to go lighter i suggest manic panic bleaching kit or splat.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark blonde/light brown with gray, and the front is mostly white (yikes). This product is the only bleach blonde I&#x27;ve used that works perfectly for me! The first time I used it, I left it on all over for 60 minutes, except for the front white part. After that, I just apply it to the roots for 50 mins, not the ends. It&#x27;s great! I use a toning shampoo &amp; conditioner (the purple kind) for a few days afterwards to tone down the brassiness a little, and then it&#x27;s fabulous until it&#x27;s time to do the roots again. I have very short hair and I only wash it every 3rd day but I use the conditioner that comes in the box almost every day, and my hair is not dry or damaged at all. I get a lot of compliments and even my stylist is impressed!</li>
            <li> When I decided to go back to blonde hair last week, my husband bought this stuff. Now, in the past, I had used Clairol&#x27;s Born Blonde. So, I used this stuff &amp; was very amazed at the results!! My hair is the same condition as before I bleached it &amp; it left very little red left in my hair after (not much red). And NEVER turned orange either! This stuff was MUCH better than Born Blonde, which had left my hair very much like straw, in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this brand if anyone who desires to go blonde from brunette. It&#x27;s very gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting/inch the scalp, &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave an orange color (but a tiny bit of red, which is easily can be colored out with a haircolor/toner shade). This is the stuff I will be using for my roots for now on &amp; working on going lighter too. So, this is the brand I will be using for now on.</li>
            <li> I color my own hair and I am 52 and a brunette.  I love this brand and the color.  Wal-mart told me they recalled this product so I went to the internet to continue having really blond hair.  I love, love love this brand and color.</li>
            <li> turns hair shiny yellow. don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Bam! Bleach blonde baby!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite colors</li>
            <li> This works great, really lightens your hair fast!! I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This box color is not for dark hair at all I would only recommend this if you are already light trying to go lighter.</li>
