            <li>Great to help release tension in my shoulders</li>
            <li>What is a good way to weaken a piece of plastic, if not break it in two?</li>
            <li>Love the products, good value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for almost six months now and they are still as great as when they first came out of the package.</li>
            <li>They work fine if you got the fight person tapping!</li>
            <li>This is the best thing, outside of a person.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t care, &#x27;cause I love these!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love &#x27;em!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Any merchant that carries and sells this product should be ashamed of themselves and should be considered nothing more than a scam</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I have used them quite often and love the feeling of loosening the muscles.</li>
            <li>It enables better  stretch also..</li>
            <li>These are not made of any kind of special plastic that is impervious to bending.</li>
            <li>Nice to have tools that you can access for quick relief .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, because the handles are nice and long, so they&#x27;re easy to position and adjust as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great for tapping your feet or better yet to have someone use them on your back or all over your body.</li>
            <li>Love these, my clients relax quickly and can use them at home themselves.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for helping relieve that tension.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my son because I have used them before and they are great at releasing tension in shoulders and back.</li>
            <li>Of course they also feel  really good on the back or any place else that aches.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and really relieve my shoulder pain.  </li>
            <li>I just take one or two of the Massage Tool Tappers and thump away on my back and/or shoulders, and it is amazing</li>
            <li>great for upper back..</li>
            <li>I have used a similar product for many years, Bongers, they work but eventually break.  </li>
            <li>These are definitely for those who feel relaxed by a good amount of repetitive tapping pressure, but I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Just three to five minutes provides much needed relief.</li>
            <li>And they are much easier for him than a hands on massage.</li>
            <li>Tapping these on my calf really helps.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>This brand seems to be holding up very well.  </li>
            <li>They had slightly longer handles which were slightly more flexible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This tapper is particularly helpful for spot pain .</li>
            <li>You can tap your tight spots or lay the ball against the wall for more pressure.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I know the other reviewer said theirs  fell apart on them immediately, but the ones I have, I&#x27;ve been using since Christmas morning, and they are sitll going strong, so maybe they just got a faulty pair?</li>
            <li>The bending that happens with normal use soon causes this rubbish product to weaken and score where the grip meets the shaft.</li>
            <li>right where I feel the knot, and just lean back into the couch and press on it</li>
            <li>By continuing to bend it back and forth multiple times which is exactly what this item is supposed to be designed to do.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> For parents and they like them.</li>
            <li> What can be said about tapping balls?  They work fine if you got the fight person tapping!</li>
            <li> Yes they do. I use them a few times a week on tight muscles in my legs, back, hips , shoulders. Nice to have tools that you can access for quick relief . These were also quite sturdy.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this Tappers Massagers for a while, after losing mine.  This is the best thing, outside of a person. You can tap your tight spots or lay the ball against the wall for more pressure.  I truly carry this thing everywhere, because the work I do causes me tightness in my shoulders and back.  I really love it. It comes 2 to a pack. You can also use it on your arms and legs too. Last time, I gave one away.  Not again, I&#x27;m keeping them both!</li>
            <li> Back in college, I had a set of these tappers, and my husband used to use them on me when I was stressed, until one broke.  That was 10 years ago.  I saw them out here and had to have them. These are definitely for those who feel relaxed by a good amount of repetitive tapping pressure, but I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> They broke after about 10 uses.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered the ancient Oriental massage tools for a present for me for last Christmas, but instead they sent her these. She failed to notice the difference until it was too late to exchange the item. But I don&#x27;t care, &#x27;cause I love these!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency to get headaches from tension in my back and shoulders. These are fantastic for helping relieve that tension. I just take one or two of the Massage Tool Tappers and thump away on my back and/or shoulders, and it is amazing how well they work! I tend to get knots around my shoulder blades, so sometimes I just take one and put the ball of it right where I feel the knot, and just lean back into the couch and press on it and after a bit, the knot dissolves. It&#x27;s great, because the handles are nice and long, so they&#x27;re easy to position and adjust as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a simple, inexpensive item, yet it works wonderfully! I highly recommend it. I know the other reviewer said theirs  fell apart on them immediately, but the ones I have, I&#x27;ve been using since Christmas morning, and they are sitll going strong, so maybe they just got a faulty pair? I&#x27;ve had mine for almost six months now and they are still as great as when they first came out of the package. So without hesitation I say \\&quot;Buy &#x27;em! You&#x27;ll love &#x27;em!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been massaging thousands of people for the last twenty years with Bonger balls. The company that makes Bongers went out of business. I was hoping these worked the same way but they did not. I could not keep a beat on someones back.  They were too flimsy.</li>
            <li> When I first received them in the mail, each ball had little cracks all around, like they&#x27;ve been on the shelf for a while, but we&#x27;ve been using them for a while now, and it hasn&#x27;t broken in pieces or anything like that and they feel wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Love these, my clients relax quickly and can use them at home themselves.</li>
            <li> I had a version of this product in the past.  They had slightly longer handles which were slightly more flexible.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like these replacement ones quite as well, but was very impressed that you had them and that they&lt;br /&gt;arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li> This tapper is particularly helpful for spot pain . The handler is flexible enough to give a bounce makes it easier for the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer the ball a littler larger to cover a larger area.</li>
            <li> These are great for tapping your feet or better yet to have someone use them on your back or all over your body. Great for soothing sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Useless. Do not purchase this. Think about it. What is a good way to weaken a piece of plastic, if not break it in two? By continuing to bend it back and forth multiple times which is exactly what this item is supposed to be designed to do. These are not made of any kind of special plastic that is impervious to bending. The bending that happens with normal use soon causes this rubbish product to weaken and score where the grip meets the shaft. I have used it less than an hour and there is no tension in the handle, the ball just flops back and forth. I might just as well be using a ball on a chain. This is now a permanent condition, at least until it finally breaks in two. Any merchant that carries and sells this product should be ashamed of themselves and should be considered nothing more than a scam artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not a viable, less expensive alternative to [[ASIN:B0007DHMVK Bongers Massage Tool]], a pair of which I have just ordered.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Love these. I wish the sticks were a little less flexible though.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my son because I have used them before and they are great at releasing tension in shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> One of the plastic handles broke by the second use.</li>
            <li> Love the products, good value. I have used them quite often and love the feeling of loosening the muscles. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great to help release tension in my shoulders and my boys will bounce them on my back too. I leave one by my office and one by my couch.</li>
            <li> I have severe psoriatic arthritis. After a long day I have my my husband use these on my back and neck. Just three to five minutes provides much needed relief. And they are much easier for him than a hands on massage.</li>
            <li> I use these for my restless legs.  Tapping these on my calf really helps.  Of course they also feel  really good on the back or any place else that aches.  Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> great for upper back..i am a massage therapist..i am sore after work so i use this to loosen  my muscles It enables better  stretch also..</li>
            <li> I have been living with back pain for over 15 years.  This is the BEST product that I have used.  It only takes a few minutes and you can feel relief.  I use them daily!  I cannot say enough good things about them.  My lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I have used a similar product for many years, Bongers, they work but eventually break.  This brand seems to be holding up very well.  They are easy to use and really relieve my shoulder pain.  They act as extenders for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a massage from the kids!</li>
