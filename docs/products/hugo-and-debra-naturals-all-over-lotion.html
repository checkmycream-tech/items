    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This lotion is remarkably and wonderfully moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Smells great.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, great scent and lotion.</li>
            <li>Why do companies always change a good thing?</li>
            <li>So all in all, again, good lotion, but looking for something else.</li>
            <li>I thought return business was supposed to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Really nice lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a very light pleasing formula.</li>
            <li>AMAZING lotion, strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Love Hugo.  </li>
            <li>, I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE this lotion.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much more lotion I keep putting on, my hands feel like they are getting drier.  </li>
            <li>What a shame that such a good company was ruined by greedy people -- can&#x27;t we get away from this anywhere anymore??!!</li>
            <li>I love the product&#x27;s scent, feel and ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>better then the lotion tbh</li>
            <li>I love the lotion, did not realize the formula had changed.  </li>
            <li>I needed something that would help me and it&#x27;s awesome because of the push down lotion top.</li>
            <li>This bottle is too small.&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly pay more money for the original size and original formula.</li>
            <li>It is a very mild vanilla and orange scent.  </li>
            <li>I buy the Vanilla &amp; Sweet Orange scent because its my favorite.</li>
            <li>Great subtle orange scent, great light, non greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>It lasts and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Light and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for my daughter, I can read.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>even though I like the lotion a lot, if I find something I like just as much, would not buy Hugo lotion any more.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from sensitive sinuses and this lotion smells amazing and leaves me headache-free and super moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love this particular scent.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!!  </li>
            <li>Maybe they need a more air tight bottle, mine was the kind with the pump.</li>
            <li>It brought her relief from the stinging, kept her skin amazingly soft and smelled lovely on a baby.</li>
            <li>At three and a half.she developed allergies and the eczema has returned so I went right out to buy more of this lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right consistency for a lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is light and sweet and the lotion makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and the Vanilla &amp; Sweet Orange scent is terrific.</li>
            <li>I liked this, even though you have to cut open the container with scissors to be able to get to the last quarter of the product.  </li>
            <li>this is my first time trying this lotion</li>
            <li>I have been using them for several years, and was so pleased with the ingredients and performance.  </li>
            <li>Being able to reuse or recycle items is high on my priority list, so I probably will not continue to buy this lotion in future.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hands VERY hydrated.</li>
            <li>i dnt really like the smell of it</li>
            <li>but u dont really like the smell...</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m going to do.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot, Hugo.</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate the company&#x27;s efforts to make nontoxic products.</li>
            <li>Very emollient and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Time to find a new lotion...</li>
            <li>crocheting but the constant touching of the yarn dries my hands.</li>
            <li>But if you like your lotion to dry quickly this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells, but this one I can handle.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I bought plenty and it lasted us until she stopped breaking out at a little under three years old.</li>
            <li>After trying Hugo my skin felt soft and youthful.</li>
            <li>Also completely non toxic.  </li>
            <li>For an all natural product, something is amiss if breaking out using this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of natural products and never seen this happen.</li>
            <li>BUT, I don&#x27;t buy it so much since they reduced the size and charged the same price and</li>
            <li>But the last bottle became filled with black and brown mold a month after I started using the container.  </li>
            <li>I&lt;br /&gt;am now going to switch to another brand for the reason that Hugo Naturals thinks they can pull a fast one on a once devoted and long time customer.</li>
            <li>I had this bottle for less than 3 months and then noticed the entire thing was full of mold.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how a company can use the same name for a product while completely changing the ingredients.</li>
            <li>daughter developed eczema shortly after birth.</li>
            <li>The scent of vanilla sweet orange is subtle and pleasing to the senses.</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t TOO thick</li>
            <li> which is difficult because the bottle is made of really thick plastic</li>
            <li> So sad.............</li>

            <li> This lotion is remarkably and wonderfully moisturizing. It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy. It isn&#x27;t TOO thick but it isn&#x27;t watery either. It&#x27;s the right consistency for a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this in my crochet bag. This keeps my hands VERY hydrated. I love crocheting but the constant touching of the yarn dries my hands. I needed something that would help me and it&#x27;s awesome because of the push down lotion top. I don&#x27;t have to put the yarn down to get a dab. I can just press, lotion up, and continue crocheting. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love Hugo.  I love this particular scent. It is a very mild vanilla and orange scent.  Works well and I do find it greasy at all on the skin. It has a very light pleasing formula.</li>
            <li> This body lotion rocks!I&#x27;ve tried various other lotions only to be disappointed when my skin still showed signs of dehydration. After trying Hugo my skin felt soft and youthful. The scent of vanilla sweet orange is subtle and pleasing to the senses. I recommend trying this lotion.</li>
            <li> I use the hugo naturals bodywash and lotion for my baby and decided to try some for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I am so glad I did. The smell is light and sweet and the lotion makes my skin feel so soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> Deserves 5 stars.  Non greasy...Smells great.  I&#x27;m not a lotion user....but I do this one.  It lasts and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Why do companies always change a good thing? This bottle is too small.&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly pay more money for the original size and original formula. I&lt;br /&gt;am now going to switch to another brand for the reason that Hugo Naturals thinks they can pull a fast one on a once devoted and long time customer. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hugos used to use the purest ingredients.  NOW, someone else got in there, and the formula has changed.  I used to LOVE this lotion.  Now I put some on, and there is a dry film on my hands just minutes later.  No matter how much more lotion I keep putting on, my hands feel like they are getting drier.  I will NEVER purchase this lotion again.  What a shame that such a good company was ruined by greedy people -- can&#x27;t we get away from this anywhere anymore??!!</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to body lotion for a long while. I love the product&#x27;s scent, feel and ingredients. Unfortunately, the company recently changed the packaging from an easily reusable or recyclable bottle to a plastic tube. In my area, at least, such packaging is not recyclable, and it&#x27;s definitely not reusable. Hence the 3-star rating. Being able to reuse or recycle items is high on my priority list, so I probably will not continue to buy this lotion in future.</li>
            <li> I always keep a bottle of lotion in my car and have never had any problems.  This bottle liquefied and I was never able to get it back to normal consistency and had to toss it.  Otherwise, great scent and lotion.</li>
            <li> Great subtle orange scent, great light, non greasy feel.  Very moisturizing!!  Love it.  Also completely non toxic.  What&#x27;s not to like!!</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying this lotion i like the shower gel better then the lotion tbh i dnt really like the smell of it i want to try hugos other scents so will see but u dont really like the smell...</li>
            <li> I just applied this all over my hands.  I buy the Vanilla &amp; Sweet Orange scent because its my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Very emollient and natural ingredients. But if you like your lotion to dry quickly this isn&#x27;t for you. Takes awhile to absorb in. I am very sensitive to smells, but this one I can handle. Light and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Broke out after using it.  For an all natural product, something is amiss if breaking out using this product.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought I just had some freakish thing happen to my bottle, but now I just read someone else had the same problem. I had this bottle for less than 3 months and then noticed the entire thing was full of mold. So disgusting. I&#x27;ve used a lot of natural products and never seen this happen. Maybe they need a more air tight bottle, mine was the kind with the pump.</li>
            <li> AMAZING lotion, strongly recommended. I suffer from sensitive sinuses and this lotion smells amazing and leaves me headache-free and super moisturized. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I liked this, even though you have to cut open the container with scissors to be able to get to the last quarter of the product.  But the last bottle became filled with black and brown mold a month after I started using the container.  ICK!  Unfortunately, Amazon won&#x27;t return it, since the actual purchase date was over two months ago.  Time to find a new lotion...</li>
            <li> I also am greatly disappointed in the changes to the Hugo Lotions.  I have been using them for several years, and was so pleased with the ingredients and performance.  Now, I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m going to do.  So sad.............</li>
            <li> I love the lotion, did not realize the formula had changed.  BUT, I don&#x27;t buy it so much since they reduced the size and charged the same price and even though I like the lotion a lot, if I find something I like just as much, would not buy Hugo lotion any more.  Also the pump stops working when there is still about a quarter of the bottle left, wonder if this is intentional?  I cut it open which is difficult because the bottle is made of really thick plastic, intentional?  So all in all, again, good lotion, but looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how a company can use the same name for a product while completely changing the ingredients. I thought return business was supposed to be a good thing. Well, they lost my family for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter developed eczema shortly after birth. It took about a year of trying different products to find something that helped her (in addition to dietary changes) and what I found was the previous version of this lotion. It brought her relief from the stinging, kept her skin amazingly soft and smelled lovely on a baby. Fortunately I bought plenty and it lasted us until she stopped breaking out at a little under three years old. At three and a half.she developed allergies and the eczema has returned so I went right out to buy more of this lotion. Fortunately for my daughter, I can read. The ingredients are nothing like the other, and the third ingredient is now alcohol. No way I&#x27;m putting that on my toddler&#x27;s inflamed skin. Back to the drawing board. Thanks a lot, Hugo.</li>
            <li> Really nice lotion. A little goes a long way. I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and the Vanilla &amp; Sweet Orange scent is terrific. I also really appreciate the company&#x27;s efforts to make nontoxic products.</li>
