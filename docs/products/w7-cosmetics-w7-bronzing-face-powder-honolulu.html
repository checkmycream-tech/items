            <li>This is so cute, nice color too</li>

            <li>Just make sure to blend the edges.</li>
            <li>Love this Bronzer.</li>
            <li>You might want to use a different brush to apply this bronzer, and it will work great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a slightly red toned brown, which is perfect to give a suntanned look to the skin.</li>
            <li>and I love the brush.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, perfect color, doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint to it like other bronzers.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and works great for applying and sculpting your face.</li>
            <li>I have used so many bronzers, this is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for contouring and cheek bronzer, and it is working great for the summer so far.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>As a lot are more golden or orangy or contour shades.</li>
            <li>and it also came with a brush, the brush is soft and works really good with contouring.</li>
            <li>Wow this was surprisingly really good.</li>
            <li>super fast 2 day shipping and wonderful for tan skin, might look a little muddy on lighter skin tones otherwise very wonderful for contouring and warming up the skin on yellow undertones</li>
            <li>It is super soft and creamy feeling and blends really good.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>instead of the tacky orangy colors most bronzers use..and it works well if ur fair or dark skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right color..</li>
            <li>Nice color ,doesnt stay on for long</li>
            <li>I am really excited because I feel like I can delayed buying another foundation powder until the end of this particular product.</li>
            <li>When I saw this product mentioned on a makeup review site (never hearing the brand W7 before) and the reasonable price, I thought it worth a shot to try it....</li>
            <li>Perfect for the entire year, works the same as Hoola from Benefit Cosmetics and its only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>this product is pretty good, a little soft but it does its work</li>
            <li>* a more popular and expensive option out there.</li>
            <li>It is remarkably soft and is just the right size for applying product under the cheekbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the color bit dark for me</li>
            <li>Just a little goes a long way which means it&#x27;s gonna last me for a long time and for that price I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>I am very interested in purchasing other products from W7.</li>
            <li>Gives off a natural tan color on me.</li>
            <li>It shipped incredibly fast as well - 2 weeks prior to me expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented bronzer, dark color.</li>

            <li> Very pigmented bronzer, dark color.</li>
            <li> When I go down south, I always like to have a red toned bronzer, because naturally when you tan you get slightly red.</li>
            <li> If you are not careful it will look really dark on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was sick of spending 32 for that company&#x27;s version when this is hands down just as good.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long this will last.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s not so orangey like a lot of other bronzer a.</li>
            <li> as expected and shipping was superfast!</li>
            <li> I used a morphe MB5 and it didn&#x27;t turn out as dark as it did when I used the brush included.</li>
            <li> I am even am using the little brush included for contouring my cheeks.</li>
            <li> If not better.</li>
            <li> Which is really hard to come buy these days.</li>
            <li> and I never buy makeup blindly without swatching them or seeing them in person first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Very pigmented bronzer, dark color. Just a little goes a long way which means it&#x27;s gonna last me for a long time and for that price I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> This is so cute, nice color too</li>
            <li> This product is a lot darker than it appears in the pictures. If you are not careful it will look really dark on the skin. I used a morphe MB5 and it didn&#x27;t turn out as dark as it did when I used the brush included. It shipped incredibly fast as well - 2 weeks prior to me expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> This is the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used! It is super soft and creamy feeling and blends really good. I like it because it&#x27;s not so orangey like a lot of other bronzer a. It doesn&#x27;t make you look muddy or rusty (in my opinion.) it&#x27;s a dupe for the benefit hula bronzer. It&#x27;s a fraction of he cost! I say SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THIS INSTEAD OF THE BENEFIT BRONZER!</li>
            <li> Nice color ,doesnt stay on for long</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I could not bring myself to spend $30 on the Too Faced Chocolate Soleil bronzer even tho I loved the color on me. When I saw this product mentioned on a makeup review site (never hearing the brand W7 before) and the reasonable price, I thought it worth a shot to try it....and I never buy makeup blindly without swatching them or seeing them in person first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I did! It is the perfect color for my medium warm skin...I believe I like it even better than the Chocolate Soleil because the Honolulu seems a tad cooler to me. I am even am using the little brush included for contouring my cheeks. It is remarkably soft and is just the right size for applying product under the cheekbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am very interested in purchasing other products from W7.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, perfect color, doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint to it like other bronzers. Gives off a natural tan color on me. Perfect for the entire year, works the same as Hoola from Benefit Cosmetics and its only a fraction of the price. Easy to apply. The brush is very soft and works great for applying and sculpting your face. The packaging is to die for also!! So adorable!</li>
            <li> I will never buy benefit&#x27;s bronzer again!!</li>
            <li> I am very fair.  I have been using it for contouring and cheek bronzer, and it is working great for the summer so far. Just make sure to blend the edges.</li>
            <li> Love this Bronzer. It&#x27;s just the right color.. Not Orange at all. Blends really good. I will defiantly  be ordering this again!!</li>
            <li> love it! as expected and shipping was superfast!</li>
            <li> good product, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Bought this while i was in Europe on vacation, and its the best ever!! Leaves a nice brown color on face..instead of the tacky orangy colors most bronzers use..and it works well if ur fair or dark skin!</li>
            <li> this product is pretty good, a little soft but it does its work and it also came with a brush, the brush is soft and works really good with contouring. You might want to use a different brush to apply this bronzer, and it will work great!</li>
            <li> Great product.. great price. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Wow this was surprisingly really good. I had gone for 2 weeks to see family in the USA, and didn&#x27;t bring makeup and I ordered a lot online. So I was stuck using only those products. I am so happy I purchased this! It&#x27;s a slightly red toned brown, which is perfect to give a suntanned look to the skin. Which is really hard to come buy these days. As a lot are more golden or orangy or contour shades. When I go down south, I always like to have a red toned bronzer, because naturally when you tan you get slightly red. So this will be perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> Had over heels in love with the sponsor like nothing I&#x27;ve ever bought perfect for contouring face no shine no shimmer and just under $10 I definitely recommend this any makeup junkie</li>
            <li> This worked well for me because it turned out to be a foundation replacement rather than a bronzer. My complexion is and see 45 and Mac. I am plied this after putting on a lighter foundation powder and instead of this being a bronzer it matched my complexion fantastically. I am really excited because I feel like I can delayed buying another foundation powder until the end of this particular product. Not sure how long this will last. The brush is great for contouring.</li>
            <li> This is a great bronzer and comes with it&#x27;s own brush....and love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product and very good product</li>
            <li> Just as good as *wink* a more popular and expensive option out there. I was sick of spending 32 for that company&#x27;s version when this is hands down just as good. If not better. It lasts all day.</li>
            <li> super fast 2 day shipping and wonderful for tan skin, might look a little muddy on lighter skin tones otherwise very wonderful for contouring and warming up the skin on yellow undertones</li>
            <li> Very very fast delivery !!!!! Love the color bit dark for me but I can mix it.</li>
            <li> I have used so many bronzers, this is by far my favorite!! Beautiful color, flawless application!!</li>
            <li> Very good product and I love the brush.</li>
            <li> Nice Product. Thanks :)</li>
