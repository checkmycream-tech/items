            <li>And for what I paid I sure as heck wasn’t going to chuck the shaver ..........</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit the Norelco 8505!</li>
            <li>We received it on time and works great and excelent price beats having to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li>good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>This replacement charger fits my razor better that the original.</li>
            <li>A different model number and shape than the $29.95 exact Norelco part number charger for my 7810XL shaver, but fits and works perfectly for 1/3 of that price!  </li>
            <li>It did not quite fit</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t fit my razor</li>
            <li>I searched a few places on the internet and this was the best deal I could find.</li>
            <li>Good replacement for old Norelco</li>
            <li>Back to normal, I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li>Charges just like original that came with it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Just like the original..</li>
            <li>it works well, its a razor charger, cant get too excited.</li>
            <li>The cord feels stiff and made of more plastic than rubber unlike the factory one that came with my shaver which was a very nice one.</li>

            <li>Out of a 5 (being good), I would rate this charger only a 2.  </li>
            <li>Charger was delivered quickly and worked as advertised</li>
            <li>So much more affordable than a new razor.  </li>
            <li>It works fine and replaces the old one.</li>
            <li>First time customer</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be back for more at Amazon.</li>
            <li>And isn&#x27;t that what you&#x27;re really hoping for when making the purchase?  ;)</li>
            <li>Received this product in a very timely manner</li>
            <li>We got it really fast and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to find my original back home some place so that I can  use this replacement as a travel plug, along with the collapsible charge stand which doesn&#x27;t come with the supply cord.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this particular product</li>
            <li>My son had pulled the plug in off the end of his shaver cord, so I purchased him a new one.</li>
            <li>Norelco should make owning their razors a modest amount, this charger costs almost 25% of the complete price for the razor.  </li>
            <li>i works but barely.</li>
            <li>The type 8500 is the key to matching it with your old charger and razor I think.</li>
            <li>worked well and was deliver much faster than I expected.</li>

            <li> Replacement charger. Works well.</li>
            <li> works flawlessly and I dont have to feel like a bum anymore.</li>
            <li> poor retention of plug. don&#x27;t know why. i works but barely.</li>
            <li> perfect fit, arrived on time</li>
            <li> Received this product in a very timely manner and yes it does work, but the charger itself is the cheapest piece of junk I have ever seen for $20.00 someone is making a load of cash at the customers expense! I would not buy this particular product again![[ASIN:B001XSRQA0 Philips Norelco Charging Cord 8000X for Speed-XL, Smart Touch, Spectra, Quarda, Precision, Arcitec, Cool Skin Shaver models and more]]</li>
            <li> On more then one occasion I have had to replace the charger for this razor, and $20 is twice what this charger should cost.  Norelco should make owning their razors a modest amount, this charger costs almost 25% of the complete price for the razor.  I would look for a razor which has a universal charger, this is customer abuse!</li>
            <li> Item works as well as unit supplied with razor.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Fits for a perfect connection and charges my razor just like my original one. Couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice.</li>
            <li> The product was as advertised, a good charger at a great price.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This charger works perfectly with my Norelco razor.  Charges just like original that came with it. The type 8500 is the key to matching it with your old charger and razor I think.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an electric cord. How good can it be? It serves the purpose of recharging my razor.</li>
            <li> Good replacement for old Norelco</li>
            <li> It did not quite fit but I made it work for now.  For the price of this compared to a name brand save your money.</li>
            <li> This razor charger charges the razor then the razor works. It is like magic.... It has no flaws so I you have a dead razor and have no charger and this is the type your razor needs... then you should totally get it. Thats what I did. Now I am happy... The End.</li>
            <li> delivered faster than estimated and worked perfect for my application!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Got it ahead of scheduled time of delivery.  Now I can shave my face again.</li>
            <li> Hey, it revived my dead Norelco Jet Clean / Charging base!  (A lightning-strike victim.)  Yay!  Back to normal, I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t fit my razor</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work with the razor</li>
            <li> Did not work with my electric razor</li>
            <li> My son had pulled the plug in off the end of his shaver cord, so I purchased him a new one. It works fine and replaces the old one. Shipping on it was very poor and it took over 10 days to get it to us from NY state.</li>
            <li> bought this for my son in law. he&#x27;s still using it a year later. great buy, great price. who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> A different model number and shape than the $29.95 exact Norelco part number charger for my 7810XL shaver, but fits and works perfectly for 1/3 of that price!  First time customer but I&#x27;ll be back for more at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Ordered this charger because we lost the orginal one when we moved and my husband had used his electric razor maybe twice since. We received it on time and works great and excelent price beats having to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li> item as described. functions as expected.</li>
            <li> check the back of your razor for the cord type. it will be listed in small print and will not be clear. this is a 8500 replacement. worked well and was deliver much faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> works really good. I enjoyed this product. and here&#x27;s me taking up more space ha ha ha ha ha ha</li>
            <li> It just WORKS.  And isn&#x27;t that what you&#x27;re really hoping for when making the purchase?  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this replacement cord for a couple months... no problems.</li>
            <li> the charger works well, but it is a very cheap charger. The cord feels stiff and made of more plastic than rubber unlike the factory one that came with my shaver which was a very nice one. It does however charge as designed. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Thank you, this was just what I was looking for. It is in a good condition and it works great.</li>
            <li> Out of a 5 (being good), I would rate this charger only a 2.  I charged it a for  24 hours after receiving it and it only charged part way.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Charger was delivered quickly and worked as advertised</li>
            <li> Seller is a prompt shipper and product was as described.</li>
            <li> Perfect price for item. Arrived and is as described. I searched a few places on the internet and this was the best deal I could find.</li>
            <li> This replacement charger fits my razor better that the original. It also seems to charge a little faster too. I love it.</li>
            <li> Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, my little Wife cleans the house and puts my things in a &amp;#34;SAFE&amp;#34; place.  But, I can&#x27;t find my razor cord and she forgot were she put&#x27;s things (JUST......................., my things..........................lol).  My little Wife............................&amp;#34;I love you, Cakes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> worth to buy, good quality</li>
            <li> Well, my charger grew legs and walked off. And for what I paid I sure as heck wasn’t going to chuck the shaver ..........I purchased this replacement charger and it works great......Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Just like the original.. I am hoping to find my original back home some place so that I can  use this replacement as a travel plug, along with the collapsible charge stand which doesn&#x27;t come with the supply cord. Certainly saves having to buy a new razor for those stupid like me to lose the power cord.</li>
            <li> Some how in our move we lost the cord to my husband&#x27;s razor. This one replaced it perfectly. We got it really fast and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Product works as stated.  Great transaction.</li>
            <li> So much more affordable than a new razor.  Whats there to say, its a power cord, I lost mine, this fits great!</li>
            <li> Works, and then we found the lost one.</li>
            <li> it worked the way it was suppose to and it came to my house in 4 days. there was no problem</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit the Norelco 8505! Had to cut it with a knife so it connects to the trimmer. :(</li>
            <li> Stopped functioning after only a week. I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It does not fit clipper model CC5060 as it written under &amp;#34;Product Description&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Just wasted my time !!</li>
            <li> it works well, its a razor charger, cant get too excited.</li>
