            <li> This was my first date ever with falsies.  I&#x27;m happy to say that it worked out well, and we are now in a committed relationship.  Very easy to apply and stick down close to the lash line.  I used a thin strip of Duo adhesive and a toothpick to place them.

            <li> Very natural look. I am Asian. I don&#x27;t have to cut the length to fit my eyes at all. Love this. I am reusing every pairs.</li>
            <li> The most comfortable shop i ever deleted with</li>

            <li> My favorite lashes for professional environment. They look natural and cute.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite go-to lashes for every day use. They look so natural an are so easy to apply! These are by far, my absolute FAVORITE lashes. However, no drugstores carry this brand in my area. And the only way for me to get them in bulk is from amazon. However, I ordered 12 packs of these about a month ago. Because I only have two pairs left, and I use them quite often. I NEVER RECEIVED THEM. I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but 20 dollars later, I still have no lashes. And I&#x27;m completely out and having to use drug store brands. No ones fixed my issue as of yet. Not even a refund. No longer an Amazon customer. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love these human hair lashes, they really look natural and they are great to wear out. I would highly recommend, good price too! The cheaper manmade ones are fake looking but these look so natural that it is hard to tell if they are your own. I usually only wear them on special occasions but I like the way these look and I wear them more often.</li>
            <li> That looked very natural. Too natural....as in too thin. I had to double them up just to some what be happy with them....I guess I&#x27;ll go back to my red cherry 415s.....even through those are also thin.....ugh....these are too thin as a brand.... I think I&#x27;m gonna try a different brand all together</li>
            <li> i loved them just what i wanted and they were not that expensive &amp;#60;333</li>
            <li> These are the most natural lashes I have found. Most of the time, people just comment on how beautiful my lashes are. 70% of people I talk to do not even realize I have false eyelashes  on. Very easy to apply with a plastic applicator. Easy to take off. I usually get 3 to 4 days wear out a pair.</li>
            <li> My favorite lashes! I need to order more!</li>
            <li> New favorite lash! Super comfortable, and just the right length. I do trim the lashes themselves, because I like a more uneven look, but these are really great! I will be ordering more asap!</li>
