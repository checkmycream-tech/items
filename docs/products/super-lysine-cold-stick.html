            <li>Go fly your drone...</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I use this chapstick every day and also take Quantum&#x27;s L-lysine supplement, and I&#x27;ve found that these two are very effective together.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the chapstick has a very nice consistency and looks sort of like a lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this product, excellent ingredients, sun screen, moisturizes as it protects.</li>
            <li>But excellent, I always make sure I have a couple of hand.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, Lysine is a great healer of lip sores and great sunscreen stick.</li>

            <li>Buy a couple and keep them handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had one before and it kind of freaked me out.  </li>
            <li>Taste is not off putting and has a nice sheen to it.</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>If you feel tingle using this, void touching any pimples or your lips.</li>
            <li>Urgh, more places to keep an eye on and more outbreak frequencies.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>For the money, this is one of my favorite products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.     </li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many types of lip protection.</li>
            <li>This stuff is better than prescription strength ointments.</li>
            <li>Im also a premed student, and the ingredients in this product as well as the matching pills work better than prescriptions.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation like many products with fragrance and flavor and makes lips look healthy.</li>
            <li>Glad it as UV protection.</li>
            <li>I bought one for my boyfriend, too. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it so nothing more to say</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has SPF21 in it.</li>
            <li>- in fact, I am about to now! :)</li>
            <li>I think it works better.</li>
            <li>I love the Coldstick-</li>
            <li>My aunt referred it to me, and I love it.</li>
            <li>So relieved, and so glad that I went looking for a solution.</li>
            <li>sore free like me as well!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if that will be safe for pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if that will be safe for pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know there are many of these types of products out on the market with the Lysine, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe what I feel about this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product -- my second order!!!</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I prefer the flavored versions has a better scent to them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I think this is a pretty good lip balm.</li>
            <li>Love this for easy of application, feels smooth and nice on, and no cold sores yet!</li>
            <li>Certain things work well for some and not to good for others.</li>
            <li>Love that it goes on so smooth and has the sunblock added in.</li>
            <li>so you can easily locate it.  </li>
            <li>Always does the job, and easy to carry in a pocket or purse...</li>
            <li>easy to keep on you, even if all you have is pockets.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Seems to help heal them very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I use this balm every day in addition to the Super Lysine Plus vitamin supplement and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!</li>
            <li>When you finally find something that works, it is a great feeling.</li>
            <li>smooth and soothing, it helps speed the healing.</li>
            <li>have been cold-sore free, since, and it feels amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spreads on smooth with no smell.</li>
            <li>I love this item, but I really don&#x27;t like how you have to spend MORE money just to get this item for the &amp;#34;add on program&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Started clearing up right away and has gotten 80% better in one day.</li>
            <li>Was so glad to find it at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>This product goes on nicely and gets absorbed by your lips really well... and does NOT leave a greasy residue.      </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this product was made with Lysine - an actual vitamin - and in a chapped stick formula - so it&#x27;s easy to use and to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li>Great product but just like any other lip stick</li>
            <li>Ok, so like most people I am totally fed up with coldsores, non working remedies, and promises that don&#x27;t come true.  </li>
            <li>Super Lysine coldstick keeps you protected from the start, period.</li>
            <li>soon as I get that tingling on or around the lips, I take the Super Lysine supplement, that worked for me.</li>
            <li>Go to Walgreens and get the Super Lysine ointment in a tube.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried the Lysine pill version as I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried the Lysine pill version as I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant</li>
            <li>If I take the super lysine orally and put the cream on my lips, I can get rid of it before it surfaces.</li>
            <li>I also bought the Super Lysine pills.  </li>
            <li>She was amazed at how quickly hers cleared up and has not had one since using this.</li>
            <li>So much better than abreva and so in-expensive compared to the normal colds ore products.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m delighted to report that I haven&#x27;t had a single sore since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>and I really just want to buy it with out spending all this money!!</li>
            <li>This just leaves your lips looking healthy and naturally moist.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price of 6$ and</li>
            <li>Love the Lip Clear Coldstick it worked well at the beach.</li>
            <li>I was googling more natural remedies and came across mention of this lip balm</li>
            <li>but it is WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>If the price was right I would have given this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>in 30 years this is the first time that it never fully developed, I&#x27;m buying more to keep in my work, car, and home.</li>
            <li>More often than not, it prevents the actual fever blister from coming up on my lip.</li>
            <li>After 5 years,  I experience an outbreak after a month from first using this.  </li>
            <li>I also bombard myself with the oral lysine capsules when I first feel one tingling.  </li>
            <li>I purchased four more for some family members and back ups.</li>
            <li>I also bought some Zoivarax cream and would use that at the first sign</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I&#x27;ve tried almost everything you can think of.</li>
            <li>Love it and would definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>Most dry them out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this as a chapstick, it made my lips feel more dry, so I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t apply much that month.  </li>
            <li>Wash hands carefully and eat healthy until tingling ceases when applying.  </li>
            <li>Well, this product really works for me to keep them at bay</li>
            <li>I was turned onto this product by a Whole Foods Market rep.  </li>
            <li>As a male using \\&quot;lip-balm\\&quot;, this is really important to me.  </li>
            <li>This is the best chapstick for people who suffer from cold sores.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of OTC as well as prescription (zovirax) for cold sores and this is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>The product really helps and takes care of the problem very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told it works very well,</li>
            <li>This is an excellent lip balm that has the added benefit of eliminating cold sores.</li>
            <li>a Whole Foods rep.</li>
            <li>Clears them up fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much like the smell</li>
            <li>This is a lip balm so there isn&#x27;t much to say...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the taste and feel of it on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really hasn&#x27;t made a difference.  </li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t do much to help heal your coldsore blister, but it will help prevent it from cracking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s basically just a lipbalm with vitamins that are meant to assist the healing, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>balm itself doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell and absorbs into the lips keeping them soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very shiny</li>
            <li>Suffered many years with oral sores and they typically get worse as you age, and even with being on prescription drugs to keep them at bay, this is the best product on the market over all others to stop pain, to prevent future sores and helps prevent scarring.</li>
            <li>and then on about day 8 (of 10), it came back in full force.</li>
            <li>I also take Lysin pills, but I was taking them before and didn&#x27;t really see too much improvement; I also &amp;#34;applied Lip clear Lysing + ointment&amp;#34; which you can purchase here as well.</li>
            <li>I remembered the Super Lysine Plus and immediately popped 3 capsules, repeating 3 times daily for a week.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is stuffed with a crazy amount of goodies for your lips, and works incredibly.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels just like a normal chapstick</li>
            <li>the clear balm make the spot not showing as much since the whole lips are shiny (not overly) and look natural.</li>
            <li>apply this lipbalm (using separate q-tip for prevention) all over my lips and my lips look normal and</li>
            <li>This is by far the most effective way to guard against cold sores.</li>
            <li>This year I have spent more money on generic Valtrex than I care to mention and have been taking Lysine supplements twice a day and STILL got them.  </li>
            <li>I would take some generic l-lysine during a breakout, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to help much.</li>
            <li>It was good enough though, no unpleasant smell, didn&#x27;t leave any weird film on my lips.</li>
            <li>So, if it starts in the middle of the night, I put this on first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product ever since I first discovered it in a local health food store.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a relief!</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product!</li>
            <li>After rubbing this product on that spot several times a day for the past three days, I can honestly say that it did the trick - I see no sign of a sore at this point.</li>
            <li>If you get one, this stick will help it clear up faster and soothe the soreness.</li>
            <li>I use it immediately and regularly when I feel one coming on and it helps so much.</li>
            <li>Then, about 7 years ago I completely changed the way I ate and cut out processed sugars and refined flours from my diet.</li>
            <li>The recurrence is not that frequent...</li>
            <li>So far it works well.</li>
            <li>I got a good one and was using some other stuff that did not work(it came a lot quicker than this did, shipping from this is slow).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really interested in taking it on a daily basis again to prevent future breakouts</li>
            <li>For starters, I&#x27;m pretty leery of any review for a health-related product because there are so many fake reviews.</li>
            <li>as  in no  cold sores I  haven&#x27;t used it  long enough to tell....?  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a great blend and definitely works and makes a difference with lip cold sores.  </li>
            <li>I have had cold sores all my life and for the most part I rarely got one</li>
            <li>No other product works like Lysine and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>I frequently get fever blisters but since I have been using this daily, I have not gotten any.</li>
            <li>With this, it actually never fully developed.</li>
            <li>Since I found this I have used it regularly (but not everyday since I often forgot - in</li>
            <li>It works good, keeps my lips from being chapped, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent cold sores though.</li>
            <li>Good for cold sore bearers</li>
            <li>I found the other positive reviews hard to believe-but they are true.  </li>
            <li>He uses this for when he goes in the sun to help prevent an outbreak, so far so good, but haven&#x27;t used enough to tell of it&#x27;s really working or not, so it&#x27;s hard to review, I&#x27;ll edit this post in a few months (he usually will have an outbreak every month or two,)</li>
            <li>Although the coldsore is not completely dry yet but it works much faster than other</li>
            <li>I found a forum where somebody recommended taking 3 Quantum Super Lysine Plus capsules 3 times daily as soon as the tingling of a cold sore came on (not everyone gets the tingling as a pre-warning, but fortunately I do).</li>
            <li>creamy and does not dry out your lips</li>
            <li>Once a cold sore is up and running it can&#x27;t heal fast enough for me - and honestly, most stuff on the market will reduce healing time by maybe one day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different lip balms in the past few months, and this one was best(even beating out carmex, which used to be my favorite).</li>
            <li>I applied only 4 times because I was confused why I felt strong tingling.</li>
            <li>I started using this stick as soon as I saw a little bump, but it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>

            <li> I love this product, excellent ingredients, sun screen, moisturizes as it protects.</li>
            <li> But excellent, I always make sure I have a couple of hand.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, Lysine is a great healer of lip sores and great sunscreen stick.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Very effective and feels nice on the lips</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product, it works great and looks great on my lips (all shiny and smooth)</li>
            <li> Buy a couple and keep them handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one before and it kind of freaked me out.  </li>
            <li> Taste is not off putting and has a nice sheen to it.</li>
            <li> Glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> If you feel tingle using this, void touching any pimples or your lips.</li>
            <li> Urgh, more places to keep an eye on and more outbreak frequencies.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> For the money, this is one of my favorite products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.     </li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of lip protection.</li>
            <li> This stuff is better than prescription strength ointments.</li>
            <li> Im also a premed student, and the ingredients in this product as well as the matching pills work better than prescriptions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation like many products with fragrance and flavor and makes lips look healthy.</li>
            <li> Glad it as UV protection.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my boyfriend, too. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it so nothing more to say</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has SPF21 in it.</li>
            <li> - in fact, I am about to now! :)</li>
            <li> I think it works better.</li>
            <li> I love the Coldstick-</li>
            <li> My aunt referred it to me, and I love it.</li>
            <li> So relieved, and so glad that I went looking for a solution.</li>
            <li> sore free like me as well!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if that will be safe for pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if that will be safe for pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know there are many of these types of products out on the market with the Lysine, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe what I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product -- my second order!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> I prefer the flavored versions has a better scent to them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good lip balm.</li>
            <li> Love this for easy of application, feels smooth and nice on, and no cold sores yet!</li>
            <li> Certain things work well for some and not to good for others.</li>
            <li> Love that it goes on so smooth and has the sunblock added in.</li>
            <li> so you can easily locate it.  </li>
            <li> Always does the job, and easy to carry in a pocket or purse...</li>
            <li> easy to keep on you, even if all you have is pockets.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Seems to help heal them very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I use this balm every day in addition to the Super Lysine Plus vitamin supplement and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!</li>
            <li> When you finally find something that works, it is a great feeling.</li>
            <li> smooth and soothing, it helps speed the healing.</li>
            <li> have been cold-sore free, since, and it feels amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spreads on smooth with no smell.</li>
            <li> I love this item, but I really don&#x27;t like how you have to spend MORE money just to get this item for the &amp;#34;add on program&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Started clearing up right away and has gotten 80% better in one day.</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find it at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This product goes on nicely and gets absorbed by your lips really well... and does NOT leave a greasy residue.      </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this product was made with Lysine - an actual vitamin - and in a chapped stick formula - so it&#x27;s easy to use and to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> Great product but just like any other lip stick</li>
            <li> Ok, so like most people I am totally fed up with coldsores, non working remedies, and promises that don&#x27;t come true.  </li>
            <li> Super Lysine coldstick keeps you protected from the start, period.</li>
            <li> soon as I get that tingling on or around the lips, I take the Super Lysine supplement, that worked for me.</li>
            <li> Go to Walgreens and get the Super Lysine ointment in a tube.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried the Lysine pill version as I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried the Lysine pill version as I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant</li>
            <li> If I take the super lysine orally and put the cream on my lips, I can get rid of it before it surfaces.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Super Lysine pills.  </li>
            <li> She was amazed at how quickly hers cleared up and has not had one since using this.</li>
            <li> So much better than abreva and so in-expensive compared to the normal colds ore products.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m delighted to report that I haven&#x27;t had a single sore since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> and I really just want to buy it with out spending all this money!!</li>
            <li> This just leaves your lips looking healthy and naturally moist.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price of 6$ and</li>
            <li> Love the Lip Clear Coldstick it worked well at the beach.</li>
            <li> I was googling more natural remedies and came across mention of this lip balm</li>
            <li> but it is WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li> If the price was right I would have given this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> in 30 years this is the first time that it never fully developed, I&#x27;m buying more to keep in my work, car, and home.</li>
            <li> More often than not, it prevents the actual fever blister from coming up on my lip.</li>
            <li> After 5 years,  I experience an outbreak after a month from first using this.  </li>
            <li> I also bombard myself with the oral lysine capsules when I first feel one tingling.  </li>
            <li> I purchased four more for some family members and back ups.</li>
            <li> I also bought some Zoivarax cream and would use that at the first sign</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I&#x27;ve tried almost everything you can think of.</li>
            <li> Love it and would definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Most dry them out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this as a chapstick, it made my lips feel more dry, so I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t apply much that month.  </li>
            <li> Wash hands carefully and eat healthy until tingling ceases when applying.  </li>
            <li> Well, this product really works for me to keep them at bay</li>
            <li> I was turned onto this product by a Whole Foods Market rep.  </li>
            <li> As a male using \\&quot;lip-balm\\&quot;, this is really important to me.  </li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick for people who suffer from cold sores.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of OTC as well as prescription (zovirax) for cold sores and this is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> The product really helps and takes care of the problem very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told it works very well,</li>
            <li> This is an excellent lip balm that has the added benefit of eliminating cold sores.</li>
            <li> a Whole Foods rep.</li>
            <li> Clears them up fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much like the smell</li>
            <li> This is a lip balm so there isn&#x27;t much to say...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the taste and feel of it on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really hasn&#x27;t made a difference.  </li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t do much to help heal your coldsore blister, but it will help prevent it from cracking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s basically just a lipbalm with vitamins that are meant to assist the healing, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> balm itself doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell and absorbs into the lips keeping them soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very shiny</li>
            <li> Suffered many years with oral sores and they typically get worse as you age, and even with being on prescription drugs to keep them at bay, this is the best product on the market over all others to stop pain, to prevent future sores and helps prevent scarring.</li>
            <li> and then on about day 8 (of 10), it came back in full force.</li>
            <li> I also take Lysin pills, but I was taking them before and didn&#x27;t really see too much improvement; I also &amp;#34;applied Lip clear Lysing + ointment&amp;#34; which you can purchase here as well.</li>
            <li> I remembered the Super Lysine Plus and immediately popped 3 capsules, repeating 3 times daily for a week.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is stuffed with a crazy amount of goodies for your lips, and works incredibly.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels just like a normal chapstick</li>
            <li> the clear balm make the spot not showing as much since the whole lips are shiny (not overly) and look natural.</li>
            <li> apply this lipbalm (using separate q-tip for prevention) all over my lips and my lips look normal and</li>
            <li> This is by far the most effective way to guard against cold sores.</li>
            <li> This year I have spent more money on generic Valtrex than I care to mention and have been taking Lysine supplements twice a day and STILL got them.  </li>
            <li> I would take some generic l-lysine during a breakout, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to help much.</li>
            <li> It was good enough though, no unpleasant smell, didn&#x27;t leave any weird film on my lips.</li>
            <li> So, if it starts in the middle of the night, I put this on first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product ever since I first discovered it in a local health food store.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a relief!</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product!</li>
            <li> After rubbing this product on that spot several times a day for the past three days, I can honestly say that it did the trick - I see no sign of a sore at this point.</li>
            <li> If you get one, this stick will help it clear up faster and soothe the soreness.</li>
            <li> I use it immediately and regularly when I feel one coming on and it helps so much.</li>
            <li> Then, about 7 years ago I completely changed the way I ate and cut out processed sugars and refined flours from my diet.</li>
            <li> The recurrence is not that frequent...</li>
            <li> So far it works well.</li>
            <li> I got a good one and was using some other stuff that did not work(it came a lot quicker than this did, shipping from this is slow).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really interested in taking it on a daily basis again to prevent future breakouts</li>
            <li> For starters, I&#x27;m pretty leery of any review for a health-related product because there are so many fake reviews.</li>
            <li> as  in no  cold sores I  haven&#x27;t used it  long enough to tell....?  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a great blend and definitely works and makes a difference with lip cold sores.  </li>
            <li> I have had cold sores all my life and for the most part I rarely got one</li>
            <li> No other product works like Lysine and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> I frequently get fever blisters but since I have been using this daily, I have not gotten any.</li>
            <li> With this, it actually never fully developed.</li>
            <li> Since I found this I have used it regularly (but not everyday since I often forgot - in</li>
            <li> It works good, keeps my lips from being chapped, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent cold sores though.</li>
            <li> Good for cold sore bearers</li>
            <li> I found the other positive reviews hard to believe-but they are true.  </li>
            <li> He uses this for when he goes in the sun to help prevent an outbreak, so far so good, but haven&#x27;t used enough to tell of it&#x27;s really working or not, so it&#x27;s hard to review, I&#x27;ll edit this post in a few months (he usually will have an outbreak every month or two,)</li>
            <li> Although the coldsore is not completely dry yet but it works much faster than other</li>
            <li> I found a forum where somebody recommended taking 3 Quantum Super Lysine Plus capsules 3 times daily as soon as the tingling of a cold sore came on (not everyone gets the tingling as a pre-warning, but fortunately I do).</li>
            <li> creamy and does not dry out your lips</li>
            <li> Once a cold sore is up and running it can&#x27;t heal fast enough for me - and honestly, most stuff on the market will reduce healing time by maybe one day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different lip balms in the past few months, and this one was best(even beating out carmex, which used to be my favorite).</li>
            <li> I applied only 4 times because I was confused why I felt strong tingling.</li>
            <li> I started using this stick as soon as I saw a little bump, but it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> The only time I have had one is because of an actual illness, not for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> Usually I break out only on my bottom lip but since, I have spread it \\&quot;around\\&quot; my lip, the virus is now capable of popping up anywhere on my face.  </li>
            <li> But after consistent usage, that was the first and last cold sore on my lips.</li>
            <li> I also took 2 Valtrex pills (but usually those do absolutely nothing for me) and it stopped it in its tracks.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure that this product is what finally got rid of my cold sore but it seems likely.</li>
            <li> I use to get frequent cold sores, and I think because of this stuff on my lips I have been sore free for 6 months.  </li>
            <li> After suffering with cold sores for many years i have finally found a lip balm that keeps them</li>
            <li> This is great for everyday use and has seemed to keep the cold sore count way down.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than other chapstick brands</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing this now for a about 5 years and have been cold sore free since!</li>
            <li> that I believe I am an expert on dealing with a cold sore more that her...</li>
            <li> Usually when you go to sleep, you wake up the next morning to a developed sore running its toll on you.</li>
            <li> how long this chapstick lasts.</li>
            <li> Plus this took a really long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> 3 days later the coldsore (which never really came out) was gone.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it everyday and it has really cut down on the number of sores he gets.  </li>
            <li> But, to my surprise, and relief, I found Quantum Super Lysine Cream... and WOW, my cold sore went away in 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using various other ointments for weeks</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and gives your lips a glossy look to them!</li>
            <li> I find it easier to reapply during the day than the ointments which are messy and obvious that you have a big sore with shiny goo all over it.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly to treat cold sores - and prevents them too when used as a lip balm!</li>
            <li> I noticed that when I was taking the l-lysine regularly the chances of getting a cold sore in the spring and fall were significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I believe this is true.</li>
            <li> it gets melt down if left under the sun.</li>
            <li> When I used those white cream in the past, it made the coldsore shown so obvious as it screamed &amp;#34;Look at</li>
            <li> I now use this in the morning and at night and in the middle of the day if my lips are a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I brought it because my lips have been very dry this winter and everything I was using was not working.</li>
            <li> My cold sore was completely gone within a few days after I started using Super Lysine.</li>
            <li> I carried it on my key chain for a little while</li>
            <li> Did not work, actually made a cold sore appear the first day after using it!</li>
            <li> I feel as if that kind of cold sore is hard to combat.</li>
            <li> If I continue to stay cold sore free, there&#x27;s no way I will ever stop ordering it.</li>
            <li> But I do know what it feels like when they&#x27;re coming in, as well as what the texture of the skin is at that stage, and I could tell that one was about to appear on my upper lip a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done so much research some remedies have helped, while others have made it worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This got me curious about the product</li>
            <li> broke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned my brother onto this remedy a few years back</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but for me, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They were starting literally every few weeks-they are unattractive and distract me from my work throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It was slightly waxy and left my lips feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> Then during one particularly embarrassing and painful breakout, I went to my local health food market in search of a natural remedy.</li>
            <li> But, if you do, hopefully it will last less than the typical and dreaded 7 - 10 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you get cold sores, L-lysine will make the likelihood of getting an outbreak significantly lower.  </li>
            <li> years ago, on the advice of a friend, I began taking small amounts of l-lysine to reduce the number of canker sores I would get on the inside of my mouth (it didn&#x27;t eradicate them, but definitely reduced the amount that I would get).</li>
            <li> He unfortunately doesn&#x27;t get the pre-breakout tingle warning like I do, so he can&#x27;t prevent them entirely without taking a daily capsule (which he can&#x27;t remember to do), but he has reduced his breakouts from 7-10 days to only 2-3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The other cream on the market doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> It uses other chemical sunscreens (some linked to cancer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li> Luckily the cold sore never</li>
            <li> highly recommend this lip balm to cure and prevent cold sore.ly this lipbalm (using separate q-tip for prevention) all over my lips and my lips look normal and you can hardly tell that I have a breakout.</li>
            <li> All of the other stuff on the market claims to cut healing time in half, etc, etc....</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend to anybody who suffers from chronic canker sores to give up soda (regular and diet).</li>
            <li> average 3-4 days a week) to prevent a breakout.</li>
            <li> I have heard using this on a daily basis can actually help prevent cold sores, but I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis, so I can&#x27;t say yes or no to that.  </li>
            <li> The previous time I had was over 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve ever had  even with the one advertised and previously purchased  at walmart</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s completely worth it to me to have that extra guard against those annoying little nuisances.</li>
            <li> and I am sitting in bed (writing my first review ever), and the cold sore is ALL GONE.  </li>
            <li> and I started doing a little research on the Internet.</li>
            <li> so I try to put a little on</li>
            <li> (that item cuts down on the healing time by at least half from 2 weeks to around 7 days, sometimes less).  </li>
            <li> but when my lips started to dry out, I decided to look for a serious lip balm.</li>
            <li> This has really helped keep my cold sores at bay.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here on Amazon and was dubious... how could a lip balm really defend against dreaded cold cores, which I have suffered from for a few years on a semi-regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I was addicted to deep chocolate cookies with chocolate chips for a while before getting an outbreak.  </li>
            <li> As an added plus, it&#x27;s green</li>
            <li> a family member  uses it for dried out lips, years on corners.  </li>
            <li> I use everyday, hour, all the time.  </li>
            <li> Take everyday in the morning, and drink the recommended water intake.  </li>
            <li> i used this product after reading a few reviews on it and decided to take a chance on it.</li>
            <li> I use it on plain lips and over my lipstick.</li>
            <li> Tastes ok, prevents cold sores!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from fever blisters.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this lip balm to cure and prevent cold sore.</li>
            <li> A week or two past the estimated delivery date which was a few weeks from when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from cold sores I highly suggest getting this, some stress complex B, and Lysine pills.  </li>
            <li> I stopped by whole foods market and picked up one of these bad boys.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why you can&#x27;t buy this stuff in stores.</li>
            <li> After the outbreak was gone,  no more tingles on my lips using this.  </li>
            <li> After telling them of my cold sore affliction and explaining how I was tired of spending money on much more expensive treatments, they recommended this.      </li>
            <li> not really sure I&#x27;ll continue to buy it for that price.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t help it from erupting and it would literally take 2-3 days for the tingling to stop and I would get a small scab.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using the problem as everyday chapstick to prevent chapping and future cold sores.  </li>
            <li> you can hardly tell that I have a breakout.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too slimy, not too waxy, doesn&#x27;t taste weird or any of the other usual issues that can be hand with chapsticks.  </li>
            <li> this stuff has floored me - not because of its healing ability but because I haven&#x27;t had a cold sore since I started using this stuff as my daily</li>
            <li> I have tried neosporin, vaseline and every chapstick out there-this stuff moisturizes, soothes, has no sticky, stinky, or icky tastes or smells.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s actually bringing out the cold sores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person who gets cold sores all the time, I believe the last one that I had appeared around five years ago.</li>
            <li> If you get occasional cold sores this is the one to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually had a cold sore disappear before it ran</li>
            <li> I religiously would get two cold sores every year; one in the spring and one in the fall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after I stopped taking l-lysine daily I started noticing regular recurrence of my bi-annual cold sore breakouts, which was extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> I started to feel the tingling of a cold sore breakout and started using the lip cream several times a day.  </li>
            <li> Lately I have been eating well and get lots of sleep.</li>
            <li> Coldsore still develops but it never gets crazy big.</li>
            <li> This was low cost and as anyone who has a cold sores knows, I was desperate for any potential solution.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a cold sore since using it daily.</li>
            <li> I kept getting cold sores, and now I just use this daily, and haven&#x27;t had one in ages.</li>
            <li> I had tried other expensive over-the-counter cold sore relief products like Abreva that don&#x27;t work at all, so my hopes of finding something that would work was low.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I had even resorted to taking Valtrex every single day to keep from getting Cold Sores.  </li>
            <li> I have not had a single cold sore since.  </li>
            <li> The first step was cutting out soda, which was very difficult to say the least!</li>
            <li> highly recommend to anybody who suffers from cold sores to give this a try.</li>
            <li> This product is useless and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I get terrible cold sores that swell my whole face up and bust open.</li>
            <li> The other stuff just seemed to keep the cold sore going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to get cold sores up to twice a month - big nasty painful things - and I think it&#x27;s been nearly a year since my last one?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to cancel dates on multiple occasions due to these horrific sores.</li>
            <li> Really surprised, I had relegated myself to the fact that I was going to be living with ugly, painful cold sore for the next couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I have had cold sore for all of my life and in looking for L-Lysine tablets, I stumbled upon this little gem.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell him I am addicted to this product and will use NOTHING else.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my lips once everyday as a maintenance to keep the cold sore away from my lips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also tired of spending money on ointments, creams, etc...  </li>
            <li> FYI: chapped lips from cold weather and wind can get a cold sore started, as well as being out in the sun and getting dry lips.</li>
            <li> you get no more cold sores...</li>
            <li> I usually take lysine every months in the winter, but forgot this winter and got a cold sore.</li>
            <li> i thought it would at least helped suppressed the cold sore</li>
            <li> have not had a cold sore since using this every day and recently bought one for my friend who was going through chemo and suffering badly with cold sores.</li>
            <li> Try it you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not returnable</li>
            <li> He used to suffer from 6-10 nasty breakouts each year that would last 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> the worst that I hate was when one breakout almost gone and then a new one started.</li>
            <li> When I feel that horrible little itch underneath the skin on my lips, I coat this stuff on.</li>
            <li> In fact, I got a cold sore two weeks after I started using this chapstick.</li>
            <li> Now, let me just say that my mother gets cold sore ALL the time.  </li>
            <li> After trying this, I have NEVER had cold sores again.  </li>
            <li> After I started to use this product, I have NEVER, ever had another cold sore.  </li>
            <li> I feel a cold sore coming on...</li>
            <li> I thought this was a cold sore treatment and realized it is not when I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a cold sore before</li>
            <li> My daughter had a cold sore when we purchased this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every day, morning and night and still had cold sore outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I used to get Cold Sores all the time.</li>
            <li> Knock on wood, but I haven&#x27;t got a cold sore in almost three years since I started using this.</li>
            <li> My cold sore popped up this morning within an hour.  </li>
            <li> The cold sore was almost gone within an hour of using the product.  </li>
            <li> a pro it did help get rid of my cold sore and chapped lips</li>
            <li> The cold sore never broke</li>
            <li> I have had cold sore on and of for almost 30 years.</li>
            <li> and I have used a lot of antibiotic to cure it to the point that I&#x27;m afraid my kidney can&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
            <li> Then I got a cold sore, so I dug around for it and started putting just on the sore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a cold sore in my life until this winter at age 42.</li>
            <li> My husband always had a problem with Cold sores, but Not anymore.</li>
            <li> I had just had a cold sore and it was healed</li>
            <li> and before i knew it i woke up with another cold sore</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this for anyone that suffers with a cold sore.</li>
            <li> I tried this after getting cold sore after cold sore with no avail.</li>
            <li> As someone who has chapped lips regardless of season, and also tend to get cold sores it not attended to promptly, I was psyched to see a chapstick with the added benefit of Lysine in it.  </li>
            <li> had a cold sore in the making stopped it in its tracks  fastest healing</li>
            <li> they are just an awful, painful, depressing little plague.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I wear it when I feel a Cold Sore coming on (and it stops the cold sore from coming to the surface), or when I&#x27;m in the sun all day (for sun blisters) and it works!</li>
            <li> but then it would get bad again.</li>
            <li> But why wait &#x27;till you got an ugly sore on your lip?  </li>
            <li> I hate cold sore</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Once a cold sore is up and running it can&#x27;t heal fast enough for me - and honestly, most stuff on the market will reduce healing time by maybe one day max?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff has floored me - not because of its healing ability but because I haven&#x27;t had a cold sore since I started using this stuff as my daily chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to take hold. In fact, I got a cold sore two weeks after I started using this chapstick. But after consistent usage, that was the first and last cold sore on my lips. I used to get cold sores up to twice a month - big nasty painful things - and I think it&#x27;s been nearly a year since my last one? Halle-frickin-lujah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate reviews that boast miracles but I don&#x27;t know how else to put it.  My greatest fear is that they will some day take this off the market and I&#x27;ll have to go back to trying to find something else to solve my woes.</li>
            <li> Not sure why you can&#x27;t buy this stuff in stores. HEB doesn&#x27;t have it, Walmart doesn&#x27;t have it. Glad Amazon carries it. I also take Lysine in vitamin form. When my lips are chapped, I use the stick. I would highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from fever blisters. When I feel that horrible little itch underneath the skin on my lips, I coat this stuff on. More often than not, it prevents the actual fever blister from coming up on my lip. For me, if I don&#x27;t treat it when I feel the itch, the fever blister will appear within about 12 hours. So, if it starts in the middle of the night, I put this on first thing in the morning. This stuff is awesome. When you finally find something that works, it is a great feeling. No other product works like Lysine and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> If you have some tingling after applying this balm, please take mediation because it means you are currently shedding the virus and likely have an outbreak soon.  After 5 years,  I experience an outbreak after a month from first using this.  I applied only 4 times because I was confused why I felt strong tingling. So I didn&#x27;t apply much that month.  If you feel tingle using this, void touching any pimples or your lips. Wash hands carefully and eat healthy until tingling ceases when applying.  I was addicted to deep chocolate cookies with chocolate chips for a while before getting an outbreak.  After the outbreak was gone,  no more tingles on my lips using this.  It&#x27;s been 2 years and I use the balm only occasionally.  I think it helps.n, it can breakout anywhere in that entire section. There are three sections. Usually I break out only on my bottom lip but since, I have spread it \\&quot;around\\&quot; my lip, the virus is now capable of popping up anywhere on my face.  NO wonder my bottom nose itches because now my upper lip is infected in addition to my bottom lip!  Urgh, more places to keep an eye on and more outbreak frequencies.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from fever blisters around my mouth for YEARS...they are just an awful, painful, depressing little plague.  Well, this product really works for me to keep them at bay AND I use it in conjunction with the lysine ointment made by the same company when one flares up (that item cuts down on the healing time by at least half from 2 weeks to around 7 days, sometimes less).  This product softens lips and wards off the blisters masterfully.  I won&#x27;t be without it.  My husband gave me some \\&quot;burts bees\\&quot; lip balm for a stocking stuffer...I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell him I am addicted to this product and will use NOTHING else.  I also bombard myself with the oral lysine capsules when I first feel one tingling.  Hope this helps shoppers!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not work, actually made a cold sore appear the first day after using it!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  If you get cold sores, L-lysine will make the likelihood of getting an outbreak significantly lower.  I use this chapstick every day and also take Quantum&#x27;s L-lysine supplement, and I&#x27;ve found that these two are very effective together.  Plus, the chapstick has a very nice consistency and looks sort of like a lip gloss.  I&#x27;ve actually had people complement me on my \\&quot;lip gloss\\&quot; and ask me what brand it is because they like the way it looks.  Great product, all around.</li>
            <li> I was turned onto this product by a Whole Foods Market rep.  After telling them of my cold sore affliction and explaining how I was tired of spending money on much more expensive treatments, they recommended this.      Now, let me just say that my mother gets cold sore ALL the time.  And in the winter time, I always break out with them.     I recommend this to anyone I see because I&#x27;m so happy about its effectiveness.  This product goes on nicely and gets absorbed by your lips really well... and does NOT leave a greasy residue.      After trying this, I have NEVER had cold sores again.  Let me just repeat:  After I started to use this product, I have NEVER, ever had another cold sore.  For me, it has been a godsend.  No greasiness, no overly shiny lips, no smell -- just results.  As a male using \\&quot;lip-balm\\&quot;, this is really important to me.  This just leaves your lips looking healthy and naturally moist.    If you want an \\&quot;end all\\&quot; to lip balms, look no further.  This is the only thing you&#x27;ll need.  As an added plus, it&#x27;s green so you can easily locate it.  But after you give it a try, I&#x27;m betting you&#x27;ll buy one for your room, office, car, work, and like me, always carry one in your jacket pocket.      For the money, this is one of my favorite products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.     Think of it this way:  All of the other stuff on the market claims to cut healing time in half, etc, etc....AFTER THE FACT.   But why wait &#x27;till you got an ugly sore on your lip?  Super Lysine coldstick keeps you protected from the start, period.</li>
            <li> I really love this chapstick!!! I just ordered 2 more. My lips are always moisture! Its great.</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick for people who suffer from cold sores. I carried it on my key chain for a little while cuz I thought it was so nifty, but then I realized I looked like a walking ad for herpes. Now I just carry it in my purse or keep it around the house for anytime I feel a cold sore coming on... Definately recommend keeping one of these around!</li>
            <li> If you have a lip problem, this item will correct it in no time.  It is the best treatment I have every used and I have used a lot of different treatment.  Would highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and whenever I feel that I am starting to get a fever blister and it seems to keep them from forming (not always, but almost always).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of lip protection. Most dry them out. This is the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff is better than prescription strength ointments. I have tried a lot of OTC as well as prescription (zovirax) for cold sores and this is the best I have tried. I use it immediately and regularly when I feel one coming on and it helps so much. I find it easier to reapply during the day than the ointments which are messy and obvious that you have a big sore with shiny goo all over it. It looks and feels just like a normal chapstick but it is soothing, reduces inflammation, and redness immediately. I haven&#x27;t tried it as a prophylactic but might now that people say it works for that as well. Buy a couple and keep them handy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price.  Works great and the L Lysine helps keep cold sores away!!</li>
            <li> I like the thickness and how long this chapstick lasts. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price of 6$ and not really sure I&#x27;ll continue to buy it for that price. 2 for 6 I could see. I could buy 6 tubes of chapstick at the store for this price which would definitely last me longer than just this one! If the price was right I would have given this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Suffered many years with oral sores and they typically get worse as you age, and even with being on prescription drugs to keep them at bay, this is the best product on the market over all others to stop pain, to prevent future sores and helps prevent scarring. Everything else that makes promises including abreva is total garbage. Im also a premed student, and the ingredients in this product as well as the matching pills work better than prescriptions. Try it you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a cold sore treatment and realized it is not when I got it. Unfortunately it was not returnable so I had to keep it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 coldsticks at separate times.  I put it on my lips once everyday as a maintenance to keep the cold sore away from my lips.  I hate those ugly things and they are sore.  The product really helps and takes care of the problem very well.  I will always keep this in stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a cold sore before but when my lips started to dry out, I decided to look for a serious lip balm. I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different lip balms in the past few months, and this one was best(even beating out carmex, which used to be my favorite). It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation like many products with fragrance and flavor and makes lips look healthy. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this one from now on.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a cold sore when we purchased this. She put it on as soon as she got it and the next day she had nothing - no sore and no scabs. I&#x27;m a believer! I purchased four more for some family members and back ups.</li>
            <li> No regrets. I approve this product</li>
            <li> Great for on the go.  Glad it as UV protection.</li>
            <li> Love this for easy of application, feels smooth and nice on, and no cold sores yet! I bought one for my boyfriend, too. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told it works very well, a family member  uses it for dried out lips, years on corners.  I don&#x27;t use it so nothing more to say</li>
            <li> It works good, keeps my lips from being chapped, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent cold sores though. I&#x27;ve used it every day, morning and night and still had cold sore outbreaks. But it helps with chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I love this item, but I really don&#x27;t like how you have to spend MORE money just to get this item for the &amp;#34;add on program&amp;#34; I recently moved from CO back to IL and we don&#x27;t have a shop where I&#x27;m at that has this item and I really just want to buy it with out spending all this money!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, excellent ingredients, sun screen, moisturizes as it protects. I always order in bulk, I wish the prices were lower, they are about the same as the stores in my area. But excellent, I always make sure I have a couple of hand.</li>
            <li> Good for cold sore bearers&lt;br /&gt;Fever blister unfortunates&lt;br /&gt;Its creamy and does not dry out your lips&lt;br /&gt;I wear it every night just because</li>
            <li> This has really helped keep my cold sores at bay.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Always does the job, and easy to carry in a pocket or purse...</li>
            <li> Carry this around and always use it after eating out at restaurants. I believe  it prevents any herpes virus still lurking on glasses and silverware.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have been using for a while but can&#x27;t get it locally! Was so glad to find it at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I have used this before and think it is the best one there is. I use this all the time.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff!  I have a food allergy and when contaminated my skin breaks out in hives including my lips! I have tried neosporin, vaseline and every chapstick out there-this stuff moisturizes, soothes, has no sticky, stinky, or icky tastes or smells. I don&#x27;t leave home with out one in my purse!!</li>
            <li> easy to keep on you, even if all you have is pockets. smooth and soothing, it helps speed the healing. highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good lip balm. I love the fact that it has SPF21 in it. It was slightly waxy and left my lips feeling a little dry. It was good enough though, no unpleasant smell, didn&#x27;t leave any weird film on my lips.</li>
            <li> I have had cold sore for all of my life and in looking for L-Lysine tablets, I stumbled upon this little gem. I read the glowing reviews and tried it out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I have been cold-sore free, since, and it feels amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the best chapsticks I&#x27;ve ever used, and also keeps my lips from drying out in the winter, and from burning in the sun. It is stuffed with a crazy amount of goodies for your lips, and works incredibly. I would definitely buy again. Ha ha - in fact, I am about to now! :)</li>
            <li> It may helps prevent additional breakouts but does not reduce the time to heal the existing ones. I started using this stick as soon as I saw a little bump, but it didn&#x27;t help much. It may have reduced the healing time by about a day, that&#x27;s all I can say.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I get that tingling on or around the lips, I take the Super Lysine supplement, that worked for me. Hope they come up with a permanent cure for this virus.</li>
            <li> Does the opposite of what I bought it for. Have been using it as a preventative and I think it&#x27;s actually bringing out the cold sores. Plus this took a really long time to arrive. A week or two past the estimated delivery date which was a few weeks from when I ordered it. Go to Walgreens and get the Super Lysine ointment in a tube. I think it works better.</li>
            <li> Just in time, excellent product!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, Lysine is a great healer of lip sores and great sunscreen stick.</li>
            <li> I frequently get fever blisters but since I have been using this daily, I have not gotten any. It&#x27;s SPF 21 so I plan to continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Love the Lip Clear Coldstick it worked well at the beach.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent lip balm that has the added benefit of eliminating cold sores. I use this balm every day in addition to the Super Lysine Plus vitamin supplement and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!</li>
            <li> I used to get Cold Sores all the time. I love the Coldstick- I wear it when I feel a Cold Sore coming on (and it stops the cold sore from coming to the surface), or when I&#x27;m in the sun all day (for sun blisters) and it works! My aunt referred it to me, and I love it. Knock on wood, but I haven&#x27;t got a cold sore in almost three years since I started using this.</li>
            <li> My cold sore popped up this morning within an hour.  I&#x27;ve never had one before and it kind of freaked me out.  I stopped by whole foods market and picked up one of these bad boys.  The cold sore was almost gone within an hour of using the product.  It&#x27;s the end of the day now and I am sitting in bed (writing my first review ever), and the cold sore is ALL GONE.  I will keep using the problem as everyday chapstick to prevent chapping and future cold sores.  Don&#x27;t hesitate - it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I work outside all the time and the sun can flare up sores. This Chapstick helps prevent flare ups.</li>
            <li> Great product but just like any other lip stick it gets melt down if left under the sun.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!  I use everyday, hour, all the time.  I use to get frequent cold sores, and I think because of this stuff on my lips I have been sore free for 6 months.  If you suffer from cold sores I highly suggest getting this, some stress complex B, and Lysine pills.  Take everyday in the morning, and drink the recommended water intake.  Staying hydrated it key.  Bottom line, get this chap stick, especially for preventative measures.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly to treat cold sores - and prevents them too when used as a lip balm! I used to get colds ores every two months, now get them around once every 8 months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have had cold sores all my life and for the most part I rarely got one but once I turned 40 last October something changed and I started getting them all the time.  This year I have spent more money on generic Valtrex than I care to mention and have been taking Lysine supplements twice a day and STILL got them.  I also bought some Zoivarax cream and would use that at the first sign but it didn&#x27;t help it from erupting and it would literally take 2-3 days for the tingling to stop and I would get a small scab.  I was googling more natural remedies and came across mention of this lip balm so I ordered it.  I will have it on hand at all times from now on.  I have two tubes, one at home and one at work.  I hadn&#x27;t gotten one until last weekend when a) I forgot to take a couple of Lysine pills, b) was at the pool and didn&#x27;t have my lysine lip balm and c) got a sunburn on my lips.  So I started to get one - I didn&#x27;t have any tingling but just felt the telltale bump.  I immediately grabbed my lysine balm and slathered it on.  I also took 2 Valtrex pills (but usually those do absolutely nothing for me) and it stopped it in its tracks.  This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product ever since I first discovered it in a local health food store. I use it on plain lips and over my lipstick. I have issue with fever blisters an using this helps me. I think helps prevent lips drying out from exposure to sun and winter weather</li>
            <li> Love that it goes on so smooth and has the sunblock added in.</li>
            <li> I had a similar situation to D.M.B: this was recommended to me by a Whole Foods rep. I&#x27;m not a person who gets cold sores all the time, I believe the last one that I had appeared around five years ago. But I do know what it feels like when they&#x27;re coming in, as well as what the texture of the skin is at that stage, and I could tell that one was about to appear on my upper lip a few days ago. After rubbing this product on that spot several times a day for the past three days, I can honestly say that it did the trick - I see no sign of a sore at this point. Really surprised, I had relegated myself to the fact that I was going to be living with ugly, painful cold sore for the next couple of weeks. So relieved, and so glad that I went looking for a solution. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very effective and feels nice on the lips</li>
            <li> My son said it&#x27;s a great product, been using it a month &amp; I agree</li>
            <li> Great product.  If you get occasional cold sores this is the one to use.  My husband uses it everyday and it has really cut down on the number of sores he gets.  Clears them up fast.</li>
            <li> I suffer from these dreaded things! I&#x27;ve had to cancel dates on multiple occasions due to these horrific sores. Let me first say that I&#x27;ve tried almost everything you can think of. I&#x27;ve done so much research some remedies have helped, while others have made it worse. I&#x27;ve never actually had a cold sore disappear before it ran it&#x27;s entire course. After I applied this, within hours, I felt and saw improvement. Usually when you go to sleep, you wake up the next morning to a developed sore running its toll on you. With this, it actually never fully developed. I was amazed!!!! I also take Lysin pills, but I was taking them before and didn&#x27;t really see too much improvement; I also &amp;#34;applied Lip clear Lysing + ointment&amp;#34; which you can purchase here as well. these two seem to work great together. Certain things work well for some and not to good for others. I can say this works for me. I get about 3 a year and I hope this will stop them from developing. in 30 years this is the first time that it never fully developed, I&#x27;m buying more to keep in my work, car, and home.</li>
            <li> Very good chap stick. It has this glow to it so I don&#x27;t have to put on lipgloss when wearing. I don&#x27;t much like the smell but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> This is a lip balm so there isn&#x27;t much to say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a pro it did help get rid of my cold sore and chapped lips faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a con I didn&#x27;t really like the taste and feel of it on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are my 2 cents.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you just hate them? I know I do! I religiously would get two cold sores every year; one in the spring and one in the fall. I can&#x27;t pretend to understand why, but they were relentless and always lasted a minimum of 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago, on the advice of a friend, I began taking small amounts of l-lysine to reduce the number of canker sores I would get on the inside of my mouth (it didn&#x27;t eradicate them, but definitely reduced the amount that I would get). I noticed that when I was taking the l-lysine regularly the chances of getting a cold sore in the spring and fall were significantly reduced. Then, about 7 years ago I completely changed the way I ate and cut out processed sugars and refined flours from my diet. The first step was cutting out soda, which was very difficult to say the least! But, several months after faithfully leaving soda to the birds, I noticed that I was not getting canker sores at all anymore. Wow, what a relief! I decided to stop taking the l-lysine regularly to see if the canker sores would come back, but they never did. So in my case, the canker sores were definitely a result of the soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after I stopped taking l-lysine daily I started noticing regular recurrence of my bi-annual cold sore breakouts, which was extremely disappointing. I would take some generic l-lysine during a breakout, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to help much. I wasn&#x27;t really interested in taking it on a daily basis again to prevent future breakouts so I suffered through the breakouts for quite some time. Then during one particularly embarrassing and painful breakout, I went to my local health food market in search of a natural remedy. I had tried other expensive over-the-counter cold sore relief products like Abreva that don&#x27;t work at all, so my hopes of finding something that would work was low. But, to my surprise, and relief, I found Quantum Super Lysine Cream... and WOW, my cold sore went away in 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This got me curious about the product and I started doing a little research on the Internet. I found a forum where somebody recommended taking 3 Quantum Super Lysine Plus capsules 3 times daily as soon as the tingling of a cold sore came on (not everyone gets the tingling as a pre-warning, but fortunately I do). I decided I would give this a try during the onset of my next breakout and immediately ordered some on Amazon so that I would be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, the following November I started getting that undeniable tingle in my lower left lip. I remembered the Super Lysine Plus and immediately popped 3 capsules, repeating 3 times daily for a week. The cold sore never broke out!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing this now for a about 5 years and have been cold sore free since! This product will always have a home on the shelf of my medicine cabinet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that there was a time that I was on a trip and didn&#x27;t have my SuperLysine+ capsules, but I did have this lip balm.  I started to feel the tingling of a cold sore breakout and started using the lip cream several times a day.  Luckily the cold sore never broke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned my brother onto this remedy a few years back and he also swears by it! He used to suffer from 6-10 nasty breakouts each year that would last 7-10 days. He unfortunately doesn&#x27;t get the pre-breakout tingle warning like I do, so he can&#x27;t prevent them entirely without taking a daily capsule (which he can&#x27;t remember to do), but he has reduced his breakouts from 7-10 days to only 2-3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to anybody who suffers from cold sores to give this a try. The worst thing that can happen is that you spend 15 or so dollars and still get a cold sore. But, if you do, hopefully it will last less than the typical and dreaded 7 - 10 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I highly recommend to anybody who suffers from chronic canker sores to give up soda (regular and diet). You will be healthier and richer for it, and hopefully canker sore free like me as well!</li>
            <li> I have had cold sore on and of for almost 30 years. I told my cousin who is an infectious disease specialist at Mayo clinic that I believe I am an expert on dealing with a cold sore more that her...lol. Unfortunately I believe this is true. I use to have several breakout episodes almost every month...the worst that I hate was when one breakout almost gone and then a new one started. Some episodes can last over a month. I hate cold sore and I have tried my best to not spread it to anyone. I&#x27;ll refrain from any activities that can cause contamination during my breakout. Lately I have been eating well and get lots of sleep. The recurrence is not that frequent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything on the market and I have used a lot of antibiotic to cure it to the point that I&#x27;m afraid my kidney can&#x27;t take it anymore. The other cream on the market doesn&#x27;t work well for me. It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut the healing time. Nothing work great like this lip balm (Antibiotic still works but I don&#x27;t want to kill my kidney and liver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Lysine lip balm is a GOD SENT product for people with cold sore!!! Since I found this I have used it regularly (but not everyday since I often forgot - in average 3-4 days a week) to prevent a breakout. So far it works well. The previous time I had was over 2 years ago. And now that it has just occurred (today is day 3 of the breakout), I use it from the very second I felt it. It stops the burn sensation immediately. Coldsore still develops but it never gets crazy big. I keep applying it a multiple times a day and I never feel the burn sensation. My lips feel great. Although the coldsore is not completely dry yet but it works much faster than other cr&amp;egrave;mes I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the clear balm make the spot not showing as much since the whole lips are shiny (not overly) and look natural. When I used those white cream in the past, it made the coldsore shown so obvious as it screamed &amp;#34;Look at me!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this lipbalm (using separate q-tip for prevention) all over my lips and my lips look normal and you can hardly tell that I have a breakout. This is the best product ever for coldsore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the Lysine pill version as I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant and I don&#x27;t know if that will be safe for pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I have one of these lip balms in my purse all the time so I can use it as soon as I feel a nudge. I also keep one in my office and one on my bedside table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lip balm to cure and prevent cold sore.ly this lipbalm (using separate q-tip for prevention) all over my lips and my lips look normal and you can hardly tell that I have a breakout. This is the best product ever for coldsore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the Lysine pill version as I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant and I don&#x27;t know if that will be safe for pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I have one of these lip balms in my purse all the time so I can use it as soon as I feel a nudge. I also keep one in my office and one on my bedside table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lip balm to cure and prevent cold sore.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this as a chapstick, it made my lips feel more dry, so I stopped using it.  Then I got a cold sore, so I dug around for it and started putting just on the sore.  It really hasn&#x27;t made a difference.  I&#x27;m healing at the same rate I would without using anything.</li>
            <li> For starters, I&#x27;m pretty leery of any review for a health-related product because there are so many fake reviews. This was low cost and as anyone who has a cold sores knows, I was desperate for any potential solution. I&#x27;ve never had a cold sore in my life until this winter at age 42. I&#x27;ve had 3 sore sores since September and the last time my lip got so infected that I ended up getting an anti-biotic script from my doctor. It seemed like it was working and then on about day 8 (of 10), it came back in full force. I can&#x27;t say for sure that this product is what finally got rid of my cold sore but it seems likely. I was using various other ointments for weeks and they would initially improve things but then it would get bad again. My cold sore was completely gone within a few days after I started using Super Lysine. Time will tell if using this will help prevent recurrences.</li>
            <li> I get terrible cold sores that swell my whole face up and bust open. It&#x27;s painful and embarrassing. When I feel one coming on I go for anything in this brand. If I take the super lysine orally and put the cream on my lips, I can get rid of it before it surfaces. So much better than abreva and so in-expensive compared to the normal colds ore products. I always keep this stuff on hand!</li>
            <li> I know there are many of these types of products out on the market with the Lysine, but this is my favorite.  Seems to be a great blend and definitely works and makes a difference with lip cold sores.  Seems to help heal them very quickly.  I have heard using this on a daily basis can actually help prevent cold sores, but I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis, so I can&#x27;t say yes or no to that.  Definite recommend.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t do much to help heal your coldsore blister, but it will help prevent it from cracking.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically just a lipbalm with vitamins that are meant to assist the healing, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Love doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe what I feel about this product. Haven&#x27;t had a cold sore since using it daily. Taste is not off putting and has a nice sheen to it. A bit expensive but for me, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Lysine  lip balm is the best on the market. My husband always had a problem with Cold sores, but Not anymore.Since he has used this Never got another one!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> i used this product after reading a few reviews on it and decided to take a chance on it. I had just had a cold sore and it was healed so i tried this product and before i knew it i woke up with another cold sore i thought it would at least helped suppressed the cold sore but it didn&#x27;t. This product is useless and a waste of my money. I do not recommend this for anyone that suffers with a cold sore.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Very effective!</li>
            <li> Ok, so like most people I am totally fed up with coldsores, non working remedies, and promises that don&#x27;t come true.  I&#x27;m also tired of spending money on ointments, creams, etc...  that do nothing.  I bought this because of the reviews, and the price.  I also bought the Super Lysine pills.  No sooner did I receive these items and BANG..... coldsore tingle.  I immediately put this on the area (around my nostril) and popped 3 of the pills.  I continued to use this about 5 times a day and I popped the 3 pills per day for 3 days.  OMG..... 3 days later the coldsore (which never really came out) was gone.  GONE.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  This stuff works.  As I mentioned I used the pills as well.</li>
            <li> I  got this after reading lots of reviews saying  it&#x27;ll make it so  you get no more cold sores...I  like that it  has sunscreen in it,  doesn&#x27;t taste  great,  but as  in no  cold sores I  haven&#x27;t used it  long enough to tell....?  that&#x27;s why I  only gave it 4stars</li>
            <li> After suffering with cold sores for many years i have finally found a lip balm that keeps them away!&lt;br /&gt;The balm itself doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell and absorbs into the lips keeping them soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had a cold sore since using this every day and recently bought one for my friend who was going through chemo and suffering badly with cold sores. She was amazed at how quickly hers cleared up and has not had one since using this. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!! It is the best!! I definately recommend it. I haven&#x27;t had anything since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this after getting cold sore after cold sore with no avail. This is great for everyday use and has seemed to keep the cold sore count way down. I use this with a lysine supplement and I have only had one in 2 months and it used to be one every-other week. The only time I have had one is because of an actual illness, not for no apparent reason. I feel as if that kind of cold sore is hard to combat. Overall, I really like this product!</li>
            <li> This is by far the most effective way to guard against cold sores. Coupled with a daily Lysine suppliment in the morning &amp; evening I haven&#x27;t had one in years. They are a bit on the pricey side but it&#x27;s completely worth it to me to have that extra guard against those annoying little nuisances. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Excellent product -- my second order!!!</li>
            <li> The list of in credits in the product description is NOT the list of in credits on the actual product. I purchased this SPECIFICALLY for the zinc oxide. GUESS WHAT? No zinc oxide in it. It uses other chemical sunscreens (some linked to cancer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go, Jeff! Go fly your drone...</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. I brought it because my lips have been very dry this winter and everything I was using was not working. But I like QH products overall. It is very shiny so I try to put a little on but it still give bit of a shine. I prefer the flavored versions has a better scent to them. I would continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> i use this on every skin abrasion - takes out sting and rushes healing</li>
            <li> As someone who has chapped lips regardless of season, and also tend to get cold sores it not attended to promptly, I was psyched to see a chapstick with the added benefit of Lysine in it.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than other chapstick brands but it is WORTH IT.  It&#x27;s not too slimy, not too waxy, doesn&#x27;t taste weird or any of the other usual issues that can be hand with chapsticks.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> had a cold sore in the making stopped it in its tracks  fastest healing i&#x27;ve ever had  even with the one advertised and previously purchased  at walmart that is over 15 dollars</li>
            <li> I kept getting cold sores, and now I just use this daily, and haven&#x27;t had one in ages. FYI: chapped lips from cold weather and wind can get a cold sore started, as well as being out in the sun and getting dry lips. If you get one, this stick will help it clear up faster and soothe the soreness.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and gives your lips a glossy look to them!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product, it works great and looks great on my lips (all shiny and smooth)</li>
            <li> Tastes ok, prevents cold sores!! Love it and would definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Turning the knob at the bottom of the tube dosen&#x27;t push the stick out. To get a replacement I have to pay return postage. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> He uses this for when he goes in the sun to help prevent an outbreak, so far so good, but haven&#x27;t used enough to tell of it&#x27;s really working or not, so it&#x27;s hard to review, I&#x27;ll edit this post in a few months (he usually will have an outbreak every month or two,)</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this product was made with Lysine - an actual vitamin - and in a chapped stick formula - so it&#x27;s easy to use and to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here on Amazon and was dubious... how could a lip balm really defend against dreaded cold cores, which I have suffered from for a few years on a semi-regular basis.  Well, I&#x27;m delighted to report that I haven&#x27;t had a single sore since I started using this product.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  If I continue to stay cold sore free, there&#x27;s no way I will ever stop ordering it.</li>
            <li> I usually take lysine every months in the winter, but forgot this winter and got a cold sore. I got a good one and was using some other stuff that did not work(it came a lot quicker than this did, shipping from this is slow). The other stuff just seemed to keep the cold sore going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does work. Spreads on smooth with no smell. Started clearing up right away and has gotten 80% better in one day. Dries up the sore and keeps it from spreading. Reduces size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff for AFTER you have one.</li>
            <li> I had even resorted to taking Valtrex every single day to keep from getting Cold Sores.  They were starting literally every few weeks-they are unattractive and distract me from my work throughout the day.  I now use this in the morning and at night and in the middle of the day if my lips are a little dry.  I have not had a single cold sore since.  I found the other positive reviews hard to believe-but they are true.  This is a great product.</li>
