            <li>The Lumene product is just wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I thought it was a great buy</li>

            <li>I love it, and it doesnt cause breakouts!</li>
            <li>Great deal and great product and fast ship!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay serum...</li>
            <li>I prefer the Olay Pro-X line and the Olay Regenerist Serums much better.</li>
            <li>If I had to recommend one (and I&#x27;ve used Loreal, Lumene, Olay, and so many others), I would recommend Olay brand products.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems to love it.</li>
            <li>So, glad I am able to get this online, as it is no longer sold in my drugstore, or cosmetic store.</li>
            <li>ok item, havent seen any drastic changes</li>
            <li>I received this product today and the bottle is two-thirds full, I wonder why-maybe it was used as a sample.</li>
            <li>Put it on a freshly washed face and then put on a layer of face cream</li>
            <li>This product is not as good as Lumene other serum, I have not seen any difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product up to my expectations and the price very reasonable</li>
            <li>I have used this serum for years and like it very much</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t make much of a noticeable difference, but it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and is cheaper than the Olay lines.</li>
            <li>I am wondering if this is true of all bottles of this specific item, particularly since others have also found this to be the case.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like it creates new skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I think I received a bottle that was half full!</li>
            <li>this product was half full when I received it.  </li>
            <li>bottles were half full</li>
            <li>Container was half full</li>
            <li>I have found this serum to be equal to the very expensive department store serums and have used it for years with great results.  </li>
            <li>This bottle was slightly less than half full.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;However, I think I received a bottle that was half full!</li>
            <li> this product was half full when I received it.  </li>
            <li> bottles were half full</li>

            <li> /&gt;The real reason I am giving this a one star, the bottles  were half empty.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several other Lumene anti-aging products from Amazon in the past, and I have never received a bottle that was less than full.  </li>
            <li> I put this on every night during the fall/winter to help prevent lines from dry, weathered skin.</li>
            <li> The consistency was different from the bottle I already had, so I&#x27;m not sure why..</li>
            <li> However, it does not negate the fact that the bottle was not full when purchased.</li>
            <li> I have been using it nightly for the past week.</li>
            <li> in the face at least</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>

            <li> I love this product. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 23 and I use this stuff, I can&#x27;t describe how it makes my skin look and feel. It&#x27;s like it creates new skin. Gonna be 23 forever baby....in the face at least</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay serum...I prefer the Olay Pro-X line and the Olay Regenerist Serums much better. This one didn&#x27;t make much of a noticeable difference, but it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and is cheaper than the Olay lines.

            <li> The best stuff out there for your skin. Love it</li>
            <li> I received this product today and the bottle is two-thirds full, I wonder why-maybe it was used as a sample. I purchased this because the price was low and I thought it was a great buy, now I&#x27;m thinking if the price of a face product is too low I won&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...this product was half full when I received it.  I do like the way it makes my face feel. However, it does not negate the fact that the bottle was not full when purchased.</li>
            <li> Again, I don&#x27;t remember</li>
            <li> Lumene products are affordable and they work well for me.  I use everything from their cleanser and toner duos, makeup remover, and moisturizers. Trying this item now and seeing good results.</li>
            <li> I put this on every night during the fall/winter to help prevent lines from dry, weathered skin. I love it, and it doesnt cause breakouts!</li>
            <li> This bottle was slightly less than half full.  I am wondering if this is true of all bottles of this specific item, particularly since others have also found this to be the case.  I have purchased several other Lumene anti-aging products from Amazon in the past, and I have never received a bottle that was less than full.  If in fact the amount of fluid in the bottle is not intended to be 1.0 oz as stated on the bottle, I would not want to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ll try something else in the future</li>
            <li> bottles were half full it was a ripoff</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I find the quality of  this product up to my expectations and the price very reasonable</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;However, I think I received a bottle that was half full!</li>
            <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very happy with serum. My skin seems to love it. I have been using it nightly for the past week.</li>
            <li> The consistency was different from the bottle I already had, so I&#x27;m not sure why..</li>
            <li> I have found this serum to be equal to the very expensive department store serums and have used it for years with great results.  Highly recommend.  Put it on a freshly washed face and then put on a layer of face cream you will be amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> So, glad I am able to get this online, as it is no longer sold in my drugstore, or cosmetic store. Don&#x27;t know why?</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as Lumene other serum, I have not seen any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I am giving this a one star, the bottles  were half empty.</li>
            <li> Not for me. Container was half full</li>
            <li> The Lumene product is just wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for years and like it very much</li>
