            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love pinksugar but not this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It  is one of those perfumes that is a warm comforting scent.</li>
            <li>it kind of has a coconut smell.</li>
            <li>layers well over my warm vanilla sugar lotion.</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;d get a whiff of something nice, but close up</li>
            <li>I think Gold Sugar is a VERY strong perfume...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so strong!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love the powdery drydown.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think it is more of a fall or winter sort of scent because of the way it makes me feel.</li>
            <li>Purchase more for my friends</li>
            <li>they love how it smells.</li>
            <li>The lasting power isn&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li>Everything worked and was of top quality upon arrival.</li>
            <li>This is even better.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>this one is more sophisticated and earthier.</li>
            <li>this will be one of my most used scents.</li>
            <li>This smells just as sugary but has a sexy amber musk, vanilla-y creamy undertone, with the wafting scent of coconut.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>People like walking by me and smelling baked goods. :)</li>
            <li>I love this perfume but its takes time to get used to.</li>
            <li>As a teacher, it helps-my students are more prone to listen and do work in the event</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a warn sweet sexy comforting kind of scent.</li>
            <li>I smell lime &amp; coconut, then warms to a nice sweet limey sandalwood.</li>
            <li>This is  sweet  and warm.</li>
            <li>Its very strong and extremely sweet.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the creme brulee, strong, creamy gourmand a lot of others describe from this scent.</li>
            <li>They started out strong, and one of them irritated my throat.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful, the packaging is solid.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy wearing it though.</li>
            <li>Smells like a cheap perfume to me.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely enjoy this for years to come.</li>
            <li>I think I would enjoy it if it weren&#x27;t for that note.  </li>
            <li>Its a mix of strong and sweet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the scent of this one yet, but it&#x27;s a good  value and good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique</li>
            <li>I do still prefer the original though.</li>
            <li>On me it is a fresh sugar scent that isn&#x27;t overly strong.</li>
            <li>I would almost describe it as a sweet clean scent.</li>
            <li>Like all aquolina &amp;#34;sugar&amp;#34; scents, it is sweet.</li>
            <li>Aquolina smells tend to be too sweet for me</li>
            <li>For the price I am very happy with this purchase and glad I took the risk on a blind buy.</li>
            <li>but it, too, dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>just as nice as pink sugar, maybe even a bit better.</li>
            <li>The reason for the 4 stars is that is wears off really quickly.</li>
            <li>Fun, young, fresh, easy, carefree, light...not a sexy scent...</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time as well, always a good quality in a scent.</li>
            <li>This is sweet and playful but yet adult fitting lasting scent very enjoyable</li>
            <li>Actually Blue Sugar is becoming my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>not as good as the original pink sugar, but definitely smells nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a warm scent.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, it does smell a little more grown up than the original, but pink is still my favorite!</li>
            <li>goes on very strong, I would only recommend a squirt or two.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even really describe the smell of this perfume except that it is strong and very musky.  </li>
            <li>Love this version; it&#x27;s like the original Pink Sugar mixed with a warm vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled at such a large amount for the price.  </li>
            <li>A bit different than the original pink sugar, but smells great.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the scent very much</li>
            <li>I first tried this fragrance while shopping in Ulta.  </li>
            <li>I was guessing based on reviews it would be like pink sugar and warm vanilla.</li>
            <li>Later, the scents were better after they lightened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery was pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>I love the whole Pink Sugar line, and this one fits right in....</li>
            <li>Was a much bigger size than expected and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I purchased this on a whim because I enjoyed Pink Sugar so much.</li>
            <li>I want to put on my favorite sweater and cozy up to a fire next to the one I love.</li>
            <li>bought this because I love Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like either one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite is still pink</li>
            <li>It might be a little too sweet for some, but if you like sweet and sugary scents, this is it!</li>
            <li>I love the perfume from Aquolina, I regularly use the original pink sugar.</li>
            <li>actually like it much better than the original Pink  Sugar.</li>
            <li>It is very different than the original.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Women over 30 years old can wear this! !</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see the liquid with the Gold Sugar, and when I sprayed, it had only a slight scent, albeit a nice scent</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of Pink Sugar and Aquolina in general</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the entire Pink sugar line..</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter</li>
            <li>but it smells like old lady and that aussie from the 90&#x27;s hair gel.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t smell the coconut very much, but once I read cr&amp;egrave;me brulee listed as a key note I totally got it.</li>
            <li>Having been wearing the Pink Sugar for over 10 years, when opening the Pink package,I immediately noticed the dark and dingy coloring of the liquid and confirmed when spraying that the scent bore non resemblance whatsoever to Pink Sugar--it also dissipated within seconds (real Pink Sugar has a long-lasting, great scent).</li>
            <li>Everything was soaked, the product wasn&#x27;t packed right at all, more than half of the bottle is empty, I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li>Apparently, this issue happens often here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gold Sugar has a sweet, coconut, whipped cream scent on me, with something bitter in it that ruins it for me.  </li>
            <li>If I had to rank them this would come in 3rd scent wise!</li>

            <li> If I had to rank them this would come in 3rd scent wise!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I LOVE the regular Pink Sugar and thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> The bottle which is suppose to be gold, has peeled away completely and turned silver, the scent does not last as long as my previous Gold Rush did.</li>
            <li> i have blue and pink sugar</li>
            <li> If you like Pink Sugar, you should definitely check Gold Sugar out.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> more of an everyday, casual scent.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s old stock, not sure.</li>
            <li> Nothing compared to pink sugar</li>
            <li> I would spray a generous amount on every morning, being careful not to overdue it.  </li>
            <li> (Pink Sugar turns my stomach and gives me a headache even from across the room)</li>
            <li> I ordered both the Pink and Gold Sugar.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar pales in comparison to this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely in your face with a sugary musk that takes a few seconds to recover from, but once it dries on your skin the vanilla and citrus start to take over.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Pink Sugar but with a funky twist thrown in the mix.  </li>
            <li> I tried this and Pink Sugar.  </li>
            <li> I am a big FAN of Amazon, and I tend to trust their seller, but unfortunately it has failed me, as I honestly believe I got a bootleg product from this seller.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s either expired or watered down, very disappointing.</li>

            <li> Great scent to wear in summer. Fun, young, fresh, easy, carefree, light...not a sexy scent...more of an everyday, casual scent. Very current.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Nothing compared to pink sugar</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet,  creamy coconut citrus scent that&#x27;s perfect for summer. I love the powdery drydown. aquolina&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Mmmm smells just like sugar! !&lt;br /&gt;Women over 30 years old can wear this! ! Smells amazing! I would totally recommend this! !</li>
            <li> This is a great spray! Smells so good! It&#x27;s great for any age too! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this great fragrance!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I first tried this fragrance while shopping in Ulta.  I thought it was the best thing I have ever smelled.  I immediately jumped on Amazon and ordered it.  The shipping was super fast and I immediately started using it.  I would spray a generous amount on every morning, being careful not to overdue it.  The scent just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the entire Pink sugar line..This is sweet and playful but yet adult fitting lasting scent very enjoyable</li>
            <li> I smell so yummy, I could eat myself up. Buttery, caramel, and praline scent. I love it. I even wear it to bed.</li>
            <li> Gift for granddaughter.  She is happy to have it.</li>
            <li> Love gold sugar! It  is one of those perfumes that is a warm comforting scent. I want to put on my favorite sweater and cozy up to a fire next to the one I love. It&#x27;s a warn sweet sexy comforting kind of scent. I think it is more of a fall or winter sort of scent because of the way it makes me feel. It sort of smells like a roasted marshmallow. That may not intrigue you but I get a lot of compliments and I&#x27;ve already ordered my second bottle. It&#x27;s unique</li>
            <li> I have bought Gold Sugar before from stores, and UNFORTUNATELY I feel like this seller sells COUNTERFEIT versions of it.  The bottle which is suppose to be gold, has peeled away completely and turned silver, the scent does not last as long as my previous Gold Rush did. I am a big FAN of Amazon, and I tend to trust their seller, but unfortunately it has failed me, as I honestly believe I got a bootleg product from this seller. DO NOT BUY IT</li>
            <li> Poroduct was packaged well, but 1/4-1/3 of the perfume had leaked out through the seal causing the gold metallic of the cap to peel off everywhere. I was not able to gift this item as intended. Can&#x27;t return because it is perfume/no return policy. I just have to keep it. Scent is vanilla, coconut. Very disappointed in condition of product received.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected! Was a much bigger size than expected and smells amazing! Only regret is i should have bought two!</li>
            <li> Like all aquolina &amp;#34;sugar&amp;#34; scents, it is sweet. Gold sugar has a warmer scent to it though. I love it!</li>
            <li> Omg. I had to cut it from the tube it was stuck! I don&#x27;t like the scent very much it&#x27;s so strong! I can&#x27;t put my finger on it but it smells like old lady and that aussie from the 90&#x27;s hair gel. I love pinksugar but not this! I was guessing based on reviews it would be like pink sugar and warm vanilla.</li>
            <li> Luv, luv, luv this perfume. It&#x27;s the best. Delivery was pretty fast too. Purchase more for my friends bc they love how it smells.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the creme brulee, strong, creamy gourmand a lot of others describe from this scent. On me it is a fresh sugar scent that isn&#x27;t overly strong. I&#x27;m a big fan of this one! To me it smells like white sugar and reminds me a lot of a sugar scented candle I had years ago. Aquolina smells tend to be too sweet for me (Pink Sugar turns my stomach and gives me a headache even from across the room) but this one is softer and pleasant. I would almost describe it as a sweet clean scent. The lasting power isn&#x27;t the best so I did dock one star for this. I get 2-3 hours before it is totally gone. For the price I am very happy with this purchase and glad I took the risk on a blind buy.</li>
            <li> Everything worked and was of top quality upon arrival. Thanks...would use again.</li>
            <li> I ordered both the Pink and Gold Sugar. Having been wearing the Pink Sugar for over 10 years, when opening the Pink package,I immediately noticed the dark and dingy coloring of the liquid and confirmed when spraying that the scent bore non resemblance whatsoever to Pink Sugar--it also dissipated within seconds (real Pink Sugar has a long-lasting, great scent). It&#x27;s either expired or watered down, very disappointing. Since I&#x27;d never smelled Gold Sugar, I had no reference point but had heard it was great. You can&#x27;t see the liquid with the Gold Sugar, and when I sprayed, it had only a slight scent, albeit a nice scent but it, too, dissipated quickly. After reading a reviewer&#x27;s advice to contact cust. service as they did to receive a refund, I did that. I was offered either a refund or an exchange and opted for the refund, since I&#x27;d read exchanges were just as bad. I&#x27;m just happy I was able to resolve the issue through an online chat within 20 minutes and received my refund within two days. Apparently, this issue happens often here. I should have read all reviews before ordering. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> That is what Gold Sugar is, and Amazon&#x27;s price, as well.  I&#x27;m thrilled at such a large amount for the price.  If you like Gold  Sugar, this is where to get it.</li>
            <li> Smells good! It&#x27;s a bit spicy, almost smells like a men&#x27;s cologne. I still enjoy wearing it though. It is very different than the original.</li>
            <li> wonderful, warm smell, I always get compliments on it&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I love Pink Sugar. This is even better.</li>
            <li> i have blue and pink sugar so i had to get this one. i love it. just as nice as pink sugar, maybe even a bit better. this one is more sophisticated and earthier. this will be one of my most used scents. A+</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I LOVE the regular Pink Sugar and thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  I get compliments on it all the time.  I can&#x27;t even really describe the smell of this perfume except that it is strong and very musky.  Smells like a cheap perfume to me.  I don&#x27;t smell any of the smells that it is described by.</li>
            <li> A bit different than the original pink sugar, but smells great. I do still prefer the original though.</li>
            <li> Love this version; it&#x27;s like the original Pink Sugar mixed with a warm vanilla scent. Lasts a long time as well, always a good quality in a scent.</li>
            <li> arrived in a timely fashion. not as good as the original pink sugar, but definitely smells nice. goes on very strong, I would only recommend a squirt or two. lasts for hours. DOES NOT SMELL LIKE BROWN SUGAR, SO IF THAT IS WHAT YOURE GOING FOR, DONT PURCHASE THIS. it kind of has a coconut smell.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Pink Sugar line, and this one fits right in.... Love the smell, it does smell a little more grown up than the original, but pink is still my favorite! Actually Blue Sugar is becoming my all time favorite. If I had to rank them this would come in 3rd scent wise!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim because I enjoyed Pink Sugar so much. Pink Sugar pales in comparison to this. This smells just as sugary but has a sexy amber musk, vanilla-y creamy undertone, with the wafting scent of coconut. Hours later theres that lingering subtle scent of creame and coconut and I love it. I&#x27;m a big fan of gouramands and scents such as this, so if this is your thing it WILL NOT dissapoint. Will definitely enjoy this for years to come.</li>
            <li> Usually wear Pink Sugar, and purchased this based on reviews. Starts tropical I smell lime &amp; coconut, then warms to a nice sweet limey sandalwood. Reminds me of Summer nights.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.  People like walking by me and smelling baked goods. :)</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful, the packaging is solid. I love the perfume from Aquolina, I regularly use the original pink sugar. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the scent of this one yet, but it&#x27;s a good  value and good quality.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of Pink Sugar and Aquolina in general but oh my, my, my this perfume smells AMAZING! Its a mix of strong and sweet I love it!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really great, believe me it spilled all over the packaging and the bottle. Everything was soaked, the product wasn&#x27;t packed right at all, more than half of the bottle is empty, I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I think Gold Sugar is a VERY strong perfume...but in a really good, delicious way! It&#x27;s definitely in your face with a sugary musk that takes a few seconds to recover from, but once it dries on your skin the vanilla and citrus start to take over. Reminds me of Pink Sugar but with a funky twist thrown in the mix.  I can&#x27;t smell the coconut very much, but once I read cr&amp;egrave;me brulee listed as a key note I totally got it. Smells like an intoxicating dessert.  I can&#x27;t wait to wear this in the winter - it&#x27;s such a warm scent.  If you like Pink Sugar, you should definitely check Gold Sugar out.</li>
            <li> Just  received this  and it is beautiful! I  actually like it much better than the original Pink  Sugar. This is  sweet  and warm. .Really  layers well over my warm vanilla sugar lotion.</li>
            <li> Love love love the smell of this!!! The reason for the 4 stars is that is wears off really quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried this and Pink Sugar.  I didn&#x27;t really like either one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both lasted about the same amount of time.  They started out strong, and one of them irritated my throat.  Or both.  I&#x27;ll have to test them again on separate days.  Later, the scents were better after they lightened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Sugar has a sweet, coconut, whipped cream scent on me, with something bitter in it that ruins it for me.  It resembles grapefruit but not good.  I think I would enjoy it if it weren&#x27;t for that note.  I also got a plastic/synthetic smell the closer I got to it.  Every now and then I&#x27;d get a whiff of something nice, but close up it was not good.  Maybe it&#x27;s old stock, not sure.</li>
            <li> My favorite is still pink</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but its takes time to get used to. Its very strong and extremely sweet.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!! I personally like walking around smelling like a sugar cookie. As a teacher, it helps-my students are more prone to listen and do work in the event I actually have a cookie in my pocket. It might be a little too sweet for some, but if you like sweet and sugary scents, this is it! I love it! (Did I say that already?)</li>
