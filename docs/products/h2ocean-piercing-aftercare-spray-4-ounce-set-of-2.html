            <li>then my first purchase and you get two for just a little over what I paid for one and they ship quickly.</li>
            <li>I also use a lot of plain hot water soaks too.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean is seriously the easiest method in which to clean, and is the only thing my piercings seem to ease with whenever they flare up!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Everything was great.  The product showed up on time!  Great dealings.</li>
            <li> Works well for a nose piercing and travel.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really helped my piercings&#x27; healing process</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find out about this product until after I got my industrial piercing and did some additional research.  I wish I had this when the original piercing was done. I had just run out when I placed the order and as fate would have it the next morning I woke up with my piercing bothering me. I was at work hoping it would come soon and it did. I was surprised at how quickly I received. I opened and sprayed. Within minutes the ear was better !!! I would recommend this product and this seller. The price is much more reasonable then my first purchase and you get two for just a little over what I paid for one and they ship quickly.</li>
            <li> This is great &amp; so convenient. I can take it with me &amp; spray my piercings whenever I need to.</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps heal piercings fast and relieves pain naturally!</li>
            <li> This stuff has rescued my two almost-botched piercings. I also used it on my toddlers infected cut, and it cleared it right up. I will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> I got triple helix piercings on both of my ears about 3 months ago. If anyone has or has ever had multiple cartilage piercings, you know how slowly they heal, how painful cleaning can be, and how easily irritated they can get! H2Ocean is seriously the easiest method in which to clean, and is the only thing my piercings seem to ease with whenever they flare up! What&#x27;s the best about this product is that it contains enzymes and other natural components that promote healing. If you want to ease irritation and prevent infection, definitely invest in H2Ocean, the price is worth it!</li>
            <li> Dependable product.  Best for cleaning. bargain price.</li>
            <li> Great saline spray for piercings. I just got my cartilage pierced in June of this year and I originally bought this from the tattoo parlor, but I ran out so I just ordered more on here through Amazon since it was a little cheaper...at the tattoo shop its $10 a bottle and online here in $17 and change for two bottles. This stuff is amazing it definitely helps keep my piercings clean and helps to heal it. You can also use a regular wound wash saline as well but they always come in bigger sizes like 7 or 8oz, whereas this comes in 4oz size which I find easier to hold at an angle and spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff--I always use saline sprays for all my piercings. I have 6 piercings, two in both ear lobes, one in cartilage, and navel pierced and none of my piercings have ever gotten infected using saline sprays. I also use a lot of plain hot water soaks too.</li>
            <li> Men. I heard great things so I got these for my ear piercing, but they are very messy. I felt like s lot of product was wasted by dripping down off my ear. And when dried it leaves white crusty salt residue. I ended up spraying onto cotten then applying, then rincing skin with water to avoid residue. Purhaps that&#x27;s how its meant to be done (onto cotton) but then I don&#x27;t know why its airesol. I switched to other products and didn&#x27;t finish these.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product for the price I paid for it. I got my bellybutton pierced in August and this (as well as sea salt soaks) has been my main way of keeping my piercing clean. It is very convenient to bring around with me so I can clean it when I need to no matter where I am. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is such great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great! Came in on time and worked just as well as the ones I buy from piercing stores.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff.  Even though it&#x27;s been months since her piercings, she still uses it to clean her piercings.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awsome, it heals my piercings and keeps them clean.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product only one bottle would spray</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and just as promised, two unopened, sterile H20cean bottles. Great to keep this handy for new and healed piercings alike</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this product three stars and not five is b/c although I did receiveI them on time, the products were dirty like they had been thrown around in the dirt. There was nothing wrong with the packaging, just the products themselves, which made me skeptical on using them and left me wondering whether they were new or not.</li>
            <li> Great product for piercing aftercare, much easier than a salt water soak for areas not easily submerged, i.e. industrials.</li>
