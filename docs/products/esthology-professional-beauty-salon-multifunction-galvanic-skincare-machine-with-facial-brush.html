            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this machine for my own and family treatments.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot to know for this machine to be effective.   </li>
            <li>And it would be nice if they had an instruction</li>
            <li>once you know how to use it, it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have been getting facials for many years and said what the heck with this economy might as well just buy one for home.....  </li>
            <li>Love it everything I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Do people buying this machine realize that the HF needs to be grounded before touching the skin?  </li>
            <li>I was accustomed to working with equipment that was much more costly through school.</li>
            <li>booklet.&lt;br /&gt;Other than those two things I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>many thanks, I love and am very happy with the product obtained, very fast delivery and satisfactory.</li>
            <li>The quality of the machine seems fine, however, given the nature of the machine it is important that it comes with a user manual.</li>
            <li>Electric modalities are not to be taken lightly.  </li>
            <li>and I love the High Frequency</li>
            <li>Although, I would have given  the shipper/ manufacturer a better rating ,  I am familiar with how to use the different functions, if the company could have provided an instructional booklet for the use of their particular machine.</li>
            <li>I had to find out how to use it by watching many different videos on You Tube.</li>
            <li>the high frequency part, super simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That the galvanic grounding electrode needs to be moistened by covering with a moist gauze or sponge while being held before applying the positive electrode to the skin?  </li>
            <li>For the money, or more, it seems well worth the price compared to other machines.  </li>
            <li>There was no user manual, but being familiar with similar machines, I could have figured it out, but I still don&#x27;t know how to use the suction part exactly.</li>
            <li>I will very appreciate it....</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really even used this yet because there is no users manual/instructions.</li>
            <li>Trying to find some before I really use everything.</li>
            <li>This equipment is essential for advanced skin care therapy.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It needs to come with a hand book with much needed info, and include replacement part info.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can really zap ya!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is very affordable for what it</li>
            <li>would have given 5 stars, but the packaging was cracked for the glass implements, although they were not broken.  </li>
            <li>There were no instructions, but being familiar with similar machines, I could have figured it out.</li>
            <li>dissapointed about the suction, but my main reason for the purchace was the high frequency and galvantic.</li>
            <li>careful when you first start using it, make sure it is on a low setting, particularly for the Galvanic treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The suction can also be very damaging and scarring to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>(It has symbols where each of the devices plug in)&lt;br /&gt;Package was however missing one or more of the plugs that go from machine to plugins.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for a newly licensed esthetician as a starter device.</li>
            <li>The machine came quick not much detail instructions</li>
            <li>Steer clear of purchasing this machine and this company.</li>
            <li>Even so, be mindful that the professional equipment you may have used before was probably different, so this machine will take some practice to get used to using.</li>
            <li>The product did not come with instructions that are complete enough/ and or manufacturer specific, therefore leaving things to the imagination.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting such a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy, sturdy and very professional looking.</li>

            <li> Hi... I just bought this machine, but i have no idea how to use it.... if someone has a manual or a video tutorial how to use it I will very appreciate it.... PLEASE HELP ME!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy, sturdy and very professional looking. I&#x27;m an esthetician student and I&#x27;m very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I bought in December 2011 and it has been working perfect.  My clients are very happy with the treatments they have been receiving. I haven&#x27;t found any difference with the one I was using at school.</li>
            <li> i am an esthetician, the machine works great, except the suction. The suction doesnt work at all. The case where the glass electrodes came in was cracked but the electrodes were in tact. dissapointed about the suction, but my main reason for the purchace was the high frequency and galvantic.</li>
            <li> Stop working and will not replace item not available</li>
            <li> I have been getting facials for many years and said what the heck with this economy might as well just buy one for home.....  The machine came quick not much detail instructions but there is You Tube and other sights.  Everything works great and I love the High Frequency my pores have already been reduced in about a week.  I wake up and go to bed with my creams and then use HF to soak it in.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions, but being familiar with similar machines, I could have figured it out. (It has symbols where each of the devices plug in)&lt;br /&gt;Package was however missing one or more of the plugs that go from machine to plugins. There are packages for sale in the same price range that will have all the parts to use the machine&#x27;s total set of functions so after inventory of the parts,  I returned the machine and will buy another one.</li>
            <li> Is not good confuse to use it and no manual inside.............so I return it but I recive on time ...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really even used this yet because there is no users manual/instructions. Trying to find some before I really use everything. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The machine did not live up to its description. There is very little power, the merchandise is shoddy, and the operating instructions are extremely limited. I returned the machine to Mix Wholesale over six weeks ago and never received a refund. I called the company and the Customer Service rep I spoke to was not helpful in the least. In fact, she was VERY RUDE.  Steer clear of purchasing this machine and this company.</li>
            <li> I have tested the product and it works quite well. very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Is a good machine and I like it because it has several funtions but disgust me a little that I miss one of the high frecuency accessory.</li>
            <li> Love it everything I thought it would be</li>
            <li> This equipment is essential for advanced skin care therapy.  I did a lot of research on which product to purchase, weighed it with the price, and took into consideration what facial devices I already had.  The multifunctions of the machine are working wonderfully.  There are no instructions, so it is a must that you know what your are doing before purchasing something like this.  Even so, be mindful that the professional equipment you may have used before was probably different, so this machine will take some practice to get used to using.</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician.  I do not practice any longer.  I bought this machine for my own and family treatments.  For the money, or more, it seems well worth the price compared to other machines.  Electric modalities are not to be taken lightly.  You could kill a person by using galvanic current on a person with a pacemaker.  You can burn a persons skin and scar them with electrical burns.  This machine can be very dangerous if you haven&#x27;t been trained to use it properly.  It can also be useless if the appropriate products aren&#x27;t used in conjunction with the different modalities.  The suction can also be very damaging and scarring to sensitive skin.  Do people buying this machine realize that the HF needs to be grounded before touching the skin?  That the galvanic grounding electrode needs to be moistened by covering with a moist gauze or sponge while being held before applying the positive electrode to the skin?  There is a lot to know for this machine to be effective.   There are NO directions for use with this machine......only connection instructions.  Great value for professionals!  Go for it.....if you dare....untrained people.....</li>
            <li> All in 1 ,no gaste tanto dinero y lo tengo casi todo ,lastima que falto el scraber ,sin embargo le agregue md skin es una extencion de microderma ,en lugar del vacum tiene filtro y todo ,estoy maravillada com mi equipo de spa ,solo me hace falta algo mas para solo abultar el spa ,y de todos modos tengo todo EXCEPTO SCRUBER ,en una maquina .</li>
            <li> There was no user manual. The quality of the machine seems fine, however, given the nature of the machine it is important that it comes with a user manual.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. I was accustomed to working with equipment that was much more costly through school. This piece of equipment is sturdy, and every feature works just great. I highly recommend this for a newly licensed esthetician as a starter device.</li>
            <li> This is a great machine for the price.  I have used this machine several times and it does what is suppose to do.  Although, I would have given  the shipper/ manufacturer a better rating ,  I am familiar with how to use the different functions, if the company could have provided an instructional booklet for the use of their particular machine. All in all, I like the 5 in 1 multifunctional galvanic skincare machine.</li>
            <li> Arrived in the time stated and Amazon kept its word. The product did not come with instructions that are complete enough/ and or manufacturer specific, therefore leaving things to the imagination. It needs to come with a hand book with much needed info, and include replacement part info. My machine did not come with all \\&quot;as seen on Amazon\\&quot;, a few things are missing but none that will play a role in the function of the equipment or my spec of treatment. For the price it is a great deal and perfect start up equipment to my clinic.</li>
            <li> quality product many thanks, I love and am very happy with the product obtained, very fast delivery and satisfactory. Muchas gracias desde venezuela.</li>
            <li> great machine for SPA.. great service!</li>
            <li> There was no user manual, but being familiar with similar machines, I could have figured it out, but I still don&#x27;t know how to use the suction part exactly.</li>
            <li> There are very minimal directions.  I had to find out how to use it by watching many different videos on You Tube. And reading up on it.  I still don&#x27;t know how to use the suction part exactly.&lt;br /&gt;But once you know how to use it, it is very easy to use.  Especilly the high frequency part, super simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using it long, so I haven&#x27;t seen any results in my sking yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when you first start using it, make sure it is on a low setting, particularly for the Galvanic treatments.&lt;br /&gt;It can really zap ya!&lt;br /&gt;Everything that I have used on it seems to work well.  I think it is very affordable for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given 5 stars, but the packaging was cracked for the glass implements, although they were not broken.  And it would be nice if they had an instruction booklet.&lt;br /&gt;Other than those two things I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
