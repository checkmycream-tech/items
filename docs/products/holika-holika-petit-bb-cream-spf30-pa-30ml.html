    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li>It might be best to apply it when your skin is damp...</li>
            <li>the color is perfect on her.</li>
            <li>But once I put it on my skin the color was perfect.</li>

            <li>this is really great has nice coverage</li>
            <li>Nothing but good things to say about this cream.</li>
            <li>Also, I find that for optimum coverage you probably will need to reapply.  </li>
            <li>natural, perfect complexion!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m 40, have very fair, good, combination~but,</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is a nice color!</li>
            <li>It has really great coverage and really easy to put on!</li>
            <li>had a concern and emailed them and they replied promptly and very respectably.</li>
            <li>seriously i love this stuff, great coverage matches my skin</li>
            <li>Honestly i like this bb cream since i am fair skinned</li>
            <li>It looks so wonderful on the skin though the bottle is pretty petite.</li>
            <li>still love it!</li>
            <li>This makeup is magical!</li>
            <li>this Korean one is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used their dot eyeliner that is amazing</li>
            <li>is definitely very moisturizing and the color matches me perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am W3 - W4 Loreal or Nude beige with warm undertone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is nice.</li>
            <li>I got the moisture kind</li>
            <li>That said, the color is still perhaps a smidge darker than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Covers my melasma and my mild rosacea beautifully.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really easy and nice to apply, and it smells lovely too hehe~~&lt;br /&gt;Makes a very nice and luminous complexion and moisturize well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very strong perfume scent</li>
            <li>Wow, this BB cream impressed me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this BB cream is &#x27;okay,&#x27; but nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>Reason being its too light, i already am fair skinned</li>
            <li>is the best bb cream I have found by far.</li>
            <li>Love love love holika holika!</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, great finish--dewy without being oily, but dry enought</li>
            <li>It covers very well and looks great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>understand Hyaluronic Acid is supposed to be able to hold 1000 times its weight in water</li>
            <li>It covers and spreads well, with a nice texture and light (dryer-sheet like?)</li>
            <li>The purple cat packaging is so much better.  </li>
            <li>so I plan to buy more.  </li>
            <li>I am ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love my bobbi brown skin foundation and also lorac..</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>MUCH better than the b.b. cream I was using.</li>
            <li>It is more moisturizing than some others.  </li>
            <li>I love this item just what wanted.</li>
            <li>#34;look more poshed</li>
            <li>/&gt;i LOVE</li>
            <li>When I want a bit of a more luminous look, I mix in some of my L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Primer.</li>
            <li>It feels so light, but covers so well!  </li>
            <li>The smallest, pea-sized amount covered my entire face and the tint was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I just love having discovered this treasure.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Overall I think this product is excellent!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>But it looks ok on my hand.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s excellent, the only thing is</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It is very rare to find Korean BB Cream with a warm undertone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Pretty good BB cream for a very cheap price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent was pleasant (a light fruity/floral) and faded quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and has a very cool, ashy undertone.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful bb cream feels great on the skin very smooth finish and full coverage but won&#x27;t look cakey or heavy has a nice smell too.</li>
            <li>This is as good or better than the much higher priced BB creams.</li>
            <li>It goes on very light but does turn skin tone color after a minute or so but only if you aré very fair, which I am.</li>
            <li>But the coverage is pretty good.</li>
            <li>But the seller I used sent it very quickly and even gave me some free samples!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really love it</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, which is why I went for an Asian BB cream.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day without drying or becoming orange.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and has good coverage.</li>
            <li>I live the dewy, moisturized look I have with this while enjoying the benefits of good coverage.</li>
            <li>This one also seems to be more of a creamy nude color than a fair ivory color and would probably be good for people who find other bb creams</li>
            <li>It comes closer to a flawless finish than any other foundation I have used.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it would make an awesome tinted moisturizer on days you don&#x27;t feel like wearing a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>and it  applied easily  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t wash away easily / as the day went along.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be very mild doesn&#x27;t clog or break out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Yes, the smell is strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pale (to the point where most of the lightest shades offered are still too dark/orange for me) and this matched me perfectly.</li>
            <li>Holika brand has cute little products that are perfect for light uses of BB creams.</li>
            <li>The colour, texture and scent are fine but it doesnt stay even with powder.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines and accentuate them.</li>
            <li>It is fine alone</li>
            <li>(Luckily I won&#x27;t have to worry with the SPF 30!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite fair with a warm undertone and dry flaky patches.</li>
            <li>Way too light for my complexion.</li>
            <li>10 hours later, it still looked great.</li>
            <li>I would consider it light coverage</li>
            <li>I can tell you this is better by far than ANY American BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried and the best part is even with shipping</li>
            <li>but sometimes I just want a light dewy look without -</li>
            <li>This cream is incredibly light and effortlessly blends into my skin.</li>
            <li>Has a light scent, which I like.</li>
            <li>and i find it too light</li>
            <li>Now a word of warning - if you don&#x27;t have light skin tones it might look pasty on you.</li>
            <li>It is really light on your face.</li>
            <li>Before it oxidized it looked soooo light</li>
            <li>Too light for a tan person.</li>
            <li>It has medium coverage but still feels light.</li>
            <li>My bf says it smells really nice and the commercial is cool, though! :)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much, it blends well and it is buildable if you want more coverage.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned (NW15) &amp; this BB Cream was too dark for me.</li>
            <li>This is not an easy task as I am 43 years old, but honestly - my skin looks nicer than it has in years.</li>
            <li>Has a very pleasant smell, decent coverage but doesn&#x27;t really last all day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to have a brand new one that won&#x27;t expire until 2017.  </li>
            <li>Since I keep hearing all the rave about Asian BB creams being good for your skin, I did my research online and found that this brand has light to medium coverage and won&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shame it&#x27;s too dark on me, I loved it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is anything special.</li>
            <li>I only use for special occasions or to cover up blemishes on good days ^^</li>
            <li>Arrived faster than I expected, I got the moistusture BB cream (purple one) and am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The coverage is amazing, yet it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, and stays on all day just wish they had more color choses.</li>
            <li>So my suggestion is to wait a full 10-15 minutes after you&#x27;ve applied this product, or else you risk looking like vampire.</li>
            <li>It is very good for dry skin, it moisturizes and blends very well into skin.  </li>
            <li>The BB cream is a great quality, but the color is certainly not for my skin.</li>
            <li>So if you want a Korean BB cream and you&#x27;re not super fair, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This is quiet the good product with decent amount of coverage and a fine and easy to apply formula.</li>
            <li>I am a golden fair to medium-fair american girl.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast as well!</li>
            <li>A lot of women often confuse their light skin to being fair, and after reading how some of the reviewers were supposedly pale, I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble finding a good light product this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These types of products are worth it though.</li>
            <li>As it is only one color, be sure to know it is LIGHT.  </li>
            <li>But overall it was really nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most natural looking coverage, either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you have dry skin (I have mild dandruff on my nose+forehead), take note that you have to exfoliate a lot to make sure there are no flakies when you put this on!</li>
            <li>It is worth a try - the price is right.</li>
            <li>Color is also just right--</li>
            <li>the bronzer or whatever doesn&#x27;t go on right</li>
            <li>A little dab is all you need of it.&lt;br /&gt;It would be great for light skin if you are really young.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks softer, smoother, less oily and best of all, not itchy or red.</li>
            <li>It however moisturizes my face really well, has a very smooth finish and not heavy on the face.</li>
            <li>I got this for my older, dry, fair skin</li>
            <li>I like this bb cream because it&#x27;s very blendable, buildable, and feels super light.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The price of this BB cream is also very reasonable -</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair with freckles, and think this will still work if I pick up a little color this summer.  </li>
            <li>My eyeshadow lasted all day when I put this on first.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this Holika line.</li>
            <li>Probably comparable to the lightest shade of most American foundations and a more yellow undertone.  </li>
            <li>It seems to moisturize pretty well, and stays on pretty well too.</li>
            <li>This was my first foray into the world of bb creams</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it takes quite a while for the cream to oxidize and somehow adjust to your skintone.</li>
            <li>Wish it was bigger! :)</li>
            <li>I will confess when I opened it at first</li>
            <li>I would buy this one over some of the higher priced name brands that are now coming out.</li>
            <li>This is the first BB Cream or foundation</li>
            <li>so I recommend using blush and/or a contouring powder on top to add shape back to your face.</li>
            <li>At first, I was worried because the product looked a bit orange on my arm.</li>
            <li>This is my first BB cream</li>
            <li>I wish it was a tad darker to more of a light shade, not very light.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin break out very slightly, but I imagine you ladies are too wise to sleep in it as I did.</li>
            <li>BB cream is pretty much a great make-up essential for girls who have very dry skin like me.</li>
            <li>OK so I was really concerned about getting this product since I have medium skin with yellow undertones</li>
            <li>First out of the box, I really, REALLY like it.  </li>
            <li>though I have never, ever been able to keep makeup on my face for long under any circumstances.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one thing that ruined it for me though, is that even the one that says moisture isn´t a safe bet for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this cream feels very fluid and light compared to other BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried, and it is also very easy to apply; there is no need to use brushes or fancy applicators to buff the cream into your skin.</li>
            <li>The product is more like makeup rather than a moisturizer and was very dry and did not go on well.</li>
            <li>It has a medium couverture and its completely invisible, but it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone completely, it&#x27;s too light...</li>
            <li>I have pretty clear skin already, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether this will cover volcano-like eruptions on the face, but it did even out skin tone and minor blemishes (around the hairline and such) with a convincing light water resistant finish.  </li>
            <li>(You really don&#x27;t have to use that much at all)</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell.  </li>
            <li>Not that it matters much...</li>
            <li>It is a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>(or without) primer or a lightweight moisturizer, this goes on like a second skin with light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>I use my BeautyBlender or Samantha Chapman Real Techniques sponges to apply.  </li>
            <li>é bem sequinho, e a cor tambem é bem legal</li>
            <li>price is very reasonnable for 30</li>
            <li>If you still wanted to try a Korean brand for medium complexions, you can look into Missha and Etude House which has different shades available.</li>
            <li>This does take a few minutes for the color to adapt to one&#x27;s face,so be sure you get a chance to test it at a store before deciding whether or not this is the right shade for you.</li>
            <li>I am mixed race (korean and white) so luckily for me, most bb creams work well for my skin tone (something I&#x27;ve had trouble with matching in most foundations sold in the US).  </li>
            <li>bought this in 2012 when I visited Korea, and liked it enough to buy a new one finally after it&#x27;s almost run out.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream is dryer feeling than a tinted moisturizer, but covers amazingly well with very little product.</li>
            <li>I have English fair combo skin with a little rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The cream covers well and has a slightly dewy finish, which i love.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>like that it has the hyaluronic acid and high spf too.</li>
            <li>After that, it looked much better but it left my features looking flat, after the bronzer it looked ah-mazing!</li>
            <li>It will make your face look super flat</li>
            <li>Far more pigment than my former HG (which was Estee Lauder Double Wear)</li>
            <li>It definitely gives your skin a distinct &amp;#34;I&#x27;m wearing makeup&amp;#34; texture.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and my skin is soft and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always stayed away from tinted moisturizers, cream/liquid foundations and even high spf products; they irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>My new bottle has a lighter purple cap than in the picture which clashes.  </li>
            <li>And boy, did it live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li>The seller  Seoul Glamour is very  professional .I</li>
            <li>It was white at first but then adjusted to my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>(I still use my regular moisturizer first, though--</li>
            <li>so I got this one instead and the color is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I still prefer skin79 pink so far in terms of finish, but this product holds it&#x27;s own (especially for the price point).</li>
            <li>I have tried at least 8 different BB creams and this one is fine, but nothing special in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Product appeared new in clear plastic shrink wrap.</li>
            <li>It seemed a bit darker at first, but after looking at it up close next to the old stuff</li>
            <li>I also feel a need to warn girls with tanner/darker skintones to look elsewhere for a BB cream that will match their skintone, because this cream runs a little too light.</li>
            <li>I added this on top of my foundation and it made it look dewy and a little tiny bit shimmery.</li>
            <li>It does seem to perform a little better in terms of dewiness/finish (at least in an arid/semi-arid climate) if you splash a touch of water or facial mist on top of it after application.  </li>
            <li>only sad thing is that this did not match my skintone very well, but I was overall very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>but that was a complete lie</li>
            <li>This product came completely sealed and sanitary.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda too old for it.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It evens out those pesky age spots and I was surprised that it stayed on /</li>
            <li>It is so cheap and the color is dead on.</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone who wants to start out in BB cream, OR if you wear BB cream on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Please bear in mind when you order products that come direct from Korea</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Might go on looking too light, however, give it a few minutes and it blends.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it takes a few minutes to tone down/absorb in, it feels light after that.</li>
            <li>Feels soft on skin, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>I never had much luck with foundations before, for various reasons.</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t noticed any of the benefits claimed as far as lightening freckles, helping clear acne, etc.</li>
            <li>but I really like it so far just testing the lasting power so far I do need to re powder through out the day</li>
            <li>, fica mto natural, só demorou um pouco pra chegar, ma</li>
            <li>I use it as a highlighter, which it actually works very well at.</li>
            <li>The new bottle is definitely a firmer thickness, but that&#x27;s because my old one is just too old!  </li>
            <li>This cream is the first BB I have tried but it is definitely that last one I will buy because I am hooked.</li>
            <li>The formula is thin but goes a long way and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally the second to lightest shade in foundation.</li>
            <li>was also sent a sample of Cantabile Magic Secret BB cream.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I thought it was too dark, but the second time I used it I waited about 10-15 minutes to dry, and found that it matched my skin tone really well.</li>
            <li>The formula with hyaluronic acid is an absolute must for me -- I had tried the &#x27;regular&#x27; formula and found it way too dry.  </li>
            <li>High Definition Loose Powder</li>
            <li>Perhaps, a little blotting paper~here &amp; there, on a hot day...</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re going to wear it alone and have dry skin you wan to use a facial mist to keep it looking fresh throughout the day.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>

            <li> this is really great has nice coverage</li>
            <li> Nothing but good things to say about this cream.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that for optimum coverage you probably will need to reapply.  </li>
            <li> natural, perfect complexion!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m 40, have very fair, good, combination~but,</li>
            <li> It smells nice and is a nice color!</li>

            <li> seriously i love this stuff, great coverage matches my skin</li>
            <li> Honestly i like this bb cream since i am fair skinned</li>
            <li> It looks so wonderful on the skin though the bottle is pretty petite.</li>
            <li> still love it!</li>
            <li> This makeup is magical!</li>
            <li> this Korean one is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used their dot eyeliner that is amazing</li>
            <li> is definitely very moisturizing and the color matches me perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am W3 - W4 Loreal or Nude beige with warm undertone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is nice.</li>
            <li> I got the moisture kind</li>
            <li> That said, the color is still perhaps a smidge darker than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> Covers my melasma and my mild rosacea beautifully.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really easy and nice to apply, and it smells lovely too hehe~~&lt;br /&gt;Makes a very nice and luminous complexion and moisturize well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very strong perfume scent</li>
            <li> Wow, this BB cream impressed me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this BB cream is &#x27;okay,&#x27; but nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> Reason being its too light, i already am fair skinned</li>
            <li> is the best bb cream I have found by far.</li>
            <li> Love love love holika holika!</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, great finish--dewy without being oily, but dry enought</li>
            <li> It covers very well and looks great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> understand Hyaluronic Acid is supposed to be able to hold 1000 times its weight in water</li>
            <li> It covers and spreads well, with a nice texture and light (dryer-sheet like?)</li>
            <li> The purple cat packaging is so much better.  </li>
            <li> so I plan to buy more.  </li>
            <li> I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love my bobbi brown skin foundation and also lorac..</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> MUCH better than the b.b. cream I was using.</li>
            <li> It is more moisturizing than some others.  </li>
            <li> I love this item just what wanted.</li>
            <li> #34;look more poshed</li>
            <li> /&gt;i LOVE</li>
            <li> When I want a bit of a more luminous look, I mix in some of my L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Primer.</li>
            <li> It feels so light, but covers so well!  </li>
            <li> The smallest, pea-sized amount covered my entire face and the tint was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I just love having discovered this treasure.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Overall I think this product is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> But it looks ok on my hand.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s excellent, the only thing is</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It is very rare to find Korean BB Cream with a warm undertone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Pretty good BB cream for a very cheap price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent was pleasant (a light fruity/floral) and faded quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is very light and has a very cool, ashy undertone.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful bb cream feels great on the skin very smooth finish and full coverage but won&#x27;t look cakey or heavy has a nice smell too.</li>
            <li> This is as good or better than the much higher priced BB creams.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light but does turn skin tone color after a minute or so but only if you aré very fair, which I am.</li>
            <li> But the coverage is pretty good.</li>
            <li> But the seller I used sent it very quickly and even gave me some free samples!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really love it</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, which is why I went for an Asian BB cream.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day without drying or becoming orange.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and has good coverage.</li>
            <li> I live the dewy, moisturized look I have with this while enjoying the benefits of good coverage.</li>
            <li> This one also seems to be more of a creamy nude color than a fair ivory color and would probably be good for people who find other bb creams</li>
            <li> It comes closer to a flawless finish than any other foundation I have used.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it would make an awesome tinted moisturizer on days you don&#x27;t feel like wearing a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> and it  applied easily  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t wash away easily / as the day went along.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be very mild doesn&#x27;t clog or break out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell is strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale (to the point where most of the lightest shades offered are still too dark/orange for me) and this matched me perfectly.</li>
            <li> Holika brand has cute little products that are perfect for light uses of BB creams.</li>
            <li> The colour, texture and scent are fine but it doesnt stay even with powder.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines and accentuate them.</li>
            <li> It is fine alone</li>
            <li> (Luckily I won&#x27;t have to worry with the SPF 30!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite fair with a warm undertone and dry flaky patches.</li>
            <li> Way too light for my complexion.</li>
            <li> 10 hours later, it still looked great.</li>
            <li> I would consider it light coverage</li>
            <li> I can tell you this is better by far than ANY American BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried and the best part is even with shipping</li>
            <li> but sometimes I just want a light dewy look without -</li>
            <li> This cream is incredibly light and effortlessly blends into my skin.</li>
            <li> Has a light scent, which I like.</li>
            <li> and i find it too light</li>
            <li> Now a word of warning - if you don&#x27;t have light skin tones it might look pasty on you.</li>
            <li> It is really light on your face.</li>
            <li> Before it oxidized it looked soooo light</li>
            <li> Too light for a tan person.</li>
            <li> It has medium coverage but still feels light.</li>
            <li> My bf says it smells really nice and the commercial is cool, though! :)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much, it blends well and it is buildable if you want more coverage.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned (NW15) &amp; this BB Cream was too dark for me.</li>
            <li> This is not an easy task as I am 43 years old, but honestly - my skin looks nicer than it has in years.</li>
            <li> Has a very pleasant smell, decent coverage but doesn&#x27;t really last all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to have a brand new one that won&#x27;t expire until 2017.  </li>
            <li> Since I keep hearing all the rave about Asian BB creams being good for your skin, I did my research online and found that this brand has light to medium coverage and won&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shame it&#x27;s too dark on me, I loved it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is anything special.</li>
            <li> I only use for special occasions or to cover up blemishes on good days ^^</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than I expected, I got the moistusture BB cream (purple one) and am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The coverage is amazing, yet it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, and stays on all day just wish they had more color choses.</li>
            <li> So my suggestion is to wait a full 10-15 minutes after you&#x27;ve applied this product, or else you risk looking like vampire.</li>
            <li> It is very good for dry skin, it moisturizes and blends very well into skin.  </li>
            <li> The BB cream is a great quality, but the color is certainly not for my skin.</li>
            <li> So if you want a Korean BB cream and you&#x27;re not super fair, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This is quiet the good product with decent amount of coverage and a fine and easy to apply formula.</li>
            <li> I am a golden fair to medium-fair american girl.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast as well!</li>
            <li> A lot of women often confuse their light skin to being fair, and after reading how some of the reviewers were supposedly pale, I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble finding a good light product this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These types of products are worth it though.</li>
            <li> As it is only one color, be sure to know it is LIGHT.  </li>
            <li> But overall it was really nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most natural looking coverage, either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you have dry skin (I have mild dandruff on my nose+forehead), take note that you have to exfoliate a lot to make sure there are no flakies when you put this on!</li>
            <li> It is worth a try - the price is right.</li>
            <li> Color is also just right--</li>
            <li> the bronzer or whatever doesn&#x27;t go on right</li>
            <li> A little dab is all you need of it.&lt;br /&gt;It would be great for light skin if you are really young.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks softer, smoother, less oily and best of all, not itchy or red.</li>
            <li> It however moisturizes my face really well, has a very smooth finish and not heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> I got this for my older, dry, fair skin</li>
            <li> I like this bb cream because it&#x27;s very blendable, buildable, and feels super light.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The price of this BB cream is also very reasonable -</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair with freckles, and think this will still work if I pick up a little color this summer.  </li>
            <li> My eyeshadow lasted all day when I put this on first.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this Holika line.</li>
            <li> Probably comparable to the lightest shade of most American foundations and a more yellow undertone.  </li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize pretty well, and stays on pretty well too.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into the world of bb creams</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it takes quite a while for the cream to oxidize and somehow adjust to your skintone.</li>
            <li> Wish it was bigger! :)</li>
            <li> I will confess when I opened it at first</li>
            <li> I would buy this one over some of the higher priced name brands that are now coming out.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB Cream or foundation</li>
            <li> so I recommend using blush and/or a contouring powder on top to add shape back to your face.</li>
            <li> At first, I was worried because the product looked a bit orange on my arm.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream</li>
            <li> I wish it was a tad darker to more of a light shade, not very light.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin break out very slightly, but I imagine you ladies are too wise to sleep in it as I did.</li>
            <li> BB cream is pretty much a great make-up essential for girls who have very dry skin like me.</li>
            <li> OK so I was really concerned about getting this product since I have medium skin with yellow undertones</li>
            <li> First out of the box, I really, REALLY like it.  </li>
            <li> though I have never, ever been able to keep makeup on my face for long under any circumstances.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one thing that ruined it for me though, is that even the one that says moisture isn´t a safe bet for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this cream feels very fluid and light compared to other BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried, and it is also very easy to apply; there is no need to use brushes or fancy applicators to buff the cream into your skin.</li>
            <li> The product is more like makeup rather than a moisturizer and was very dry and did not go on well.</li>
            <li> It has a medium couverture and its completely invisible, but it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone completely, it&#x27;s too light...</li>
            <li> I have pretty clear skin already, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether this will cover volcano-like eruptions on the face, but it did even out skin tone and minor blemishes (around the hairline and such) with a convincing light water resistant finish.  </li>
            <li> (You really don&#x27;t have to use that much at all)</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell.  </li>
            <li> Not that it matters much...</li>
            <li> It is a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> (or without) primer or a lightweight moisturizer, this goes on like a second skin with light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I use my BeautyBlender or Samantha Chapman Real Techniques sponges to apply.  </li>
            <li> é bem sequinho, e a cor tambem é bem legal</li>
            <li> price is very reasonnable for 30</li>
            <li> If you still wanted to try a Korean brand for medium complexions, you can look into Missha and Etude House which has different shades available.</li>
            <li> This does take a few minutes for the color to adapt to one&#x27;s face,so be sure you get a chance to test it at a store before deciding whether or not this is the right shade for you.</li>
            <li> I am mixed race (korean and white) so luckily for me, most bb creams work well for my skin tone (something I&#x27;ve had trouble with matching in most foundations sold in the US).  </li>
            <li> bought this in 2012 when I visited Korea, and liked it enough to buy a new one finally after it&#x27;s almost run out.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream is dryer feeling than a tinted moisturizer, but covers amazingly well with very little product.</li>
            <li> I have English fair combo skin with a little rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cream covers well and has a slightly dewy finish, which i love.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> like that it has the hyaluronic acid and high spf too.</li>
            <li> After that, it looked much better but it left my features looking flat, after the bronzer it looked ah-mazing!</li>
            <li> It will make your face look super flat</li>
            <li> Far more pigment than my former HG (which was Estee Lauder Double Wear)</li>
            <li> It definitely gives your skin a distinct &amp;#34;I&#x27;m wearing makeup&amp;#34; texture.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and my skin is soft and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always stayed away from tinted moisturizers, cream/liquid foundations and even high spf products; they irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> My new bottle has a lighter purple cap than in the picture which clashes.  </li>
            <li> And boy, did it live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> The seller  Seoul Glamour is very  professional .I</li>
            <li> It was white at first but then adjusted to my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> (I still use my regular moisturizer first, though--</li>
            <li> so I got this one instead and the color is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I still prefer skin79 pink so far in terms of finish, but this product holds it&#x27;s own (especially for the price point).</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 8 different BB creams and this one is fine, but nothing special in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Product appeared new in clear plastic shrink wrap.</li>
            <li> It seemed a bit darker at first, but after looking at it up close next to the old stuff</li>
            <li> I also feel a need to warn girls with tanner/darker skintones to look elsewhere for a BB cream that will match their skintone, because this cream runs a little too light.</li>
            <li> I added this on top of my foundation and it made it look dewy and a little tiny bit shimmery.</li>
            <li> It does seem to perform a little better in terms of dewiness/finish (at least in an arid/semi-arid climate) if you splash a touch of water or facial mist on top of it after application.  </li>
            <li> only sad thing is that this did not match my skintone very well, but I was overall very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> but that was a complete lie</li>
            <li> This product came completely sealed and sanitary.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda too old for it.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It evens out those pesky age spots and I was surprised that it stayed on /</li>
            <li> It is so cheap and the color is dead on.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who wants to start out in BB cream, OR if you wear BB cream on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Please bear in mind when you order products that come direct from Korea</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Might go on looking too light, however, give it a few minutes and it blends.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it takes a few minutes to tone down/absorb in, it feels light after that.</li>
            <li> Feels soft on skin, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> I never had much luck with foundations before, for various reasons.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t noticed any of the benefits claimed as far as lightening freckles, helping clear acne, etc.</li>
            <li> but I really like it so far just testing the lasting power so far I do need to re powder through out the day</li>
            <li> , fica mto natural, só demorou um pouco pra chegar, ma</li>
            <li> I use it as a highlighter, which it actually works very well at.</li>
            <li> The new bottle is definitely a firmer thickness, but that&#x27;s because my old one is just too old!  </li>
            <li> This cream is the first BB I have tried but it is definitely that last one I will buy because I am hooked.</li>
            <li> The formula is thin but goes a long way and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally the second to lightest shade in foundation.</li>
            <li> was also sent a sample of Cantabile Magic Secret BB cream.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I thought it was too dark, but the second time I used it I waited about 10-15 minutes to dry, and found that it matched my skin tone really well.</li>
            <li> The formula with hyaluronic acid is an absolute must for me -- I had tried the &#x27;regular&#x27; formula and found it way too dry.  </li>
            <li> High Definition Loose Powder</li>
            <li> Perhaps, a little blotting paper~here &amp; there, on a hot day...</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re going to wear it alone and have dry skin you wan to use a facial mist to keep it looking fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> but think it will last long enough to satisfy the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my right skin color (I&#x27;m very pale) but my skin is also very dry.</li>
            <li> I blended it out with a flat kabuki brush and waited for it to oxidize.</li>
            <li> Only thing is, its lighter than I am and it gets kinda cakey looking and dry..</li>
            <li> My only comment would be that it takes awhile to &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; so before putting bronzer or anything on I either have to wait awhile or apply loose powder and then proceed, otherwise</li>
            <li> Perfumy, floral, but it didn&#x27;t linger too long.  </li>
            <li> Also, some of them are for pink tones, some for yellow tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used that hasn&#x27;t dried out my (ridiculously dry, sensitive) skin.</li>
            <li> (Btw I have fairly dry skin.)</li>
            <li> It will highlight any dry patches you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I use this for my dry</li>
            <li> somewhat dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this BB cream, because I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> The tube is small but has so far lasted me just over 2 months</li>
            <li> one is a bit clear, but after a few minutes it adapts to the colour of your skin, like the 3 other</li>
            <li> I was sad to see that this product isn&#x27;t light at all, it&#x27;s quite dark on me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need a single other thing on my face.  </li>
            <li> Has lasted almost four months with regular use-not everyday, but a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It  arrived sooner than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I spent about $6-$7 on a tube which arrived sooner than it was projected to.  </li>
            <li> For some time now I had been doing some research on the wide selection of BB creams and found that the oriental BB creams seemed to be preferred by people with lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or grimy once on.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin quiet dull and emphazises dry patches.</li>
            <li> it evens out skintone and brightens but is not super heavy which I actually like.  </li>
            <li> I often have that problem with other foundations.</li>
            <li> I let it dry for about a minute inbetween layers and then added a little translucent powder.</li>
            <li> The tube feels half empty &amp; it smells like Pantene hair products</li>
            <li> I believe the coverage was slightly sheerer than the Skin79 pink, but still performed to the level I expect from any Korean bb.  </li>
            <li> I am told I look anemic and very pale for an Asian</li>
            <li> Not worth buying it</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and dark undereye circles</li>
            <li> product really goes on quite dark on my skin (which is weird</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too dark for me to wear</li>
            <li> is way too dark.</li>
            <li> and i dont think it would work well with dark skinned.</li>
            <li> I put it on half my face to try it and then washed off, and there was a noticable difference in the texture of the side that had the BB cream, after just one use.  </li>
            <li> but if I did it would run out in less than a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying, but not too moisturizing either, although it has a slightly dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I use less than a pea-sized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now obsessed with this brand and highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li> It was too orange for my pale complexion so passed down to my daughter.</li>
            <li> The scent was a little off putting.</li>
            <li> The tint was a bit orange for my complexion, a little darker than I wanted for a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li> A little primer + A few dots + blending &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I found that the product does moisturize well, but it feels a little heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> and it dried a little too powder.</li>
            <li> I have used the green &amp;#34;Clearing&amp;#34; one as well</li>
            <li> I have normal-dry pale olive skin.</li>
            <li> The bb cream made your skin look pale.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very pale) and settles down after a minute as I rub it in with my hands or a brush.</li>
            <li> I got it to wear to a Latin wedding- for those of you who don&#x27;t know, these involve long nights of serious dancing!</li>
            <li> I wear it with just a little mineral blush and translucent finishing powder and my skin glows!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> The size of the tube is quite small and I will use it up in no time</li>
            <li> but small though.</li>
            <li> BB cream will not make your skin look dewy or moisturized, or at least, it did not for me today.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> I also have eczema and some foundations that have sunscreen actually sting my face when my skin is bad.</li>
            <li> However, I got tired of looking for moisturizers with spf and mineral makeup because the ones I like keep getting discontinued.</li>
            <li> so I know the brand doesn&#x27;t have false claims.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but don&#x27;t be afraid of it.</li>
            <li> It smells faintly flowery</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that this BB Cream did not adjust to my skin color.</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the drugstore ones and they are awful, all of them!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Way too light for my complexion.</li>
            <li> This is quiet the good product with decent amount of coverage and a fine and easy to apply formula. The one thing that ruined it for me though, is that even the one that says moisture isn´t a safe bet for dry skin. It leaves your skin quiet dull and emphazises dry patches.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than I expected, I got the moistusture BB cream (purple one) and am really happy with it. I&#x27;m pale (to the point where most of the lightest shades offered are still too dark/orange for me) and this matched me perfectly. The smell is sweet and wonderful, the coverage is great for a BB cream, and I&#x27;m really happy I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed. The coverage reminded me of a tinted moisturizer. The next day, I decided to do 2 layers instead of 1. (You really don&#x27;t have to use that much at all) I let it dry for about a minute inbetween layers and then added a little translucent powder. 10 hours later, it still looked great. (Btw I have fairly dry skin.) I will definitely buy again. Also works great as an eyeshadow primer. My eyeshadow lasted all day when I put this on first.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying it I should of trusted what some people said about the skin tone but I do admit I though that it was going to blend into my skin tone like some reviews said but that was a complete lie</li>
            <li> I found that it was moisturizing enough  for my skin but not greasy  and it  applied easily  and coverage is very good.  This is as good or better than the much higher priced BB creams. I have English fair combo skin with a little rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;I was also sent a sample of Cantabile Magic Secret BB cream. It was white at first but then adjusted to my skin tone.  One tiny sample will be enough for two applications. It covers very well and looks great on.&lt;br /&gt; The seller  Seoul Glamour is very  professional .I had a concern and emailed them and they replied promptly and very respectably. This product came completely sealed and sanitary.  I recommend buying from this company.</li>
            <li> I added this on top of my foundation and it made it look dewy and a little tiny bit shimmery. A little dab is all you need of it.&lt;br /&gt;It would be great for light skin if you are really young. I&#x27;m kinda too old for it. Had to try it anyway...</li>
            <li> This bb cream totally worked for me. It&#x27;s my right skin color (I&#x27;m very pale) but my skin is also very dry. :/ I took a gamble and bought it after reading all the mixed reviews. I&#x27;m very happy with it and I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this Holika line.</li>
            <li> This does take a few minutes for the color to adapt to one&#x27;s face,so be sure you get a chance to test it at a store before deciding whether or not this is the right shade for you. I am told I look anemic and very pale for an Asian so this shade works for me. By the way, I am Asian, but not anemic. A little does go a long way and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or grimy once on. This is the only thing I use on my face and it covers the freckles and brown spots quite well. Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> A lot of women often confuse their light skin to being fair, and after reading how some of the reviewers were supposedly pale, I was excited to try this product. I was sad to see that this product isn&#x27;t light at all, it&#x27;s quite dark on me. If you have trouble finding a good light product this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, don&#x27;t let my color woes deter you from this product. It&#x27;s fantastic! It hydrates beautifully and its so creamy. It looks so wonderful on the skin though the bottle is pretty petite. It smells faintly flowery and I fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame it&#x27;s too dark on me, I loved it!</li>
            <li> Wow, this BB cream impressed me. I have normal-dry pale olive skin. The color seemed to have been tailor made for me. It is very moisturizing and has good coverage. This is a keeper, and the price tag is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is dryer feeling than a tinted moisturizer, but covers amazingly well with very little product. I have acne scars and dark undereye circles and I didn&#x27;t even feel the need to use concealer with this BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have dry skin (I have mild dandruff on my nose+forehead), take note that you have to exfoliate a lot to make sure there are no flakies when you put this on! It will highlight any dry patches you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream will not make your skin look dewy or moisturized, or at least, it did not for me today. (I applied it after exfoliating, showering, moisturizing, and putting primer on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand Hyaluronic Acid is supposed to be able to hold 1000 times its weight in water so that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to keep your skin moisturized. It might be best to apply it when your skin is damp... I will have to try again with wetter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this BB cream is &#x27;okay,&#x27; but nothing amazing. My bf says it smells really nice and the commercial is cool, though! :)</li>
            <li> I use this on the back of my hands.  It evens out those pesky age spots and I was surprised that it stayed on / didn&#x27;t wash away easily / as the day went along.  Of course, I only use it when going out.  Smallish tube but think it will last long enough to satisfy the price.  It is a good product.</li>
            <li> The product is more like makeup rather than a moisturizer and was very dry and did not go on well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good BB cream for awhile,  and this was on sale so I thought I would try it. I&#x27;m now obsessed with this brand and highly recommend it to everyone.  It&#x27;s very light but blends flawlessly.  I no longer use a concealer and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin health. Love love love holika holika!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with another BB cream to try them out.  First out of the box, I really, REALLY like it.  I&#x27;ve been using a tinted SPF15 moisturizer under foundation and this takes the place of both.  (I still use my regular moisturizer first, though--I was using all 3).  Great coverage, great finish--dewy without being oily, but dry enought there was no need to set with powder.  I put it on half my face to try it and then washed off, and there was a noticable difference in the texture of the side that had the BB cream, after just one use.  Yes, the smell is strong.  Perfumy, floral, but it didn&#x27;t linger too long.  Color is also just right--I&#x27;m fair with freckles, and think this will still work if I pick up a little color this summer.  (Luckily I won&#x27;t have to worry with the SPF 30!)</li>
            <li> OMG I LOOOOVE this BB Cream! It is so cheap and the color is dead on. It is very rare to find Korean BB Cream with a warm undertone.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely very moisturizing and the color matches me perfectly. I am W3 - W4 Loreal or Nude beige with warm undertone.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who wants to start out in BB cream, OR if you wear BB cream on a daily basis. It is so much better than expensive American BB Cream. This also oxidizes to your skin color as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It also smells SOO GOOD!</li>
            <li> I have used several bb creams both american and Korean and this is one of my favorites.  It is very good for dry skin, it moisturizes and blends very well into skin.  I would consider it light coverage it evens out skintone and brightens but is not super heavy which I actually like.  This one also seems to be more of a creamy nude color than a fair ivory color and would probably be good for people who find other bb creams too pale/grey.  It seems to be very mild doesn&#x27;t clog or break out my skin.  No perfumey smell and works well with or without a primer.  I can tell you this is better by far than ANY American BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried and the best part is even with shipping it&#x27;s a lot less expensive. Please bear in mind when you order products that come direct from Korea IT TAKES LONGER. Keep this in mind when ordering.  These types of products are worth it though.</li>
            <li> Moisture version&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in 2012 when I visited Korea, and liked it enough to buy a new one finally after it&#x27;s almost run out.  It seemed a bit darker at first, but after looking at it up close next to the old stuff I really can&#x27;t tell.  As it is only one color, be sure to know it is LIGHT.  Probably comparable to the lightest shade of most American foundations and a more yellow undertone.  It covers and spreads well, with a nice texture and light (dryer-sheet like?) fragrance.  The new bottle is definitely a firmer thickness, but that&#x27;s because my old one is just too old!  I remember when it started to get runny, so it&#x27;s nice to have a brand new one that won&#x27;t expire until 2017.  (the date stamped on the bottle) I don&#x27;t know why they decided to change the packaging...  The purple cat packaging is so much better.  My new bottle has a lighter purple cap than in the picture which clashes.  Not that it matters much...&lt;br /&gt;Product appeared new in clear plastic shrink wrap.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, and stays on all day just wish they had more color choses.</li>
            <li> seriously i love this stuff, great coverage matches my skin great and I am hispanic</li>
            <li> It was too orange for my pale complexion so passed down to my daughter. the color is perfect on her.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for me and goes on very smoothly, blending nicely. My only comment would be that it takes awhile to &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; so before putting bronzer or anything on I either have to wait awhile or apply loose powder and then proceed, otherwise the bronzer or whatever doesn&#x27;t go on right/evenly/smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any of the anti-ageing effects yet, but I like it as a foundation so I plan to buy more.  It seems to moisturize pretty well, and stays on pretty well too. The tube is small but has so far lasted me just over 2 months and I probably have about 1/2 left. I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love my bobbi brown skin foundation and also lorac..but sometimes I just want a light dewy look without - this bb cream delivers. This was my first foray into the world of bb creams and I&#x27;m sticking with holika.&lt;br /&gt;The product really goes on quite dark on my skin (which is weird but I&#x27;m very pale) and settles down after a minute as I rub it in with my hands or a brush. Sometimes I use powder to set. I live the dewy, moisturized look I have with this while enjoying the benefits of good coverage.</li>
            <li> It has really great coverage and really easy to put on! It smells nice and is a nice color! Only thing is, its lighter than I am and it gets kinda cakey looking and dry.. I have sensitive skin so.. It also kinda made me break out a bit but I cleared it up after~ I only use for special occasions or to cover up blemishes on good days ^^ still love it!</li>
            <li> Might go on looking too light, however, give it a few minutes and it blends. Has lasted almost four months with regular use-not everyday, but a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has the hyaluronic acid and high spf too. It&#x27;s thick, but don&#x27;t be afraid of it. Like I said, it takes a few minutes to tone down/absorb in, it feels light after that.</li>
            <li> I got this for my older, dry, fair skin and I love it. I got another type for my teen daughter that she loves. I like that it does moisturize and it has sunscreen. You don&#x27;t need very much, it blends well and it is buildable if you want more coverage. It covers my redness as well as under eye circles. Feels soft on skin, not at all greasy. It  arrived sooner than I expected it to. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It works the same way although in a different package.</li>
            <li> This makeup is magical! I got it to wear to a Latin wedding- for those of you who don&#x27;t know, these involve long nights of serious dancing! This makeup not only adjusted to match my skin tone with incomprehensible accuracy, it also hydrated and smoothed my dehydrated skin (nursing a baby, travel, dancing!) and did not BUDGE, all night- though I have never, ever been able to keep makeup on my face for long under any circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is amazing, yet it looks natural. It does make my skin break out very slightly, but I imagine you ladies are too wise to sleep in it as I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally the second to lightest shade in foundation. This cream is incredibly light and effortlessly blends into my skin. MUCH better than the b.b. cream I was using. It lasts all day without drying or becoming orange.</li>
            <li> Pretty good BB cream for a very cheap price!&lt;br /&gt;Works great on my skin and I&#x27;ve tried the one with pore cleansing feature&lt;br /&gt;and this one is moisture petit BB cream so I use this for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Holika Holika brand has cute little products that are perfect for light uses of BB creams.</li>
            <li> I never had much luck with foundations before, for various reasons. Maybe the color just didn&#x27;t match. Maybe it was too shiny or chalky. Maybe it was all melted off by the end of the day. Don&#x27;t have any of those problems with this, it&#x27;s the only foundation I use now.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that the products practically slides off my face. The colour, texture and scent are fine but it doesnt stay even with powder. :/ But the seller I used sent it very quickly and even gave me some free samples! I would buy from them again, just not this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really love it</li>
            <li> It has a medium couverture and its completely invisible, but it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone completely, it&#x27;s too light...</li>
            <li> this is really great has nice coverage</li>
            <li> Has a very pleasant smell, decent coverage but doesn&#x27;t really last all day. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any of the benefits claimed as far as lightening freckles, helping clear acne, etc.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream is pretty much a great make-up essential for girls who have very dry skin like me. The consistency of this cream feels very fluid and light compared to other BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried, and it is also very easy to apply; there is no need to use brushes or fancy applicators to buff the cream into your skin. This product has very beautiful luminizing properties, and you end up with a nice dewy, youthful complexion. The price of this BB cream is also very reasonable - I bought this product from seoulglamour, and I paid about $12 for quite a bit of product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only two problems with this BB cream. When you first put it on, it takes quite a while for the cream to oxidize and somehow adjust to your skintone. So my suggestion is to wait a full 10-15 minutes after you&#x27;ve applied this product, or else you risk looking like vampire. I also feel a need to warn girls with tanner/darker skintones to look elsewhere for a BB cream that will match their skintone, because this cream runs a little too light.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned (NW15) &amp; this BB Cream was too dark for me. The tube feels half empty &amp; it smells like Pantene hair products lol. It&#x27;s way too dark for me to wear so I don&#x27;t know how it performs.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of American BB creams, but this Korean one is amazing. It leaves a beautiful, dewy finish. Has a light scent, which I like. It comes closer to a flawless finish than any other foundation I have used. There are some great ingredients in it as well. The only drawback is that it does contain some parabens.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bb cream feels great on the skin very smooth finish and full coverage but won&#x27;t look cakey or heavy has a nice smell too. I set it with a powder still testing it out but I really like it so far just testing the lasting power so far I do need to re powder through out the day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite fair with a warm undertone and dry flaky patches. The cream covers well and has a slightly dewy finish, which i love. The scent was a little off putting. Very strong perfume scent but it seems to wear off after a while. It didn&#x27;t crease or flake later in the day too. I often have that problem with other foundations. The size of the tube is quite small and I will use it up in no time but it&#x27;s so good! Wish it was bigger! :)</li>
            <li> I will confess when I opened it at first i was very disappointed. The color it is when it comes out of the tube is way too dark. But once I put it on my skin the color was perfect. I have very fair skin, which is why I went for an Asian BB cream. Shipping was very fast as well! Ordered it on Saturday and it was here by Monday! Will definitely be ordering again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I am mixed race (korean and white) so luckily for me, most bb creams work well for my skin tone (something I&#x27;ve had trouble with matching in most foundations sold in the US).  The Holika Holika moisture petit bb was great for the price point.  I spent about $6-$7 on a tube which arrived sooner than it was projected to.  The scent was pleasant (a light fruity/floral) and faded quickly.  I believe the coverage was slightly sheerer than the Skin79 pink, but still performed to the level I expect from any Korean bb.  I have pretty clear skin already, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether this will cover volcano-like eruptions on the face, but it did even out skin tone and minor blemishes (around the hairline and such) with a convincing light water resistant finish.  It does seem to perform a little better in terms of dewiness/finish (at least in an arid/semi-arid climate) if you splash a touch of water or facial mist on top of it after application.  Overall, I still prefer skin79 pink so far in terms of finish, but this product holds it&#x27;s own (especially for the price point).</li>
            <li> This product is nice. It goes on very light but does turn skin tone color after a minute or so but only if you aré very fair, which I am. I wish it was a tad darker to more of a light shade, not very light.</li>
            <li> Honestly i like this bb cream since i am fair skinned and i dont think it would work well with dark skinned. Reason being its too light, i already am fair skinned and i find it too light so i always need to put a bronzer or darker shade of powder over it. It however moisturizes my face really well, has a very smooth finish and not heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful, is nice and creamy going on, minimizes pores, evens skin tone, and basically just makes my skin look perfect. This is not an easy task as I am 43 years old, but honestly - my skin looks nicer than it has in years. Definitely recommend this as a go-to foundation/primer product. I wear it with just a little mineral blush and translucent finishing powder and my skin glows!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is anything special. I have tried at least 8 different BB creams and this one is fine, but nothing special in my opinion.  It is more moisturizing than some others.  It is a reasonable price.  I would buy this one over some of the higher priced name brands that are now coming out.</li>
            <li> I love this item just what wanted. Matches my skin tone and feels great! Thank you so very much &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I already use Holika&#x27;s Aqua Jelly BB cream, which gives you an airbrushed look, when applied/buffed out with a stippling brush.&lt;br /&gt; I use the petite moisture bb, when I&#x27;m on the go. I keep it in my purse, for days when I don&#x27;t have time for foundation and end up going somewhere I need to &amp;#34;look more poshed up&amp;#34; on short notice. A little primer + A few dots + blending &#x3D; a 1min. natural, perfect complexion!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m 40, have very fair, good, combination~but, somewhat dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;With (or without) primer or a lightweight moisturizer, this goes on like a second skin with light to medium coverage. It doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines and accentuate them. Also, it lasts all day~no need for touch ups. Perhaps, a little blotting paper~here &amp; there, on a hot day...but, that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;i LOVE Holika&#x27;s Moisture Petite BB cream and can&#x27;t ecommend it, enough!!</li>
            <li> Far more pigment than my former HG (which was Estee Lauder Double Wear) w/out looking cakey.  Covers my melasma and my mild rosacea beautifully.  I use my BeautyBlender or Samantha Chapman Real Techniques sponges to apply.  When I want a bit of a more luminous look, I mix in some of my L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Primer.</li>
            <li> é bem sequinho, e a cor tambem é bem legal, fica mto natural, só demorou um pouco pra chegar, ma</li>
            <li> I have used the green &amp;#34;Clearing&amp;#34; one as well and they are both awesome. Best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried!  I&#x27;ve tried the drugstore ones and they are awful, all of them!  My skin is drier in the winter so I got this one instead and the color is exactly the same.  I often use ONLY this and I don&#x27;t need a single other thing on my face.  It feels so light, but covers so well!  It&#x27;s amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> For some time now I had been doing some research on the wide selection of BB creams and found that the oriental BB creams seemed to be preferred by people with lighter skin tones. This cream is the first BB I have tried but it is definitely that last one I will buy because I am hooked. The smallest, pea-sized amount covered my entire face and the tint was perfect for me. It has staying power and it makes your skin look like it is lit up from inside. The SPF 30 is also a big plus. Nothing but good things to say about this cream. Now a word of warning - if you don&#x27;t have light skin tones it might look pasty on you. It is worth a try - the price is right. I just love having discovered this treasure.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Amazing coverage, smells wonderful, never breaks me out.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best bb cream I have found by far.</li>
            <li> I bought this BB cream, because I have really dry skin. When I first used it, I thought it was too dark, but the second time I used it I waited about 10-15 minutes to dry, and found that it matched my skin tone really well. So, I would recommend waiting after you apply it. I found that the product does moisturize well, but it feels a little heavy on my face. On the other hand, it would make an awesome tinted moisturizer on days you don&#x27;t feel like wearing a lot of makeup. The bottom line--- the price, and the moisturizing aspect is enough that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! It goes on smooth and my skin is soft and doesn&#x27;t dry out. It is really light on your face. It is fine alone but I bought another product for touch ups that I haven&#x27;t received yet. My only con is I wish it came in a larger container! I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day but if I did it would run out in less than a month. I would recommend buying 2 tubes at a time. Overall I think this product is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> The tint was a bit orange for my complexion, a little darker than I wanted for a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; cream. But overall it was really nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok. but small though. I don&#x27;t know how it will be like on my face. But it looks ok on my hand.</li>
            <li> The bb cream made your skin look pale. If you look closely it looks like you put powder on your face and it looks bumpy.</li>
            <li> All the Holika Holika Petit BB creams are great, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a bit clear, but after a few minutes it adapts to the colour of your skin, like the 3 other I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Really easy and nice to apply, and it smells lovely too hehe~~&lt;br /&gt;Makes a very nice and luminous complexion and moisturize well.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonnable for 30 ml.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it from A-Poly and the transaction was great. The parcel arrived earlier than when it was supposed to, and they have even put some samples!</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously awesome. This is the first BB Cream or foundation I&#x27;ve used that hasn&#x27;t dried out my (ridiculously dry, sensitive) skin. I also have eczema and some foundations that have sunscreen actually sting my face when my skin is bad. Not this one though! The formula is thin but goes a long way and provides good coverage. I can apply it well with my fingers or blend it with a blush brush. I&#x27;m Asian so it blended into my skin tone well but it might not for those with medium/darker skin tones. It will make your face look super flat so I recommend using blush and/or a contouring powder on top to add shape back to your face. I set the look with e.l.f. High Definition Loose Powder so it stays on longer. I&#x27;ll definitely buy another when I run out!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that this BB Cream did not adjust to my skin color. I guess my yellow undertone color is a bit deep cause this left a white cast on my face and I ended up looking like a ghost. I would not recommend this product to people with deep yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> OK so I was really concerned about getting this product since I have medium skin with yellow undertones but I got this to work for me! So if you want a Korean BB cream and you&#x27;re not super fair, it&#x27;s okay. I blended it out with a flat kabuki brush and waited for it to oxidize. Then I applied bronzer to my temples and cheekbones and then added blush. Before it oxidized it looked soooo light so I freaked out but I just waited and kept blending in circular motions. After that, it looked much better but it left my features looking flat, after the bronzer it looked ah-mazing! For the price it&#x27;s excellent, the only thing is I got the moisture kind and it dried a little too powder. It wasn&#x27;t an issue because I applied cream products over it but if you&#x27;re going to wear it alone and have dry skin you wan to use a facial mist to keep it looking fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am a golden fair to medium-fair american girl.  The BB cream is a great quality, but the color is certainly not for my skin. It is very light and has a very cool, ashy undertone.  I use it as a highlighter, which it actually works very well at.</li>
            <li> I like this bb cream because it&#x27;s very blendable, buildable, and feels super light.&lt;br /&gt;The only sad thing is that this did not match my skintone very well, but I was overall very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> I tried it once or twice and it was lighter than my skin tone, so personally I would be repurchasing again.</li>
            <li> Too light for a tan person. Leaves a white cast on your face</li>
            <li> The color matched well with my face. At first, I was worried because the product looked a bit orange on my arm. It has medium coverage but still feels light. It&#x27;s not drying, but not too moisturizing either, although it has a slightly dewy finish. I like that it is easy to blend. I use less than a pea-sized. Not a fan of the scent, but it&#x27;s not unbearable.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream and I love it. I&#x27;ve always stayed away from tinted moisturizers, cream/liquid foundations and even high spf products; they irritate my sensitive skin! However, I got tired of looking for moisturizers with spf and mineral makeup because the ones I like keep getting discontinued. Since I keep hearing all the rave about Asian BB creams being good for your skin, I did my research online and found that this brand has light to medium coverage and won&#x27;t cause any breakouts. I&#x27;ve also used their dot eyeliner that is amazing so I know the brand doesn&#x27;t have false claims. And boy, did it live up to it&#x27;s claims. My skin feels and looks softer, smoother, less oily and best of all, not itchy or red. There are 5 types of cream in this Petit line and each one does something different so you should pick one according to your needs. Also, some of them are for pink tones, some for yellow tones. Since I&#x27;m a neutral tone, I can&#x27;t tell the difference. I will be buying more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Korean BB creams caters to those with lighter complexions. If you still wanted to try a Korean brand for medium complexions, you can look into Missha and Etude House which has different shades available.</li>
            <li> The formula with hyaluronic acid is an absolute must for me -- I had tried the &#x27;regular&#x27; formula and found it way too dry.  That said, the color is still perhaps a smidge darker than I would have liked.  Also, I find that for optimum coverage you probably will need to reapply.  I find my rosy rosacea cheeks start to peek through towards the end of the day.  It&#x27;s not the most natural looking coverage, either.  It definitely gives your skin a distinct &amp;#34;I&#x27;m wearing makeup&amp;#34; texture.  But the coverage is pretty good.</li>
