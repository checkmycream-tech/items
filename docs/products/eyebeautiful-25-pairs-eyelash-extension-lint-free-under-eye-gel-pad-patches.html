            <li>and she was fine.</li>
            <li>My clients say they are comfortable and i like how they stay in place.  </li>
            <li>They are cooling and comfortable for your client.</li>
            <li>The eye gel pads were not eyebeautiful as shown in the picture they were just a grey package and did stick as well as eye beautiful</li>
            <li>This product has been wonderful for most of my clients with the occasional fiber catching with the adhesive when I&#x27;m doing lash extensions, however, I recently had a client who experienced extreme pain, swelling, &amp;#</li>
            <li>Amazing!  Super thick and holding very nice on my clients.</li>
            <li>I have been doin lash extensions for the past 4 years and these are awesome!</li>
            <li>creates a canvas so lashes are easily seen making application of extensions easier thus saving time so worth the buck apiece.</li>
            <li>But overall, they are a good product.</li>
            <li>May be good for others with different technique</li>
            <li>Cool and soothing.</li>
            <li>I am looking into the full ingredient list</li>
            <li>They are comfortable for the client and exactly what I needed to ensure the adhesive does not stick to the bottom lash.</li>
            <li>Almost half of my clients I&#x27;ve used these in experienced itchy eyes, swelling,and discharge from their eyes after using these.</li>
            <li>so I can get a better idea of what she may be sensitive to.</li>
            <li>Go on and off easily, and create the best white background for hard to see lashes!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>actually felt moisturized and better</li>

            <li>I didnt have good luck with these, /they dont stay down very well in the inner eye area.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this for my clients.</li>
            <li>However apply some white medical tape to the edges and you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>And I love how they hold down the bottom lashes which makes lash extensions easier to apply!!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I use these eye pads on a professional level for my eyelash extension clients.  </li>
            <li>I love how these didn&#x27;t stick to my skin and the delicate skin under my eyes</li>
            <li>A lot of the get was stuck to the backing, like they were old or had been exposed to heat.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>Seller agreed to take them back however it would cost almost as much to send them back to China than the refund itself.</li>
            <li>These really help hold down the lower lashes while applying your lash extensions.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for 6 months now and I love it.  My clients say they are comfortable and i like how they stay in place.  They are easy to remove without hurting my clients.  I am a return customer.</li>
            <li> Good patches! Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Pads stick well but outer surface is hard and slippery.  Makes it hard to lash when my tool is slipping.  May be good for others with different technique but I prefer a pad with a softer gel-like surface.</li>
            <li> These are the best product I&#x27;ve found. The price is good too. I will be ordering again for sure. Thanks</li>
            <li> These are my favorite undereye pads for my clients during eyelash extension services.  They are a great shape for almost every eye, they don&#x27;t move around, and the gel doesn&#x27;t ooze out of them.  It&#x27;s the best deal on 25 pairs I have found.  I have ordered them 3 times, and each time the packaging has been different which makes me nervous that they are going to change the eye pads.  They are perfect, don&#x27;t change them at all!</li>
            <li> these work just fine. they come in plain grey packages. if using for lash extensions you need to tape them down so they don&#x27;t slide into the eyes. creates a canvas so lashes are easily seen making application of extensions easier thus saving time so worth the buck apiece.</li>

            <li> I didnt have good luck with these, /they dont stay down very well in the inner eye area. Kinda bulky.</li>

            <li> Wonderful product, perfect for eyes extension lashes:), loved, thanks</li>
            <li> Very good product for a good price</li>
            <li> They do not stay in place even when using medical tape. They were sliding up within seconds of application.  I do not recommend these pads. Seller agreed to take them back however it would cost almost as much to send them back to China than the refund itself.</li>
            <li> This product has been wonderful for most of my clients with the occasional fiber catching with the adhesive when I&#x27;m doing lash extensions, however, I recently had a client who experienced extreme pain, swelling, &amp;#34;sick looking&amp;#34; eyes that lasted a week after. We initially thought it was the adhesive but after yesterday we determined it was the gel patches because she immediately experienced the pain and I had not begun using the adhesive. We wiped the &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; off her lower eye and used medical tape and she was fine. Very scary... even her eyeball was red at the bottom where the gel patch was closest to her eye. Overall, no problems but some people may be allergic... I am looking into the full ingredient list so I can get a better idea of what she may be sensitive to. Hope this helps us lashers to keep our clients safe, happy and coming back!!!</li>
            <li> I like them with my customers!</li>
            <li> The backing would not peel off well.  A lot of the get was stuck to the backing, like they were old or had been exposed to heat.</li>
            <li> I really liked the eye patch. It has a very good hold and it doesn&#x27;t move when I fix eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Super thick and holding very nice on my clients. Also very easy to take off. Will order them always here now. Wow! Loving them. Perfect for eyelash extensions! !! Musst try!</li>
            <li> my clients LOVE these.  Feels great and they stay in place.</li>
            <li> The eye gel pads were not eyebeautiful as shown in the picture they were just a grey package and did stick as well as eye beautiful</li>
            <li> Perfect for what you need them for. Holds great but removes easily. Also they are priced better here then most places online.</li>

            <li> I LOVE  these. They work wonderful. They keep the lower lashes down while moisturizing the under eye.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t that sticky at all. However apply some white medical tape to the edges and you&#x27;re fine. They are very moisturized.</li>
            <li> These pads do not stay in place &amp; when removing your tape, the patches come apart. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Highly disappointed since i believed the reviews. will never purchase again.</li>
