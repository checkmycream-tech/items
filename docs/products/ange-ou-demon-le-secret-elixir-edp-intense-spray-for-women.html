            <li>I LOVE this product..really love the fact that I can receive it overseas.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This one has more strong scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique and I love the orange notes.  </li>
            <li>It is rich, warm, sensual,and bold.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this fragrance, I really like ...</li>
            <li>She was so excited since she had smelled her own mothers same parfum and heard that her mother received MANY compliments.</li>
            <li>the smell is great and stays on you for a long time!!</li>
            <li>I love this fragance, it&#x27;s sensual, unique, more to use it at night and it lasts the enough time, full recomended</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick, and the product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>So we ordered it online for much less price and found it as good as the one in store and almost as durable.</li>
            <li>So far, I don&#x27;t feel it has a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new one - and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this at Sephora, had to get a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>No watered down scent, no opened box, the same product as available at your better fragence counters, at a much better price.</li>
            <li>Way way too sweet, sickly sweet actually.</li>
            <li>Maybe the one I got was older or not stored at the right temperature</li>
            <li>For some reason I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this perfume, but I really do.</li>
            <li>I really like it, but it does not stay.</li>
            <li>so I think its the real thing but</li>
            <li>VERY unhahppy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item twice now wanting the pictured item (solid purple bottle) and both times received a bottle that is purple on top that fades to clear.  </li>
            <li>Not the Same smell as the original</li>
            <li>I am surprised because the first time I tried this perfume at the airport in Europe it stayed on for like 8 hours.</li>
            <li>My new signiture scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a floral fragrance, but very dark, sexy, and intense.</li>
            <li>I already had two older versions of this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>very strong, very dark, but just right for fall/winter and lasts a long time on the skin</li>
            <li>My favorite scent; I tried it at Sephora and purchased it for about 50% less on Amazon!</li>
            <li>but I cannot seem to find it in any stores around where I live and was even told that this was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>My second favorite after pink one Givenchy Angels Ou Demon.</li>
            <li>here, this item is not  expensive as in regular stores.</li>
            <li>The bottle is different from the original (it has like holes on the back).</li>
            <li>I was surprised to get something else in the box.  </li>
            <li>Have worn this fragrance for years and when I last tried to get a new bottle, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  </li>

            <li> Not the Same smell as the original</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> First time i bought this perfum and I am very satisfied with it! the smell is great and stays on you for a long time!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> There is no scent, simply alcohol in a bottle. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good product. My girl so seductively smells... Saliva flows... Pleasantly to deal with you.I recommend. The best gift for romantic women.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent; I tried it at Sephora and purchased it for about 50% less on Amazon! Everytime I wear this, I get compliments. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;sophisticated, delicate and flowery.&amp;#34;  Perfect for a night out!</li>
            <li> Really lovely parfume. My second favorite after pink one Givenchy Angels Ou Demon. This one has more strong scent. Don&#x27;t see any differences with store parfumes. ❤️ Givenchy parfumes, use them around 8 years.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this fragrance. I will order it again soon. Definetely convenient to be able to get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this fragance, it&#x27;s sensual, unique, more to use it at night and it lasts the enough time, full recomended</li>
            <li> its not like it has to be</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, not at all like most Givenchy scents, which are much nicer.  Way way too sweet, sickly sweet actually.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  It&#x27;s unique and I love the orange notes.  I get so many compliments when I when I wear it. I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li> In the picture, the bottle itself is not the product for the box shown.  Since the words were rubbed off of the previous bottle I purchased, I was going by visuals.  My previous bottle looks just like the picture.  I was surprised to get something else in the box.  I took a chance and got duped. It smells similar but watered down.  I attempted to get a RMA to return it, and it is unclear if I can do that.  Buy your perfume from another retailer.  These guys are up to no good, it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the retailer: If you do the right thing and refund my purchase, I would be happy to follow up to tell everyone that you made good on my transaction.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on this cologne and can&#x27;t buy it in our city anymore. Love the compliments. Someone always comments on how good I smell when I wear Angels &amp; Demons Elixir.</li>
            <li> Become fascinated with the scent of this perfume, my husband raves every time I use it, so would buy this product again next time, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Not so good. And packaging was terrible.</li>
            <li> Thanks!! My Wife love it and the smell is so good !!</li>
            <li> I brought it for my daughter and its her favorite perfume she loves it and so do i !!!!</li>
            <li> For some reason I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this perfume, but I really do. It&#x27;s a floral fragrance, but very dark, sexy, and intense. Also, the staying power is very good. If you don&#x27;t shy away from bold fragrances, definitely check this one out.</li>
            <li> excellent 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Item is not what is pictured.  .  I ordered this item twice now wanting the pictured item (solid purple bottle) and both times received a bottle that is purple on top that fades to clear.  Same name, different bottle, different smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is great I really like it, but it does not stay. Within an hour its gone. I am surprised because the first time I tried this perfume at the airport in Europe it stayed on for like 8 hours. Maybe the one I got was older or not stored at the right temperature or I don&#x27;t know. The box looks legit so I think its the real thing but the scent just wont stay.</li>
            <li> this is a very GREAT scent. stay for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;  I am totally happy with this parfum!  here, this item is not  expensive as in regular stores.</li>
            <li> This scent makes a statement. It is rich, warm, sensual,and bold. My new signiture scent! I will be buying another bottle even though I just recieved this one today. The shipping was very quick, and the product is the real deal. No watered down scent, no opened box, the same product as available at your better fragence counters, at a much better price. Highy recommend, everyone will ask what is that scent you are wearing.</li>
            <li> We loved it for a while as we smelled the tester in Macys and were fascinated by its durability. So we ordered it online for much less price and found it as good as the one in store and almost as durable.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this fragrance, I really like ... I recommend it to others .. thank you ... keep up the good work</li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t feel it has a strong scent. I feel quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this at Sephora, had to get a bigger bottle. It smells like purple. Go ahead and smell it for yourself.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product..really love the fact that I can receive it overseas. Arrived in perfectect timing all in tact.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume but I cannot seem to find it in any stores around where I live and was even told that this was discontinued.  I was happy to be able to find it online.</li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for years and when I last tried to get a new bottle, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Ulta and Sephora no longer carry this, so I found it online...very glad I did!</li>
            <li> OMG , smells very good. very strong, very dark, but just right for fall/winter and lasts a long time on the skin</li>
            <li> VERY unhahppy with this purchase. Bought one for my daughter-in-law &amp; one for myself. She was so excited since she had smelled her own mothers same parfum and heard that her mother received MANY compliments. Well when the product arrived to us, she stated it DID NOT smell like the one her mother purchased nor did it have the lasting power - as if the product was watered down.&lt;br /&gt;VERY UNSATISFIED!!!!</li>
            <li> I already had two older versions of this fragrance. / I wanted to try a new one - and was not disappointed. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The product is different from the same one purchased at a store. The fragrance that I received does not hold at all, I spray it and the smell is gone. I owned several bottles purchased from stores, and they all lasted hours! It appears that I was sold a fake product.</li>
            <li> The bottle is different from the original (it has like holes on the back). I think it&#x27;s fake and the perfume itself doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same, it has more alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> Love this. Will continental buying it.</li>
