    <ol>
            <li>Great place to find this color!</li>
            <li>The price here is very good also.  </li>
            <li>Stay away from the Clairol Beautiful Collection it leaves a waxy, sticky residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>So,  using the Clairol #765 Loving Care every couple weeks is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Everything was great - they didn&#x27;t have # 76</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to be gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I just want to feel good about my hair.</li>
            <li>The medium reddish brown Clairol Loving Care hair color is great.</li>
            <li>is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>And Loving Care #765 does that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was told about this product that is just like Clairol Loving Care [...]</li>
            <li>Loving Care is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair color because it has no ammonia or peroxide.  </li>
            <li>I had looked many places.  </li>
            <li>The condition of your hair is even better after you use it.</li>
            <li>I have used it before and was pleased.</li>
            <li>Would add more reddish highlights to my hair.    </li>
            <li>I Love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>I was able to do this four times with the same bottle, and greatly expanded the amount of product I was able to use.  </li>
            <li>certainly easy and convenient in a pinch, but</li>
            <li>I love this product for covering gray hair but looking very natural and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a hard to find color, and I was very happy to find it here.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon for the ability for many of us to buy this thru you</li>
            <li>The end color of the grays did look like highlights, and blended nicely into my natural hair color.  </li>
            <li>After using this product once to get over my fear of dying, I think I&#x27;m ready to move on to a semi-permanent product for more longevity...</li>
            <li>It is the same as I have used, so glad to be able to order it here.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it or want to try another color, it washes out quickly</li>
            <li>I was concerned that because this product washes out quickly that it would rub off on my clothes or sheets and stain them, but it didn&#x27;t.      </li>
            <li>I was amazed how smooth this transaction was and the product is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My order was processed very quickly and shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>I have been Loving Care, medium brown mixed with reddish brown and sometimes auburn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have found some of the old Loving Care product they&#x27;ve discontinued - along with the lovely conditioner Clairol used to include before they decided to get cheap and put in the useless stuff that comes with Natural Instincts.  </li>
            <li>Considering that it wasn&#x27;t recommended for my natural brunette color, it did a reasonable job at doing mostly what I wanted it to:</li>
            <li>Adds so much shine!  </li>
            <li>First, let me lay some background...    </li>
            <li>I accidentally left it in for over an hour, and was concerned; however, the color result was probably better for me, and it didn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair (however, I would not advise doing this without first consulting Clairol).  </li>
            <li>Although this was not difficult to do, it is not convenient.  </li>
            <li>(Although many people who use products such as henna redye their hair every couple of weeks, that frequency is just not for me.)  </li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>if you are dying your hair for the first time:    </li>
            <li>Plan this days in advance since you have to do an allergy skin test first, as well as a hair strand test, and you also have to wash all product (including conditioner) out of your hair and wait 12-24 hours before dying.  </li>
            <li>Wear it inside out, and be sure to have a large neck hole because you have to take it off over wet, dye-soaked hair.  </li>
            <li>I could experiment with and would wash out within a reasonable amount of time if I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>The gray was covered, but not as much as I wanted it to be...</li>
            <li>So much for you returns department.  </li>
            <li>Although there was a hint of red highlight to the end result, my grays (which are silvery white) turned as much golden as reddish, and because of their original silvery nature, individual strands shone a somewhat brassy color within my brunette hair, but it was not unpleasing or too unnatural looking, and definitely better than the gray strands.  </li>
            <li>It adds body as well as just the right amount of color, which fades naturally after about 10 days.  </li>
            <li>it is a pain to keep your long hair in it and secure it.  </li>
            <li>Use tight fitting latex gloves rather than the disposible plastic gloves supplied.  </li>
            <li>By adding a little water to the \\&quot;empty\\&quot; bottle and shaking it, you can get a lot more product out.  </li>
            <li>Their new product has either ammonia or peroxide...</li>
            <li>In summary:  Good product for apprehensive first-time hair dyer, but for brunettes the result is not quite enough color (in my opinion), and it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me.  </li>
            <li>It requires advanced planning and preparation, and is not quick.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting my mostly light brown hair to look like the woman&#x27;s on the box, it&#x27;s not even remotely that red, not even orangey, mostly just brown with my grays looking dark yellow.</li>
            <li>Clear the area where you plan to dye your hair</li>
            <li>Is gentler than natural Instincts.</li>
            <li>I used this color for my roots only and it really does work.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely wash out which for me</li>
            <li>My hair looks really natural with this product.</li>
            <li>Use an old towel for your hair after washing the dye out.</li>
            <li>I have wasted a lot of money on other so-called non-permanent hair coloring products, and nothing even comes close to Loving Care.  </li>
            <li>There will be some spray or drips especially if you are new at this.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks and 4-5 washes, some of the grays are already back to their old self.  </li>
            <li>It apparently is still floating around in the nether world some where because I received no response.  </li>
            <li>i have been using this color/product for approximately 12 years, tried others, but like this best...get many compliments on how \\&quot;natural\\&quot; it looks on me...</li>
            <li>Note: a LITTLE water at a time so as not to dilute it too much.  </li>

            <li> Note: a LITTLE water at a time so as not to dilute it too much.  </li>
            <li> Would cover my small amount of gray without changing my natural hair color or covering my natural highlights...</li>
            <li> To Clairol&#x27;s exoneration, they do not recommend this product for my medium dark brunette color, but I wanted to try it anyway because I hoped that the medium reddish brown shade (slightly lighter in tone than my natural hair) would not cover my natural color, but would only cover my grays, giving them a hint of red, as well as adding some red highlights.    </li>
            <li> Ironically, my fears of dye lasting too long were counteracted by this product not lasting long enough.  </li>
            <li> Put on an old dark colored shirt that won&#x27;t show stains.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little scary to realize that eventually I won&#x27;t be able to buy it at any price.</li>
            <li> it did not change my natural base color, and it did mostly cover the gray.  </li>
            <li> (I have dry hair and can only wash it on average twice a week).  </li>
            <li> the entire process with shampooing took around an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, out of desperation, before I found out about it I paid over $1500 for two years worth of Loving Care from a seller on ebay :((</li>
            <li> (and they always look so fake and leave a marked line as the new hair grows in).  </li>
            <li> It was too red for my coloring but east to use and trouble</li>
            <li> Try any product that was going to change the base color of my hair since I like my brunette with natural red and golden highlights.    </li>
            <li> I had problems with loss of hair with other hair color and found Clairol colored without side effects.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can use it where I need it--mainly around the hairline and can streak it in around the crown (my hair is shoulder length, with just a little curve under at the ends.)  </li>
            <li> If you want to keep dying your hair, I would find the process inconvenient to have to keep repeating frequently.  </li>
            <li> The temporary nature of this product and its claim that it wouldn&#x27;t change my base color took the nervousness out of dying my hair for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This product is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> This product is hard to find at stores in our area.</li>
            <li> It had been hard finding a comparable product and color.</li>
            <li> Now I am stuck with 96 bottles of 3 year old hair color! :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to color with monthly or less frequency!!!</li>
            <li> yes, it&#x27;s a scary step to move up to \\&quot;big-girl\\&quot; dye, but</li>
            <li> I, mistakenly ordered the wrong color.  </li>
            <li> one of my worst fears was a flat monotone color.  </li>
            <li> It makes the hair look dirty and separated.</li>
            <li> The process wasn&#x27;t very difficult to do (although it did take over an hour).  </li>
            <li> and it was a bad choice.</li>
            <li> Too bad clairol has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> It is awful!</li>
            <li> frustrating!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be gorgeous.  I just want to feel good about my hair. And Loving Care #765 does that.  It adds body as well as just the right amount of color, which fades naturally after about 10 days.  I shampoo every day and can&#x27;t use anything with ammonia or peroxide (and they always look so fake and leave a marked line as the new hair grows in).  So,  using the Clairol #765 Loving Care every couple weeks is perfect.  I like the fact that I can use it where I need it--mainly around the hairline and can streak it in around the crown (my hair is shoulder length, with just a little curve under at the ends.)  I have wasted a lot of money on other so-called non-permanent hair coloring products, and nothing even comes close to Loving Care.  Loving Care is by far the best.  It&#x27;s a little scary to realize that eventually I won&#x27;t be able to buy it at any price.</li>
            <li> Used it all the time 30 years ago. Is gentler than natural Instincts. If hair is short, you can get two applications from one bottle.</li>
            <li> Great place to find this color! This is a hard to find color, and I was very happy to find it here. My order was processed very quickly and shipped super fast. I was amazed how smooth this transaction was and the product is exactly what I was looking for. I will definately order this again and again!</li>
            <li> I love this hair color because it has no ammonia or peroxide.  I had problems with loss of hair with other hair color and found Clairol colored without side effects.  When I found they were discontinuing the product I bought every bottle I could find through internet and drugstores.</li>
            <li> Wish Clairol would bring this product back.</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel like you&#x27;ve had a salon conditioning treatment!  Adds so much shine!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find.  I had looked many places.  The price here is very good also.  I love this product for covering gray hair but looking very natural and it is very easy to use.  The condition of your hair is even better after you use it.</li>
            <li> I used this color for my roots only and it really does work. It turns the color that&#x27;s on the box</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have found some of the old Loving Care product they&#x27;ve discontinued - along with the lovely conditioner Clairol used to include before they decided to get cheap and put in the useless stuff that comes with Natural Instincts.  I just have to wonder a bit about the color, and whether this stuff might \\&quot;go bad\\&quot; after a while.  I was expecting my mostly light brown hair to look like the woman&#x27;s on the box, it&#x27;s not even remotely that red, not even orangey, mostly just brown with my grays looking dark yellow.</li>
            <li> Everything was great - they didn&#x27;t have # 76 so I tried this one and it was a bad choice. I am trying to HIDE red hair with brown rinse.  Otherwise...everything was swell.</li>
            <li> Stay away from the Clairol Beautiful Collection it leaves a waxy, sticky residue in my hair. It is awful! It is damaging to the hair to just comb through it. The waxiness lasts even after several shampoos, at which time all the color is gone anyway. It makes the hair look dirty and separated. It looks horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told about this product that is just like Clairol Loving Care [...] I read the reviews and the women are raving about it. Unfortunately, out of desperation, before I found out about it I paid over $1500 for two years worth of Loving Care from a seller on ebay :(( Now I am stuck with 96 bottles of 3 year old hair color! :( I wish I had known!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it here for 5.99 a bottle. it&#x27;s bigger then Clairol&#x27;s was too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> i have been using this color/product for approximately 12 years, tried others, but like this best...get many compliments on how \\&quot;natural\\&quot; it looks on me...PLEASE don&#x27;t discontinue!!!!!!  thanks amazon for the ability for many of us to buy this thru you, i cannot find it in any of my town stores either........frustrating!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find at stores in our area. I have used it before and was pleased. It is the same as I have used, so glad to be able to order it here.</li>
            <li> The medium reddish brown Clairol Loving Care hair color is great. It covers my gray, for about three weeks it has a red cast to it, and gradually fades after about a month. It doesn&#x27;t completely wash out which for me is a good thing. My hair looks really natural with this product.</li>
            <li> First, let me lay some background...    I had never dyed my hair before and didn&#x27;t want to:    1. Try any permanent product  2. Try any semi-permanent product that was going to show root grow-out (I have dry hair and can only wash it on average twice a week).  3. Try any product that was going to change the base color of my hair since I like my brunette with natural red and golden highlights.    I wanted a temporary product that:    1.  I could experiment with and would wash out within a reasonable amount of time if I didn&#x27;t like it.  2.  Would wash out before root grow out.  3.  Would cover my small amount of gray without changing my natural hair color or covering my natural highlights...one of my worst fears was a flat monotone color.  4.  Would add more reddish highlights to my hair.    To Clairol&#x27;s exoneration, they do not recommend this product for my medium dark brunette color, but I wanted to try it anyway because I hoped that the medium reddish brown shade (slightly lighter in tone than my natural hair) would not cover my natural color, but would only cover my grays, giving them a hint of red, as well as adding some red highlights.    Pros:    --  The temporary nature of this product and its claim that it wouldn&#x27;t change my base color took the nervousness out of dying my hair for the first time.  --  Considering that it wasn&#x27;t recommended for my natural brunette color, it did a reasonable job at doing mostly what I wanted it to: it did not change my natural base color, and it did mostly cover the gray.  --  The end color of the grays did look like highlights, and blended nicely into my natural hair color.  --  The process wasn&#x27;t very difficult to do (although it did take over an hour).  --  If you don&#x27;t like it or want to try another color, it washes out quickly (you could accelerate this process with repeated consecutive washes).  --  The max recommended time for leaving this product in your hair is 45 minutes.  I accidentally left it in for over an hour, and was concerned; however, the color result was probably better for me, and it didn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair (however, I would not advise doing this without first consulting Clairol).  --  I was concerned that because this product washes out quickly that it would rub off on my clothes or sheets and stain them, but it didn&#x27;t.      Cons:    --  The normal average time for leaving the dye in your hair is supposed to be 20 minutes, but that would not have worked for my hair...I had to leave it in for the maximum time...the entire process with shampooing took around an hour and a half.  --  The gray was covered, but not as much as I wanted it to be...I wish the end result was darker.  --  Although there was a hint of red highlight to the end result, my grays (which are silvery white) turned as much golden as reddish, and because of their original silvery nature, individual strands shone a somewhat brassy color within my brunette hair, but it was not unpleasing or too unnatural looking, and definitely better than the gray strands.  --  Although this was not difficult to do, it is not convenient.  It requires advanced planning and preparation, and is not quick.  It is not something I want to do every two to three weeks.  --  Ironically, my fears of dye lasting too long were counteracted by this product not lasting long enough.  After a couple of weeks and 4-5 washes, some of the grays are already back to their old self.  --  This product continues to fade even without washings.    In summary:  Good product for apprehensive first-time hair dyer, but for brunettes the result is not quite enough color (in my opinion), and it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me.  If you want to keep dying your hair, I would find the process inconvenient to have to keep repeating frequently.  (Although many people who use products such as henna redye their hair every couple of weeks, that frequency is just not for me.)  After using this product once to get over my fear of dying, I think I&#x27;m ready to move on to a semi-permanent product for more longevity...yes, it&#x27;s a scary step to move up to \\&quot;big-girl\\&quot; dye, but now I think I&#x27;ll survive it. ;)    Recommendations if you are dying your hair for the first time:    --  Plan this days in advance since you have to do an allergy skin test first, as well as a hair strand test, and you also have to wash all product (including conditioner) out of your hair and wait 12-24 hours before dying.  --  Put on an old dark colored shirt that won&#x27;t show stains.  Wear it inside out, and be sure to have a large neck hole because you have to take it off over wet, dye-soaked hair.  --  Lay out all your supplies before beginning, especially damp paper towels to wipe your face (somehow this ended up all over my face).  --  There will be some spray or drips especially if you are new at this.  Clear the area where you plan to dye your hair (I did it at a sink vanity in front of the mirror, which I recommend).  Do not get this product on white sink calk or grout...it could stain.  --  Use tight fitting latex gloves rather than the disposible plastic gloves supplied.  --  Use a plastic shower cap with an elastic band instead of the plastic bag supplied...it is a pain to keep your long hair in it and secure it.  --  A lot of product sticks in the bottle at the end.  By adding a little water to the \\&quot;empty\\&quot; bottle and shaking it, you can get a lot more product out.  I was able to do this four times with the same bottle, and greatly expanded the amount of product I was able to use.  Note: a LITTLE water at a time so as not to dilute it too much.  --  Use an old towel for your hair after washing the dye out.</li>
            <li> I have been Loving Care, medium brown mixed with reddish brown and sometimes auburn.  The product does not have peroxide or ammonia and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve used it all these  years.  Their new product has either ammonia or peroxide...both of which I&#x27;m allergic  to.  I&#x27;ve been ordering Loving Care like crazy but I will run out of it because they  discontinued it.  I have no idea what I will use next but I don&#x27;t want gray hair to  show.</li>
            <li> This product solved my problem with allergic reaction to hair color.  It was too red for my coloring but east to use and trouble freel  Too bad clairol has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because my wife uses it.  I, mistakenly ordered the wrong color.  &amp;#34;No problem&amp;#34;, I said to myself, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll just return it&amp;#34;.  Your returns system WOULD NOT LET ME RETURN THE PRODUCT.  It kept saying it could not return &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;.  I could not contact anyone at Amazon to confirm this.  I sent a &amp;#34;contact us&amp;#34; email.  It apparently is still floating around in the nether world some where because I received no response.  I finally gave the product to my daughter to sell on ebay.  So much for you returns department.  I think you owe me $22 USD.</li>
            <li> I Love this product and have used it for years. I wish they had not stopped making this color. It had been hard finding a comparable product and color.</li>
            <li> certainly easy and convenient in a pinch, but this color/product is SO short-lived (not even 6 shampoos), that it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s cost is low...I don&#x27;t want to have to color with monthly or less frequency!!! Won&#x27;t repurchase</li>
