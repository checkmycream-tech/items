            <li>The lotion is just okay and for the price it should be fabulous.</li>

            <li>Between the humidity and and Texas&#x27; inability to ever get below 110 degrees, the burning sensation I feel in my feet at night would make that actor on those Shingles commerciasl feel like he was tinkering with an easy bake oven.</li>
            <li>though I suppose that&#x27;s true for most foot lotions).</li>
            <li>was looking for a mint lotion...truely enjoy it...</li>
            <li>My husband used this on my feet in the hospital while I was in labor - it smells amazing, very soothing and calming, and it moisturizes well.</li>

            <li>, it leaves your skin so nice and soft , I love e it</li>

            <li>It moisturizes well, not too greasy, and is long-lasting and my feet look great all day, and don&#x27;t get that dry look at all.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this product for the price.</li>
            <li>instead - much thicker and more relaxing.</li>

            <li>Stops leg cramps the very first time.</li>
            <li>Great for those who have trouble with &amp;#34;hot feet&amp;#34; at night.</li>
            <li>sweet sweet cant think of anything else, thanks</li>
            <li>It makes my at-home pedicures much more enjoyable and keeps my heels soft and smooth -- definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Her Comments: i just love the tingly feeling when I apply to the feet and of course it makes my feet soft .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and ¢¾d this product since 2001-2002, I&#x27;d been using Suave at the time to alleviate dry/cracked skin on my surgically repaired right foot.</li>
            <li>Sore feet perked right up.  </li>
            <li>I also have a smaller travel size version for my travel kit, and that really comes in handy when I&#x27;ve been touring and walking for hours a day.</li>
            <li>I know the price was very reasonable on this</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind squeezing kinda hard and shaking it vigorously to get the lotion out, then this is a really great product.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>I struggle with hot feet</li>
            <li>Sometimes my feet gets so hot</li>
            <li>Has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li>It is my first Body Shop lotion</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>thanks!  </li>
            <li>I will order more later.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, a recent move to Texas has left me rather hot and bothered (but not in a good way).</li>
            <li>The kind that comes in the green tube is higher, but worth</li>
            <li>The lotion has a slight cooling sensation from the peppermint, smells good (but not too overwhelmingly pepperminty, like other foot lotions), and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>This is very cooling whenever I suffer from hot feet.</li>
            <li>I have used peppermint foot products in the past that were really good.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my feet feeling cool skin soft</li>
            <li>Does cool and makes your feet soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other types of foot lotion prior to this one and in my opinion this one ranks up there with the best!</li>
            <li>A refreshing foot massage with the peppermint lotion, clean pair of socks and a change of shoes gets me back on my feet and ready for the next outing !</li>
            <li>an hour later woke up because my feet were so hot that they only made the cream warm</li>
            <li>Packaging is good and if there were either more ounces or if it was a little less pricy</li>
            <li>Very high marks for this product.</li>
            <li>but I do really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap peppermint candy and has about the same consistancy.</li>
            <li>Works great my feet feel better,it helps relive my tired feet .sweet</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>It is great to sooth tired or achy feet</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It really has helped to soften my feet.</li>
            <li>Cooling, didn&#x27;t really do for me.</li>
            <li>it has a very soothing feeling on my feet</li>
            <li>I like this lotion so much that I am now on the &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It puts my kids right to sleep and makes their feet soft.</li>
            <li>I have other lotions that work much better</li>
            <li>but I will either use it more sparingly or use some other product for a foot massage.</li>
            <li>This product is OK but not worth ordering online when you can get good foot cream or lotion for less at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>this lotion has the best smell out there...and after a long hard day on the feet it really does cool them down....</li>
            <li>It took me a few uses to get used to the smell, but now I think it&#x27;s pretty pleasant and your feet definitely feel nice and smooth after you let them soak in the lotion (usually by wearing thick socks or just sleeping in bed right after application) for a while.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell nice, but it is extremely soothing and calming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy, but if you put on more than a nickel-sized amount per foot, it can be a little slippery (</li>
            <li>it still has the great smell and cooling factor, however, it was very thin and runny....</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my foot really soft but will only last for a few hours.</li>
            <li>ordered another due to the fact that Dr. School&#x27;s cooling peppermint is no longer available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if its just the bottle I purchased, but one thing surprised me about the bottle of lotion I just received, it is a bit more runny than it ever has been....</li>
            <li>This was delivered quickly and the product is as expected.</li>
            <li>A product like this is hard to find in any stores, I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but I purchased it from the Body Shop directly....</li>
            <li>The product I received was old, made in 2008 and as I remember it is 2013 now.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and is not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet soft.  </li>
            <li>Solved my problem and kept my feet as soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>soft keeps  heel callous soft.</li>
            <li>This actually makes my whole body feel cooler.</li>
            <li>it would be a five star product, but there are a few similar products that are a better value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it used to be a bit more thick like a paste....</li>
            <li>I have use many lotions and related products for my feet, this is above average.</li>
            <li>Ready to be there to relieve dry feet.</li>
            <li>but I really do not feel much.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t have the same \\&quot;minty\\&quot; cooling, soothing action as before.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasy/watery, so I&#x27;d recommend spending a few more dollars to get Aveda&#x27;s peppermint foot lotion</li>
            <li>Growing up in Utah, my warm feet problem was easily solved by simply sticking my feet out under the covers and letting the frigid temperatures do their work.</li>
            <li>The peppermint and/or menthol really cooled by feet down.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I know the price was very reasonable on this</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind squeezing kinda hard and shaking it vigorously to get the lotion out, then this is a really great product.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> I struggle with hot feet</li>
            <li> Sometimes my feet gets so hot</li>
            <li> Has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li> It is my first Body Shop lotion</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> thanks!  </li>
            <li> I will order more later.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a recent move to Texas has left me rather hot and bothered (but not in a good way).</li>
            <li> The kind that comes in the green tube is higher, but worth</li>
            <li> The lotion has a slight cooling sensation from the peppermint, smells good (but not too overwhelmingly pepperminty, like other foot lotions), and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> This is very cooling whenever I suffer from hot feet.</li>
            <li> I have used peppermint foot products in the past that were really good.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my feet feeling cool skin soft</li>
            <li> Does cool and makes your feet soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other types of foot lotion prior to this one and in my opinion this one ranks up there with the best!</li>
            <li> A refreshing foot massage with the peppermint lotion, clean pair of socks and a change of shoes gets me back on my feet and ready for the next outing !</li>
            <li> an hour later woke up because my feet were so hot that they only made the cream warm</li>
            <li> Packaging is good and if there were either more ounces or if it was a little less pricy</li>
            <li> Very high marks for this product.</li>
            <li> but I do really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap peppermint candy and has about the same consistancy.</li>
            <li> Works great my feet feel better,it helps relive my tired feet .sweet</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> It is great to sooth tired or achy feet</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It really has helped to soften my feet.</li>
            <li> Cooling, didn&#x27;t really do for me.</li>
            <li> it has a very soothing feeling on my feet</li>
            <li> I like this lotion so much that I am now on the &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It puts my kids right to sleep and makes their feet soft.</li>
            <li> I have other lotions that work much better</li>
            <li> but I will either use it more sparingly or use some other product for a foot massage.</li>
            <li> This product is OK but not worth ordering online when you can get good foot cream or lotion for less at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> this lotion has the best smell out there...and after a long hard day on the feet it really does cool them down....</li>
            <li> It took me a few uses to get used to the smell, but now I think it&#x27;s pretty pleasant and your feet definitely feel nice and smooth after you let them soak in the lotion (usually by wearing thick socks or just sleeping in bed right after application) for a while.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it smell nice, but it is extremely soothing and calming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy, but if you put on more than a nickel-sized amount per foot, it can be a little slippery (</li>
            <li> it still has the great smell and cooling factor, however, it was very thin and runny....</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my foot really soft but will only last for a few hours.</li>
            <li> ordered another due to the fact that Dr. School&#x27;s cooling peppermint is no longer available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if its just the bottle I purchased, but one thing surprised me about the bottle of lotion I just received, it is a bit more runny than it ever has been....</li>
            <li> This was delivered quickly and the product is as expected.</li>
            <li> A product like this is hard to find in any stores, I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but I purchased it from the Body Shop directly....</li>
            <li> The product I received was old, made in 2008 and as I remember it is 2013 now.</li>
            <li> It smells fabulous and is not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet soft.  </li>
            <li> Solved my problem and kept my feet as soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> soft keeps  heel callous soft.</li>
            <li> This actually makes my whole body feel cooler.</li>
            <li> it would be a five star product, but there are a few similar products that are a better value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it used to be a bit more thick like a paste....</li>
            <li> I have use many lotions and related products for my feet, this is above average.</li>
            <li> Ready to be there to relieve dry feet.</li>
            <li> but I really do not feel much.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t have the same \\&quot;minty\\&quot; cooling, soothing action as before.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy/watery, so I&#x27;d recommend spending a few more dollars to get Aveda&#x27;s peppermint foot lotion</li>
            <li> Growing up in Utah, my warm feet problem was easily solved by simply sticking my feet out under the covers and letting the frigid temperatures do their work.</li>
            <li> The peppermint and/or menthol really cooled by feet down.  </li>
            <li> I just wish the price was lower as with daily use, it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> The peppermint scent is not overwhelming and is actually very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really the only negative thing I can say.  </li>
            <li> My husband insists that his dry, itchy skin is only soothed by minty lotions and this is one of his favorites.</li>
            <li> My feet have been portable space heaters for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When my hands are overly dry</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice them getting as dry as often.</li>
            <li> When it dries, foot is dry again.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion for my hot tired diabetic feet at night.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, absorbs into the skin &amp; makes the skin soft &amp; supple - no more rough &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> Not very minty smelling.</li>
            <li> it cause it really helixes tired feet.  </li>
            <li> and I start wearing closed shoes without socks, I stock up on this.  </li>
            <li> It feels like any other lotion so go buy something else instead of this.</li>
            <li> Also it is non greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue that some other foot lotions do.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the product cap came loose in shipping, leaving a mess in the box and all over it.  </li>
            <li> I put it on and it was a little uncomfortable to sleep at first because it&#x27;s so oily</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really to thick and takes an enormous amount to rub on your feet and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I store upside down</li>
            <li> then my previous brand</li>
            <li> does not cool my feet like it advertised.</li>
            <li> I am desperate to sleep without hot feet, so I bought this lotion and even put it in the refrigerator before using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a  hard plastic unsqueezeable bottle that makes it difficult to dispense the product and the cap on mine broke in transit so that I have to take the whole cap off each time and pound the bottom like a bottle of ketchup to dispense the product.</li>
            <li> Anyway I bought this cream at 3am after tossing and turning for a few hours, hoping to find just a quantum of solace (+10 for James Bond reference) to help me sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li> Shopping via Amazon Prime makes it easier to get things like this that are not available nearby.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get a cold gel wrap or just wet your feet and put a little fan next to them.</li>
            <li> and my feet were now hot AND sticky :(  </li>
            <li> The only upside to this product is that after application your hands smell faintly of peppermint for a few hours, which might be a negative afterall if you aren&#x27;t into that sort of a thing.</li>
            <li> also found it hard to squeeze the bottle and there was very little flexability with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It prevents ugly calluses from forming and also helps take away some of the aches and pains when I&#x27;ve spent a long day walking or standing on my feet.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a lotion that truly softened my feet and refreshed them too.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> Tried this foot lotion in the late 1980&#x27;s while traveling in London.  </li>
            <li> However, with this it has just a small amount of peppermint and just feels like thin foot lotion.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s also in a very small container.</li>
            <li> I guess works on tired legs too</li>
            <li> However, the bottle is weird and difficult to get the lotion out of.  </li>
            <li> I know, weird review,</li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad bottle.  </li>
            <li> It looked painful.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> The packaging is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I have been on my feet all day and they are swollen by the end of the evening, I rub this lotion on them and it instantly relieves the pain and by morning the swelling is gone!</li>
            <li> This is the most refreshing lotion for your feet.  When feet are burning, it is soothing, I love it!</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law was complaining about her feet hurting.  I have used this type of peppermint lotion before and found it soothing.  I bought this product and gave it to my mother-in-law who loves it.  It is not greasy and absorbs well into the skin.  The peppermint scent is not overwhelming and is actually very relaxing.  I would recommend this lotion to others.</li>
            <li> I have used peppermint foot products in the past that were really good.  The peppermint and/or menthol really cooled by feet down.  However, with this it has just a small amount of peppermint and just feels like thin foot lotion.  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and ¢¾d this product since 2001-2002, I&#x27;d been using Suave at the time to alleviate dry/cracked skin on my surgically repaired right foot. When my Physical Therapist found out I was using Suave, she&#x27;d intro&#x27;d me to this lotion. I CANNOT sing its&#x27; praises enough! This stuff WORKS WONDERS, plus it&#x27;s fair trade and made from natural products. It may cost a little more than you&#x27;d like to spend, but PLEASE consider buying this wonderful product....</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed The Body Shop products for years, and this by far, is the best foot lotion that I have found. Not only does it smell nice, but it is extremely soothing and calming. It moisturizes well, not too greasy, and is long-lasting and my feet look great all day, and don&#x27;t get that dry look at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister, who had it on her Amazon wish list.  She absolutely loves it!  Will have to get some for myself!</li>
            <li> does not cool my feet like it advertised.</li>
            <li> I have used this peppermint cooling foot lotion for years....but I purchased it from the Body Shop directly....its nice that Amazon is now carrying it....this lotion has the best smell out there...and after a long hard day on the feet it really does cool them down....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if its just the bottle I purchased, but one thing surprised me about the bottle of lotion I just received, it is a bit more runny than it ever has been....it still has the great smell and cooling factor, however, it was very thin and runny....it used to be a bit more thick like a paste....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to put it on my feet and then put on a pair of socks so the lotion would not run off my feet...which worked....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If its smell and cooling effect you are looking for...this is the stuff for you...if you want something that deeply penetrates your skin to help prevent it from cracking, this may not be the best product....</li>
            <li> Great lotion which is refreshing to your feet. It was almost $6 cheaper on a,axon than purchasing at the store in my local mall.</li>
            <li> The product I received was old, made in 2008 and as I remember it is 2013 now. The Body Shop doesn&#x27;t recommend using their products after 3 years. Smells bad.</li>
            <li> I am desperate to sleep without hot feet, so I bought this lotion and even put it in the refrigerator before using it. I put it on and it was a little uncomfortable to sleep at first because it&#x27;s so oily and my feet were messing up my sheets. I finally went to sleep and an hour later woke up because my feet were so hot that they only made the cream warm and my feet were now hot AND sticky :(  I never used the cream again. Save your money and get a cold gel wrap or just wet your feet and put a little fan next to them. This was what worked more for me.</li>
            <li> I found it to be lacking in the area of providing  that cooling sensation that is found in Dr.School&#x27;s cooling peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;It is really to thick and takes an enormous amount to rub on your feet and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I also found it hard to squeeze the bottle and there was very little flexability with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another due to the fact that Dr. School&#x27;s cooling peppermint is no longer available.I will probably order it again,since there isn&#x27;t anything else out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy/watery, so I&#x27;d recommend spending a few more dollars to get Aveda&#x27;s peppermint foot lotion instead - much thicker and more relaxing.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and feel great on your feet.  It puts my kids right to sleep and makes their feet soft.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion for my hot tired diabetic feet at night. I was hoping for a very obvious cooling sensation but I really do not feel much. I have other lotions that work much better but I do really like this lotion. It smells fabulous and is not too heavy or greasy. I got the spray as well and it helps out the cooling effect.</li>
            <li> Really good lotion.  Keeps my feet soft.  However, the bottle is weird and difficult to get the lotion out of.  I know, weird review, but it&#x27;s really the only negative thing I can say.  If you don&#x27;t mind squeezing kinda hard and shaking it vigorously to get the lotion out, then this is a really great product.</li>
            <li> This is great! It makes my feet look beautiful and not dry. It lasts 2 days if I don&#x27;t feel like using daily. It is healing and cooling on my feet. I store upside down and it comes out easy. When my hands are overly dry I use on them too.</li>
            <li> I used to have foot order. Then I discovered Dr. S&#x27;s peppermint foot cream. Solved my problem and kept my feet as soft as a baby&#x27;s skin. Then Dr. S. discontinued the product. I am now using the Body Shop&#x27;s version and I find it just as effective. My one complaint is the packaging. This type of bottle does not dispense as well. Perhaps if the cap was larger so you could stand the bottle on the cap?</li>
            <li> Stops leg cramps the very first time. Keep it in the fridge and massage it over feet and legs before bed. It works best after a hot soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> My dad had the most cracked heels. It looked painful. He used the lotion regularly for months and recently showed me his feet because he said the lotion worked! I noticed the difference too. Great price too.</li>
            <li> This product is OK but not worth ordering online when you can get good foot cream or lotion for less at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  The peppermint lotion has a wonderful smell that lingers for a while and is very refreshing and comforting for your feet.</li>
            <li> Leaves sticky residue on sandals and feet. Would not buy this product again. Not very minty smelling. Smells like cheap peppermint candy and has about the same consistancy.</li>
            <li> Works great my feet feel better,it helps relive my tired feet .sweet sweet sweet cant think of anything else, thanks</li>
            <li> Only tried once and it seemed to work well. I struggle with hot feet and I am hopeful this will help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s MIA. Definitely not worth the money. It feels like any other lotion so go buy something else instead of this.</li>
            <li> My feet have been portable space heaters for as long as I can remember. Growing up in Utah, my warm feet problem was easily solved by simply sticking my feet out under the covers and letting the frigid temperatures do their work. Unfortunately, a recent move to Texas has left me rather hot and bothered (but not in a good way). Between the humidity and and Texas&#x27; inability to ever get below 110 degrees, the burning sensation I feel in my feet at night would make that actor on those Shingles commerciasl feel like he was tinkering with an easy bake oven. Anyway I bought this cream at 3am after tossing and turning for a few hours, hoping to find just a quantum of solace (+10 for James Bond reference) to help me sleep at night. It arrived yesterday, but after application it actually felt like it retained heat on my feat rather than pepperminting away my troubles. The only upside to this product is that after application your hands smell faintly of peppermint for a few hours, which might be a negative afterall if you aren&#x27;t into that sort of a thing.</li>
            <li> This is very cooling whenever I suffer from hot feet. Sometimes my feet gets so hot I have trouble sleeping. This stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. It is great to sooth tired or achy feet and there is a nice tingle that lasts a while too. I just wish the price was lower as with daily use, it doesn&#x27;t last too long. Packaging is good and if there were either more ounces or if it was a little less pricy it would be a five star product, but there are a few similar products that are a better value.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to splurge, go for this one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.It is the best peppermint cooling lotion I&#x27;ve tried but I will either use it more sparingly or use some other product for a foot massage.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion, but did not have the cooling effect I was hoping for</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for Dr Scholls peppermint lotion.  This produce it okay.  It works quite well.  I was looking for a lotion that had a bit of tingle.  This product doesn&#x27;t have that but that is the only con I have for it.</li>
            <li> I know the price was very reasonable on this but it just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  I need something that stimulates the nerves in my feet to relax.  This smells good and moisturizes, but is more like hand than foot cream  The kind that comes in the green tube is higher, but worth it cause it really helixes tired feet.  Rethink this recipe.  I will pay more for it if it works!!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Microplane foot file, and it works great. The lotion has a slight cooling sensation from the peppermint, smells good (but not too overwhelmingly pepperminty, like other foot lotions), and moisturizes well.  It&#x27;s not too greasy, but if you put on more than a nickel-sized amount per foot, it can be a little slippery (though I suppose that&#x27;s true for most foot lotions). It makes my at-home pedicures much more enjoyable and keeps my heels soft and smooth -- definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not work well. Made my feet have a more burning sensation than cooling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and really enjoy the soothing and moisturizing properties for my dainty tootsies. I keep the bottle in my nightstand and massage it into my feet before going to bed each night. It prevents ugly calluses from forming and also helps take away some of the aches and pains when I&#x27;ve spent a long day walking or standing on my feet. I also have a smaller travel size version for my travel kit, and that really comes in handy when I&#x27;ve been touring and walking for hours a day. A refreshing foot massage with the peppermint lotion, clean pair of socks and a change of shoes gets me back on my feet and ready for the next outing !</li>
            <li> was looking for a mint lotion...truely enjoy it...use it on feet once i lightly scritch them as i call it :) (file)..love your lotion TY SO MUCH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and OH so much more lotion  then my previous brand</li>
            <li> A product like this is hard to find in any stores, I was glad to find it on Amazon.  It does help relieve pain for sore feet.  I will continue to buy this product.  Great buy</li>
            <li> Good product, fair price - Easy to apply, appealing fragrance - great product to add to Suscribe &amp; Save  | Minty !</li>
            <li> The lotion is just okay and for the price it should be fabulous. The packaging is awful. It&#x27;s a  hard plastic unsqueezeable bottle that makes it difficult to dispense the product and the cap on mine broke in transit so that I have to take the whole cap off each time and pound the bottom like a bottle of ketchup to dispense the product.</li>
            <li> My husband insists that his dry, itchy skin is only soothed by minty lotions and this is one of his favorites.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet feeling cool skin soft it has refreshing smell keeps skin soft keeps  heel callous soft. No cracks</li>
            <li> This product was interesting but did not have the ingredients listed in the product description so I could not identify an ingredient to which I am allergic.  In addition, the product cap came loose in shipping, leaving a mess in the box and all over it.  I did receive a quick refund when I returned the product.</li>
            <li> Love this foot lotion!! Works very well.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil is known for combating foot oder.  Every year when the temperatures start to turn and I start wearing closed shoes without socks, I stock up on this.  You get the best bang for your buck as far as soothing and moisturizing your feet in addition to eliminating oder.  Has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li> Not as cooling as i would hope. I guess works on tired legs too</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is helping my feet burning and I use it all over! I would like it to have more peppermint!</li>
            <li> My husband used this on my feet in the hospital while I was in labor - it smells amazing, very soothing and calming, and it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> This actually makes my whole body feel cooler. Awesome after a long day on my feet</li>
            <li> This is an excellent foot product. I am enjoying it very much. It really has helped to soften my feet.</li>
            <li> I am 9 months pregnant and this product DOES NOT do what it says. It smells like a candy cane and it has zero cooling effect. Was super bummed when I received this. Amazon nicely refunded my money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion and I love it , it leaves your skin so nice and soft , I love e it</li>
            <li> It took me a few uses to get used to the smell, but now I think it&#x27;s pretty pleasant and your feet definitely feel nice and smooth after you let them soak in the lotion (usually by wearing thick socks or just sleeping in bed right after application) for a while.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels so good and really softens the feet. Been using it for many years. I&#x27;ve tried other foot lotions but this works best and really makes your feet feel good.</li>
            <li> Tried this foot lotion in the late 1980&#x27;s while traveling in London.  Sore feet perked right up.  Have tried other peppermint foot lotions since but was happy to find this one again since it is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this product for the price.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice scent, is light and absorbs well.  I like the lotion as a lotion.  Cooling, didn&#x27;t really do for me.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it makes my feet feel so much better. I have use many lotions and related products for my feet, this is above average. 3 Stars</li>
            <li> Myself, hubby and teen daughter use this and we love it has a very soothing feeling on my feet and I don&#x27;t notice them getting as dry as often.</li>
            <li> This foot lotion is perfect.  I can feel it soothing my feet as soon as I apply it.  It is nicely scented. I highly recommend it.  I have tried several other types of foot lotion prior to this one and in my opinion this one ranks up there with the best!</li>
            <li> This was delivered quickly and the product is as expected. Ready to be there to relieve dry feet. Shopping via Amazon Prime makes it easier to get things like this that are not available nearby.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this peppermint lotion twenty years ago, I loved it! I purchased it while in London.  I finally located where to buy it and frankly, it doesn&#x27;t have the same \\&quot;minty\\&quot; cooling, soothing action as before.  Maybe I just got a bad bottle.  And it&#x27;s also in a very small container.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my feet - if you have not tried it yet, please do yourself a favor and order this. You will not slip.n.slide after it is applied and it works.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a lotion that truly softened my feet and refreshed them too.  I like this lotion so much that I am now on the &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34; program with Amazon, making sure it is automatically delivered to my door at the times I want.  Great product/great program!</li>
            <li> Very high marks for this product. A little goes a long way, absorbs into the skin &amp; makes the skin soft &amp; supple - no more rough &amp; dry. Also it is non greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue that some other foot lotions do.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Does cool and makes your feet soft. I like the fragrance. I only wish the cooling sensation lasted longer than it does.</li>
            <li> I especially love the cooling effects of the lotion.  Great for those who have trouble with &amp;#34;hot feet&amp;#34; at night.</li>
            <li> Her Comments: i just love the tingly feeling when I apply to the feet and of course it makes my feet soft .</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my foot really soft but will only last for a few hours. When it dries, foot is dry again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t smell the peppermint in this bottle. It is my first Body Shop lotion and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> it cools your skin n feet feel so much better after using this lotion... perfect mouisture as well... thanks!  ALWAYS satisfied w amazon products n sevice~</li>
            <li> I like using this lotion it is not overpowering or grease.  Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff I ave used it for years</li>
            <li> Im a Massage Therapist and I like to massage my clients with the best products I can find and peppermint lotion is the best thing to massage the feet, I decided to order this lotion after reading all the reviews on it and Im glad I did, my clients love it, it soothes their feet and they said it felt great. I tried it on my feet and loved it. I will order more later.</li>
