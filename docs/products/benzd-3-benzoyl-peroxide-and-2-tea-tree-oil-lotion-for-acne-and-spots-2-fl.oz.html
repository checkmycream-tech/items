            <li>My skin looks great!</li>
            <li>I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this product.</li>

            <li>I never write reviews but this this treatment is really great</li>

            <li>Works great on my acne and not too drying</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I found this.</li>
            <li>Saw results imediatly and saw amazing results in just 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>Thank you Bendz for this awesome stuff :-)</li>
            <li>and I feel like this was a good option.</li>
            <li>My favorite is Benzd, but the cleanser is great too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s potent, effective and smells great.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I also love the packaging!</li>
            <li>5 Stars for sure!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I explained what the issue was I&#x27;m happy to say they sent me the salic and retin formula free of charge and my skin loves these products.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great too - all recyclable paper and thoughtfully packed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to wait a bit longer to see if this product continues to be as effective,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective at clearing and drying out pimples.</li>
            <li>The DMSO intensifies the tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide to work more effectively inside the skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>hope it comes in handy as a spot treatment has benzoyl which I love</li>
            <li>Ok this is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant odor, like green tea, and my skin feels wonderfully refreshed after application.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This cream is potent.</li>
            <li>and omg it is all it says it will be and more.</li>
            <li>When anyone asks what I am using I will tell them about this life changing product :-)</li>
            <li>and I do find it quite effective at both reducing the redness and sensitivity within the first 2 days of use.</li>
            <li>When I told them it wasn&#x27;t going so well, they suggested the Benzd, and sent it to me to try free of charge.</li>
            <li>So, it is good for sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Whenever you apply any product to your face, make sure it is done very gently.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use ONLY your hands to get a nice foamy lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a problem not just with large pores and blackheads, but also with more hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>but im so proud of the results for the money I spent that I had to.</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin clear and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Works great, I also tried out there other products, like Retin and CLns.</li>
            <li>And most of all, it seems to be MUCH more effective at making any active zits and pimples go away fast.  </li>
            <li>I will not call this a miracle product, and my skin is by no means perfect, but overnight, some of the nastier problem spots were noticeably smaller, and when I use this regularly, it keeps my skin under control.</li>
            <li>I actually originally purchased the Salic product by Pom, but found it wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in years that I can honestly say I have clear skin.</li>
            <li>I really like how smoothly I can apply this to my face.</li>
            <li>Apply BENZD to any acne spots on face, again being very gentle and gliding your fingers over any areas.  </li>
            <li>It is not the typical strong chemical smells of most acne treatments.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this product at a discounted rate for my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference within the first use.</li>
            <li>but the tea tree oil hope it goes well mixed :)</li>
            <li>Despite being 4% BP, BENZD (which includes Castor Oil supposed to counter-act dryness) has made my skin feel and look so much better, and its only been 10 days.  </li>
            <li>Works really well without being harsh or drying and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>In summary, if you have had any success with BP, I would HIGHLY recommend this product, as it has been so much better for me than regular BP.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For those interested, here is my whole regimen (done twice a day,</li>
            <li>I wanted something mild for his young skin</li>
            <li>Works great for calming down inflamed and red areas.</li>
            <li>In the beginning,I used it all over my face twice everyday(morning/night) and started peeling in certain areas and my face could feel the sting.</li>
            <li>The main problem with acne.org&#x27;s BP was the fact that it was very, very drying.  </li>
            <li>Wow, first off let me say that I bought this with my own money and have absolutely no connection to this company or product.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in months, I actually feel good about how my face is improving and am actually excited that I can finally be clear within a few months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One of the advantage of this product is my daughter really likes the smell.</li>
            <li>I think the bottle dispenses too much at once</li>
            <li>so I imagine it really was intended for use as a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Although very affective I really dislike the dryness.</li>
            <li>Thanks skin by pom.</li>
            <li>I also really like the product packaging and customer service of the company.</li>
            <li>This was delivered promptly and has really helped both heal and prevent acne.</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for my skin.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m  familiar with essential oils, DMSO and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>and I use it more like a spot treatment so that my skin won&#x27;t dry out completely.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I would suggest you use this product as a spot treatment and not necessarily as a preventative for acne unless you&#x27;re super acne prone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Previously, I had been using 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide from Acne.org as a spot treatment and had decent results.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my 13YO son who is just starting to have some mild breakouts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is because excessive use of benzyl peroxide, which is a very strong chemical, has been found to induce contact dermatitis according to a study I read after using Proactive, not something I like for my face or anywhere for that matter.</li>
            <li>She normally struggles with acne and I have tried a lot of products to help her minimize breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I was excited as previously, I&#x27;ve tried pure Benzyl Peroxide product before but never one combined with tea tree.</li>
            <li>and I figured I might as well try something new</li>
            <li>Pat face dry being as gentle as possible, allow the rest of the water/moisture to dry out on its own for about 1-2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this product again when I run out, and I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re like me, with sensitive problem skin.</li>
            <li>She has been using this product consistently for the last couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>This product gives me the exact same result for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>so I have to be careful not to use a full pump.</li>
            <li>My skin feel smoother, softer and clear now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been testing mixing aloe vera (Earth&#x27;s Daughter Aloe Vera Gel which can be found on Amazon) with my moisturizer and have found that this really helps with old acne red marks</li>
            <li>Thank you for the promise of clear skin</li>
            <li>I tried just tea tree before as undiluted essential oil but that didn&#x27;t really work out too well for me (too drying).</li>
            <li>I have persistent hormonal adult acne</li>
            <li>Apply Cerave Moisturizing Lotion using only fingertips and gently gliding all over face in circular motions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had adult acne skin most of my 20&#x27;s, in fact as I got older my skin got worse.</li>
            <li>I emailed the company at night complete with pictures of the label and they messaged me back in the morning saying that even though the label is incorrect, the product does contain Tea Tree oil and that they&#x27;re in the process of printing new labels.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle because you only need a little product.</li>
            <li>So, because of the effectiveness of the product, the responsiveness of the company, and the fact that they&#x27;re printing new labels/addressing the issue, I overall decided to give this product a five.</li>
            <li>(have only tested on forehead thus far).</li>
            <li>Though I do not have a problem with wrinkles, I worry that by treating the acne with certain products, not only will my skin become overly dry and irritated, I may cause wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Not only have I noticed less new pimples forming, but the pimples I do get are disappearing at a much faster</li>
            <li>it is gentle enough to help with breakouts without drying out my skin, especially now in winter, I have no skin peeling or my skin feeling dry and unmanageable</li>
            <li>: I go to hot yoga quite often, and I do NOT recommend using this product or the RETIN product when you know you might be heavily sweating -</li>

            <li> : I go to hot yoga quite often, and I do NOT recommend using this product or the RETIN product when you know you might be heavily sweating -</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and it gets worse with hormonal changes but using this prevents any major flare ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product goes on feeling thin, if you are familiar with other Benzoyl Peroxide products then the slight tingling and tight sensation will be familiar.</li>
            <li> My pimples are still elevated slightly but its definitely going down and faster than the 4-8 days it normally takes to reach this same stage.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money in the past with my dermatologist who prescribed me a $285 dollar cream which contained benzoyl and always worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have literally been through every &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; type cleanser &amp; lotion in the drugstore, and have spent lots of money on Kiehls and Origins products - ultimately the price of which was so prohibitive I couldn&#x27;t maintain it.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount goes a long way, but be careful pushing down on the dispenser as it catches at a certain spot and as you&#x27;re trying to push past that spot, the lotion may shoot out, which to me is a bit wasteful.</li>

            <li> I can only surmise that it&#x27;s due to the fact that it contains a 4% benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Aaaaamazing! Had the worst skin problems ever! Out of no where and I&#x27;m 27! Out of desperation I went on a hunt to find anything that would work, when I read the reviews they were great! And to my surprise it actually works! Saw results imediatly and saw amazing results in just 2 weeks! Love!</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this product at a discounted rate for my teenage daughter.  She normally struggles with acne and I have tried a lot of products to help her minimize breakouts.  She has been using this product consistently for the last couple weeks.  I have noticed that she is currently breaking out a lot less.  One of the advantage of this product is my daughter really likes the smell. It is not the typical strong chemical smells of most acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I use this in the mornings after I wash my face and before I moisturize. Works really well without being harsh or drying and has a pleasant smell. I think the bottle dispenses too much at once so I have to be careful not to use a full pump. Overall has helped clear up troubled areas of my face within a day or two when they appear. I also love the packaging!</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money in the past with my dermatologist who prescribed me a $285 dollar cream which contained benzoyl and always worked for me. This product gives me the exact same result for a fraction of the price. I never write Amazon reviews but im so proud of the results for the money I spent that I had to. Try it out people!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my occasional but sometimes deep acne, usually hormonal/stress related or since its the winter, my coat rubbing against my chin. I was excited as previously, I&#x27;ve tried pure Benzyl Peroxide product before but never one combined with tea tree. I tried just tea tree before as undiluted essential oil but that didn&#x27;t really work out too well for me (too drying). So when I got the product, I was disappointed to find that tea tree was not listed at all in any of the labels. I emailed the company at night complete with pictures of the label and they messaged me back in the morning saying that even though the label is incorrect, the product does contain Tea Tree oil and that they&#x27;re in the process of printing new labels. Okay. Just wanted to give you guys a heads up.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the product itself does have a lotion-like; almost watered down consistency so I imagine it really was intended for use as a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;. HOWEVER, I would suggest you use this product as a spot treatment and not necessarily as a preventative for acne unless you&#x27;re super acne prone. This is because excessive use of benzyl peroxide, which is a very strong chemical, has been found to induce contact dermatitis according to a study I read after using Proactive, not something I like for my face or anywhere for that matter. A tiny amount goes a long way, but be careful pushing down on the dispenser as it catches at a certain spot and as you&#x27;re trying to push past that spot, the lotion may shoot out, which to me is a bit wasteful. I&#x27;ve been using this product 2x/day for the last couple days and I do find it quite effective at both reducing the redness and sensitivity within the first 2 days of use. My pimples are still elevated slightly but its definitely going down and faster than the 4-8 days it normally takes to reach this same stage. So, because of the effectiveness of the product, the responsiveness of the company, and the fact that they&#x27;re printing new labels/addressing the issue, I overall decided to give this product a five. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t list the tea tree oil as an ingredient on the actual bottle and the slight kink on the dispense bottle takes away half a star, but unfortunately, Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow me to give 4.5 stars. The pros outweigh the cons so five stars it is. I&#x27;m going to wait a bit longer to see if this product continues to be as effective, if it does, then I think I&#x27;m going to try the mask out next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had adult acne skin most of my 20&#x27;s, in fact as I got older my skin got worse. I&#x27;ve always had a problem not just with large pores and blackheads, but also with more hormonal acne. I&#x27;ve been using this product along with CLNS and RETIN, and the result is unbelievable. I have literally been through every &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; type cleanser &amp; lotion in the drugstore, and have spent lots of money on Kiehls and Origins products - ultimately the price of which was so prohibitive I couldn&#x27;t maintain it. This is the first time in years that I can honestly say I have clear skin. I have a combination of dry and oily skin, so excessive drying will often lead to break outs. I also spend about an hour in a chlorine pool every day, so I needed something that would counteract those chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on feeling thin, if you are familiar with other Benzoyl Peroxide products then the slight tingling and tight sensation will be familiar. What I like about BENZD is I can wear it all day (Pom recommends putting it on in the morning as a preventative treatment) under concealer and make-up and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. My ONLY caution: I go to hot yoga quite often, and I do NOT recommend using this product or the RETIN product when you know you might be heavily sweating - it ended up making my skin red and quite itchy.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within the first use. I use it every other day because it can be harsh to the skin and I use it more like a spot treatment so that my skin won&#x27;t dry out completely. I have mild acne and it gets worse with hormonal changes but using this prevents any major flare ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one complaint I have is that it smells awful! But other than that it does its job well. I would recommend it as a cheaper solution than other acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I will be the first to admit that I have terrible skin. At 33, I have greasy, oily, acne prone skin, and a ton of clogged pores. Though I do not have a problem with wrinkles, I worry that by treating the acne with certain products, not only will my skin become overly dry and irritated, I may cause wrinkles. Adult acne is a serious conundrum sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I read the reviews for BENZD. I will not call this a miracle product, and my skin is by no means perfect, but overnight, some of the nastier problem spots were noticeably smaller, and when I use this regularly, it keeps my skin under control. It is not overly drying, nor is my skin in red patches, flaking and irritated. So, it is good for sensitive, acne prone skin. It also has a pleasant odor, like green tea, and my skin feels wonderfully refreshed after application. Although like all Benzoyl Peroxide treatments, you should keep away from clothes due to bleaching, I haven&#x27;t managed to ruin a single shirt yet, which is a bonus. I will be buying this product again when I run out, and I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re like me, with sensitive problem skin. 5 Stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this this treatment is really great and I wanted to let others know. I have persistent hormonal adult acne and I have had a hard time finding something that treats and prevents acne. This formula works! It&#x27;s Non-drying for my skin too. I really&lt;br /&gt;like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try BENZD because my life long problems with acne and extremely oily skin. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and tried just about everything, including Accutane 3 times. Also I&#x27;m  familiar with essential oils, DMSO and benzoyl peroxide. Combining these 3 is actually a brilliant formula. The DMSO intensifies the tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide to work more effectively inside the skin without drying it out. My skin feel smoother, softer and clear now. I would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> just received it today hope it comes in handy as a spot treatment has benzoyl which I love but the tea tree oil hope it goes well mixed :)</li>
            <li> I feel ambivalent toward this product. It has caused my face to become very dry and flaky. I can only surmise that it&#x27;s due to the fact that it contains a 4% benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient. I have used other products in the past with a 2%, and or less, containment of benzoyl peroxide and have had the same reaction. Although very affective I really dislike the dryness. Other than the aforementioned I really like how smoothly I can apply this to my face. It leaves a non sticky/oily look and feel to it.</li>
            <li> Have to say that the customer service is excellent. I purchased the Benzd but was having issues with it as it was causing slight irritation maybe because I was using another benzoyl peroxide product before starting this one.any ways, I received an email asking about how the product was working and I explained what the issue was I&#x27;m happy to say they sent me the salic and retin formula free of charge and my skin loves these products. I have severe acne especially around my period and now my fave is down to 3 pimples that I know will soon disappear with continuous use. Thanks skin by pom. These products work Magix</li>
            <li> works great for acne and blackheads.  In the beginning,I used it all over my face twice everyday(morning/night) and started peeling in certain areas and my face could feel the sting. Afterwards,I rested a few days, and started using it only in my acne areas, instead of the whole face. Works great, I also tried out there other products, like Retin and CLns. My favorite is Benzd, but the cleanser is great too.  I also really like the product packaging and customer service of the company. He responds really fast, I bought a concealer from them but was the wrong skin color, he immediately refunded me the money without waiting for the product to arrive.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin clear and has a nice smell.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This was delivered promptly and has really helped both heal and prevent acne. My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> This definitely helps tone down my breakouts and acne. it is gentle enough to help with breakouts without drying out my skin, especially now in winter, I have no skin peeling or my skin feeling dry and unmanageable</li>
            <li> I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this product. It&#x27;s potent, effective and smells great. I noticed my acne subside at least 40% within a wk. I used with other no1 by pom products</li>
            <li> Works great on my acne and not too drying</li>
            <li> Works great for calming down inflamed and red areas. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for my skin. I was worried about the 4% benzoyl peroxide, but it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin. I actually originally purchased the Salic product by Pom, but found it wasn&#x27;t the right product for me. I was shocked to receive an email from Pom about a week after my purchase asking how it was going. When I told them it wasn&#x27;t going so well, they suggested the Benzd, and sent it to me to try free of charge. I didn&#x27;t think customer service like that existed anymore. They have made a customer for life out of me!</li>
            <li> Wow, first off let me say that I bought this with my own money and have absolutely no connection to this company or product.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 days and I can truly say that I have noticed a BIG improvement with my acne.  Not only have I noticed less new pimples forming, but the pimples I do get are disappearing at a much faster rate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I had been using 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide from Acne.org as a spot treatment and had decent results.  The main problem with acne.org&#x27;s BP was the fact that it was very, very drying.  Despite using it only as a spot treatment and moisturizing afterwards, it always left my face feeling dry and unhealthy.  I was running out of acne.org BP and I figured I might as well try something new, so I took a chance on BENZD and I am glad I did.  Despite being 4% BP, BENZD (which includes Castor Oil supposed to counter-act dryness) has made my skin feel and look so much better, and its only been 10 days.  I didn&#x27;t switch anything in my lifestyle, diet, or skincare regimen other than switching out acne.org BP for BENZD.  My face no longer feels dry and flaky after showering.  It no longer feels cracky and gross after I apply the BP and wait a few minutes before applying moisturizer.  And most of all, it seems to be MUCH more effective at making any active zits and pimples go away fast.  For the first time in months, I actually feel good about how my face is improving and am actually excited that I can finally be clear within a few months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note, that because my skin is used to BP, I had already gone through the initial &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; phase when my skin was TERRIBLY dry and flaky.  Because I was used to BP, I did not experience this with BENZD, but those who have never used Benzoyl Peroxide before may experience this before seeing improvement.  Additionally, like anything with Benzoyl Peroxide, always wash your hands before and after using as BP is known to bleach towels, shirts, etc.  In summary, if you have had any success with BP, I would HIGHLY recommend this product, as it has been so much better for me than regular BP.  If you&#x27;ve never tried BP before, I would say give this a shot and see if it helps; but if you&#x27;ve used BP before and it never helped you out/made things worse, you may want to avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested, here is my whole regimen (done twice a day, once in the morning and once at night).  Whenever you apply any product to your face, make sure it is done very gently.  Simply glide your hands/fingers across your face and let each product do its thing.  No need to scrub, rub, press hard, or otherwise irritate your skin:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face with Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser (I do this while taking a shower).  Be sure to use ONLY your hands to get a nice foamy lather.  Once you have enough foam from rubbing hands together, glide using your hands/fingers over your face for no more than 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;2. Pat face dry being as gentle as possible, allow the rest of the water/moisture to dry out on its own for about 1-2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply BENZD to any acne spots on face, again being very gentle and gliding your fingers over any areas.  Allow BENZD to dry and set into skin for 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply Cerave Moisturizing Lotion using only fingertips and gently gliding all over face in circular motions.  I&#x27;ve also been testing mixing aloe vera (Earth&#x27;s Daughter Aloe Vera Gel which can be found on Amazon) with my moisturizer and have found that this really helps with old acne red marks (have only tested on forehead thus far).</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works on my aging skin against acne and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema. The packaging was great too - all recyclable paper and thoughtfully packed. The creator has assured me that this is NOT tested on animals either. It is my go-to product now.</li>
            <li> This cream is potent. It&#x27;s effective at clearing and drying out pimples. However, it will also dry out your skin dramatically. I&#x27;d recommend this only if you are knowledgable about properly taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 13YO son who is just starting to have some mild breakouts. I wanted something mild for his young skin and I feel like this was a good option.</li>
            <li> Ok this is amazing stuff. I have to always have this in my beauty arsenal.I have hormonal acne uughh. Oily skin as well. I have used this twice at night and omg it is all it says it will be and more. I had a few little breakouts and over night they were cleared. This is a huge bottle because you only need a little product. I have never had anything work this well on my skin. Thank you Bendz for this awesome stuff :-) thank you Amazon for carrying this. Bendz I am a customer for life. Thank you for the promise of clear skin and I actually received the promise. I am so happy that I found this. When anyone asks what I am using I will tell them about this life changing product :-)</li>
            <li> Omg. My face was jacked before using this. Although I don&#x27;t use it daily since its a bit drying, I do use it often enough to keep big pimples at bay.</li>
