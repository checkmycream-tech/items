            <li>I seem to find the happiness</li>
            <li>a good brand, but wasn&#x27;t going to cost me a fortune like some pricier razors out in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lovely piece of machinery too.  </li>

            <li>Second shave, perfect.  </li>
            <li>I was faced with too many choices and recommendations.</li>
            <li>The video reviews were my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this slippery at all, in fact the matte finish makes for a better grip.</li>
            <li>What outstanding craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After shaving with this razor, I was pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with a DE razor for about two years now and this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that i can adjust the aggressiveness.</li>
            <li>Did some research, and was thinking about upgrading to a more aggressive one,</li>
            <li>Icut myself more with the EJ because I was a rookie, but it helped find my technique and angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>else DE may become something they do not find enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest and fair, I also got my Merkur blades and from The Art of Shaving the whole shaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality is superb as expected from Solingen.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend they do not go beyond a (3) setting until they are absolutely sure they are comfortable with their technique, or</li>
            <li>] gives me no nicks (so far) and a very nice</li>
            <li>It takes practice to not cut yourself and once you know how to handle it becomes easy.</li>
            <li>and I have strong man hands.</li>
            <li>While I own one myself one of my friends got interested in the Merkur.</li>
            <li>The price on this is a bit higher than some of the entry level DE razors, but I liked that it was adjustable,</li>
            <li>Also, the adjustable head is very easy to use which will reduces the irritation on your face once you find the right settings for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic razor.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dislike the way it feels in my hand, and the results are fantastic with almost every brand of blades I&#x27;ve tried with it.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I used a run-of-the-mill safety razor with a butterfly opening and anything available blades.</li>
            <li>No scraping sound.</li>
            <li>It was smooth.</li>
            <li>No scraping sound.</li>
            <li>It was smooth.</li>
            <li>The craftsmanship and balance are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>What good old days?</li>
            <li>since I was pretty comfortable with the EJ, wanted something that got me a closer shave, and wasn&#x27;t sure if upgrading was for me.  </li>
            <li>I typically shave my neck with a 2 and everywhere else with a 3.5, it is great how with this razor I am able to do that.</li>
            <li>My first mistake was holding the top of the razor as I adjusted the angle of attack.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Merkur razor and without a doubt the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Had my reservations about going single blade, but it works great.</li>
            <li>most certainly do!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh and use a good shaving soap too, it makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>Who cared about the fixed income now it was what kind of shiny toy could I afford?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Settle</li>
            <li>Now that I am getting the technique down, this shave is even more remarkable then the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely heavy, it feels great in your hand, and the adjustable head is extremely smooth....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bulkier than my favorite DE Razors, but still very easy to shave with and seems to be extremely forgiving to my face even when I got too aggressive with the settings.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I hesitated for a long time because of the price but am very glad I bought the Futur.  </li>
            <li>It feels big, but comfortable, and can be adjusted to get a great shave with a lot of different blades by adjusting the razor, not so much my technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very intimidating at first, lots of nicks and some pretty good actual cuts around my throat.  </li>
            <li>This double edge razor is very sharp, and when used correctly, will deliver the best shave you ever had.</li>
            <li>I reach back to the good old days.</li>
            <li>The blade just comes off, a fresh one is put in, and the top popped back in.  </li>
            <li>my amazement the stubble gave way on the first stroke.</li>
            <li>my amazement the stubble gave way on the first stroke.</li>
            <li>My standard now is 1.5-2 depending on how many shaves the blade have on it.</li>
            <li>It is the first safety razor I have owned.</li>
            <li>However, I am a first time user of a DE razor.</li>
            <li>My first safety blade razor.</li>
            <li>sturdiness and heaviness helps with the shave, because of the ability to expose the blade at the higher settings, you don&#x27;t need any pressure, just the pressure of the razors wait against your skin.  </li>
            <li>I cut myself with the EJ when first learning how to use it as well.  </li>
            <li>Like every other american, I was sucked in to the more blades is better</li>
            <li>I love the smoothness on my face after every single shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but now, I love every single time that I use this</li>
            <li>head is large, and,</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a razor that would enable me to give the middle finger to Gilette, save some money and not have to buy their latest overpriced razor everytime they release a new one.</li>
            <li>I personally suggest using this with shave soap and a badger brush for the ultimate shave, and some brave soldier code blue for after shave.</li>
            <li>It fits in my hand very well and feels well balanced.</li>
            <li>, I find this one much easier to replace.  </li>
            <li>I can do it much faster one handed by pricing with my thumb against the side and popping off the cap.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a sandwich design, so the top of the head just pops off like a pen cap, and the spring mechanism that holds it in place seems like it could wear out in due time, so</li>
            <li>Double Edge Safety Razor #700.&amp;quot; I gave up the familiar butterfly opening and opted for a closeness dial.</li>
            <li>As a side note, this thing is brass, and if you drop it you&#x27;ll see exactly how soft brass is.    </li>
            <li>This was my first attempt at switching over to the old school razor I saw my dad using when I was growing up.  </li>
            <li>that I broke my previous razor, which was a three-piece screw top, replacing the blade</li>
            <li>Highly recommend pairing it with feather blades.</li>
            <li>, I approached with a little more caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Has it helped me through midlife crisis by giving my morning routine a little more purpose when otherwise life feels like</li>
            <li>I did not think the handle was any longer than normal.</li>
            <li>It will take a week or two to get used to, and you will get some nicks when starting, but its worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you could improvise something to keep a firm grip, but Merkur should have offered a serrated handle on it as with the HD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the new disposables came out decades ago I moved to them.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re a new DE shaver, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>I also own a Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor (#34C) (Merkur HD).</li>
            <li>It was heart breaking to see that after several emails to &amp;#34;deals for salons&amp;#34; i was completely ignored until I was told they would make it right.</li>
            <li>One thing I question would be the longevity of the top piece of the razor for the mechanism in which you pull off and press on (two small metal bars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a strong and heavy feel, which I</li>
            <li>I leave the Futur down near its mildest blade exposure setting with the Feathers, where I never feel the blade, and it cuts smooth and close without any hint of tugging or razor burn.</li>
            <li>A fixed income</li>
            <li>Four Band-Aids for my thumb and two days later I was ready to try again.</li>
            <li>Theres alot of info on the net about this razor; its very well reviewed.</li>
            <li>sure you get all the shaving kit from The Art of Shaving (or at least the pre-shave oil and the soap)</li>
            <li>Also, purchasing blades are far cheaper now, which means I&#x27;ve been saving money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone as far as 3.5 and had some nicks.</li>
            <li>I have been using the old cartridge razors (3-blades) with shaving soap for decades.</li>
            <li>Make sure to toss the blade that comes in the box, and buy a few extra packs of blades.</li>
            <li>other thing worth noting is that the blade does not always line up with the guard (safety bars).</li>
            <li>I really like the adjustable head that allows me to get a very close shave on my face, and a slightly less close shave on my neck with</li>
            <li>My only criticism of this razor is that it is very smooth and if you need to adjust the blade height with wet hands....be very careful.</li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re out together dancing cheek to cheek.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Music and words by Irving Berlined up (bar soap) and with blade in hand and septic stick in the other, I approached with a little more caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this must be inherent of adjustable razors in general?</li>
            <li>All in all, I went back to my old Merkur-</li>
            <li>No cheep Chinese knock off of the old quickie safety razor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of the large size and weight, the razor can be tricky to manuever around tight spots near the lips, nose and ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If they have not and find this razor to be four to five stars, then they would probably really like some of their other models/designs.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin, I highly recommend using a less aggressive DE razor and learn the proper techniques of shaving with a DE razor to minimize skin irritation/nicks.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t think you can wait a few months, up to a year, before going to the higher levels</li>
            <li>Also, it has a big head, and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to get under your nose; I read this before ordering the product thinking that perhaps the other reviewers were incompetent, however I misjudged, because it simply misses a good 1/4\\&quot; under your nose due to the size (though this gets smaller the more aggressive the setting).  </li>

            <li> I hesitated for a long time because of the price but am very glad I bought the Futur.  Best shave I have ever had!  It&#x27;s a very lovely piece of machinery too.  I now shave with the ultra-sharp Feather blades, which were dangerously eager to cut skin with any moderately aggressive razor.  I leave the Futur down near its mildest blade exposure setting with the Feathers, where I never feel the blade, and it cuts smooth and close without any hint of tugging or razor burn. I am even a little careless with razor pressure and still never get nicked.  Oh and use a good shaving soap too, it makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> This was intended to replace my open-comb merkur.  It lived up to the quality standards that I was accustomed to- it&#x27;s extremely heavy, it feels great in your hand, and the adjustable head is extremely smooth.... like a high-end automobile.  However, it&#x27;s a sandwich design, so the top of the head just pops off like a pen cap, and the spring mechanism that holds it in place seems like it could wear out in due time, so no passing it down to the next generation I don&#x27;t think.  Also, it has a big head, and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to get under your nose; I read this before ordering the product thinking that perhaps the other reviewers were incompetent, however I misjudged, because it simply misses a good 1/4\\&quot; under your nose due to the size (though this gets smaller the more aggressive the setting).  As a side note, this thing is brass, and if you drop it you&#x27;ll see exactly how soft brass is.    All in all, I went back to my old Merkur- it was much easier to handle and gets every place you need it to, but I can&#x27;t say anything else bad about the futur.</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustable head that allows me to get a very close shave on my face, and a slightly less close shave on my neck with no razor burn. This razor is quite heavy which I like. For me, using [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] gives me no nicks (so far) and a very nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not dropped this razor (yet) but it does get slippery in the shower. Does anyone know of a way to apply a rubber grip to the handle?</li>
            <li> Great shave, great value.</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor.  I love this razor.  On setting #1 , a tiny nick on the jawbone.  Second shave, perfect.  Beautiful design still on #1 setting.  As advertised.  Watch the video at, Geofatboy shave nation.com</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave. Highly recommend pairing it with feather blades. Had my reservations about going single blade, but it works great.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this less than 5 stars is the size of the razor vs. what I&#x27;m used to.  It feels big, but comfortable, and can be adjusted to get a great shave with a lot of different blades by adjusting the razor, not so much my technique.&lt;br /&gt;The head is large, and, like others have noted, makes it a little harder do detail work,&lt;br /&gt;I probably should give this 5 stars rather than 4.  I don&#x27;t dislike the way it feels in my hand, and the results are fantastic with almost every brand of blades I&#x27;ve tried with it.  It&#x27;s bulkier than my favorite DE Razors, but still very easy to shave with and seems to be extremely forgiving to my face even when I got too aggressive with the settings.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if this becomes my every day razor down the road.</li>
            <li> While I own one myself one of my friends got interested in the Merkur. I gave her one as a gift and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;My father used a similar product all his life. It was not as perfected 80 years ago as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend this product for it&#x27;s versatility and eco friendliness (less waste). The blades are amazing!</li>
            <li> Years ago I used a run-of-the-mill safety razor with a butterfly opening and anything available blades. Never had complaints and was not aware or cared about options. When the new disposables came out decades ago I moved to them. Then the blade count kept creeping up. Looks like I was well on the way to a 10 blade electronically shakable disposable head that played &amp;quot;God Save the Queen&amp;quot; while reaching into each pour for the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it happened. A fixed income and I had to reevaluate my choices. I reach back to the good old days. But wait there are now choices that I never had. What good old days? No cheep Chinese knock off of the old quickie safety razor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was I to do? I was faced with too many choices and recommendations. The video reviews were my favorite. I wanted everything; my eyes grew wide and gluttonous. Who cared about the fixed income now it was what kind of shiny toy could I afford?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Settle down and take a deep breath. Once again go at this practically. Weight, grip, angle, durability, etc. from all the choices the best balance turned out to be &amp;quot;Merkur Futur Double Edge Safety Razor #700.&amp;quot; I gave up the familiar butterfly opening and opted for a closeness dial. I will have to learn to put the blade in differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor came in an air-bubble mailer. The razor being heavy worked its way out of the flimsy construction-board package and was loose in the mailer. It was heavy like promised. I did not think the handle was any longer than normal. I pushed off the blade holder with one thumb before reading the included instructions. Inserted the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With blade in place I swung it around and challenged my beard in the mirror &amp;quot;On Guard!&amp;quot; It winched. My first mistake was holding the top of the razor as I adjusted the angle of attack. My thumb slipped and I only lost a pint of blood. Four Band-Aids for my thumb and two days later I was ready to try again. I lathered up (bar soap) and with blade in hand and septic stick in the other, I approached with a little more caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my amazement the stubble gave way on the first stroke. No pressure. No scraping sound. My face was still there. It was smooth. What happed to all the stories about having to get used to it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All those wasted decades. If I had only known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Heaven... I&#x27;m in heaven,&lt;br /&gt;And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak.&lt;br /&gt;And I seem to find the happiness I seek,&lt;br /&gt;When we&#x27;re out together dancing cheek to cheek.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Music and words by Irving Berlined up (bar soap) and with blade in hand and septic stick in the other, I approached with a little more caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my amazement the stubble gave way on the first stroke.

            <li> I wanted to find a razor that would enable me to give the middle finger to Gilette, save some money and not have to buy their latest overpriced razor everytime they release a new one. I tried and tried, but there&#x27;s no way my skin can take this type of single blade razor. My only criticism of this razor is that it is very smooth and if you need to adjust the blade height with wet hands....be very careful. I suggest you get a Merkur with a knurled handle.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor that has ever touched my face. Like every other american, I was sucked in to the more blades is better bs that schick and gillete sell. But, my face still got chopped and burned.  Do you know how many blades you need for the best shave? Its definitely not 3 or 4. This double edge razor is very sharp, and when used correctly, will deliver the best shave you ever had. It has a nice weight to it; its not made of plastic. You have to control the shave, and angle it properly. You can change the angle of the blade too with the adjuster on the handle. It will take a week or two to get used to, and you will get some nicks when starting, but its worth it. You will end up having the best shaves ever. If you plan to get this, toss out the edge gel too, and buy some serious shave cream or shave soap. I personally suggest using this with shave soap and a badger brush for the ultimate shave, and some brave soldier code blue for after shave. Make sure to toss the blade that comes in the box, and buy a few extra packs of blades. If you are not sure if this is for you, dont second guess. Theres alot of info on the net about this razor; its very well reviewed. After using it, you will convince your friends to buy one.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from shick X3 and gillette Mach 4 to this and Oh Boy... I love the smoothness on my face after every single shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest and fair, I also got my Merkur blades and from The Art of Shaving the whole shaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been any happier after a shave to the point that I wanted to shave my face every single day, hahahahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has the perfect weight for your shave. Also, the adjustable head is very easy to use which will reduces the irritation on your face once you find the right settings for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me couple of tries to get he heck of it but now, I love every single time that I use this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a closer shave, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Make sure you get all the shaving kit from The Art of Shaving (or at least the pre-shave oil and the soap), it makes a difference, but buy it from amazon because instore is  expensive.)</li>
            <li> It was heart breaking to see that after several emails to &amp;#34;deals for salons&amp;#34; i was completely ignored until I was told they would make it right. 15 days later Im still awaiting new tracking # as my old one shows as returned to sender due to misplaced label.... I hope they will eventually understand what they put me through as a consumer</li>
            <li> Use it all the time to shave my head. It takes practice to not cut yourself and once you know how to handle it becomes easy. Also, purchasing blades are far cheaper now, which means I&#x27;ve been saving money. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Clean shave, perfect size handle and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The adjustable head allows you to increase the gap between the blade and the front of the razor. I&#x27;ve gone as far as 3.5 and had some nicks. My standard now is 1.5-2 depending on how many shaves the blade have on it. Quality is superb as expected from Solingen. I don&#x27;t find this slippery at all, in fact the matte finish makes for a better grip.</li>
            <li> Not much else I can say other than the Merkur is an investment in shaving.  I will never go back to anything I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Merkur razor and without a doubt the best so far.  The craftsmanship and balance are fantastic.  I was concerned as well that the unit might end up being slippery in the shower, but that turned out to be a non-issue.  Great shave!</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at switching over to the old school razor I saw my dad using when I was growing up.  After careful reading of reviews and considering the cost I chose the merkur.  The weight is a little on the heavy side at first compared to the Gillette fusion that I used.  It takes some getting used to and I am almost there. I have used it for the last 2 weeks. Very intimidating at first, lots of nicks and some pretty good actual cuts around my throat.  Even some razor burn.  Lets just say its not the product, it&#x27;s the technique.  Now that I am getting the technique down, this shave is even more remarkable then the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering if this is for you,  It is!  Get it now!</li>
            <li> What outstanding craftsmanship.  The shave with the razor is awesome the closest shave yet...by far.&lt;br /&gt;Very adjustable.  I&#x27;d recommend starting out at a mid-range adjustment and then go from there.</li>
            <li> It is quite slippery and I have strong man hands. It is the first safety razor I have owned. Single blades definitely keep the razor burn to a minimum on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Does it give a closer shave than my Mach 5?&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure that it does.&lt;br /&gt;Do I like the fact that blades are around $.10 per blade?&lt;br /&gt;I most certainly do!&lt;br /&gt;Has it helped me through midlife crisis by giving my morning routine a little more purpose when otherwise life feels like Ground Hog Day?&lt;br /&gt;You bet it does!&lt;br /&gt;I would look for one with a knurled grip for the next one I get.</li>
            <li> I also own a Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor (#34C) (Merkur HD). I prefer the build and size of my Merkur HD and think it will outlast the Futur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a slick and un-serrated handle. I&#x27;m sure you could improvise something to keep a firm grip, but Merkur should have offered a serrated handle on it as with the HD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Futur razor looks like a quality built razor with a solid heft and feel to it. One thing I question would be the longevity of the top piece of the razor for the mechanism in which you pull off and press on (two small metal bars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head on this razor is approximately twice the depth and a little wider than my Merkur HD. After using my Merkur HD, the Merkur Futur razor feels over-sized and clunky (both the handle and head). I&#x27;m assuming this must be inherent of adjustable razors in general? Because of the large size and weight, the razor can be tricky to manuever around tight spots near the lips, nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I question whether or not everyone else who has reviewed this item have tried other razors from Merkur. If they have not and find this razor to be four to five stars, then they would probably really like some of their other models/designs. If I hadn&#x27;t had any experience with any other of Merkur&#x27;s razors, I would probably give this one five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving with this razor, I was pleased with its performance. While still heavy and a little difficult to maneuver, it performed well overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing worth noting is that the blade does not always line up with the guard (safety bars). The alignment isn&#x27;t terribly off enough to cause trouble while shaving, but it is visually noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this. I was slicing my face to ribbons with my other safety razor. This allows me to change settings as the heaviness of my beard changes.</li>
            <li> The build quality of this razor is second to none. It is beautifully crafted. It fits in my hand very well and feels well balanced. However, I am a first time user of a DE razor. I have to say that this razor is extremely aggressive in shaving even at its lowest setting. What does this mean? It means that it will remove a lot of skin and whiskers. If you have very sensitive skin, I highly recommend using a less aggressive DE razor and learn the proper techniques of shaving with a DE razor to minimize skin irritation/nicks. I shave in the shower because it gives me the best (closest) shave with the most minimum of skin irritation. I have been using the old cartridge razors (3-blades) with shaving soap for decades. I am thinking my learning curve on DE razor is going to take time. The only reason I&#x27;m only giving it 4 vs. 5-stars is that it is too aggressive for first-time shavers with a DE. Just MHO.</li>
            <li> My first safety blade razor. Works great while I am learning how to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a DE razor for about two years now and this is my favorite razor. I love the fact that i can adjust the aggressiveness. I typically shave my neck with a 2 and everywhere else with a 3.5, it is great how with this razor I am able to do that. The only con is the hand is slippery when wet. It would have been great if they added some kind of indents to give a better grip.</li>
            <li> very good quality and weight balance.....of course, I would expect nothing else from Merkur</li>
            <li> I am about a  year into DE shaving and started off with the Edwin Jagger (EJ) DE89BL.  About two months ago, that razor slipped from my hand while changing the blade, and it broke upon hitting my bathroom floor.  Did some research, and was thinking about upgrading to a more aggressive one, since I was pretty comfortable with the EJ, wanted something that got me a closer shave, and wasn&#x27;t sure if upgrading was for me.  The price on this is a bit higher than some of the entry level DE razors, but I liked that it was adjustable, a good brand, but wasn&#x27;t going to cost me a fortune like some pricier razors out in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that I broke my previous razor, which was a three-piece screw top, replacing the blade, I find this one much easier to replace.  I can do it much faster one handed by pricing with my thumb against the side and popping off the cap.  The blade just comes off, a fresh one is put in, and the top popped back in.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that I recommend doing it when it&#x27;s wet, but I have done it, and it&#x27;s no where near as scary as it was with my EJ, or as others have mentioned on here, In my opinion.  It has a strong and heavy feel, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sturdiness and heaviness helps with the shave, because of the ability to expose the blade at the higher settings, you don&#x27;t need any pressure, just the pressure of the razors wait against your skin.  This razor gives me a much closer shave, with less passes, including in trouble areas.  In order to avoid irritation and cutting, I start off with the highest (6) setting on the blade and do downward strokes.  Then I do a  (4) against the grain in my neck area and from ear to nose, and finally do a  (4) again against the grain in my neck area and a (2) against the grain on my cheeks/chin/nose.  I have cut myself with this razor, but it was only while getting used it after a few tries.  Keep in mind I cut myself with the EJ when first learning how to use it as well.  Come to think of it, Icut myself more with the EJ because I was a rookie, but it helped find my technique and angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a beginner were to start using this, I would recommend they do not go beyond a (3) setting until they are absolutely sure they are comfortable with their technique, or else DE may become something they do not find enjoyable.  If you don&#x27;t think you can wait a few months, up to a year, before going to the higher levels and you&#x27;re a new DE shaver, this may not be for you.</li>
