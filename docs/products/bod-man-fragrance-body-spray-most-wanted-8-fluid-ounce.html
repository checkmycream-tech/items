            <li> This is a very nice daily use fragrance for men.  Gentle --But, you know it is there -- and, the ladies do as well.  No matter what -- no lady likes a stinky guy!!!  The Amazon price is great for this item!!!</li>
            <li> I get compliments about this body spray</li>
            <li> I have gotten non-stop compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance ever! if you like to smell it on you hours after you put it on, BOD is it. it lasts very long and Don&#x27;t meed much.</li>
            <li> awesome!  This product was for my 16 year old son and he is very happy with it. Excellent quality.  Nice price</li>
            <li> My parents bought the little sampler box, it had blue musk, ripped abs, black, and most wanted. I thought the blue musk was nice smelling but too strong. Ripped abs smelt good but didnt last more than 10 seconds, black was just an average smell, not awful not bad. But most wanted by far in my opinion was the best. It was the only smell that received compliments, so i decided to buy a big bottle. I was disappointed when i got it. For starters it didnt look like the picture, and for some reason it smelt different to me. So for my rating.... it was ok</li>
            <li> Great spray smells exactly like Ambercrombie &amp; Fitch Fierce,lasts very long and always get asked what it is..highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Okay. Why are you here?&lt;br /&gt;Let me guess. Either bodybuilding.com forum brought you here, or other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I will give it to you straight.&lt;br /&gt;I have Black (My second favorite), Blue Musk (Third favorite), Really Ripped Abs (Fourth Favorite), and Midnight Reign (Very horrible, do not buy under any circumstances unless, you are into that musty wood smell, but it has no longevity)&lt;br /&gt;Most wanted has gotten me the most compliments by far, and happens to by my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;It last wayyyyy longer than Black, and smells a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to buy just one, you may have seen all the other comments on the other Bods, &amp;#34;this is the best&amp;#34; well that is most likely personal preference.
