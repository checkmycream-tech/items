            <li>The placement and quantity of the inner pockets are perfectly placed to balance the contents.  </li>

            <li>It fits in every medium to oversize purse I have and makes it so easy to switch purses.</li>
            <li>it keeps things organized and easy to find.</li>
            <li>This fits perfectly in the lower part of my huge hobo bag, and keeps it from being a jumbled mess with everything at the bottom where I can&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>My son gave me a huge purse which is like a bottomless pit - I felt like Mary Poppins digging for a lamp in this bag).  </li>
            <li>It helps to keep my bag filled out, so that it never looks slouchy or caved it.  </li>
            <li>I can still fit it all in.</li>
            <li>I found this one and was excited that it matched the purse I reciently bought.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and fit all my purses well.</li>

            <li>I need quick access to conveniently stored.  </li>
            <li>To make sure i didn&#x27;t lose my new phone, i got this.</li>
            <li>The built in outer zippers, which expands the width of the organizer, are so well placed and of such great quality making the size adjustments completely effortless.</li>
            <li>Love the way everything is available right in the center of my bag.</li>
            <li>Width is perfect for medium longchamp le pliage but the length is a little short for the purse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great size if you carry a small handgun - easy to reach straight in and put your hand directly on your weapon.</li>
            <li>I had one many years ago, and just recently decided that I would like to try one again.</li>
            <li>The pictures, truly, are an exact representation of the product.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!  </li>
            <li>While I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the design of this organizer, it&#x27;s turned out to be pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>It can easily be used independently as a clutch.  </li>
            <li>Wife loves it, practical and makes using various purses easy plus keeps everything organized</li>
            <li>Swapped in out a few times, that&#x27;s pretty handy.  </li>
            <li>I carry medium to large handbags.</li>
            <li>The zebra print is cute and the fabric wiped clean easily when I spilled a little vodka into my purse (long story).</li>
            <li>this tote has really been helpful in some of my bags that i need some pockets</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>When I completely lost my phone recently, I was sure it just fell in the bottomless pit of disorganization that is my purse, never to be found again.</li>
            <li>Make sure you measure the bottom of your purses as this is a larger insert and won&#x27;t fit in a small purse.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s time to change bags, it lifts out by little straps on the sides and drops straight into the next bag - easy peasy!</li>
            <li>It is versatile enough to go from my medium size bags to my large totes.</li>
            <li>The Britney Organizer fixed it so I can look in or reach in and find what I want.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to save on marks inside of a new handbag, or just to keep your handbag looking new inside, I would recommend a handbag organizer such as this.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Britney Bone Zebra and Black &amp; Grey Handbag Purse Tote Travel Cosmetic Make-Up Bag Organizer after looking at many similar items.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not flimsy but the fabric left much to be wanted.</li>
            <li>The pockets inside tore quickly and the adjustment buttons broke and fell off in a few days use.</li>

            <li> This is my first purse organizer and it&#x27;s been a great experience. It is versatile enough to go from my medium size bags to my large totes. It has 6 inner pockets and two outer pockets as well as one long zip pocket. I love it that all of my items are organized and easily accessible now. No more digging through the stuff in the bottom of my purse to find my lip gloss, or comb, or gum. This is the perfect size and it looks cute in my bag as well. It helps to keep my bag filled out, so that it never looks slouchy or caved it.  Great combination of form and function.</li>
            <li> this tote has really been helpful in some of my bags that i need some pockets</li>
            <li> I like the organizer okay. It&#x27;s a little heavy in weight and  was too stiff.  I would have preferred a compartment for pencils and an  outside zipper.  I do like the fact that I can make it larger when needed.</li>
            <li> I use this all of the time for my daytime bags.  I no longer have to search for my phone, my wallet, my keys, etc.  I used to have to dump everything to find something small like a pen.  Now I save a lot of time (and mess) not searching.</li>
            <li> This was better than I thought it would be. You can literally lift it out to change purses! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v used handbag organizers for many years. I found this one and was excited that it matched the purse I reciently bought. It works perfect. I would suggest to pay attention to the size of your handbag (length x width x depth) and purchase an organizer accordingly. If you are looking to save on marks inside of a new handbag, or just to keep your handbag looking new inside, I would recommend a handbag organizer such as this.</li>
            <li> the quality of the product is great.  It has served its purpose well and I am glad I bought it  Improvements I would make is a couple of pen holdersand a couple of smaller pockets..  Some small studff fall out.  but I am still satisfied and overall impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this organizer insert for a leather tote bag I have that has only a few small pockets and left all of my stuff sort of swimming around inside.  This organizer insert does a great job, fits all my stuff and keeps it upright so I can find everything easily. It appears to be made well and is big enough to hold a lot of items i.e. glass case, pens, small cosmetic bag, iPod, checkbook, pocket calendar, kleenex, hand lotion etc etc.  I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hated digging around the bottom of my giant purse for my phone. When I completely lost my phone recently, I was sure it just fell in the bottomless pit of disorganization that is my purse, never to be found again. To make sure i didn&#x27;t lose my new phone, i got this. Love the way everything is available right in the center of my bag. I also like the way it gives shape to the bag it&#x27;s in - makes the purse look better. Swapped in out a few times, that&#x27;s pretty handy.  There seems to be a lot of these inserts to choose from, but I&#x27;m very happy with my selection. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> While I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the design of this organizer, it&#x27;s turned out to be pretty awesome. It fits in every medium to oversize purse I have and makes it so easy to switch purses. Things can still get messy in it but that&#x27;s my fault.</li>
            <li> I had one many years ago, and just recently decided that I would like to try one again. The size is great. I carry medium to large handbags. So many pockets!  I will say that I just ordered the black one with the cheetah print lining for a friend but having to return it because the interior zipper is broken. Hope that the next one I get will be as good as the one I have.</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly in the lower part of my huge hobo bag, and keeps it from being a jumbled mess with everything at the bottom where I can&#x27;t find it. Nice quality, too.</li>
            <li> Great item. Material appears to be a little thin.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for work. Width is perfect for medium longchamp le pliage but the length is a little short for the purse. Zippered pocket is not built for bulky stuff. Otherwise, fairly satisfied with this product. Been using it since i got it in the mail!</li>
            <li> Love my travel tote ! I use it in my fabric purse.....it keeps things organized and easy to find. My pocketbook before was a bottomless pit.  It seemed I could never find what I was looking for when I needed it!&lt;br /&gt;TY for the  prompt delivery !</li>
            <li> great invention for organizing.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and fit all my purses well. The adjustability of this was not what I imagined it would be. Definitely not flimsy but the fabric left much to be wanted. Its the kind of fabric you might find on one of the reusable dollar tote bags at a grocery store, plastic and very easily torn. The pockets inside tore quickly and the adjustment buttons broke and fell off in a few days use. The zipper began to tear as well. I used it for about a month and now its holding makeup under my sink just like a basket. Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t review what you never had to review. Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah Blah, Blah Blah. Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It helps organize the items in my bag, with TONS of little pockets and pouches. When it&#x27;s time to change bags, it lifts out by little straps on the sides and drops straight into the next bag - easy peasy! The zebra print is cute and the fabric wiped clean easily when I spilled a little vodka into my purse (long story). It actually expands so if I have a lot of stuff (moms, that&#x27;s you) I can still fit it all in. It&#x27;s also a great size if you carry a small handgun - easy to reach straight in and put your hand directly on your weapon. The price is low enough you could buy several different colors, if you care that your insert matches your bag, or if you have several different sets of stuff to carry at different times, such as if you have a set of stuff for business meetings or for your travel carry-on. Love it!</li>
            <li> This tote arrived so quick I was pleasantly surprise. It fits great in more than one of my bags. I Love the color and quality. I do recommend getting this tote.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this purse insert.  It holds everything I need to carry with me.  I don&#x27;t even need to use my purses&#x27; pockets anymore.  And it transfers from purse to purse in just a couple of seconds.  And I don&#x27;t have to dig through pockets to make sure I haven&#x27;t forgotten something.  Make sure you measure the bottom of your purses as this is a larger insert and won&#x27;t fit in a small purse.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Britney Bone Zebra and Black &amp; Grey Handbag Purse Tote Travel Cosmetic Make-Up Bag Organizer after looking at many similar items.  The pictures, truly, are an exact representation of the product.  This is a well made/designed good quality and beautiful bag.  It can easily be used independently as a clutch.  The placement and quantity of the inner pockets are perfectly placed to balance the contents.  I someone had asked me what I am looking for in this type of product I would say this bag hit all the key points.&lt;br /&gt;This organizer is chucked full of pleasant surprises too.  The built in outer zippers, which expands the width of the organizer, are so well placed and of such great quality making the size adjustments completely effortless. The inner zipper is perfect for keeping the documents I carry around away from the contents of the bag.  The two outer pockets keep my business cards and whatever else I need quick access to conveniently stored.  I plan to order more as gifts for those special ladies in my circle.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for creating a beautiful quality product which does not break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;Carol.</li>
            <li> My son gave me a huge purse which is like a bottomless pit - I felt like Mary Poppins digging for a lamp in this bag).  The Britney Organizer fixed it so I can look in or reach in and find what I want.  It&#x27;s great!  And it arrived sooner than expected.  THANKS!  (p.s. I&#x27;m from San Diego, not Australia---don&#x27;t know where that came from.)</li>
