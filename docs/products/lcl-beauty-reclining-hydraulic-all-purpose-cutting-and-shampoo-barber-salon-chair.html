            <li> Very happy with this chair! I had the pump on incorrectly and had emailed the company for a new pump, because I thought it was just defective but I had installed it backwards. They replied to my email after just 10 minutes and gave me instructions to install the foot pump correctly! I&#x27;m very pleased with my chair and their customer service! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this chair for my wife. And she has liked it a lot.  It is very practical and functional.  It is a bit heavy though, so don&#x27;t plan to move around much.  But at least I know it is not made of cheap material.</li>
            <li> Chair back keeps falling back.  Doesn&#x27;t stay in upright position.  And chair doesn&#x27;t go up that high. Fast delivery though.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and the chairs are nice! However, all 3 that I bought now have issues with them!</li>
            <li> The chair is very nice.. Very wide and nice to look at... But, it came with a rip in the seat the back wont stay up and the cover didnt fit... I contacted the company and got immediate response.. They are more than willing to fix the problems and shipped me new parts the same day.. When i get them if everything works i would rate this chair 5 stars</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn very easy that&#x27;s the only thing I have to say</li>
            <li> It works great for what I needed it for. Was easy to put together and it worked!</li>
            <li> loved it ... great chair</li>
            <li> Every part of this brand new chair was damaged. The quality is very poor and I would not ever purchase anything from this company again.</li>
            <li> Great reclining chair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about the chair then when we got it and put it together the back wont stay up, my clients can&#x27;t even lean back without it starting to recline back. It&#x27;s upsetting!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> fabulous chair it is two chairs in one. thank you so much this is a wonderful product, i have no problems  with it</li>
            <li> The Chair my be fine, but the Cape isn&#x27;t. I bought this cape from Ebay and when I tried it on to see how water resistant it was, drops of water would fall through. Would not recommend this cape.</li>
            <li> Very good quality chair. I was surprised because of price. Easy to put togather and set up.</li>
            <li> I love this chair, very comfortable!!!</li>
            <li> The thing we&#x27;re suppose to push down with our foot to get the chair higher up was made wrong&lt;br /&gt;On my chair in order to get the chair higher I have to pull it up and that kinda sucks because instead of pushing it down with my foot(how it suppose to be done) I have to pull it up with my hands :(&lt;br /&gt;Also my order didn&#x27;t come with the booster..but I don&#x27;t mind that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the chair is good..it leans back perfectly fine as well</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable and the price was very reasonable vs what you can get at a beauty supply store ... recommend this chair!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved her chair; back doesn&#x27;t go all the way back for shampooing but very easy to put together.</li>
            <li> I really love my new chair its heavy and durable, I was a little scared about assembly but after I started putting it together it went together perfect and it was pretty easy its not wobbely or rickedy at all and the hydrologics work perfect I would definitely recommend this also the price is great</li>
            <li> THE CHAIR LOOKS GREAT &amp; WAS EASY TO ASSEMBLE. HOWEVER, I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS ABOUT A MONTH, I AM STARTING TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT. THERE IS A SPRING THAT ALLOWS YOU TO RAISE &amp; RECLINE THE BACK. THE BACK OF THE CHAIR IS SLOWLY LEANING BACK AS MY CUSTOMERS SIT IN THE CHAIR. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING.</li>
            <li> This chair cannot be used for barber/cutting. As soon as clients sit in the chair it immediately starts reclining.  There is no locking mechanism to make the chair stay in the upright position.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that I do not like the chair at all. It is a nice seat width but the depth is very uncomfortable. The foot rest was also to short and my customers are constantly pushing it out of the fitting. I had my husband drill two holes in the metal bar under the seat where it attaches to the chair and changed out the screws hoping that will solve my problem. The chair wobbles very easily side to side and I am afraid the hydraulic attachment will bend with a heavier client. The arm rest on each side are also very wobbly. I called LCL Beauty about my concerns and they assure me it will be okay but I am very concerned. I wish I would have ordered a different chair and would change it out for a different one in a moment if I could. I&#x27;m sorry to report such a bad review. But all in all the chair feels very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Will buy again from seller.</li>
            <li> Good price and looks nice. Wide enough for larger clients to be comfortable</li>
            <li> Even the cat loves the chair, because he won&#x27;t stay off of it.</li>
