            <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I use the flat iron and this brand is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>No frizz, soft, great hold to the styling -</li>
            <li>The other two are just lukewarm at best.</li>
            <li>The dryers works quickly and leaves my hair shining and healthy.</li>
            <li>How can they say this is ultra light weight??  </li>
            <li>Pays for itself in the time you save and its a amazing price for a high quality dryer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have paid the original price.</li>
            <li>When this one dies, I&#x27;m most definitely buying another.....especially at such a great discounted price!</li>
            <li>Also has great heating and cooling settings so my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>Great blow dry .</li>
            <li>It has a super strong fan but isn&#x27;t very hot.</li>
            <li>Quick dry time and great sheen</li>
            <li>It is a kind of professional one</li>
            <li>My wife is 101% pleased - really.</li>
            <li>It did have a strong plastic smell at first, it either went away</li>
            <li>While most would argue that 2-3 years is adequate - when one pays $100+ for a hairdryer, you expect to see many long years of service.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Much better than their old one.  </li>
            <li>It sure beats my old Revlon blowout hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Broke right away.  </li>
            <li>I does dry my hair faster and it honestly does seem smoother.</li>
            <li>The best dryer ever, I go through hair dryers like crazy, finally I have found one I love!</li>
            <li>it is also very, very loud!!!</li>
            <li>Absolute bargain of the century!</li>
            <li>My wife LOVES this blow dryer so much that she wanted me to buy one for our daughter too!</li>
            <li>Dries hair fast!</li>
            <li>Glad I got a deep discount.</li>
            <li>I almost cried the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I actually LOVE this hair dryer and would give it 5 starts but due to where the on/off button is (right where my thumb warps around the handle)</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>No one wants chemical smell on their hair.</li>
            <li>VERY well done.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast dryer ever, doesn&#x27;t harm your hair and the result is like a pro.</li>
            <li>It weighs as much as a brick</li>
            <li>I was always the girl that took FOREVER to get ready each day.</li>
            <li>I have had several in my life, but this one is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It dries hair fast.</li>
            <li>and this dryer makes it straight.</li>
            <li>Dont even have to use my straight iron anymore.</li>
            <li>Dries hair fast.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really like the heat options.</li>
            <li>fast drying, leaves hair shiny, drastically reduces frizz,</li>
            <li>so they stick up straight...</li>
            <li>Overall a great hair dryer, but since the outer shell along with attachable head nozzles are plastic, it can emit a somewhat funky smell if left on for too long and on too high of a temperature.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that this is even a true Herstyler~~~It weighed a ton &amp; the Revelon is as light as a feather.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how it makes me hair all tangly when I put it on high speed.</li>
            <li>Diffuser does not fall off easily like it does on other products.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li>#34;It&#x27;s quiet and powerful.  </li>
            <li>So worth the extra weight?</li>
            <li>If you all are looking for a strong European quality hairdryer, this is definitely the one.</li>
            <li>The only compliant I have are the switches are right where you hand/fingers go</li>
            <li>The hot takes a few seconds to get hot, then I feel like it gets too hot.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and it absorbs  all the moisture and makes my blow drys very fast and easy!</li>
            <li>does have a funky smell when it&#x27;s on, but hoping that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s new.  </li>
            <li>I think it was just it being brand new.</li>
            <li>Get rid of your cheap hairdryer like, yesterday.&amp;#34;  She could not be more wrong.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is VERY loud and forceful.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and it dries my hair in about 5 minutes!</li>
            <li>, we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost.</li>
            <li>HerStyler has excellent products and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li>So when my old hair dryer started shooting sparks I went on the hunt for a new hair dryer....</li>
            <li>Dries my hair fast and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li>Hair stays soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft  and shiny.</li>
            <li>So all in all I should have kept my $35, and my old hair dryer, because now I will be purchasing another product.</li>
            <li>no wait straight back not up!  </li>
            <li>If you know proper blow-dry technique, you can do a full head of long curly hair in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my daughter LOVED the box that it came in and made it into a shadow box, so I can&#x27;t return it.  </li>
            <li>I now consider it dangerous to use as I fear a sharp piece of plastic may fly in my eye!  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about purchasing this after reading several of the reviews, however, this blow dryer is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Yes, if you hold the handle too low you can accidentally press the buttons, however, to modify that I simply hold it higher up and have no problems.  </li>
            <li>Instead of sinking another hundo into what is just a high priced Chinese made hair dryer, we took a gamble on the Herstyler Pro.</li>
            <li>shiny hair and fast blow dry</li>
            <li>over a year later the dryer does not get as hot which takes even longer to blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I have rather short hair with natural bends ( not waves)</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair pretty shiny and frizz free (or at least way less frizzy)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally it takes 30-45 minutes for it to be somewhat dry -but not with this dryer.</li>

            <li> over a year later the dryer does not get as hot which takes even longer to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have rather short hair with natural bends ( not waves)</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair pretty shiny and frizz free (or at least way less frizzy)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally it takes 30-45 minutes for it to be somewhat dry -but not with this dryer.</li>
            <li> The narrow concentrator keeps the air flowing just the way you need it to to avoid flyaways and allows for a much smoother blow out which eliminates the need for your flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It comes with two nozzles: a large one, and a small one.</li>
            <li> With traditional Conair blow-dryers from Walmart, I would spend 10 minutes blow drying my hair and it would be left really dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I only blow dry my hair twice a week.</li>
            <li> The cold shot button is okay</li>
            <li> long cord&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy dryer to hold and has a chord that is much longer than other dryers, which enables it to tangle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair was COMPLETELY dry in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> it blows it dry in no time.</li>
            <li> and it does not blow dry my hair any faster than the $20 walmart one I already had.  </li>
            <li> With this dryer, it now takes me 3-4 minutes to dry my hair and leaves it with a moisturized sheen.  </li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair that is chemically straightened and high lighted.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how this would compare to a higher end dryer, but overall, Im not too disappointed.</li>
            <li> but WOW it is very heavy and takes time to get use to</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair!  </li>
            <li> But still, it&#x27;s a little gross.</li>
            <li> It just blows harder.....</li>
            <li> my hair does dry in less time.</li>
            <li> It seriously took me less than 7 minutes to completely blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser who was recently introduced to this dryer in the past year.</li>
            <li> Other users comment that Herstyler will not deal with Amazon users, and the time has expired on the one-year warranty.  </li>
            <li> does cut out a few minutes of dry time.</li>
            <li> It came without the accessories pictured &amp; when I called Herstyler about the issue, not only were they terribly rude, they also informed me that they covered nothing since it was bought thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that is</li>
            <li> Usually I go through 2-3 hair dryers a year and never get my hair completely dry....</li>
            <li> Also-it&#x27;s not hot half the time, it blows cold, then hot, then slower, then faster.  </li>
            <li> I am done blow drying in half the time and the hair dryer doesn&#x27;t burn the tar out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Revlon 1875 dryer, so that&#x27;s what I am comparing this to.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, slightly wavy hair that tends to frizz in the humid weather.</li>
            <li> My duaghter loves it, her hair is long and thick, she does not complain.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said this herstyler pro tourmaline hair dryer was very heavy, one even called it a brick.</li>
            <li> Before this hair dryer I could be sweating under my blow dryer for about 1 hour every few days.</li>
            <li> Extremely heavy and noisy.  </li>
            <li> tangles hair, somewhat heavy, temperature gages suck and speed.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you have frizzy hair that takes long time to dry and don&#x27;t have the money to spend for an expensive dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like the dryer and the price isn&#x27;t to bad either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be very heavy.</li>
            <li> Cut my drying time in half!!</li>
            <li> would like to return this dryer, but it&#x27;s too late now.  </li>
            <li> not sure why they did!  </li>
            <li> Forget all the negative stuff you read... for the $38 you can not beat this deal!</li>
            <li> Would give this negative stars if I could!  </li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, course, wavy, shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> This is so heavy!!!  </li>
            <li> Something has obviously broken inside.  </li>
            <li> filter screen popped off, dangerous because sucks in hair.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is too thin, it dries it in a minute!</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> But leaves it so hard frizzy :(</li>
            <li> Buttons inconvenient</li>
            <li> This dryer is heavier than the Revlon, which isn&#x27;t too bad since it dries it a lot faster.</li>
            <li> Its not as bad on medium speed,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s annoying and seems damaging.</li>
            <li> Stuck and very disappointed</li>
            <li> It was a horrible time which I dreaded.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been an awful process trying to replace it...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. For the $$ its prob the best you can get for the power. My only issue is that when you turn it on it has a chemical smell... im hoping its just because i&#x27;ve only had it a month... But still, it&#x27;s a little gross. No one wants chemical smell on their hair.</li>
            <li> It is a kind of professional one</li>
            <li> Works great! Dries my hair fast and it&#x27;s quiet. Also has great heating and cooling settings so my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> Cut my drying time in half!! Love it :)</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this bow dryer! It makes my hair feel so soft and it dries my hair in about 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> Overall a great hair dryer, but since the outer shell along with attachable head nozzles are plastic, it can emit a somewhat funky smell if left on for too long and on too high of a temperature.</li>
            <li> Returned the item.  The box was open and the product looked like it had been used.</li>
            <li> Absolute bargain of the century! My wife had two Chi&#x27;s break in the course of around five years. While most would argue that 2-3 years is adequate - when one pays $100+ for a hairdryer, you expect to see many long years of service. Instead of sinking another hundo into what is just a high priced Chinese made hair dryer, we took a gamble on the Herstyler Pro. The result? My wife is 101% pleased - really. FIt and finish is as good as the Chi. Logical button placement and function is perfect. Temps are ideal, force is great and the whole hairdryer feels like a salon professional. They could double the price and it would still be a steal. VERY well done. I like it so much, we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is too thin, it dries it in a minute! But leaves it so hard frizzy :( it is also very, very loud!!! My duaghter loves it, her hair is long and thick, she does not complain. I did mot return it, my daughter uses it.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair that is chemically straightened and high lighted. Usually I go through 2-3 hair dryers a year and never get my hair completely dry.... Until this dryer. It is AMAZING!!! Normally it takes 30-45 minutes for it to be somewhat dry -but not with this dryer. My hair was COMPLETELY dry in 15 minutes. Save yourself time and money and buy this dryer. My only regret is not buying it sooner! Great price and will definitely buy another to have as a spare.</li>
            <li> I really like the dryer and the price isn&#x27;t to bad either. The only compliant I have are the switches are right where you hand/fingers go and I keep flipping them when I don&#x27;t want too.</li>
            <li> It came without the accessories pictured &amp; when I called Herstyler about the issue, not only were they terribly rude, they also informed me that they covered nothing since it was bought thru Amazon. I sent it back~~disgusted &amp; bought a cheap $20.00 one from Revelon &amp; it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve had. I am not sure that this is even a true Herstyler~~~It weighed a ton &amp; the Revelon is as light as a feather. Thank goodness I was able to return it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, light weight, heat/volume settings are great. Diffuser does not fall off easily like it does on other products. Leaves your hair feeling great! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It has a super strong fan but isn&#x27;t very hot.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this blow dryer so much that she wanted me to buy one for our daughter too! Excellent price for excellent product!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It is quieter than my last. Lightweight, many options for power and heat and very effective. The diffuser falls off but not too big an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for about a month and its perfect!!!! Fast dryer ever, doesn&#x27;t harm your hair and the result is like a pro.</li>
            <li> How can they say this is ultra light weight??  This is so heavy!!!  It weighs as much as a brick</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair. Before this hair dryer I could be sweating under my blow dryer for about 1 hour every few days. It was a horrible time which I dreaded. I was always the girl that took FOREVER to get ready each day. So when my old hair dryer started shooting sparks I went on the hunt for a new hair dryer....a upgrade. I always do tons of research before making a purchase and I decided on this hair dryer based on price and reviews. I am so glad I did! I am done blow drying in half the time and the hair dryer doesn&#x27;t burn the tar out of your hair. It just blows harder.....in a good way. So this is a great way investment. Pays for itself in the time you save and its a amazing price for a high quality dryer. Must have!</li>
            <li> This has to be the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have had several in my life, but this one is fantastic.  The narrow concentrator keeps the air flowing just the way you need it to to avoid flyaways and allows for a much smoother blow out which eliminates the need for your flat iron.  HerStyler has excellent products and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser who was recently introduced to this dryer in the past year. When I look for a dryer I want a lot of air, and a lot of heat. This has both. If you know proper blow-dry technique, you can do a full head of long curly hair in 15 minutes. It comes with two nozzles: a large one, and a small one. I have one pet peeve though, the cord needs to be longer. If you all are looking for a strong European quality hairdryer, this is definitely the one.</li>
            <li> Works very good for the price but WOW it is very heavy and takes time to get use to</li>
            <li> I LOVE how this dryer makes my hair feel and look!  No frizz, soft, great hold to the styling - think it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The only negative I have is that is does have a funky smell when it&#x27;s on, but hoping that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s new.  Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best dryer ever, I go through hair dryers like crazy, finally I have found one I love!</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dryer I have purchased, especially for the price. It dries hair fast. I have rather short hair with natural bends ( not waves) and this dryer makes it straight. Dont even have to use my straight iron anymore. Hair stays soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This the best hair dryer I have ever had.  Dries hair fast.  Has multiple hot-cool, fast-slow.  GREAT!!!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Forget all the negative stuff you read... for the $38 you can not beat this deal! Great great deal! Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> My girls say this works great.  Much better than their old one.  Dries hair fast!</li>
            <li> I actually LOVE this hair dryer and would give it 5 starts but due to where the on/off button is (right where my thumb warps around the handle) I keep accidentally shutting off the unit while I am using it--so for me there is a tiny design flaw. The dryers works quickly and leaves my hair shining and healthy.</li>
            <li> Extremely heavy and noisy.  returned</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. Works well. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have paid the original price. Glad I got a deep discount. I does dry my hair faster and it honestly does seem smoother.</li>
            <li> Broke right away.  Plastic end over filter screen popped off, dangerous because sucks in hair.</li>
            <li> I use the flat iron and this brand is perfect for me! I have very thick hair and it absorbs  all the moisture and makes my blow drys very fast and easy!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said this herstyler pro tourmaline hair dryer was very heavy, one even called it a brick. I don&#x27;t find it to be very heavy. It did have a strong plastic kind of smell, but it has faded away. I think it was just it being brand new. I also found this price to be amazing compare to retail. Have noticed my hair being more healthy. I stopped using this 4-IN-1 oil stuff because it over does it. It sure beats my old Revlon blowout hairdryer. It also has made straightening my hair easier since this smooths out my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it. Now my hair looks like I just left the salon. Quick dry time and great sheen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for anout 1 1/2 years... The heating mechanism just broke and it&#x27;s been an awful process trying to replace it... I only blow dry my hair twice a week. I would not reccomend this product...</li>
            <li> Great blow dry . shiny hair and fast blow dry</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer .the only thing is doesn&#x27;t have a dual voltage so if you wanna use it out of states you will need to buy a voltage transformator.</li>
            <li> i love my hair dryer. my hair does dry in less time.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. The price was great I have short hair it blows it dry in no time.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer. It leaves my hair soft  and shiny.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and if she is happy, I&#x27;m happy !!!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer over a year ago at the recommendation of Jenny at the MFAMB blog.  She said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s quiet and powerful.  Get rid of your cheap hairdryer like, yesterday.&amp;#34;  She could not be more wrong.  I have thick, long hair and it does not blow dry my hair any faster than the $20 walmart one I already had.  It is not quiet, either.  Let&#x27;s move on... over a year later the dryer does not get as hot which takes even longer to blow dry.  Other users comment that Herstyler will not deal with Amazon users, and the time has expired on the one-year warranty.  So all in all I should have kept my $35, and my old hair dryer, because now I will be purchasing another product.</li>
            <li> does cut out a few minutes of dry time. No need to use the straightener after blow drying. I&#x27;ve decided not to get the Brazilian blow out after this purchase. It isn&#x27;t very light weight.</li>
            <li> Good experience will order again</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has been rattling and has spit out several plastic pieces.  Something has obviously broken inside.  I now consider it dangerous to use as I fear a sharp piece of plastic may fly in my eye!  This is a very heavy dryer to hold and has a chord that is much longer than other dryers, which enables it to tangle.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return this dryer, but it&#x27;s too late now.  I think in its&#x27; current state it could be harmful to use.</li>
            <li> Works great, great price.</li>
            <li> The diffuser did come with the blow dryer</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this after reading several of the reviews, however, this blow dryer is AMAZING!  I have VERY thick, course, wavy, shoulder length hair.  With traditional Conair blow-dryers from Walmart, I would spend 10 minutes blow drying my hair and it would be left really dry and frizzy.  I thought that was how all blow dryers would affect my hair.  Wrong.  With this dryer, it now takes me 3-4 minutes to dry my hair and leaves it with a moisturized sheen.  I almost cried the first time I used it.  Yes, if you hold the handle too low you can accidentally press the buttons, however, to modify that I simply hold it higher up and have no problems.  When this one dies, I&#x27;m most definitely buying another.....especially at such a great discounted price!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, slightly wavy hair that tends to frizz in the humid weather. I previously owned a Revlon 1875 dryer, so that&#x27;s what I am comparing this to. This dryer is heavier than the Revlon, which isn&#x27;t too bad since it dries it a lot faster. It seriously took me less than 7 minutes to completely blow dry my hair! So worth the extra weight? It did have a strong plastic smell at first, it either went away or I don&#x27;t notice it anymore. I don&#x27;t like how it makes me hair all tangly when I put it on high speed. That&#x27;s annoying and seems damaging. Its not as bad on medium speed, but then it takes longer. I also don&#x27;t really like the heat options. The hot takes a few seconds to get hot, then I feel like it gets too hot. The other two are just lukewarm at best. And I accidently hit the buttons a lot while drying my hair. The cold shot button is okay, you have to hold in it. It does leave my hair pretty shiny and frizz free (or at least way less frizzy)&lt;br /&gt;PRO: fast drying, leaves hair shiny, drastically reduces frizz, long cord&lt;br /&gt;CON: tangles hair, somewhat heavy, temperature gages suck and speed. Buttons inconvenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you have frizzy hair that takes long time to dry and don&#x27;t have the money to spend for an expensive dryer. I really don&#x27;t know how this would compare to a higher end dryer, but overall, Im not too disappointed.</li>
            <li> Would give this negative stars if I could!  I bought this because there were so many reviews by people with curly hair that loved it... not sure why they did!  This dryer is VERY loud and forceful.  It blows my hair into an aphro.  It is great for styling my son&#x27;s bangs so they stick up straight... no wait straight back not up!  Also-it&#x27;s not hot half the time, it blows cold, then hot, then slower, then faster.  I think the buttons may be defective.  Unfortunately my daughter LOVED the box that it came in and made it into a shadow box, so I can&#x27;t return it.  Stuck and very disappointed</li>
