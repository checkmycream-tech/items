            <li>I simply love it.</li>
            <li>I also use the Tui Hair Oil, which I prefer because I think it&#x27;s more moisturizing, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Most companies will not do this.</li>
            <li>Use if you want to cut off your beautiful 15inch natural hair!  </li>
            <li>anywho loved loved loved the black van.</li>
            <li>this spray is perfect for re-hydration, and makes my hair feel super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product made my  hair soft and manageable with great shine.</li>
            <li>I just really like this spray to make my hair smell good.</li>
            <li>It is an easy to use if you need to rehydrate your hair i like it</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no greasiness.  </li>
            <li>This product did nothing but leave a light fragrance in my hair.</li>
            <li>It gives light moisture, not oily at all.  </li>
            <li>it does have kind of an intense perfumey/chemical smell though.</li>
            <li>The smell is...okay, but it works fabulously.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because the oil is cheap and over priced.</li>
            <li>This company is great if you can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li>Combined with the original Hair Milk, this product works quite well on my hair.</li>
            <li>The product significantly  improved the manageability of my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>The scent is so nice, much better than many other styling products.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it works well for second-day curls, but also is great on wet hair.</li>
            <li>two dollars more is worth it for my 4a/4b curls and coils ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a sweet flower.  </li>
            <li>Especially  the way it leave my hair so soft and smelling so , so very good. .</li>
            <li>According to my son, it leaves my grandson&#x27;s hair more tangled even than normal.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light a pretty</li>
            <li>I WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK TO MIXING MY OWN LEAVE-INS WITH A SPLASH OF THIS STUFF FOR THE SCENT...</li>
            <li>Similar to other reviews I saw before I purchased, this product smells great and did a decent job detangling (although I&#x27;ve used better products for that effect).</li>
            <li>This product smells great but is definitely not for daily usage if you&#x27;re protein sensative.</li>
            <li>Well it this was exactly what I got when I tried this product.     </li>
            <li>the next morning my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>It served it purphase for me during my winter month protective styles and I will use it again until I find something a lil bit better thats within this same price range.</li>
            <li>This product smells good after a few hours of settling in my hair.</li>
            <li>But if you buy black vanilla oil you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>Makes my dry, damaged hair from coloring and heat look naturally healthy.</li>
            <li>This used on dry hair paired with coconut oil does make my scalp more breathable thought.</li>
            <li>I used this with the Mimosa Hair Honey that I think is a great product, perhaps the success I see is related to them working together, not really sure (yet).</li>
            <li>Granted her products smell amazing they do or did little for my 3c/with bits of 4a hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks Carol&#x27;s daughter</li>
            <li>Really like the result.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I use this product in other scents and love it....</li>
            <li>Better than any other leave-in we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad product but its definitely not for everyone.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would help with his head full of long curly hair.</li>
            <li>The product was okay but after using for several months it became to dry out my hair</li>
            <li>I dont know how its possible, but this leave-in conditioner actually dried my hair out more than anything!</li>
            <li>long story short, I loved the black vanilla spray sooo much that I figured</li>
            <li>Use it if you want to HAVE TO cut off all of your hair to the new growth.  </li>
            <li>on the other hand the black vanillia made my hair feel soft,conditioned,well moisturized and left my hair looking,feeling,and smelling great.</li>
            <li>This the most unbelievable product.</li>
            <li>Your hair is detangled and soft.</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE BEEN NATURAL FOR 6 YEARS NOW.</li>
            <li>I AM OFTEN COMPLIMENTED ABOUT MY NATURAL TEXTURE BUT</li>
            <li>So far my 3b hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like any of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all natural product</li>
            <li>I am caucasion with thicker  and slightly coarse hair, I havent had much luck with their products.</li>
            <li>If you need a product for when you want ease while manipulating your natural hair, this is it.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I used it twice so far</li>
            <li>i straighten or curl my hair almost every day and it was getting pretty dry.</li>
            <li>The product can be easily applied on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li>I finally found my new leav-in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin, blonde hair and this stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and does not leave a heavy build up like other moisturizers do.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s light and does not leave a heavy build up like other moisturizers do.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman and I wear a short natural.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair greasy, but dry (the oil simply sat on my hair).</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on some good reviews but was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner is light-weight, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls and helps keep my hair soft and manageable even in winter.</li>
            <li> Once sprayed on hair, a simple blow dry, flat iron and go!</li>
            <li> With having curly hair, your hair gets knotty especially when wet.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and Tui made it drier and matted.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soo striped and dry.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a daily leave in conditioner to keep my hair moist and keep the frizzies down.  </li>
            <li> i ordered the carols daughter black vanilla leave in conditioning spary from the actual carols daughter website</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a little while</li>
            <li> I bought a few things off of CD&#x27;s actual website</li>
            <li> We use this for our African son who has very tight curls.</li>

            <li> I combine it with other gels to soften my hair and define my curls.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t help detangling the way I expected or that I see from other products that cost less.</li>
            <li> Used for hair with less texture.</li>
            <li> just a differnt smell and two dollars less on amazon.</li>
            <li> but I will stick to buying the black van.</li>

            <li> This product was awful! It made my hair feel like straw! Worst leave in conditioner. Spend the extra cash and get It&#x27;s a 10. It actually works.</li>
            <li> According to my son, it leaves my grandson&#x27;s hair more tangled even than normal.  I was really hoping this would help with his head full of long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it. It is an easy to use if you need to rehydrate your hair i like it</li>
            <li> I love love love this product what a comb can&#x27;t do this leave in can !!!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products by Carol&#x27;s Daughter. It&#x27;s one of the best leave in conditioner around. Your hair is detangled and soft.</li>
            <li> I knew there was a reason why I stayed away from CD&#x27;s product but after breaking out and trying a few her products I now know why...Granted her products smell amazing they do or did little for my 3c/with bits of 4a hair. I&#x27;ve never used a leave-in that actually dried my hair out and didn&#x27;t make my curls pop. Well it this was exactly what I got when I tried this product.     Not a fan...</li>
            <li> I love this product. Easy to use, no greasiness.  Scent is nice, but very mild.  Makes my dry, damaged hair from coloring and heat look naturally healthy. Great for Caucasian hair too.</li>
            <li> OMGee...I DON NOT LIKE PRODUCT!!! YES IT DOES SMELL GREAT, YES IT IS EXPENSIVE, YES IT DOES DRY YOUR HAIR. I AM OF AFRICAN DESCENT AND I HAVE BEEN NATURAL FOR 6 YEARS NOW. I HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT OF PRODUCTS AND THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE WORST! I AM OFTEN COMPLIMENTED ABOUT MY NATURAL TEXTURE BUT NOT AFTER USING THIS OVER-PRICED/OVER-RATED HAIR PERFUME. I WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK TO MIXING MY OWN LEAVE-INS WITH A SPLASH OF THIS STUFF FOR THE SCENT...*DISAPPOINTED :~/</li>
            <li> I dont know how its possible, but this leave-in conditioner actually dried my hair out more than anything! It did NOT help one bit with detangling either.  I have very fine, thin, blonde hair and this stuff left it feeling tangled, thick, and dry like straw. Horrible product, absolute waste of my money!</li>
            <li> I have type 4b/c relaxed thick course hair, which is shoulder length. This product made my  hair soft and manageable with great shine. I am 8 weeks post relaxer and Tui  made detangling a sinch. I finally found my new leav-in. I looove this product. Thanks Carol&#x27;s daughter</li>
            <li> I am a black woman and I wear a short natural.  I really love this product.  I combine it with other gels to soften my hair and define my curls.  Really like the result.</li>
            <li> It is a bit watery but I like it. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in my hair like some leave-in conditioners do.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on some good reviews but was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. The consistency of the product was like that of water and as soon as I sprayed a bit I began to worry. Not only did this product not condition my hair at all....but it left me with an itchy scalp. My sister and I were having a phone conversation and she was complaining about her severe itchy scalp, I asked her had she changed anything in her hair regimen and she stated that she had added a few things from Carol&#x27;s Daughter, one being this Tui leave in conditioner. I shared my experience with her and when she eliminated the use of this product she noticed that her itchy scalp was alleviated. I will NOT purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Not for me. This was my 5th try with Carol&#x27;s D products. So far my 3b hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like any of them. But I will probably try Monoi oil. I have dry curly hair and Tui made it drier and matted.</li>
            <li> I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Tui Leave In Conditioner to moisturize my hair.  It&#x27;s an all natural product so it&#x27;s heavy on the chemicals.  It&#x27;s light enough for everyday use.  I use it to soften my daughter&#x27;s hair before I comb it.  I also use it as a daily leave in conditioner to keep my hair moist and keep the frizzies down.  The smell is great.  It&#x27;s like a sweet flower.  This item works best when used with the shampoo and conditioner.  Happy Leave In Conditioning!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing but leave a light fragrance in my hair. I am caucasion with thicker  and slightly coarse hair, I havent had much luck with their products. Ive used oils  and haor cremes...no luck. Their body lotions rock tho!!</li>
            <li> I love the product but not the scent.  I use this product in other scents and love it.... Just not this one.</li>
            <li> Did not get the result I wanted by using this product.  It had a great smell though. Used for hair with less texture.</li>
            <li> My son is \\&quot;trying\\&quot; to grow and twist his hair (lol).  He has thick course hair and I use carols daughter to moisturize and detangle his hair.  It works well and has a great fragrance as all CD products do.  It&#x27;s light and does not leave a heavy build up like other moisturizers do.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great! I would repurchase, it makes my hair feel like its left moisturized after applying to my hair. I have courae 4b, 4c hair.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner is light-weight, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls and helps keep my hair soft and manageable even in winter. The scent is so nice, much better than many other styling products.</li>
            <li> If you need a product for when you want ease while manipulating your natural hair, this is it.  It gives light moisture, not oily at all.  Good detangler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a little while so it will take more time to see just how effective this product is. So far I like it.</li>
            <li> This smells great and is very light on the hair.  It can be used to wake up 2nd and 3rd day hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3B/3C borderline curls. Combined with the original Hair Milk, this product works quite well on my hair. My daughter has 3A/3B curls and the Tui conditioner alone is enough for her. I think this is a good product but if your hair is a bit coarser you might want to try some of the stronger products.</li>
            <li> After hearing all the rave about Carol&#x27;s Daughter, I finally decided to take the plunge. Well, I returned the item. It left my hair greasy, but dry (the oil simply sat on my hair). All the hype you hear about the wonderful scent, don&#x27;t believe it. The scent is simply a mixture of oil and it smells like oil. In the end, you can visit the local beauty supply or drug store and get a product that is equivalent to Carol&#x27;s Daughter.</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner and the hair smells great the entire week!  Once sprayed on hair, a simple blow dry, flat iron and go!</li>
            <li> this is great for people who style their hair a lot. i straighten or curl my hair almost every day and it was getting pretty dry. this spray is perfect for re-hydration, and makes my hair feel super soft and smooth. it does have kind of an intense perfumey/chemical smell though.</li>
            <li> The product was okay but after using for several months it became to dry out my hair</li>
            <li> The product significantly  improved the manageability of my daughter&#x27;s hair.  The product can be easily applied on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> love the product keeps hair moistirizered. would recommend if you deal with hair drying out or frizzing up. great product.</li>
            <li> With having curly hair, your hair gets knotty especially when wet. This is a great detangler for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have to say its a very good product, i spray it on after i do my twist out and wrap my hair and the next morning my hair looks healthy. I get this leave-in conditioner at the PX on a Military base where its way cheaper for $9.00 or $10.00</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It makes my hair feel so nice and I will definitely continue to purchase this! I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product for your hair. Works great on frizz depending on the texture of your hair.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter both love it!!!</li>
            <li> NO RESULTS AT ALL FROM USING THE PRODUCT. CAROLS DAUGHTER TUI LEAVE IN CONDITIONER.  THE HAIR FEELS LIKE STRAW STILL.</li>
            <li> Similar to other reviews I saw before I purchased, this product smells great and did a decent job detangling (although I&#x27;ve used better products for that effect). Unfortunately it does leave my hair feeling dried out when used on curly hair. When I&#x27;ve used it before blow drying and eventually straight ironing my hair, it works great.</li>
            <li> Scent is similar to the way a tuti-fruitie jellybelly tastes. Fyi.</li>
            <li> I just really like this spray to make my hair smell good. I&#x27;m not sure if it conditions and makes a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like sugar water and FEELS like sugar water. Made my hair sticky. horrible product. Gave the product to my friend, and they felt the same way.</li>
            <li> Made combing through my daughter&#x27;s hair a breeze. Better than any other leave-in we&#x27;ve used. The smell is...okay, but it works fabulously.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in  conditioner. The smell is great and works well to soften my hair. My sister loves it too!</li>
            <li> This is the deal I have been buying hair products like no ones business for the past few weeks... This oil sucks!!! The scent is light a pretty but it makes my hair feel like I&#x27;m sprinkling it with watery syrup. Do not buy this product. I bought a few things off of CD&#x27;s actual website but I came on here to let everyone know it&#x27;s not because of amazon that it&#x27;s bad it&#x27;s because the oil is cheap and over priced. And this one is horrible I am so not a fan. But if you buy black vanilla oil you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product smells great but is definitely not for daily usage if you&#x27;re protein sensative. I only use this occasionally (once a week) when Im wearing braids or a sew in to aviod my strands being weakened by the tension. Its not a bad product but its definitely not for everyone. When you spray it in, your hair will immediately let you know that this isnt for you. It served it purphase for me during my winter month protective styles and I will use it again until I find something a lil bit better thats within this same price range.</li>
            <li> love the smell of the tui leave in conditioner.  it is apply to apply from the spray bottle, and i love how it refreshes my hair without adding any build-up to my hair.</li>
            <li> I used the Tui \\&quot;leave in conditioner\\&quot;.  This is a horrible product! Use it if you want your hair to break off. Use it if you want to HAVE TO cut off all of your hair to the new growth.  Use this if you want to have hair breakage all over your shower when water touches your hair. Use if you want to cut off your beautiful 15inch natural hair!  And if you don&#x27;t want a response from customer service, email them at the email address Carol&#x27;s Daughter providers. You will NOT get a call back with the 48 hours as they say. Matter of fact, weeks will pass by with no call back whip your hair falls out.  My hair is finally growing back! That God! And, I Will Never use any of her products again. Last, I was not impressed by the smell. Quite frankly, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used it twice so far and it didn&#x27;t help detangling the way I expected or that I see from other products that cost less. I like that it is a spray I feel I get good coverage. I used this with the Mimosa Hair Honey that I think is a great product, perhaps the success I see is related to them working together, not really sure (yet).</li>
            <li> The product has a terrible smell in my opinion but worked okay on my hair. I would not have thrown it out had the smell been tolerable - again, my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love the conditoner by Carol&#x27;s Daughter.  The smell is just awesome.  I will be buying more of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product smells good after a few hours of settling in my hair. I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic results from using it. I have used it as a freshener and then wear my hair in a bun or halo braids. This used on dry hair paired with coconut oil does make my scalp more breathable thought.</li>
            <li> This the most unbelievable product. I simply love it. Especially  the way it leave my hair so soft and smelling so , so very good. .</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have curly hair and it works well for second-day curls, but also is great on wet hair. I also use the Tui Hair Oil, which I prefer because I think it&#x27;s more moisturizing, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years for my coarse hair before curling &amp; styling.  Adds sheen.</li>
            <li> so lets begin...i ordered the carols daughter black vanilla leave in conditioning spary from the actual carols daughter website three months before I ordered the tui leavein conditoning spray by carols daughter from amazon. long story short, I loved the black vanilla spray sooo much that I figured hey, why not try the tui conditioning spray? just a differnt smell and two dollars less on amazon. anywho loved loved loved the black van. but I hated the tui. It made my hair feel soo striped and dry. on the other hand the black vanillia made my hair feel soft,conditioned,well moisturized and left my hair looking,feeling,and smelling great. I will not be buying any mpre carols daughter products off of amazon because it was a waste of time and money. but I will stick to buying the black van. leave in conditioning spray from the actual carols daughter website. two dollars more is worth it for my 4a/4b curls and coils ;)</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling dry and weird as if I put spritz in it.</li>
            <li> What can I say??? Horrible!!! the consistency is like water, and there is no way that I can use this to detangle my 3c hair!!!! I think I will stick with my spray bottle with water and conditioner mix!!! is not even slippery at all or feels like conditioner.  I cant believe I paid $11! Ugh</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t do a great job of untangling my hair</li>
            <li> So nice! We use this for our African son who has very tight curls. It is awesome and keeps his hair nice and soft! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this product but I couldn&#x27;t find in my local Beauty Supply store. This company is great if you can&#x27;t find it locally. The company reached out to me because I thought it took a little to long to receive the item. They were so gracious and apologized. Most companies will not do this. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the company.</li>
