            <li> I would reccomend this product to any one going out into the sun. It&#x27;s very handy to carry with you in the travel size.</li>
            <li> We had a work event where we had clients on a yacht to watch the America&#x27;s Cup races in SF. I had gift bags for all the clients and we included the travel sunscreen. They worked perfectly! I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated being able to purchase the travel size sunblock in bulk.  They were well packed for travel and I received them in a short span of time.  I am having an outdoor wedding and they are a small gift to all those who come.  Sue Long</li>
            <li> good price and nice travel size tubes. I got them as a party favor for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party. Everyone loved it.</li>
            <li> We ordered 2 cases and it arrived within 5 days after ordering (free shipping). Nice presentation if your looking forward to selling in a storefront, event etc. 24 tubes are inside of a large titled clear container with product information listed. We are using the tubes for our client destination wedding guest bags, as part of a weekend emergency kit. I highly recommend ordering from this vendor and look forward to placing another order soon for another client.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawai&#x27;i and apply sunblock every morning before I head outdoors. This is a perfect pocket size for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Sipped quick. Packed nicely. Just what we needed. nice SPF in a National brand and a good number.</li>
            <li> Perfect for gift bags!</li>
            <li> My husband and I put these into our thank you bags for guests staying for our destination wedding. It was a lifesaver for some who never even thought to bring suntan lotion. The item came in time,and as scheduled. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution to family outing to the beach to make sure everyone has sun protection.  It even had a container we put on the counter so people could take their own.</li>
            <li> Bulk buy but I saw cheaper at Target for 97 cents each.</li>
            <li> This is one of the rare cases where small is better. When I go hiking, I don&#x27;t want a 6oz tube. I want a 1oz tube in my backpack. The 1oz size was hard to get in my city so I opted for a case of 24 and have been giving them as presents to fellow hikers on my walks.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to go in golf tournament goodie bags and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Since we were getting married in the Riviera Maya, Mexico, we wanted to provide sun protection for our guests and so we put one in each of our guests welcome bags. It worked out great. The items arrived on time and in excellent condition in a plastic tub, so that they were not punctured or squeezed.</li>

            <li> I am head of our teachers Association and we decided to use these as unique gifts for teacher appreciation week in May.

It&#x27;s really going to make a sunny teacher appreciation week for all of us.</li>
