    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The taste is off-putting at first- try adding lots of fresh lemon juice, but after a few days i really didn&#x27;t mind it.  Didn&#x27;t notice extreme effects but felt like i generally digested better and was less bloated after meals (i eat a lot of raw veggies so that can be a problem). I will keep using this as its a good addition to a healthy regimin and i like having an easy way to cram nutrients into my body!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to previous reviews but was convinced they were wrong and this product would work for me. It&#x27;s gritty and tastes disgusting and after 3 weeks no results apart from less money in my bank account. I love Betheny Frankel and was very disappointed she would promote such an inferior and expensive product that does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now and I love it. First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t agree with a reviewer about the taste. To me, its not an issue. It&#x27;s neither bad nor great. It&#x27;s easy to mix in a glass of water and down it. I think it sort of has a refreshing spa like taste to it. I even like the smell of it, and I have a particular nose when something bothers me. I am using this along with the Weight Management supplement. I plan on continuing to use both products indefinitely. My skin looks great, I feel like I have more energy, and I think the cleanse aids in making me feel lighter and more \\&quot;regular\\&quot; if you know what I mean. I&#x27;ve never had to run to the bathroom on this cleanse. It&#x27;s not like that. I view it as something I&#x27;d like to take everyday as part of my health routine. Definitely buy it here instead of GNC which is where I first had to purchase it. Its so much cheaper here. Although just get the refill pack, skip the wood box with her recipes inside. Its cute, yes. But not necessary. Its all about the product, and I have to say bravo to Bethenny on this one! Try it out!</li>
            <li> I got no results from the product at all no benefits period. After three months the only thing I lost was $150.00. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my system I eat healthy an exersize daily maybe I didn&#x27;t need cleaning but this product did nothing for me. I think a three month trial was more than a fair amount time to get any benefit that the product may offer I say pass..</li>
            <li> Hated it! Tried it once and sent it back. The water tasted slimy and I could not get past the taste.</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanse I have found that tastes food, works well and doesnt cause negative side effects like gas, stomach pain, etc.  Love this stuff, use it daily.</li>
            <li> I am so sad because I was really excited to use this product. However, I did not feel any changes. Still have problems and this thing did not do anything. The taste is good but it was just like drinking water. Lemon water by itself helps more.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my shipment yesterday and tried the green tea lemonade this morning. I wasnt able to finish my entire glass, The taste and smell werent bad (not great either) but I took too long to drink it and it got kinda jelloy (don&#x27;t know how else to describe it) I will try it again tomorrow and hopefully get it down quicker and will update later. Maybe adding lemon would help with the taste for those of you who don&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li> It took about a week to really start working, but it is definitely working.  I eat healthy and work out, but with working full time and two little ones it is hard to really get all the nutrients I need.  The taste isn&#x27;t as bad as the slimy texture, but I can stomach it since its working for me.</li>
            <li> This is barely palatable. Do not waste your money; product does not dissolve and tastes horrendous. I love Bethanny Frankl and I hope she works on improving this product!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanse and restore!  This is my second repurchase.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of OTC products in the past and these by far, work best for me so far.  I do agree with other reviewers that the dosage needs to be altered.  I also find that it tastes better with sparkling water versus still water.  I take a day half a packet with food and sometimes one per day, depending on how I am feeling on that day.  It does give you better energy.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this once daily and it keeps me regular. I replaced another fiber powder with this. I also like the vitamin powders.</li>
            <li> First batch worked really well.  The new batches ( that make the water turn green) aren&#x27;t as strong or don&#x27;t work as well as the original. Still works OK though</li>
            <li> It literally taste like dirt. I returned it. I don&#x27;t even know if it would work or not because I couldn&#x27;t get it down.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it would be a medium to light shade of green.  This just turned into algae.  Disgusting.  When I drank it, I smelled something that reminded me of the chemical in perms.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not that chemical, but the smell was there.  I had other people try it.....they couldn&#x27;t handle it either.  What can I do with the remaining packets?</li>
            <li> i feel that it is helpful with my digestion and the taste gets better as you grow accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> not really sure what i was expecting but i just hate that artifical sweetener after taste...even when its not &amp;#34;artificial&amp;#34;.  the stevias, etc still don&#x27;t taste like the real thing.  i&#x27;d rather have a few calories worth of real stuff</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews on this item but I don&#x27;t have a weak stomach so I went ahead and ordered the drink mix as well as the daily pills. Today is the first day for both, I could&#x27;t even finish the drink. It is AWFUL. Not only does it look unappealing (dark green-brown) it doesn&#x27;t mix well with the water. It felt like I was drinking dirt, and I shook HARD to mix it all. I got about halfway and had to give up. There is nothing \\&quot;lemonadey\\&quot; about this. I have nothing good to say about it. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last six months and I have never felt better.  My diet is clean, I do not starve myself.  I do workout with Tracey Anderson six times a week, but it is this product that has changed my life.  My weight has remained so consistent and my appetite so much calmer. I was always bloated and now I feel confident.  My skin has also improved and I get tons of compliments.  I am 60 and I feel and look like I am back in my 40&#x27;s. Combine this product with no junk food/chinese/pizza/sweets/red meat /and dairy, I promise you will be happy.  I eat very nice breakfast &amp; dinner, but now I am not snacking or eating big lunches...it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the very best price, complain about taste ladies,...come on, grow up. Get off the couch, work out and use this product and you will look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m not into this &#x27;Skinnygirl&#x27; concept because I think it reinforces the warped body image and relationship with food that seems to plague us women (my humble opinion).  So I by no means am a Bethany Frankel advocate.  But, I do LOVE this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, this is not crystal light.  You will not sip this leisurely with your meal.  But I don&#x27;t think it tastes that bad (and I have had green and cleansing super foods sit on my shelf because I can&#x27;t stand the smell/taste).  I just mix it with 6-8 oz of water and drink it in a few sips. Not great, but not bad either.  But here&#x27;s the thing: my body CRAVES this stuff.  Especially since I am learning to respect what my body is calling for with nutrition and hunger/fullness ( see [[ASIN:B000H2N3FA Thin Within]], [[ASIN:B008DGRQNW Diets Are Fattening]] and [[ASIN:0963078178 Normal Eating for Normal Weight: The Path to Freedom from Weight Obsession and Food Cravings]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also (warning, TMI ahead), I have always struggled with constipation, and this had really helped with my regularity. And it also seems to help my body digest if I do go a bit beyond fullness.  Another use for this product is at that 4:00 hunger time when you don&#x27;t want to eat and ruin your dinner, but you also don&#x27;t want to be starving and then overeat. This is perfect for that and hits the spot!</li>
