            <li> This is a great item to place your Styrofoam head on for your wigs. Will not tip over. It fits perfectly. Item was shipped immediately and received it in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Ok. So this base was awesome for me to put my manikin heads on. SN: you will have to tape it down to a table to secure it.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for a styrofoam head, it fit well. Didn&#x27;t use cause the styrofoam got damage by trying to paint it with spray.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Get one that claps to a table. This has no option of holding on to anything so if the head is too heavy it will topple over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the wig non-topple wig holder. I&#x27;m using it for craft shows to display headbands and bows that I make. It worked great.</li>

            <li> This stand made it easy to display my wig. works perfect and keeps wig off the table.&lt;br /&gt;Great for styling wigs because it makes it stable.</li>
            <li> I used these on my Star Trek Alien masks.  If you are using it for a wig.  It would work very nice to hold up your Mannequin Heads.</li>
            <li> Very nice and strong enough  for head.</li>
            <li> The peg won&#x27;t anchor into the hole securely enough to hold the stryrofoam head.  Frustrating and useless.</li>
            <li> Nice stand. Doesn&#x27;t tip. Good price.</li>
            <li> FITS WELL WITH WIG HEAD AND DOES NOT TIP OVER, EVEN WITH WT OF WIG  ON IT. WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN</li>
            <li> Great base for a wig stand!  Keeps it sitting up very sturdily if placed where you will not knock into it.  Can be knocked over if you have in well traveled area, but good in its spot.</li>
            <li> What a great idea.  My long wigs would topple the long neck wigs if you breathed on them!  Problem solved.</li>
            <li> So I deciced my hubby need a stand to put his baseball caps on. It sits in entry way and a beautifu chest with the mannequim wig head. Every one walks and takes a look at the caps on the wigg head and has a laugh.</li>
            <li> Stand does what it was designed to do. I have a long neck Styrofoam head that holds a hat constantly. Stays upright even when bumped.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put together.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does! You can sorta just stick the mannequin head on there XD - Freya McMullen</li>

If I have a complaint about any future purchase I&#x27;ll let you know about it.  Please, no more reviews!</li>

Perfect pair.</li>
            <li> It is what it is.  It fits all the styrofoam &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; I have of various kinds by various vendors to display hats, and keeps the &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; and hats stable and upright.</li>
            <li> My styrofoam mannequin head fits perfectly on top of this stand which, I model my crochet hats on top of when taking pictures of my hats. Great value and quality.</li>
