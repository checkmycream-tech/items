    <ol>
            <li>Excellent replacement for a excellent product at an  excellent price!  </li>
            <li>This is the best price I have ever seen for the replacement foil for a Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>The product fits the shaver perfectly.</li>
            <li>very good as i thought it would be</li>
            <li>works great , priced righthttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41mo4%2Bdj34L._SS300_.jpg</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li>The good part is that it fits and will work as a replacement foil and comes at a good price compared to the OEM part.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not just the shaving block that contributes to a good shave.</li>
            <li>Good value for money</li>
            <li>I still feel this is a good replacement</li>
            <li>i received my replacement shaver screen quickly and it was a perfect match to my braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been more than 2 months, no issues, the product works great</li>
            <li>However, the shave performance isn&#x27;t great, though I can&#x27;t say for sure whether it&#x27;s because of this non-OEM design or just the shortfall of this style of Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others.</li>
            <li>A great product and an even better deal.</li>
            <li>It appears to effectively work as well as the OEM did.</li>
            <li>Part fits but not as good as the original.</li>
            <li>This file works great at a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>Good for a quick touch-up shave.</li>
            <li>The foil on my husbands razor broke after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>works well, and i&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Hubby likes this razor, and was very happy I found the foil online, as our local stores don&#x27;t seem to carry them anymore</li>
            <li>they are an OK</li>
            <li>but I just changed my mind :)  </li>
            <li>Its cheap and does the job!  </li>
            <li>The price was more acceptable though, which is why I gave it a 4 star.  </li>
            <li>, I WISH I HAD MORE TO SAY</li>
            <li>the quality is cheap!</li>
            <li>For the money, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Rarely is an aftermarket product superior to the OEM product, but this is.</li>
            <li>Braun changed the shaver screen for model 1775 ( a very good shaver)from staggered holes to a smaller hole with a crystalline appearance.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly but it feels like the shaves take about twice as long as with the original parts I used to get from Braun.</li>
            <li>This replacement component works as well or better than the original.</li>
            <li>It shaves well and it easy to detach and re-attach</li>
            <li>I liked it so much!</li>
            <li>Fits and works fine.  </li>
            <li>The mesh is too fine to let the whiskers thru.  </li>
            <li>I have to use a safety razor to trim my beard to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This aftermarket foil is cheap for a reason....</li>
            <li>Also the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>The foil screen however fit perfectly, and as far as I can tell is of same or better quality than the OEM.</li>
            <li>The change in the screen design greatly improves the number of times you have to back and forth before you are acceptably trimmed.</li>
            <li>was shopping for genuine replacement parts for my Braun shaver and found this aftermarket product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Soft foil doesn&#x27;t hold up to a good shave.</li>
            <li>The original configuration is no longer available.</li>
            <li>This replacement foil and block cutter fit well, and do the job, but it seems they don&#x27;t setup the beard as well as the original.</li>
            <li>then the original one did, so we purchased 3 of them.</li>
            <li>many thanks!</li>
            <li>I got this replacement because the original foil was worn and was tearing.  </li>
            <li>Do not attempt to remove the foil and use it in the original support head.</li>
            <li>The cutter works like the original one.</li>
            <li>The mesh is somewhat finer than that on the original head and takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li>works, but not as well as the original</li>
            <li>This product is a good standard replacement.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave the shaver on the charger at all except when I need to bring it to a full charge so this tip applies to those who charges it the way I do.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works with no issues.  </li>
            <li>This is a very very very good buy for $8, when it usually costs 20</li>
            <li>The new replacement Foil works even better</li>
            <li>It shaved unevenly and greatly irritated my face.</li>
            <li>I checked it against the original and seems like it is not SST material is much darker.</li>
            <li>I routinely have to use the trimmer to grab a couple of stragglers (even in easy spots like the middle of my cheek) and then go back with the foil to get a nice clean look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a light beard and the new foil</li>
            <li>It looked a bit different than the original but fits fine and works just as well, months since purchasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the original smooth screen.</li>
            <li>I would opt for the original, pay the extra price, and enjoy a cleaner, smoother shave.</li>
            <li>compared to the original foil, the openings in the foil don&#x27;t seem to admit my whiskers readily enough to get a smooth shave, and I have to repeatedly go over my beard.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this foil to replace a broken one that I have, this foil is as good as the original, way to go Amazon!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>product was an exact replacement for something that i couldn&#x27;t find in walmart or target.</li>
            <li>Consequently, when shaving with the knockoff version, I have to pass the shaver over my face considerably more times to coax the whiskers into those smaller holes, thus increasing the amount of time required for a satisfactory shave.  </li>
            <li>Fits exactly.  </li>
            <li>but like most have said this will take you a little longer to shave than the original.  </li>
            <li>The experience was positive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it takes considerably longer to shave satisfactorily using a recently purchased ersatz foil for my Braun 1000 Series shaver than with the original genuine Braun foil.  </li>
            <li>The new foil is of a better design and seems much smoother than the old foil when it was new.</li>
            <li>At first they are smaller than the original equipment unit from Braun.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Spend twice as much and get it from Braun.</li>
            <li>The replacement blade didn&#x27;t fit my 1775, the bottom was different and wouldn&#x27;t snap on.</li>
            <li>Have had it only two weeks but feel confident with its engineering and performance this far.</li>
            <li>This is the third or forth replacement I have purchased, so I can not remember how well the original foil and cutter worked, but this one seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>The pattern of the holes is NOT the same as the original foil.  </li>
            <li>It was decent for the price.</li>
            <li>BUT THERE IS LITTLE MORE THAT I CAN SHARE AT THIS TIME</li>
            <li>I might not have read the whole description, but I was surprised to find it came with a cutter block, too.</li>
            <li>Replacement foil vital instead of getting a whole new shaver unit...</li>
            <li>At first I noticed that the foil was just loose at one end where the first plastic mounting point broke.</li>
            <li>The original foil had round holes, this has more of a crisscross pattern, and I don&#x27;t think it catches the hair as well as the other.  </li>
            <li>We figured that we may as well replace the blade too since we had a new one.</li>
            <li>cuz this new one is crappo.</li>
            <li>This one pretty much work like all the other replacements I have gotten.  </li>
            <li>I found this head provides a significantly closer shave than the previous one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old modle and we could not find the replacement parts anywhere in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Was hesitate to buy ,but after reading the reviews, it helped me decided to give it a try,since the price was a third of Braun,  I&#x27;m very satisfied, works the same, if not better than Brauns.</li>
            <li>My old foil was breaking up and taking bites out of my face.</li>
            <li>Also, I was pleasantly surprised that the purchase included a replacement cutter head</li>
            <li>I suspect the OEM part will do a slightly better job based on what I remember from past experiences, whereas this foil does require multiple passes along with the user to properly stretch the skin to catch more hair for better cutting efficiency.</li>
            <li>In just a couple of weeks to a month they open up a bit and work exactly the same as the Braun unit.</li>
            <li>basically, these days I just look for a decent price which these delivered on and assume all replacements are about the same quality.</li>
            <li>I found that the genuine Braun Series 1000 shaver foil has elongated circular holes measuring about 0.7 mm by 0.3 mm arranged in parallel lines, whereas the ersatz version has confused-looking array of circular clusters of irregularly shaped holes that are less than half as big as those on the genuine product.  </li>
            <li>The new foil has a different pattern though.</li>
            <li>but they also provided a new cutter block for the same price</li>
            <li>One tip for better use of the Braun is when the battery and hence the speed of the motor starts to feel weak, the Braun won&#x27;t perform as well compared to when the battery is fully charged up.</li>
            <li>Well, we had to put the old blade back on</li>
            <li>The original foil with the razor lasted a little over 18 months, the next one lasted about 12 months, this foil did not last a month, and that ends my experiment with Braun shavers.</li>
            <li>A week or so later the whole side came loose.</li>
            <li>Replacement foil is of poor quality as far as a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It is apparent that there is a different pattern on the foil, probably the reason.</li>
            <li>Not long after writing the review the foil disconnected from the plastic that holds it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy another, the small savings isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>If you notice your foil getting a little loose then order a replacement right away because the one you have is about to break.</li>

            <li> but they also provided a new cutter block for the same price</li>
            <li> One tip for better use of the Braun is when the battery and hence the speed of the motor starts to feel weak, the Braun won&#x27;t perform as well compared to when the battery is fully charged up.</li>
            <li> Well, we had to put the old blade back on</li>
            <li> The original foil with the razor lasted a little over 18 months, the next one lasted about 12 months, this foil did not last a month, and that ends my experiment with Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> A week or so later the whole side came loose.</li>
            <li> Replacement foil is of poor quality as far as a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It is apparent that there is a different pattern on the foil, probably the reason.</li>
            <li> Not long after writing the review the foil disconnected from the plastic that holds it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy another, the small savings isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> If you notice your foil getting a little loose then order a replacement right away because the one you have is about to break.</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter I received were far easier to install than the last one I received from an other company.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a foil and cutter combo for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Shaving foil only, not original Braun (different holes in foil), but works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, considering BRAUN has dropped the ball by not offering a decent affordable replacement, its hard to complain... heck I was going to give this a 4</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The part was crushed which casued a crease in the foil, It is working for now</li>
            <li> came on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> came as promised and as expected.</li>
            <li> Basically, what used to cut in 2 strokes, now takes 6 strokes, making for a longer shave, and excess skin irritation, thus getting less shaves per battery charge, and a minor case of razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have had issues with finding decent replacements.  </li>
            <li> The new screen (the only one that will fit the 1775 model) is TERRIBLE - shaving time has been increased by a factor of 4 to 5 to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> the plus side, my face suffers less abrasion than with the genuine Braun foil.</li>
            <li> other respects</li>
            <li> This non-Braun foil remained sharp longer.</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 4-5 times across the same areas to get the hairs fully cut.  </li>
            <li> And then I usually supplement my shaving with a regular razor to catch any stray</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ll be looking at other electric razors that continue to provide replacement parts for their products!</li>
            <li> The Braun irritates less than a razor and makes using the razor a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Product arrived slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> which does not fit the 1775 shaver</li>
            <li> If my whiskers were much thicker, shaving would be impossible.  </li>
            <li> It cuts my beard without excessive effort or time.</li>
            <li> We still use the foil, but even that takes down the effectiveness of the razor, even if it doesn&#x27;t scratch my face like the broken one did.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a Braun foil and block to replace this one and after four months it is already dull.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than Braun foil and cutter replacement.</li>
            <li> Even the factory is confused!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a newer shaver in my opinion is poorly constructed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
            <li> This condition made it useless.</li>
            <li> I suppose we just have to take our chances with whichever brand we choose to replace our foil and cutting block.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works great , priced righthttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41mo4%2Bdj34L._SS300_.jpg</li>
            <li> Was a replacement for razor.  Fits and works fine.  Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The foil on my husbands razor broke after many years of use.  It&#x27;s an old modle and we could not find the replacement parts anywhere in the stores.  The new replacement Foil works even better then the original one did, so we purchased 3 of them.</li>
            <li> i received my replacement shaver screen quickly and it was a perfect match to my braun shaver.  works well, and i&#x27;m pleased with the results. many thanks!</li>
            <li> Hubby likes this razor, and was very happy I found the foil online, as our local stores don&#x27;t seem to carry them anymore</li>
            <li> Was hesitate to buy ,but after reading the reviews, it helped me decided to give it a try,since the price was a third of Braun,  I&#x27;m very satisfied, works the same, if not better than Brauns.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly.  Exactly as advertised.  I will definitely purchase from this business again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Shaving foil only, not original Braun (different holes in foil), but works well. Much less expensive than Braun foil and cutter replacement.</li>
            <li> works well if you need it</li>
            <li> Low quality shaver replacement foil. Soft foil doesn&#x27;t hold up to a good shave. Do not buy this product. waste of money</li>
            <li> The shaver foil fits to the Braun 1000 series FreeControl. It&#x27;s been more than 2 months, no issues, the product works great</li>
            <li> I might not have read the whole description, but I was surprised to find it came with a cutter block, too. This is a very very very good buy for $8, when it usually costs 20</li>
            <li> Braun changed the shaver screen for model 1775 ( a very good shaver)from staggered holes to a smaller hole with a crystalline appearance. The original configuration is no longer available. The new screen (the only one that will fit the 1775 model) is TERRIBLE - shaving time has been increased by a factor of 4 to 5 to get a close shave. The screen appears to be best for use by women with finer body hair but is AWFUL for a man. The company also said that what I needed was part no. 11, which does not fit the 1775 shaver Even the factory is confused! If you need a replacement screen for your 1775 shaver, throw it away and get a different brand!</li>
            <li> This product is a good standard replacement.  It fits the model that I have, just as it is described.  It shaves well and it easy to detach and re-attach</li>
            <li> The good part is that it fits and will work as a replacement foil and comes at a good price compared to the OEM part. However, the shave performance isn&#x27;t great, though I can&#x27;t say for sure whether it&#x27;s because of this non-OEM design or just the shortfall of this style of Braun shaver. I suspect the OEM part will do a slightly better job based on what I remember from past experiences, whereas this foil does require multiple passes along with the user to properly stretch the skin to catch more hair for better cutting efficiency. Good for a quick touch-up shave. For a closer shave, I start with the Braun and then finish up with a razor. The Braun irritates less than a razor and makes using the razor a lot easier. One tip for better use of the Braun is when the battery and hence the speed of the motor starts to feel weak, the Braun won&#x27;t perform as well compared to when the battery is fully charged up. I don&#x27;t leave the shaver on the charger at all except when I need to bring it to a full charge so this tip applies to those who charges it the way I do.</li>
            <li> I ordered this foil to replace a broken one that I have, this foil is as good as the original, way to go Amazon!</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for a excellent product at an  excellent price!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a foil and cutter combo for a long time.  I didn&#x27;t want a newer shaver in my opinion is poorly constructed!</li>
            <li> The screen is made with inferior material and pinch the skin.  I checked it against the original and seems like it is not SST material is much darker.</li>
            <li> Replacement foil is of poor quality as far as a smooth shave. It&#x27;s definitely not the original smooth screen. It shaved unevenly and greatly irritated my face. It&#x27;s not an Amazon availability or delivery problem...it&#x27;s a Braun redesign issue. It&#x27;s like shaving with a cheese grater.</li>
            <li> Part fits but not as good as the original. Product arrived slightly damaged. The way it was packaged there was not a lot of protection. The part was crushed which casued a crease in the foil, It is working for now but I wonder if the crease will cause it to wear out prematurely.</li>
            <li> This replacement foil and block cutter fit well, and do the job, but it seems they don&#x27;t setup the beard as well as the original. Basically, what used to cut in 2 strokes, now takes 6 strokes, making for a longer shave, and excess skin irritation, thus getting less shaves per battery charge, and a minor case of razor burn. It is apparent that there is a different pattern on the foil, probably the reason. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another, the small savings isn&#x27;t worth it. I would opt for the original, pay the extra price, and enjoy a cleaner, smoother shave.</li>
            <li> The mesh is too fine to let the whiskers thru.  I would not recommend it for that reason.  I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
            <li> I found this head provides a significantly closer shave than the previous one.  Definitely would recommend it...it&#x27;s not just the shaving block that contributes to a good shave.</li>
            <li> My old foil was breaking up and taking bites out of my face. The new foil is of a better design and seems much smoother than the old foil when it was new. Good value for money</li>
            <li> product was an exact replacement for something that i couldn&#x27;t find in walmart or target. came on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> The supplier gave prompt service and the product was well-packaged.  I am disappointed in the performance, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As compared to the original foil, the openings in the foil don&#x27;t seem to admit my whiskers readily enough to get a smooth shave, and I have to repeatedly go over my beard.  I have to use a safety razor to trim my beard to get a smooth shave.  I got this replacement because the original foil was worn and was tearing.  I am not likely to buy this brand again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other respects they are an OK supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myron</li>
            <li> The foil and cutter I received were far easier to install than the last one I received from an other company.  This is the third or forth replacement I have purchased, so I can not remember how well the original foil and cutter worked, but this one seems to work well.  It cuts my beard without excessive effort or time.</li>
            <li> The product fits and works but like most have said this will take you a little longer to shave than the original.  I have a light beard and the new foil still struggles to get everything.  I routinely have to use the trimmer to grab a couple of stragglers (even in easy spots like the middle of my cheek) and then go back with the foil to get a nice clean look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, considering BRAUN has dropped the ball by not offering a decent affordable replacement, its hard to complain... heck I was going to give this a 4 but I just changed my mind :)  Its cheap and does the job!  Braun just got demoted to 3 and i&#x27;ll be looking at other electric razors that continue to provide replacement parts for their products!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the foil that came on the razor. It had gotten holes in to over time. We figured that we may as well replace the blade too since we had a new one. Well, we had to put the old blade back on cuz this new one is crappo. We still use the foil, but even that takes down the effectiveness of the razor, even if it doesn&#x27;t scratch my face like the broken one did. It&#x27;s not worth the money. Spend twice as much and get it from Braun.</li>
            <li> very good as i thought it would be</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for the Braun foil.  The pattern of the holes is NOT the same as the original foil.  The original foil had round holes, this has more of a crisscross pattern, and I don&#x27;t think it catches the hair as well as the other.  The price was more acceptable though, which is why I gave it a 4 star.  It was decent for the price.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it takes considerably longer to shave satisfactorily using a recently purchased ersatz foil for my Braun 1000 Series shaver than with the original genuine Braun foil.  To investigate, I placed both foils and a ruler on my scanner and scanned a picture to provide comparable enlarged views of them.  I found that the genuine Braun Series 1000 shaver foil has elongated circular holes measuring about 0.7 mm by 0.3 mm arranged in parallel lines, whereas the ersatz version has confused-looking array of circular clusters of irregularly shaped holes that are less than half as big as those on the genuine product.  Consequently, when shaving with the knockoff version, I have to pass the shaver over my face considerably more times to coax the whiskers into those smaller holes, thus increasing the amount of time required for a satisfactory shave.  If my whiskers were much thicker, shaving would be impossible.  Nevertheless, I have to do a touchup with a safety razor to catch the whiskers that eluded the electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, my face suffers less abrasion than with the genuine Braun foil. Also, I was pleasantly surprised that the purchase included a replacement cutter head that the Amazon description did not include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If I could figure out how to do so, I would include the picture along with this written description.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works with no issues.  Replacement foil vital instead of getting a whole new shaver unit...</li>
            <li> The original foil with the razor lasted a little over 18 months, the next one lasted about 12 months, this foil did not last a month, and that ends my experiment with Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WORKS GREAT, DELIVERY WENT WELL, NO ISSUES, I WISH I HAD MORE TO SAY BUT THERE IS LITTLE MORE THAT I CAN SHARE AT THIS TIME</li>
            <li> This replacement foil saved me from having to replace my razor. It looked a bit different than the original but fits fine and works just as well, months since purchasing.</li>
            <li> This aftermarket foil is cheap for a reason....the quality is cheap! I used it twice when the foil wore through.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I have ever seen for the replacement foil for a Braun shaver.  I bought 2 I liked it so much!</li>
            <li> Fits exactly.  Now the shaver works &amp;#34;as new&amp;#34; again.  Packaging was satisfactory and protected the part in transit.</li>
            <li> This file works great at a reasonable price!  I will order another one in the future when I need it.</li>
            <li> Do not attempt to remove the foil and use it in the original support head. Use it as it comes in the supplied head.&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake and replaced just the foil portion, and the foil came out and I cut my chin when shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement shaver foil and cutter for my Braun 1000 series shaver. It was a non Braun product and therefore cost a third of the Braun price. The product fits the shaver perfectly. The new foil has a different pattern though. The cutter works like the original one. Also the shipping was free. A great product and an even better deal.</li>
            <li> This came with the foil and cutter block. The holes are indeed a different shape but that makes no difference. At first they are smaller than the original equipment unit from Braun. In just a couple of weeks to a month they open up a bit and work exactly the same as the Braun unit. I&#x27;ve been using it for about eight months and it is still doing fine.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Update. Not long after writing the review the foil disconnected from the plastic that holds it. This condition made it useless. At first I noticed that the foil was just loose at one end where the first plastic mounting point broke. It has four on each side. A week or so later the whole side came loose. I had to use a regular razor for a while until my replacement foil arrived. If you notice your foil getting a little loose then order a replacement right away because the one you have is about to break. I still feel this is a good replacement product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a Braun foil and block to replace this one and after four months it is already dull. This non-Braun foil remained sharp longer. I suppose we just have to take our chances with whichever brand we choose to replace our foil and cutting block.</li>
            <li> The mesh is somewhat finer than that on the original head and takes a bit of getting used to. But, overall, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> works, but not as well as the original</li>
            <li> This replacement component works as well or better than the original. Have had it only two weeks but feel confident with its engineering and performance this far.</li>
            <li> The replacement blade didn&#x27;t fit my 1775, the bottom was different and wouldn&#x27;t snap on. The foil screen however fit perfectly, and as far as I can tell is of same or better quality than the OEM. It appears to effectively work as well as the OEM did. For the money, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> product exceeded my expectation, all I was expecting was a foil but they also provided a new cutter block for the same price</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have had issues with finding decent replacements.  This one pretty much work like all the other replacements I have gotten.  It usually takes about 4-5 times across the same areas to get the hairs fully cut.  And then I usually supplement my shaving with a regular razor to catch any stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, these days I just look for a decent price which these delivered on and assume all replacements are about the same quality.</li>
            <li> It keeps coming off  from the razor</li>
            <li> came as promised and as expected.</li>
            <li> Rarely is an aftermarket product superior to the OEM product, but this is. The change in the screen design greatly improves the number of times you have to back and forth before you are acceptably trimmed.</li>
            <li> was shopping for genuine replacement parts for my Braun shaver and found this aftermarket product on Amazon. It fits perfectly but it feels like the shaves take about twice as long as with the original parts I used to get from Braun. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
