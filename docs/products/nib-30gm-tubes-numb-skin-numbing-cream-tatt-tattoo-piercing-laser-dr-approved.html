            <li>This stuff works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>But I am so happy, anytime I need anything numbed ever again, I&#x27;m getting this stuff.</li>
            <li>&quot; I love it!!</li>
            <li>So this is seriously amazing!</li>
            <li>It is PERFECT to use before a trip to the Botox office :-)</li>
            <li>It might work great for peircings and waxing since it&#x27;s so quick but not tattoos!!!</li>
            <li>it work good and the price is good</li>
            <li>It is the strangest feeling in the world to not be able to feel!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>That stuff is amazing :0)</li>
            <li>for longevity, the session lasted 3 hours and the cream was effective for 2 to 2.5 of them.</li>
            <li>that rivals the pain of childbirth, as this did, I can vouch for the cream.ed from &amp;#34;searingly excruciating&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;normal tattoo pain&amp;#34;, which I was thrilled to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for longevity, the session lasted 3 hours and the cream was effective for 2 to 2.5 of them.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has problems sitting through tattoos, this creme helped quite a lot to be honest.  </li>
            <li>The customers love it and could not believe how good it works</li>
            <li>Artist was very impressed, and I didn&#x27;t even flinch when he tattooed my collar bone, shoulder bone (I am very lean) and arm pit area.</li>
            <li>but it really numbs good!!</li>
            <li>I covered the area in saran wrap and used masking tape to hold it in place, though honestly I think the creams adhere the saran wrap to the skin better than the tape.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I will say honestly it worked for me,  </li>
            <li>I had already sat through 20 hours of my very detailed tattoo and wanted a way to have longer sessions.</li>
            <li>and I have never been able to finish it.  </li>
            <li>so I stopped, I&#x27;m all healed now and I&#x27;m ordering more</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>I will say it worked ok on my under-arms.  </li>
            <li>I ended up getting more relief with Hurricaine Spray.  </li>
            <li>Works just ok.</li>
            <li>very unsatisfied I was not at all happy its like</li>
            <li>I sure wish I could get that over the counter,</li>
            <li>that stuff was awesome and about the same price as this (or rather,</li>
            <li>but it did take the edge off for sure.  </li>
            <li>THAT WERE MORE THAN BUGSPRAY.</li>
            <li>This stuff was way better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that and thought ok</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>The shipping was okay hence the reason for one star.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>So glad I invested in this</li>
            <li>so I thought I would get it just to be safe.</li>
            <li>He used it more then one time</li>
            <li>would use it again for more tattoos</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>i have a lot of tattoos and even more after i bought this cream.</li>
            <li>and we were able to stitch it up without difficulty.</li>
            <li>At first I was delighted as I felt nothing.</li>
            <li>So after a 2 hour tattoo (the koi fish I&#x27;m doing is huge and very detailed)</li>
            <li>one tube was good for four sittings on one large rib tattoo...</li>
            <li>Had used another brand before that worked fine</li>
            <li>It only numbed the top of foot too, which is the best part, so I can drive and walk normally.</li>
            <li>I was getting a tattoo, and I was not looking for pain free</li>
            <li>where more than 4 hours of work at a time aka they are very large, all of which I sat though without a problem.  </li>
            <li>we apply it 2 full hours before I start working on her</li>
            <li>This sure feels like it&#x27;s not doing much.  </li>
            <li>Works wonders on full brazilian laser treatment.</li>
            <li>Its not bad at all</li>
            <li>It really works fast and effectively.</li>
            <li>Well if your looking for 100% pain free, don&#x27;t get a tattoo in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Now, if this was a normal person using it, I doubt they would be able to feel it at all.</li>
            <li>Works good as long as you fallow the directions.</li>
            <li>And I can safely say for the first 2 I didn&#x27;t feel much anything.</li>
            <li>lol, then I took it and scraped it pretty deep on the numbed area, and I felt absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I have had warts removed at my dermatologist before and this stuff numbs exactly like it!</li>
            <li>but this stuff did not numb even the surface in any detectable way.</li>
            <li>In the areas (such as right under the breast where the majority of the color to cover was), the pain was downgraded from &amp;#34;searingly excruciating&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;normal tattoo pain&amp;#34;, which I was thrilled to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she was sleeping right through it</li>
            <li>I will have to undergo many more hours for it to be fixed and even then it won&#x27;t be the same.</li>
            <li>, it came very fast, about two days.</li>
            <li>To have as much pain as I did the first two sessions and to now feel nothing i was in SHOCK!</li>
            <li>I applied more, I left it on for two hours  ...</li>
            <li>However I have not used the derma roller since the first time.</li>
            <li>I did just use this on my most recent tattoos.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this cream a try for my most recent tattoo.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I went in for the first session</li>
            <li>After that session the guy said I only needed one more</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel ANYTHING for the first 3.5 hours of the tattoo.</li>
            <li>on for 2 hours, wiped off, applied one more generous layer, wrapped it, and left on for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The best part is this little tube goes a long way!</li>
            <li>so I got it done after I applied this cream first.  </li>
            <li>I got a pretty large koi fish on my thigh and felt every bit of it.</li>
            <li>I am 100% okay with normal levels of tattoo pain--but this was above and beyond.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DIDNT WORK  </li>
            <li>Worked but wore off too fast</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage...</li>
            <li>It defiantly took the edge off the tattooing process, but not as much as i had anticipated.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works ..</li>
            <li>I had a tattoo piece done on my stomach because I wanted to cover a tummy tuck scar that was across my whole lower tummy.</li>
            <li>then I covered the whole thing with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>But for me this worked better then I expected.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my laser hair removal treatments and it numbs the area very well.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well for him.</li>
            <li>(unless it is a very un-sensitive area, I doubt it would have ever been pain free) because I had a limited time frame, and part was very close to my arm pit (</li>
            <li>I will admit that I am not sure if the cream was applied in a time frame before the tattoo was done to be effective.</li>
            <li>The last of the tattoo, I felt some pain but definitely not as bad</li>
            <li>Not bad at all however after it wears off after you wipe the cream off and last about 15 - 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Certain spots can be very sensitive</li>
            <li>So a few days later I decided to try a lot gobbed onto the top of my right foot and wrapped it for exactly 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that mainly the cream took the edge off and there where some parts of the tattoo</li>
            <li>I have a high pain tolerance</li>
            <li>wait 30 min, then put a little more on, recover with plastic wrap.  </li>
            <li>Yup, when they sent it to me, it was going to expire in three months, as opposed to two years if they had sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>can say that the cream(s) actually helped a lot, more than I expected.</li>
            <li>no more screaming :-)</li>
            <li>I am getting my first tattoo on my foot this friday, and it&#x27;s going to be big, shaded and colored</li>
            <li>I also purchased some Lanacane from the local drugstore--it&#x27;s a 20% benzocaine solution, the two primary ingredients in EMLA, the most common prescription strength topical anesthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most things don&#x27;t work, so I was a little leery that it would actually work.</li>
            <li>I put the product on and wrapped myself in clear wrap.</li>
            <li>wow it doesn&#x27;t even work (because I could feel me wiping)  </li>
            <li>far as tattoo culture goes: tattoos hurt.</li>
            <li>far as tattoo culture goes: tattoos hurt.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect deep tissue numbing</li>
            <li>wow .. Told me the name</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I used based off different research that worked also for me:&lt;br /&gt;Applied a generous layer rubbing in really well like hand</li>
            <li>It doesnt take the pain away completely but it does take some away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading a bunch of reviews, I finally purchased this product, though I think any 5% lidocaine solution without other additives would be fine.</li>
            <li>My 11th tattoo was a very large (roughly 12 x 6) cover-up piece on my ribs, to be completed in 3 sessions.</li>
            <li>The first session (outlining) went fine, but the second session (color) was excruciating to the point where I could only take about an hour and a half before I had to call it, and we were only maybe 1/3 of the way through the color and shading.</li>
            <li>You would still feel something, but definitely nothing compared to a burning  the skin sensation you normally feel when not numbing the area</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and did exactly what other customers had mentioned.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and to see if it worked, I put it on one leg and not the other.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be delicate and light</li>
            <li>At the end, the whole thing was agony, but as anyone with tattoo experience knows, the endorphins only last so long</li>
            <li>At the end, the whole thing was agony, but as anyone with tattoo experience knows, the endorphins only last so long</li>
            <li>Healing nicely, no after issues, and the artist had no issues since it wiped off clean, and you couldn&#x27;t even tell it was there by the time he was putting the stencils</li>
            <li>Maybe for a small piece but not for large tattoos!</li>
            <li>Make sure you do use a very thick layer, rub it in well, then apply another thick layer, and make sure you cover the area with saran wrap for at least 45 minutes.</li>

            <li> (unless it is a very un-sensitive area, I doubt it would have ever been pain free) because I had a limited time frame, and part was very close to my arm pit (</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am not sure if the cream was applied in a time frame before the tattoo was done to be effective.</li>
            <li> The last of the tattoo, I felt some pain but definitely not as bad</li>
            <li> Not bad at all however after it wears off after you wipe the cream off and last about 15 - 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Certain spots can be very sensitive</li>
            <li> So a few days later I decided to try a lot gobbed onto the top of my right foot and wrapped it for exactly 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that mainly the cream took the edge off and there where some parts of the tattoo</li>
            <li> I have a high pain tolerance</li>
            <li> wait 30 min, then put a little more on, recover with plastic wrap.  </li>
            <li> Yup, when they sent it to me, it was going to expire in three months, as opposed to two years if they had sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> can say that the cream(s) actually helped a lot, more than I expected.</li>
            <li> no more screaming :-)</li>
            <li> I am getting my first tattoo on my foot this friday, and it&#x27;s going to be big, shaded and colored</li>
            <li> I also purchased some Lanacane from the local drugstore--it&#x27;s a 20% benzocaine solution, the two primary ingredients in EMLA, the most common prescription strength topical anesthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most things don&#x27;t work, so I was a little leery that it would actually work.</li>
            <li> I put the product on and wrapped myself in clear wrap.</li>
            <li> wow it doesn&#x27;t even work (because I could feel me wiping)  </li>
            <li> far as tattoo culture goes: tattoos hurt.</li>
            <li> far as tattoo culture goes: tattoos hurt.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect deep tissue numbing</li>
            <li> wow .. Told me the name</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I used based off different research that worked also for me:&lt;br /&gt;Applied a generous layer rubbing in really well like hand</li>
            <li> It doesnt take the pain away completely but it does take some away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading a bunch of reviews, I finally purchased this product, though I think any 5% lidocaine solution without other additives would be fine.</li>
            <li> My 11th tattoo was a very large (roughly 12 x 6) cover-up piece on my ribs, to be completed in 3 sessions.</li>
            <li> The first session (outlining) went fine, but the second session (color) was excruciating to the point where I could only take about an hour and a half before I had to call it, and we were only maybe 1/3 of the way through the color and shading.</li>
            <li> You would still feel something, but definitely nothing compared to a burning  the skin sensation you normally feel when not numbing the area</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and did exactly what other customers had mentioned.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and to see if it worked, I put it on one leg and not the other.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be delicate and light</li>
            <li> At the end, the whole thing was agony, but as anyone with tattoo experience knows, the endorphins only last so long</li>
            <li> At the end, the whole thing was agony, but as anyone with tattoo experience knows, the endorphins only last so long</li>
            <li> Healing nicely, no after issues, and the artist had no issues since it wiped off clean, and you couldn&#x27;t even tell it was there by the time he was putting the stencils</li>
            <li> Maybe for a small piece but not for large tattoos!</li>
            <li> Make sure you do use a very thick layer, rub it in well, then apply another thick layer, and make sure you cover the area with saran wrap for at least 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, there is NOTHING that will take away the pain of initial use of an epilator, especially in highly sensitive (bikini) areas.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use a quarter of the tube and within 45 minutes I could tell it was numb, but waited the full 2 hours to really test it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when there was a small amount that had not yet soaked in, I rubbed it in gently.</li>
            <li> a second much more thick layer (milky white, but still translucent)&lt;br /&gt;Wrapped tightly with plastic wrap twice, and a little tape so it would not slip around&lt;br /&gt;left</li>
            <li> and it took him an hour and a half to complete.</li>
            <li> I am a tattoo artist and I have always found it extremely difficult to tattoo myself because I cannot put the pain on myself although I&#x27;m fine when someone else does it.  </li>
            <li> Requires a long amount of time to work.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but I think although well intentioned it is not very effective!</li>
            <li> I have a very strange body when it comes to numbing.</li>
            <li> Also if you have really dry skin and apply any lotion you are risking your tattoo quality.  </li>
            <li> It really seemed to make pain worse.</li>
            <li> I was really not impresses with this item.</li>
            <li> but suddenly I was shaking uncontrollably, screaming and crying.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin (poor skin condition), low quality ink, or an inexperienced artist that goes too deep</li>
            <li> Having gotten multiple tattoos in the past without any type of numbing cream, I would suggest saving your money and just manning up if you&#x27;re getting a tatoo.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works, will follow up later.  </li>
            <li> It did then numb completely with no feeling for about 1 1/2 hours of tattooing (one entire tatoo) and took the edge off the second one.  </li>
            <li> I PURCHASED OTHER SO-CALLED NUMBING CREAMS AND SPRAYS</li>
            <li> I removed the cream carefully with baby wipes before my tattoo and dried the area.</li>
            <li> About an hour and a half later, I applied another thick layer then re-covered with the saran wrap.</li>
            <li> In all I have had 7 previous tattoos, including some which</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t use this unless you want to feel twice the pain and have a blurred mess for your body art.</li>
            <li> I put a lot on, rubbed it in a little, put another nickel size and wrapped it tightly in saran wrap.</li>
            <li> After some searching, I assured myself that a lidocaine solution was unlikely to interfere with the tattoo process except for some potential minor swelling that I planned to combat with prophylactic use of anti-inflammatories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s make ur skin numb and ready for</li>
            <li> probably would have been numb the whole session, but I took about 45 minutes of re-positioning the stencil.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would last up to 3 hours, if he tattoed in one place then the next, it was always numb where he hadn&#x27;t touched yet.</li>
            <li> Iv gotten a lot of tattoos in 6 mos and its thanks to dr numb</li>
            <li> This product is a sham and should be barred from selling</li>
            <li> I have used this quite a few times.  </li>
            <li> I have quite a few tattoos and sort of use to the pain.</li>
            <li> This worked for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> now I have heavy blurred lines.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to take the edge off or in my case numb the pain completely you need to purchase this!!!</li>
            <li> For what I paid for this stuff, it should have worked even a little!</li>
            <li> I had sat through 20 brutal hours without moving or making a sound</li>
            <li> ..was expecting a little bit at least but nothing.</li>
            <li> so it hurt really bad, but mine was very gradual.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t tolerate that small amount of pain, you don&#x27;t need a tattoo.</li>
            <li> and I stayed numb for the rest of the night as far as I could tell.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my laser hair removal treatments that I&#x27;ve been getting done for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> Just slowly started feeling burning and the usual feeling of the needles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would bother with this cream for future tattoos in less unbearably painful areas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would bother with this cream for future tattoos in less unbearably painful areas.</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way that the cream won&#x27;t work if your skin is irritated and swollen.</li>
            <li> DO you know how hard it is to keep an artist waiting for 45 minutes?</li>
            <li> and it was numb for at least 2 hours after my tattoos where done (about 5 hours total).  </li>
            <li> It works, it does numb the area enough for a tatoo removal session.</li>
            <li> It ruined the delicate work that my artist had done.</li>
            <li> Have to use a lot of the product leave it on thick of at least 1 hour before you have to leave the house.</li>
            <li> I applied a thick layer</li>
            <li> and the ribs are a very painful area to have tattooed in the first</li>
            <li> and the ribs are a very painful area to have tattooed in the first</li>
            <li> So I looked into numbing creams, and decided to try this one, since the price isn&#x27;t ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It made all the ink that had been done already bleed into the skin around it making it a big ugly blur.</li>
            <li> No matter how thickly I applied the product or how long I let is sit in contact with my skin, epilation was just as painful in the bikini area as well as on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I am tired of hearing him complain when he is getting a tattoo</li>
            <li> Because of the scar tissue it was the worse pain ever</li>
            <li> Poor performance and quality.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to make it less painful.</li>
            <li> And just by the way, I am typically hard to numb.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a thing on the very painful area of my inner arm.</li>
            <li> after 2 hours I was getting some stinging, and nerve twitches, but unlike some people it was not more painful than before adding cream would have been.</li>
            <li> At this point, I was still skeptical, but hopeful!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did numb my leg</li>
            <li> It stayed numb all day and night even after getting the tattoo and after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t numb at all ...</li>
            <li> In no way, shape, or form, did this cream numb the skin.</li>
            <li> does not work to even remotely numb any skin anywhere; bought this to take hiking in case of feet blisters</li>
            <li> failed to work!</li>
            <li> I will admit I was VERY skeptical.</li>
            <li> but it was horribly painful.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S USELESS!!!</li>
            <li> But the worst part?</li>
            <li> The worst part is that it is a portrait of my daughter as a fairy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> IT REALLY DIDNT WORK  AS WELL AS IT SAID IT WOULD NEED SOMTHING STRONGER SOMETHING FASTER THEN SITTING 45 MIN</li>
            <li> Had a 4 hour back piece finished. And I can safely say for the first 2 I didn&#x27;t feel much anything. But it is topical so after enough grinding of course your going to feel it.</li>
            <li> failed to work! I bought this for my boyfriend becuase I am tired of hearing him complain when he is getting a tattoo but this worked for maybe 10 minutes then stopped all together.</li>
            <li> I am a tattoo artist and I have always found it extremely difficult to tattoo myself because I cannot put the pain on myself although I&#x27;m fine when someone else does it.  I have been wanting to do my thigh for the longest time and I have never been able to finish it.  Someone told me about tattoo numbing cream and I looked it up on amazon and found this I read some reviews and got it, it came very fast, about two days. I put the cream on my thigh (a lot) and wrapped it in plastic wrap, about an hour later I applied more, I left it on for two hours  ...I ended up using the entire tube.  Well any way I finally wiped it off and I&#x27;m like wow it doesn&#x27;t even work (because I could feel me wiping)  I figured I would still try and tattoo it anyway and I felt like I was doing someone else&#x27;s tattoo I did it with NO PROBLEM!!! I called a friend over and was like \\&quot;Look!!! I cant feel a thing!!\\&quot; I love it!! So after a 2 hour tattoo (the koi fish I&#x27;m doing is huge and very detailed) I started to feel it after 2 hours so I stopped, I&#x27;m all healed now and I&#x27;m ordering more so I can finish the rest!!!!! I LOVE THIS STUFF, I plan on ordering a case if possible for my clients!!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend did not work for me. Applied when the instructions said but didn&#x27;t feel like it was even on my skin. Seller was prompt with shipment.</li>
            <li> Follow directions and you won&#x27;t feel a thing! Excellent when used as described, will buy again! Product works as described.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but I think although well intentioned it is not very effective! Maybe for a small piece but not for large tattoos! directions where followed to the T!</li>
            <li> WILL NEVER EVER USE AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!! Did not work. It really seemed to make pain worse. Even if they paid me I say don&#x27;t used!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked but wore off too fast</li>
            <li> My 11th tattoo was a very large (roughly 12 x 6) cover-up piece on my ribs, to be completed in 3 sessions. The first session (outlining) went fine, but the second session (color) was excruciating to the point where I could only take about an hour and a half before I had to call it, and we were only maybe 1/3 of the way through the color and shading. As my third and final scheduled session approached, I was overcome with anxiety. I am 100% okay with normal levels of tattoo pain--but this was above and beyond. In desperation, I turned to google! After some searching, I assured myself that a lidocaine solution was unlikely to interfere with the tattoo process except for some potential minor swelling that I planned to combat with prophylactic use of anti-inflammatories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a bunch of reviews, I finally purchased this product, though I think any 5% lidocaine solution without other additives would be fine. I also purchased some Lanacane from the local drugstore--it&#x27;s a 20% benzocaine solution, the two primary ingredients in EMLA, the most common prescription strength topical anesthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three hours before my tattoo I applied a mixture of these two creams to the area that would be tattooed by rubbing them into the skin and then immediately applying a second, thicker layer. I covered the area in saran wrap and used masking tape to hold it in place, though honestly I think the creams adhere the saran wrap to the skin better than the tape. About an hour and a half later, I applied another thick layer then re-covered with the saran wrap. I removed the cream carefully with baby wipes before my tattoo and dried the area. At this point, I was still skeptical, but hopeful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that the cream(s) actually helped a lot, more than I expected. In some areas, I could feel the pressure of the needles, but not the pain of them. In the areas (such as right under the breast where the majority of the color to cover was), the pain was downgraded from &amp;#34;searingly excruciating&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;normal tattoo pain&amp;#34;, which I was thrilled to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for longevity, the session lasted 3 hours and the cream was effective for 2 to 2.5 of them. At the end, the whole thing was agony, but as anyone with tattoo experience knows, the endorphins only last so long and the ribs are a very painful area to have tattooed in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I found the product helpful. However, remember that everyone reacts to chemicals and pain differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as tattoo culture goes: tattoos hurt. There is a lot of rhetoric about &amp;#34;earning&amp;#34; your tattoos, and I don&#x27;t disagree with that. I don&#x27;t know if I would bother with this cream for future tattoos in less unbearably painful areas. And remember, tattoos hurt! They hurt when you get them, then they hurt afterwards for several days, and then they hurt again when you get them touched up. It&#x27;s part of imprinting yourself with art. If, however, you are getting yourself imprinted with art somewhere that rivals the pain of childbirth, as this did, I can vouch for the cream.ed from &amp;#34;searingly excruciating&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;normal tattoo pain&amp;#34;, which I was thrilled to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for longevity, the session lasted 3 hours and the cream was effective for 2 to 2.5 of them.

            <li> it work good and the price is good</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, there is NOTHING that will take away the pain of initial use of an epilator, especially in highly sensitive (bikini) areas.  No matter how thickly I applied the product or how long I let is sit in contact with my skin, epilation was just as painful in the bikini area as well as on my legs.  I will say it worked ok on my under-arms.  I ended up getting more relief with Hurricaine Spray.  Having gotten multiple tattoos in the past without any type of numbing cream, I would suggest saving your money and just manning up if you&#x27;re getting a tatoo.  If you can&#x27;t tolerate that small amount of pain, you don&#x27;t need a tattoo.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has problems sitting through tattoos, this creme helped quite a lot to be honest.  we apply it 2 full hours before I start working on her and it lasts about 30 minutes before she starts squirming.</li>
            <li> Works just ok. Have to use a lot of the product leave it on thick of at least 1 hour before you have to leave the house. The cheaper stuff with 5% works just as well.</li>
            <li> Did not work.. very unsatisfied I was not at all happy its like I didnt use anything....would not recommend do not buy</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any lidocaine in this cream, I&#x27;ll kiss your backside for 20 minutes or until we draw a crowd. This product is a sham and should be barred from selling</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works, will follow up later.  I bought it for the derma roller.  However I have not used the derma roller since the first time.</li>
            <li> Followed directions to the letter. I didn&#x27;t really expect deep tissue numbing but this stuff did not numb even the surface in any detectable way. Absolute garbage...</li>
            <li> It defiantly took the edge off the tattooing process, but not as much as i had anticipated.  one tube was good for four sittings on one large rib tattoo...</li>
            <li> This sure feels like it&#x27;s not doing much.  I put it on, use plastic wrap to cover it, wait 30 min, then put a little more on, recover with plastic wrap.  In the end, it&#x27;s about an hour from the initial application until doing laser hair removal.  OUCH!  I think I&#x27;m going back to the prescription instead, which has 3 different numbing medicines in it.  I sure wish I could get that over the counter, that stuff was awesome and about the same price as this (or rather, my co-pay was about the same).</li>
            <li> This stuff really works .. I saw a ladie getting her ribs tattoo and she was sleeping right through it thats a wow .. Told me the name and I got it for me and my Daughter</li>
            <li> I got this for my second tattoo and I practiced on the area the day before I got my tat, it worked great! I found out the hard way that the cream won&#x27;t work if your skin is irritated and swollen. Also I kept it unwrapped for an hour and when there was a small amount that had not yet soaked in, I rubbed it in gently. Works great!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this quite a few times.  It is PERFECT to use before a trip to the Botox office :-) It also makes life easier for your kids when you have to remove something like a splinter... no more screaming :-)</li>
            <li> Worked great! Didn&#x27;t feel any pain during my tattoo session on my ribs</li>
            <li> Yup, when they sent it to me, it was going to expire in three months, as opposed to two years if they had sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> Well if your looking for 100% pain free, don&#x27;t get a tattoo in the first place.  I did just use this on my most recent tattoos.  In all I have had 7 previous tattoos, including some which where more than 4 hours of work at a time aka they are very large, all of which I sat though without a problem.  I decided to give this cream a try for my most recent tattoo.  I applied as directed to my entire lower leg and wrapped it in plastic wrap then an ace bandage for about an hour.  It did numb my leg and it was numb for at least 2 hours after my tattoos where done (about 5 hours total).  I had a butterfly to my ankle and one to the back of my leg.  I do have to say that mainly the cream took the edge off and there where some parts of the tattoo I didn&#x27;t feel at all.  This is not a mircle cream that will take away all the feeling of getting a tattoo but it did take the edge off for sure.  I will be using it again when I get my next two butterflies done this week.  I did not have any color bleeding.  I believe the quality of the tattoo ink, size, depth, skin condition, type of needle/gun, as well as experience of the artist are all indicate if your work will bleed.  If you have very dry skin (poor skin condition), low quality ink, or an inexperienced artist that goes too deep you will have a lot of color bleeding.  Also if you have really dry skin and apply any lotion you are risking your tattoo quality.  I did not have any ink bleeding and did use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/2013 For my next two tattoos I also used this, I applied two hours prior and again one hour prior.  It did then numb completely with no feeling for about 1 1/2 hours of tattooing (one entire tatoo) and took the edge off the second one.  No after pain and I stayed numb for the rest of the night as far as I could tell.  Will be using again!  This time I&#x27;m going to do 2-3 hours of prenumbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/2013 Update!!!  For my last tattoo I applied 3 hours prior, then applied once an hour, up until my appointment.  Guess what?  Did not feel a thing!  I wrapped in plastic wrap after each application and wiped the remaining in about 15 minutes prior to getting tattooed.  My last tattoo was to the back of my calf and it was sort of wierd to hear the tattoo gun but not feel anything.  Just ordered another tube for my next tattoo.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS! I PURCHASED OTHER SO-CALLED NUMBING CREAMS AND SPRAYS THAT WERE MORE THAN BUGSPRAY. I FOLLOWED DIRECTIONS ACCORDING TO THE BOX AND 30 MINUES LATER COULD NOT FEEL A THING! NOT ANYTHING ON THE AREA THAT I PREPPED. THE TUBE HAS A HOLE AT THE BOTTOM SEAM BUT THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE CHANGED IT&#x27;S EFFECTIVENESS. I JUST HOPE IT DOES NOT LATER ON. BUT IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> It works, it does numb the area enough for a tatoo removal session. You would still feel something, but definitely nothing compared to a burning  the skin sensation you normally feel when not numbing the area</li>
            <li> So I took this to be used on my tattoo, I followed the directions and left in on for 45 minutes.... DO you know how hard it is to keep an artist waiting for 45 minutes? So He starts to tattoo and I have to tell him to stop because the product did NOT work, I sat there balling like a baby because it hurt so bad!&lt;br /&gt;THIS DIDN&#x27;T help at ALL IT&#x27;S USELESS!!!</li>
            <li> It stayed numb all day and night even after getting the tattoo and after taking a shower. It&#x27;s make ur skin numb and ready for u 2 not feel the pain.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I bought it for my laser hair removal treatments that I&#x27;ve been getting done for the past 2 years. This stuff was way better than what I was using before. Just follow the instructions and use the plastic wrap. Works wonders on full brazilian laser treatment.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on anything! But I have to comment on this. I had a tattoo piece done on my stomach because I wanted to cover a tummy tuck scar that was across my whole lower tummy. I went in for the first session and I lasted about 3 hours but it was horribly painful. I kept putting off the second part but finally went ahead and did it and I didnt think I was gonna make it through. Because of the scar tissue it was the worse pain ever but I thought hey get through this and your scar will be gone. After that session the guy said I only needed one more he advised me to look into numbing cream. I wanted to slap the hell out of him! Could he had said something sooner???... So I took to amazon and found this. I will admit I was VERY skeptical. I read the reviews and did exactly what other customers had mentioned. I applied a thick layer then about 5 mins later I applied a second layer then I covered the whole thing with plastic wrap. I kept it on for almost 3 hours. When I got to my appointment he removed the plastic and wiped the cream off. I didn&#x27;t feel that and thought ok but a needle is something different. I was talking to another artist and to my suprise the tattoo artist started and I didnt even realize it. I FELT NOTHING!! I was amazed and relieved. To have as much pain as I did the first two sessions and to now feel nothing i was in SHOCK! And so was the artist. Everybody is different. But for me this worked better then I expected. The numbing didnt wear off til a couple hours after he was finished and it took him an hour and a half to complete. If you are looking for something to take the edge off or in my case numb the pain completely you need to purchase this!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t numb at all ...did it as instructed ..nothing..very dissatisfied. ..was expecting a little bit at least but nothing. ..terrible</li>
            <li> Did not work as claimed, followed instructions, Had used another brand before that worked fine but this producted did not work as claimed.</li>
            <li> Works good as long as you fallow the directions. I will be ordering more. The customers love it and could not believe how good it works</li>
            <li> This item does not work AT ALL! OMG. I got a pretty large koi fish on my thigh and felt every bit of it. I have quite a few tattoos and sort of use to the pain. However I wanted to try something to take the edge off. I was mistaken. Do not waste your money on this product. The shipping was okay hence the reason for one star. The one star is definitely not for the product.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I used this for my neck piece (side of neck) I applied about 90 minutes before the tattoo and I didn&#x27;t feel ANYTHING for the first 3.5 hours of the tattoo. The last of the tattoo, I felt some pain but definitely not as bad and it was definitely tolerable.</li>
            <li> I was getting a tattoo, and I was not looking for pain free (unless it is a very un-sensitive area, I doubt it would have ever been pain free) because I had a limited time frame, and part was very close to my arm pit (SO sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;It worked awesome!! Artist was very impressed, and I didn&#x27;t even flinch when he tattooed my collar bone, shoulder bone (I am very lean) and arm pit area. after 2 hours I was getting some stinging, and nerve twitches, but unlike some people it was not more painful than before adding cream would have been. Just slowly started feeling burning and the usual feeling of the needles. Not everyone is the same, and some people have talked about it wearing off instantly so it hurt really bad, but mine was very gradual. I did like the fact I could still feel pressure, not like Novicaine shots where you cant feel a darn thing, and almost feel swollen.  Healing nicely, no after issues, and the artist had no issues since it wiped off clean, and you couldn&#x27;t even tell it was there by the time he was putting the stencils on.&lt;br /&gt;I probably would have been numb the whole session, but I took about 45 minutes of re-positioning the stencil. :)&lt;br /&gt;How I used based off different research that worked also for me:&lt;br /&gt;Applied a generous layer rubbing in really well like hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Applied a second much more thick layer (milky white, but still translucent)&lt;br /&gt;Wrapped tightly with plastic wrap twice, and a little tape so it would not slip around&lt;br /&gt;left on for 2 hours, wiped off, applied one more generous layer, wrapped it, and left on for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 15 minutes to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; off my skin, so it wouldn&#x27;t interfere with the artist doing his thing.&lt;br /&gt;Wipes off skin well, with no residue.</li>
            <li> In no way, shape, or form, did this cream numb the skin. I was really not impresses with this item.</li>
            <li> does not work to even remotely numb any skin anywhere; bought this to take hiking in case of feet blisters</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;numbing\\&quot; cream didn&#x27;t do what it was meant to do. All it did was make the spot tingly. I followed all the instructions and have it extra time for it to numb, and it didn&#x27;t work as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> This worked for a few minutes. I didn&#x27;t feel a thing on the very painful area of my inner arm. I had already sat through 20 hours of my very detailed tattoo and wanted a way to have longer sessions. At first I was delighted as I felt nothing. Then the pain started. It magnified the pain! I had sat through 20 brutal hours without moving or making a sound but suddenly I was shaking uncontrollably, screaming and crying. But the worst part? It messed up my tattoo! We had put the cream over work that had been done the day before. It made all the ink that had been done already bleed into the skin around it making it a big ugly blur. It ruined the delicate work that my artist had done. The worst part is that it is a portrait of my daughter as a fairy. It is supposed to be delicate and light now I have heavy blurred lines. I will have to undergo many more hours for it to be fixed and even then it won&#x27;t be the same. So don&#x27;t use this unless you want to feel twice the pain and have a blurred mess for your body art. It might work great for peircings and waxing since it&#x27;s so quick but not tattoos!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my laser hair removal treatments and it numbs the area very well. Couldn&#x27;t feel a thing. The best part is this little tube goes a long way! So glad I invested in this... makes my treatments a breeze!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for laser hair removal. I followed the directions exactly and to see if it worked, I put it on one leg and not the other. I couldn&#x27;t tell a bit of difference. For what I paid for this stuff, it should have worked even a little!</li>
            <li> I bought this to be used with my dermaroller. I have a high pain tolerance but I didn&#x27;t know what I was in for so I thought I would get it just to be safe. I have a very strange body when it comes to numbing. Most things don&#x27;t work, so I was a little leery that it would actually work. I put the product on and wrapped myself in clear wrap. After an hour I headed to my bathroom. Now, as for the numbing I could tell what areas I didn&#x27;t cover immediately when I went over with the roller. It definitely dulled the pain a lot, even though I could still feel it.  Now, if this was a normal person using it, I doubt they would be able to feel it at all. I was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> my husband used it to go get a tattoo and it worked very well for him. He used it more then one time he went.&lt;br /&gt;He never tryed anything else before.&lt;br /&gt;he would use it again for more tattoos</li>
            <li> Poor performance and quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream last week and read reviews and got worried. I am getting my first tattoo on my foot this friday, and it&#x27;s going to be big, shaded and colored and it&#x27;s gonna hurt dearly so I heard. So I looked into numbing creams, and decided to try this one, since the price isn&#x27;t ridiculous. The day I got it I tried it on my big toe for an hour and it didn&#x27;t work. So a few days later I decided to try a lot gobbed onto the top of my right foot and wrapped it for exactly 2 hours. I didn&#x27;t even use a quarter of the tube and within 45 minutes I could tell it was numb, but waited the full 2 hours to really test it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the time was up, I took off the wrap and both socks and took a sewing needle and jabbed my not numbed foot and it hurt like crud lol, then I took it and scraped it pretty deep on the numbed area, and I felt absolutely nothing. Saw it, poked it, and felt nothing at all. I am so freaking relieved, I was so worried it wouldn&#x27;t work and then I&#x27;d be peed off and I would have to endure the actual pain.  To those who say it doesn&#x27;t work, maybe you aren&#x27;t doing it correctly. I put a lot on, rubbed it in a little, put another nickel size and wrapped it tightly in saran wrap. It only numbed the top of foot too, which is the best part, so I can drive and walk normally. I&#x27;m going to poke it every 30 minutes to test the durability. But I am so happy, anytime I need anything numbed ever again, I&#x27;m getting this stuff. I know it&#x27;s cheating, but it&#x27;s my decision, no one else&#x27;s. yay! hope this review helps someone :D</li>
            <li> Not bad at all however after it wears off after you wipe the cream off and last about 15 - 30 minutes.  Its not bad at all I assure you I am a tattoo monster but I was tripping about my foot so I got it done after I applied this cream first.  It doesnt take the pain away completely but it does take some away.</li>
            <li> I had a tattoo party at my home and was told by my quest who all got tattoos that this cream did not work.  I will admit that I am not sure if the cream was applied in a time frame before the tattoo was done to be effective.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would last up to 3 hours, if he tattoed in one place then the next, it was always numb where he hadn&#x27;t touched yet. But if he kept going over the same place it stopped numbing after about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I love this product, I will say honestly it worked for me,  I got a tattoo but on my back, and i had my son put the stuff on me before he went to school, I followed the instructions, and when I went to go get my tat a couple hours later, I couldn&#x27;t feel anything.  The only reason I knew he was tatting me was because I heard the gun.  That stuff is amazing :0)</li>
            <li> Iv gotten a lot of tattoos in 6 mos and its thanks to dr numb it works well and i love it i have a lot of tattoos and even more after i bought this cream.</li>
            <li> Requires a long amount of time to work.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonderfully. My kids smashed their fingers or burned themselves. I put this stuff on it and the pain just goes away. Our goat cut her teat and my husband had to stitch her up. We put this stuff on her and we were able to stitch it up without difficulty. It really works fast and effectively.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I do laser hair removal at home. Certain spots can be very sensitive and I wanted to make it less painful. I bought this product even though it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive, and it wasn&#x27;t the cheapest. If you use it AS DIRECTED, it will work. Make sure you do use a very thick layer, rub it in well, then apply another thick layer, and make sure you cover the area with saran wrap for at least 45 minutes. It made the laser hair removal painless and I wish I had found this product sooner. I definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have had warts removed at my dermatologist before and this stuff numbs exactly like it! It is the strangest feeling in the world to not be able to feel! I don&#x27;t know about tattoos but it really numbs good!! I did not know they made stuff like this OTC. I definitely would recommend this to anyone! And just by the way, I am typically hard to numb. (I had to have 4 shots at the dentist for a root canal because I could still feel.) So this is seriously amazing!</li>
