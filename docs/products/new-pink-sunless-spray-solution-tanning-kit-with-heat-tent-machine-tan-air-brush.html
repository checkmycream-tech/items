            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The set has everything you&#x27;ll need for a successful spray tan session.</li>
            <li>I love the color that comes out &amp; notice that the medium setting works best..</li>
            <li>I was sticky for a good hour or two.</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>Convenient and price is good.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend got me this system for Christmas and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love the machine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>Like it literally needs it&#x27;s own room.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, cost effective, and</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this machine but would say that it works best at the medium pressure.</li>
            <li>medium is great and once you are really good at tanning use high!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>After reading and watching videos about how to apply it became clear that practice was going to make perfect.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s legs looked great right after we sprayed and she waited almost 24 hours before she showered and all of the tan washed off.  </li>
            <li>I freaking love this sunless tanning kit, it&#x27;s amazing and so much better and cheaper than going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is HUGE!</li>
            <li>I love this spray tanning kit as well as the solution that came with it.</li>
            <li>This is way more convenient and I make my husband just spray me in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Well I love the machine</li>
            <li>Love this spray tan machine.</li>
            <li>After the second time, I found the best setting for us</li>
            <li>Overall, a great buy that saves us a ton of money as we get to enjoy great tanning.</li>
            <li>I bought this for home use, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but I am in love already.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and I love the samples of solution that came with it as well.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried out the tent yet because spraying in the shower has proved to be very easy for clean-</li>
            <li>just make sure you always clean your gun after a days use.. if you run out of cleaning solution you can always use alcohol &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Also the heat option is heavenly, takes a minute to warm up but is worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything is really easy to understand</li>
            <li>So far so good &amp; my boyfriend was able to spray me.</li>
            <li>thing I regret to inform is that the mist is not as fine as I would like.</li>
            <li>The tent is huge and nice looking, but I really wish it came with instructions on how to fold it up easily.  </li>
            <li>Its HUGE</li>
            <li>the colors/tanning solution that comes with the set is fantastic as well-</li>
            <li>Works great easy to use, this will save a ton of money in the long run .why</li>
            <li>The machine is very user friendly, the tanning solution is good, and you get exactly what is described on the website.</li>
            <li>I came to realize that with this machine, the high setting was going to be the best setting to spray, although it sounds really loud and fast.  </li>
            <li>Just got this in and was super excited..</li>
            <li>So far I have used this machine one time on my wife&#x27;s legs and it seems to be pretty good considering the price.  </li>
            <li>this machine is very easy to use, easy to move around, and its very low mantinence..</li>
            <li>I have been getting spray tans once a week for a couple years in the salon I worked at and finally decided to buy my own machine to save money.</li>
            <li>Also, more solution (how much you coat the body) does not equal a better, darker tan.  </li>
            <li>The first coat you do looks like a million freckles, but once you do the second coat it blends better!</li>
            <li>Also, it would not let me adjust how powerful the spray was, therefore, the hose attached to the machine was consistently falling out of its hole.</li>
            <li>Everything was easy to assemble but I cannot get the machine to spray consistently and the directions aren&#x27;t clear...</li>
            <li>Came with everything in picture and got here very fast.</li>
            <li>So buying this set has saved me HUNDREDS of dollars when you consider how much solution you get, and the affordability of it!</li>
            <li>The first two sprays we used a paint roller to even out some thicker spots.  </li>
            <li>We are now 5 sprays in and have enough solution for maybe 6 more sprays.  </li>
            <li>Considering a side business ;)</li>
            <li>Love this machine so much, I&#x27;ve had other machines in the past and this one by far is the best!</li>
            <li>I purchased this at the first of this year and have pretty much outgrown my home business of airbrushing at home..</li>
            <li>One thing I am not sure about regarding the solution is that we live in a very warm area, which causes everyone to sweat a lot.  </li>
            <li>If you are having someone spray you the gun at medium pressure should be about 10-12 inches away from your body other than that it&#x27;s easy to use and self-explanatory!</li>
            <li>and I was rudely denied and told to just clean it out!!!</li>
            <li>That does work very well as you do not have to use much solution and it applies very evenly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the Norvell products to use with it because the products that came with it seemed to apply very spotty.</li>
            <li>It does not spray very evenly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this to anyone wanting to get there tan on for much cheaper and unlimited tanning</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than I thought, Youtube videos helped.</li>
            <li>I bought this a while back and was ridiculously excited the get it.</li>
            <li>The high pressure was too intense and sometimes created runny solution.</li>
            <li>I am a full time student and I am hoping this machine will help me bring in some extra money.</li>
            <li>One con to the whole purchase is that the solution bottles were not marked with the percentages, but I easily googled each one and marked it on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Tanning solution doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d prefer but that&#x27;s an easy fix!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting the sticky feet though.</li>
            <li>By about the fifth day on the body, the solution will get splotchy in high sweat areas (i.e. armpits, cleavage, inside elbows).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and its pink!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to say that by buying this machine I am going to save tons in the long run (especially on my college budget).</li>
            <li>and I just stand in the shower because we live in an apartment and that tent that came with</li>
            <li>After we are finished this solution I am interested to see if the Norvell tanning solutions will do the same.  </li>
            <li>and I love that I am at home and can stay naked till I feel dry enough to go on with my day.</li>
            <li>I am a naturally fair woman and usually go for spray tans once a week or every other week.</li>
            <li>WOndering where I can purchase the filters that are under the machine, because in the manual it says to replace them frequently..</li>
            <li>i had no trouble ordering it</li>
            <li>We actually didn&#x27;t realize how much solution comes with the kit, that was a plus.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest if you are going to do two applications within a couple days of each other that your first session start with a lower percentage solution, and the next time you can bump it up to the higher solution.  </li>
            <li>I make minimum wage and was hoping to bring in a little extra cash with this and went out on a whim and spent way more on this than I wanted to but figured I need to be assertive now its in a bag in my closet collecting dust.</li>
            <li>and I found it pretty hard to fold back up, and you really don&#x27;t need it if you&#x27;re going to spray in the shower (which i think is easiest).  </li>
            <li>The machine works very well so far and comes with a cleaning solution which I just have to use a little bit after every application.  </li>
            <li>My only mistake was spray a little too close the first time.</li>
            <li>It is a little splotchy, in certain areas, when it is sprayed on your skin, but just use a paint roller to go over it in those areas.</li>
            <li>Be careful ordering this if you are hoping to use it in the very near future after purchase!</li>

            <li> Be careful ordering this if you are hoping to use it in the very near future after purchase!</li>
            <li> I have taught my fiancee how to spray tan me, and now we do each other&#x27;s spray tan before major events!</li>
            <li> Thanks for robbing me of my hard earned cash.</li>
            <li> I used it one time and it left my guinea pig looking like a giant nasty freckle, the nozzle was like.... not clear or something, no matter how precise I tried to clean it and figure it out.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would make a note of is not to expand that pink thing that comes to stand in</li>
            <li> literally the creases of my arm and on my back chest and neck looked like black dust..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before buying this, I was paying $45 for a SINGLE session of spray tan here in Houston, TX!</li>
            <li> Not as smelly as other spray tans I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> The machine is small enough to tote around to my friends house&#x27;s to give them spray tans as well.</li>
            <li> and i looked like i had little freckles all over</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago..</li>
            <li> It just means you wasted solution.  </li>
            <li> but when I sprayed the solution it came out splotchy and not a fine mist.</li>

            <li> Great investment! I have taught my fiancee how to spray tan me, and now we do each other&#x27;s spray tan before major events! Very easy to use. The set has everything you&#x27;ll need for a successful spray tan session. I have had it for over a year and have not had any problems with it. Works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this, I was paying $45 for a SINGLE session of spray tan here in Houston, TX! So buying this set has saved me HUNDREDS of dollars when you consider how much solution you get, and the affordability of it!</li>
            <li> Works great easy to use, this will save a ton of money in the long run .why pay big money when I  can do at home</li>
            <li> I just did my second spray with this machine and solution that was included. I love the color that comes out &amp; notice that the medium setting works best.. but the solution still comes out blotchy &amp; I&#x27;ve been having to use a foam brush to blend on clients. Any recommendations?</li>
            <li> I love this spray tanning kit as well as the solution that came with it. The only thing that I wish is that the tent was wider.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got me this system for Christmas and I absolutely love it! Very easy to use, cost effective, and the colors/tanning solution that comes with the set is fantastic as well- they leave us looking bronzed instead of orange. I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back and was ridiculously excited the get it. I used it one time and it left my guinea pig looking like a giant nasty freckle, the nozzle was like.... not clear or something, no matter how precise I tried to clean it and figure it out. I attempted to use it another time and the same thing happened. I then decided to try and return it and I was rudely denied and told to just clean it out!!! I make minimum wage and was hoping to bring in a little extra cash with this and went out on a whim and spent way more on this than I wanted to but figured I need to be assertive now its in a bag in my closet collecting dust. Thanks for robbing me of my hard earned cash. Disgraceful.</li>
            <li> Great spray tan machine!  I always used to go to the salon and pay $30 a pop for a spray tan.  This is way more convenient and I make my husband just spray me in the shower.  Everything is really easy to understand and it works perfectly.  Only thing I would make a note of is not to expand that pink thing that comes to stand in so you don&#x27;t get stuff anywhere.  Its HUGE and I found it pretty hard to fold back up, and you really don&#x27;t need it if you&#x27;re going to spray in the shower (which i think is easiest).  The spray tan solution that it comes with also works well.  Not as smelly as other spray tans I&#x27;ve had.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use low setting but medium is great and once you are really good at tanning use high! I love the machine! I also purchased name brand solutions for my customers but I use the products on myself that it came with.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago.. I ended up buying the Norvell products to use with it because the products that came with it seemed to apply very spotty. WOndering where I can purchase the filters that are under the machine, because in the manual it says to replace them frequently..</li>
            <li> This machine is meh. It does not spray very evenly.</li>
            <li> I have been getting spray tans once a week for a couple years in the salon I worked at and finally decided to buy my own machine to save money. I looked at every machine possible and after a month finally decided on this one..and im sooooo happy i did!! It&#x27;s amazing i had no trouble ordering it, it came within a couple of days of ordering it and every thing was there and it works great!! I love everything about it!! It&#x27;s so easy to use and its pink! Oh and the tanning solution is great that came with it..</li>
            <li> Well I love the machine the tanning solution was not that great but the product is great. I will just but a different solution.</li>
            <li> Love this spray tan machine. It&#x27;s been a great product for me. Great price, comes with all the necessities to get your spray tan on.</li>
            <li> I freaking love this sunless tanning kit, it&#x27;s amazing and so much better and cheaper than going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;I have my boyfriend spray me and I love that I am at home and can stay naked till I feel dry enough to go on with my day. I absolutely recommend this to anyone wanting to get there tan on for much cheaper and unlimited tanning, This is a must have</li>
            <li> Just got this in and was super excited.. I had my mom spray me and i looked like i had little freckles all over, she did a second coat and same thing and after we were done i looked dirty... literally the creases of my arm and on my back chest and neck looked like black dust.. I was sticky for a good hour or two. I waited a day and took a shower and all the nasty black came off, not sure if thats normal... but after my shower today it doesnt look too bad. im not sure if its the sprayer or the solution. Im going to order a different solution and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I am a naturally fair woman and usually go for spray tans once a week or every other week. It&#x27;s safe to say that by buying this machine I am going to save tons in the long run (especially on my college budget). The machine is small enough to tote around to my friends house&#x27;s to give them spray tans as well. I haven&#x27;t tried out the tent yet because spraying in the shower has proved to be very easy for clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this machine but would say that it works best at the medium pressure. The high pressure was too intense and sometimes created runny solution. My only mistake was spray a little too close the first time. If you are having someone spray you the gun at medium pressure should be about 10-12 inches away from your body other than that it&#x27;s easy to use and self-explanatory!</li>
            <li> Did not spray properly so we sent it back. Not sure if the problem was the hand spray nozzle or whatever else could have been the problem. We returned the item.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!! Came just like the picture! Love this machine so much, I&#x27;ve had other machines in the past and this one by far is the best!</li>
            <li> The machine is great! I highly recommend getting the sticky feet though. Otherwise, you will be walking around with the bottom of your feel looking filthy for over a week...lol!</li>
            <li> I just tried out the machine and I liked it but when I sprayed the solution it came out splotchy and not a fine mist. I tried to adjust the spray but it still sprayed splotchy on every setting. Any recommendations on how to get it to spray correctly?</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the first of this year and have pretty much outgrown my home business of airbrushing at home.. I now rent a room at a friends salon on the weekends since I work a regular job mon-thurs.. this machine is very easy to use, easy to move around, and its very low mantinence.. just make sure you always clean your gun after a days use.. if you run out of cleaning solution you can always use alcohol &#x3D;) good luck</li>
            <li> This was the worst purchase. The product came in just like shown, but once I set-up the machine, the product had a short in it. When the machine was in the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; position, it would still spray. Also, it would not let me adjust how powerful the spray was, therefore, the hose attached to the machine was consistently falling out of its hole. I will be sending this product back ASAP. Be careful ordering this if you are hoping to use it in the very near future after purchase!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Convenient and price is good. Tanning solution doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d prefer but that&#x27;s an easy fix! The 9.5% will get you practically black!! I just use this machine to tan myself and occasionally my roommate and I just stand in the shower because we live in an apartment and that tent that came with it is HUGE! Like it literally needs it&#x27;s own room. But I ain&#x27;t mad. Also the heat option is heavenly, takes a minute to warm up but is worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I regret to inform is that the mist is not as fine as I would like. The first coat you do looks like a million freckles, but once you do the second coat it blends better!</li>
            <li> My girls are in competitive cheer. Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;Works like a charm. Still learning how to do hands because they still come out wonky sometimes, but I&#x27;m getting there.</li>
            <li> Everything came as advertised.  We actually didn&#x27;t realize how much solution comes with the kit, that was a plus.  After reading and watching videos about how to apply it became clear that practice was going to make perfect.  I came to realize that with this machine, the high setting was going to be the best setting to spray, although it sounds really loud and fast.  But putting the spray level on a very low mist allows for even coverage.  The first two sprays we used a paint roller to even out some thicker spots.  After the second time, I found the best setting for us so now we do not have to use a roller.  The machine works very well so far and comes with a cleaning solution which I just have to use a little bit after every application.  The tent is huge and nice looking, but I really wish it came with instructions on how to fold it up easily.  We have followed the directions suggesting applying a second coat two or three days later.  That does work very well as you do not have to use much solution and it applies very evenly.  So that helps extend the life of the tan.  I would suggest if you are going to do two applications within a couple days of each other that your first session start with a lower percentage solution, and the next time you can bump it up to the higher solution.  One con to the whole purchase is that the solution bottles were not marked with the percentages, but I easily googled each one and marked it on the bottle.  Also, more solution (how much you coat the body) does not equal a better, darker tan.  It just means you wasted solution.  The curing time is what gives the deepness of the tan, so even if you apply a lighter even coat, you will probably end up with the same tan that going over each area 2-3 times will get you.  We are now 5 sprays in and have enough solution for maybe 6 more sprays.  One thing I am not sure about regarding the solution is that we live in a very warm area, which causes everyone to sweat a lot.  By about the fifth day on the body, the solution will get splotchy in high sweat areas (i.e. armpits, cleavage, inside elbows).  After we are finished this solution I am interested to see if the Norvell tanning solutions will do the same.  Overall, a great buy that saves us a ton of money as we get to enjoy great tanning.</li>
            <li> I bought this for home use, and I absolutely love it.  It is easy to use, and I love the samples of solution that came with it as well.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the machine twice but I am in love already. I usually pay at the very least $20/tan. Much easier to use than I thought, Youtube videos helped. Came with everything in picture and got here very fast. I read reviews where customers said that they didn&#x27;t like the spray tan solution provided but I like it, especially for a beginner. I am a full time student and I am hoping this machine will help me bring in some extra money.</li>
            <li> The machine is very user friendly, the tanning solution is good, and you get exactly what is described on the website. It is a little splotchy, in certain areas, when it is sprayed on your skin, but just use a paint roller to go over it in those areas. I have had this happen also with another brand of solution and machine. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this machine one time on my wife&#x27;s legs and it seems to be pretty good considering the price.  I would recommend you not to use the tanning products that come&#x27;s with the machine though.  My wife&#x27;s legs looked great right after we sprayed and she waited almost 24 hours before she showered and all of the tan washed off.  This is not the same product that they use in the tanning salons and will not last 5-7 days, but if you are a bodybuilder and need a tan for a show, then this machine is for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my self tanning purposes &amp; to save money from having to go to the salon. So far so good &amp; my boyfriend was able to spray me. Considering a side business ;)</li>
            <li> Everything was easy to assemble but I cannot get the machine to spray consistently and the directions aren&#x27;t clear...</li>
