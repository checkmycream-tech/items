            <li>That is the greatest benefit, which I like best of all:  </li>
            <li>The triple pack is a great deal too!</li>
            <li>This is the best Crest toothpaste I&#x27;ve used yet.  </li>
            <li>I hope they continue to make it since I think it is the best out there.</li>
            <li>But, the taste and noticeably fresher breath both convince me that this is a good choice!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its not the greatest value given the ounce to price ratio, but if you want a good tasting toothpaste, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste.</li>

            <li>The size is great.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen photos of kids with their boxes, and many hold up their toothbrushes and toothpaste, instead of toys !!</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with my purchase!!</li>
            <li>Pleasant for all the senses.</li>
            <li>However, mixing a Scope gel mouthwash with a Crest whitening paste gives you a very pleasant tasting and refreshing experience.  </li>
            <li>Good value as well.</li>
            <li>This is a good toothpaste for fighting cavities and whitening teeth.  </li>
            <li>It tastes good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tastes good.</li>
            <li>good price .</li>
            <li>I like Crest products and this was a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I liked this toothpaste and it was a great deal.a three tubes of toothpaste for that price</li>
            <li>What makes a good toothpaste?&lt;br /&gt;-Cleanliness&lt;br /&gt;-Taste</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for teeth, it tastes minty, I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Also, it tastes really good, so you&#x27;ll be motivated to brush longer.</li>
            <li>Chalk some of that up to genetics and some to consistently good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and tastes as good as you would expect a toothpaste to.  </li>
            <li>Since then Crest has develop lots of add-ons to their product, all of it good.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak to the whitening as that takes a great deal of time, but taste and texture are great and my teeth feel clean afterward.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the Scope flavor helps your breath stay fresh longer, and it gives the toothpaste one of the very best mint flavors I&#x27;ve experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very refreshing toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Crest with scope is a great effective product, keeps my mouth clean and smells great.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for great tasting toothpaste (not candy flavored) that leaves your mouth feeling clean, then you&#x27;ll like this!</li>

            <li>I liked this as I could buy the three pack</li>
            <li>It is one of the cheaper toothpastes but surprisingly effective.  </li>
            <li>Most toothpastes will do a fair job freshening your breath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve beeen a Crest user since I was a kind.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning and keeping my mouth clean.</li>
            <li>This always leaves my mouth / teeth / gums feeling fresh and happy.</li>
            <li>So far it is the best \\&quot;tartar</li>
            <li>At $8.77 for a three pack (with free shipping) it&#x27;s a good buy.  </li>
            <li>I am generally happy though with the product as it leaves my mouth and teeth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope is particularly excellent in that it combines breath mint, teeth whitening, and cavity prevention.</li>
            <li>Online was easy!</li>
            <li>Sure was nice getting a 3 pack of our favorite toothpaste for the price of one we&#x27;d get in the store.</li>
            <li>You mouth feels quite clean and you can taste a pleasant aftertaste that makes the experience worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>The mint and scope give it good flavor and let me know it&#x27;s working to completely clean my mouth--breath and teeth.</li>
            <li>Besides the freshness and strong flavor for your breath, it cleans your teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li>This is a great and smart purchase.</li>
            <li>The 3 pack is the way to go as you get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I think it works great as a toothpaste, I don&#x27;t really know about its whitening prowess though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flavor is not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>You may not be able to tell from the packaging but this is Crest toothpaste combined with scope mouthwash.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>i am fully satisfied with purchases.</li>
            <li>and I love the taste.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The flavor was mild to strong, and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Why spend more at the pharmacy?</li>
            <li>Takes care of that morning breath while keeping your mouth healthy.</li>
            <li>Crest is my favorite tooth paste and this three pack is a money saver.</li>
            <li>, what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>I now often choose the greater value according to price and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In its price range, it&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li>For most people, Crest is a safe bet.</li>
            <li>Fabulous deal and product!</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li>Why pay more for toothpaste?</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes great without any burning sensation and leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Tastes good and leaves my mouth feeling clean and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh taste and a good (not too strong) aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>The mint is strong but not too over the top.</li>
            <li>More and more people are paying attention to getting items shipped free to their home rather than investing the time, money, and sometimes aggravation for trips to retailers.  </li>
            <li>Good tasting leaves my breath smelling fresh teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>The new crest with scope is indeed a wonderful way to brighten your smile and have a clean smelling mout.</li>
            <li>With great flavor and foamy action, this toothpaste is a winner.  </li>
            <li>I use this paste more than a year, Taste good, whitening effect, soft texture.</li>
            <li>Easy purchasing of items from Amazon.com instead of going to store.</li>
            <li>It has great minty taste that is strong enough but not so strong that my mouth is going to hurt afterwards because of it.</li>
            <li>I have tried Scope mouthwash and liked it, but not as much as Listerine&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel really fresh and my teeth feel super nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Great price for 3 individual toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I got this from Vine on a whim, and I was really surprised at how good it</li>
            <li>This Crest Complete toothpaste tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling clean &amp; fresh.  </li>
            <li>It may not be as strong as the more expensive ones but it tastes good in my mouth and does a great job preventing cavity or erosion of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minty fresh and works!  </li>
            <li>It revitalizes your smile!</li>
            <li>feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>The flavor is great and definitely cuts through morning breath to leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes my mouth taste so clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth feeling clean and your mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li>When we reaches for the shampoo to wash hair, we expect the bubbles and suds to reflect the fact that our hair is getting clean.</li>
            <li>feel my teeth and breath are clean when I use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I like the scope in the toothpaste, it keeps my breathe feeling fresh and clean</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>They are not shiny, reflect light brightly kind of white</li>
            <li>Way better than concrete.</li>
            <li>I think many toothpastes can live up to those two claims.</li>
            <li>Makes our mouths feel minty and clean, which my boys have a tendency to have an issue with with some toothpastes ;)</li>
            <li>I could not detect any Scope flavor at all, and felt nothing that made my mouth feel or smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>As far as toothpaste, it cleans as well as most.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on whether my teeth look brighter or whether this toothpaste cleans better than other brands and concoctions, but as for the tooth brushing experience I can say it was enjoyable.</li>
            <li>It provides all the same great cleaning power of Crest with that extra fresh minty taste of Scope.</li>
            <li>Great product but Duane-Reade has the same item, same size, 3 for $9.</li>
            <li>This particular Crest toothpaste tastes good but has minimal additives for fresh breath and whitening.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a very squeaky clean mouth that&#x27;s ready for DATE NIGHT</li>
            <li>Consistent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just personal preference -</li>
            <li>I noticed first off about Crest \\&quot;Complete\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not my favorite toothpaste, but the ones I like more are also a lot more expensive per weight.  </li>
            <li>Sensodyne toothpaste is much better that Crest but also a lot more expensive, as just one example of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>but I have not been able to locate it locally.</li>
            <li>it has a screw on lid which  works so much better on a \\&quot;squishy\\&quot; product such as this than the pop up tops.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have always been strong and clean and I&#x27;ve had minimal dental problems.</li>
            <li>That is pretty much just marketing.</li>
            <li>Honestly however, you&#x27;d be better off buying Crest at your local Dollar Store because it&#x27;s not worth the high shipping and handling cost online.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on its ability to fight cavities and haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any real results as far as tooth health, but my teeth appear to be clean and bright after brushing.</li>
            <li>Unlike many toothpastes I have used, this one doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Moderate minty flavor (not too strong).  </li>
            <li>The is a nice think paste that will not leak out if you forget to close the cap tightly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain that I have really noticed any difference in the whitening of the teeth however.</li>
            <li>but you can do better giving away at least a free toothbrush to use with the paste</li>
            <li>These are three huge tubes for under ten dollars!</li>
            <li>This is added to the fact that I feel like no toothpaste product has really done anything for my teeth to become whiter.</li>
            <li>but now I really lie the taste.</li>
            <li>Everyone in the family prefers Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste Minty Fresh.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I try</li>
            <li>The tube with the removable cap is much cleaner when stored.  </li>
            <li>The Crest Complete whitening  with Scope has a fresh taste and leaves your teeth and mouth</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve really gotten used to the hinged lids</li>
            <li>I am saving so much money.  </li>
            <li>AIM is dirt cheap at my local supermarket, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>After using this product, I really can&#x27;t see that my teeth are any whiter or my breath any fresher than with AIM.</li>
            <li>If it can keep the tartar off your teeth for more months until your next cleaning, it has clearly done its job.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I avoid toothpaste;  my dentist told me that dry brushing removes more plaque.  </li>
            <li>The scope adds an overall clean feeling after you are done brushing.</li>
            <li>It leaves such a clean feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Nothing special to note, same as what you&#x27;d buy in the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I thought it was fast drying concrete.</li>
            <li>It claims to freshen breath, and I can definitely see that to be true.</li>
            <li>checking to see if mail order tooth paste would compare price and quality with local super market.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s enough that most people who like the idea of mouthwash mixed in with their toothpaste will not be overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>Good two tone striped green and white color.</li>
            <li>This particular Crest product does not disappoint in that department.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product it do what it promises to do.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend a pack of Crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommened.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is a completely unreasonable price for one tube of crest toothpaste, but perfectly reasonable for three.  </li>
            <li>This product fits both requirements, and gets my teeth white and leaves my breath fresh too.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Crest line of toothpaste usually, but this Crest Complete Whitening Toothpaste has a particularly nice flavor.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me a long time ago to forget all the fancy toothpastes on the market and just go with tried and true Crest.</li>
            <li>In all, a good but not great toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste, but neither have I found any significant benefits to make it worth the higher cost.</li>
            <li>This takes it to a new level by adding Scope gel into the paste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is better than any other toothpaste, but it was available for subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>My only question about this product is if it whitens any better than every other \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpaste on the market.</li>
            <li>They have added Scope(TM) mouthwash, and it is only slightly milder than most of Colgate&#x27;s toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>When you go down the dental hygiene aisle in your local store, you are faced with an astounding variety of different toothpaste products.</li>
            <li>However, when I opened the shipping box, I noticed that the toothpaste was Christmas themed (purchased the product in Oct. 2014), and had a relatively early expiration date.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive mouth</li>
            <li>I consciously made the switch because I found Crest milder tasting than Colgate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier on sensitive teeth than Colgate in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old, and have never had a cavity in my adult teeth.</li>
            <li>It works much like any other tooth paste, but I thought I would mention that this one (the first one ever for me) actually has whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li>Pretty solid price for a pretty solid product, simple and works, pretty basic but rated highly due to price advantage.</li>
            <li>I honestly do not know if my teeth have become whiter since using this particular Crest product, and there is much more to cavity prevention than a single brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>If you have multiple children or live alone.</li>
            <li>I expected to have a really fresh feeling and smelling mouth, similar to when I swish with Scope.  </li>
            <li>You can often find it at major chains for $2.99 per tube.</li>
            <li>I have no other problems with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The minty flavor that Crest produces not only keeps my mouth feeling wintery fresh 30 minutes after brushing, but it apparently does a really thorough cleaning job as well since I hardly ever develop cavities while using Crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I am sorry to say it is not cost effective.</li>
            <li>Toothpaste is kind of a difficult thing to review.</li>
            <li>When I first bought these, I thought they were a little minty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li>If you have severely yellowed teeth, I would recommend talking to a dentist or getting whitening strips but slight discoloration could very well be taken care of.</li>
            <li>I have noticed less to floss and less to clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>It is just tooth paste, does its job, does not taste too bad, and good for the teeth</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Also, it tastes really good, so you&#x27;ll be motivated to brush longer.</li>
            <li> Chalk some of that up to genetics and some to consistently good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and tastes as good as you would expect a toothpaste to.  </li>
            <li> Since then Crest has develop lots of add-ons to their product, all of it good.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak to the whitening as that takes a great deal of time, but taste and texture are great and my teeth feel clean afterward.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the Scope flavor helps your breath stay fresh longer, and it gives the toothpaste one of the very best mint flavors I&#x27;ve experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very refreshing toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Crest with scope is a great effective product, keeps my mouth clean and smells great.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for great tasting toothpaste (not candy flavored) that leaves your mouth feeling clean, then you&#x27;ll like this!</li>

            <li> This always leaves my mouth / teeth / gums feeling fresh and happy.</li>
            <li> So far it is the best \\&quot;tartar</li>
            <li> At $8.77 for a three pack (with free shipping) it&#x27;s a good buy.  </li>
            <li> I am generally happy though with the product as it leaves my mouth and teeth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope is particularly excellent in that it combines breath mint, teeth whitening, and cavity prevention.</li>
            <li> Online was easy!</li>
            <li> Sure was nice getting a 3 pack of our favorite toothpaste for the price of one we&#x27;d get in the store.</li>
            <li> You mouth feels quite clean and you can taste a pleasant aftertaste that makes the experience worthwhile.  </li>

            <li> Besides the freshness and strong flavor for your breath, it cleans your teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li> This is a great and smart purchase.</li>
            <li> The 3 pack is the way to go as you get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I think it works great as a toothpaste, I don&#x27;t really know about its whitening prowess though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flavor is not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> You may not be able to tell from the packaging but this is Crest toothpaste combined with scope mouthwash.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i am fully satisfied with purchases.</li>
            <li> and I love the taste.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The flavor was mild to strong, and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Why spend more at the pharmacy?</li>
            <li> Takes care of that morning breath while keeping your mouth healthy.</li>
            <li> Crest is my favorite tooth paste and this three pack is a money saver.</li>
            <li> , what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> I now often choose the greater value according to price and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In its price range, it&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li> For most people, Crest is a safe bet.</li>
            <li> Fabulous deal and product!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> Why pay more for toothpaste?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes great without any burning sensation and leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Tastes good and leaves my mouth feeling clean and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh taste and a good (not too strong) aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> The mint is strong but not too over the top.</li>
            <li> More and more people are paying attention to getting items shipped free to their home rather than investing the time, money, and sometimes aggravation for trips to retailers.  </li>
            <li> Good tasting leaves my breath smelling fresh teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> The new crest with scope is indeed a wonderful way to brighten your smile and have a clean smelling mout.</li>
            <li> With great flavor and foamy action, this toothpaste is a winner.  </li>
            <li> I use this paste more than a year, Taste good, whitening effect, soft texture.</li>
            <li> Easy purchasing of items from Amazon.com instead of going to store.</li>
            <li> It has great minty taste that is strong enough but not so strong that my mouth is going to hurt afterwards because of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried Scope mouthwash and liked it, but not as much as Listerine&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel really fresh and my teeth feel super nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Great price for 3 individual toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got this from Vine on a whim, and I was really surprised at how good it</li>
            <li> This Crest Complete toothpaste tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling clean &amp; fresh.  </li>
            <li> It may not be as strong as the more expensive ones but it tastes good in my mouth and does a great job preventing cavity or erosion of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty fresh and works!  </li>
            <li> It revitalizes your smile!</li>
            <li> feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> The flavor is great and definitely cuts through morning breath to leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my mouth taste so clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling clean and your mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li> When we reaches for the shampoo to wash hair, we expect the bubbles and suds to reflect the fact that our hair is getting clean.</li>
            <li> feel my teeth and breath are clean when I use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I like the scope in the toothpaste, it keeps my breathe feeling fresh and clean</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> They are not shiny, reflect light brightly kind of white</li>
            <li> Way better than concrete.</li>
            <li> I think many toothpastes can live up to those two claims.</li>
            <li> Makes our mouths feel minty and clean, which my boys have a tendency to have an issue with with some toothpastes ;)</li>
            <li> I could not detect any Scope flavor at all, and felt nothing that made my mouth feel or smell fresh.  </li>
            <li> As far as toothpaste, it cleans as well as most.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on whether my teeth look brighter or whether this toothpaste cleans better than other brands and concoctions, but as for the tooth brushing experience I can say it was enjoyable.</li>
            <li> It provides all the same great cleaning power of Crest with that extra fresh minty taste of Scope.</li>
            <li> Great product but Duane-Reade has the same item, same size, 3 for $9.</li>
            <li> This particular Crest toothpaste tastes good but has minimal additives for fresh breath and whitening.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a very squeaky clean mouth that&#x27;s ready for DATE NIGHT</li>
            <li> Consistent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just personal preference -</li>
            <li> I noticed first off about Crest \\&quot;Complete\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not my favorite toothpaste, but the ones I like more are also a lot more expensive per weight.  </li>
            <li> Sensodyne toothpaste is much better that Crest but also a lot more expensive, as just one example of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> but I have not been able to locate it locally.</li>
            <li> it has a screw on lid which  works so much better on a \\&quot;squishy\\&quot; product such as this than the pop up tops.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have always been strong and clean and I&#x27;ve had minimal dental problems.</li>
            <li> That is pretty much just marketing.</li>
            <li> Honestly however, you&#x27;d be better off buying Crest at your local Dollar Store because it&#x27;s not worth the high shipping and handling cost online.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on its ability to fight cavities and haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any real results as far as tooth health, but my teeth appear to be clean and bright after brushing.</li>
            <li> Unlike many toothpastes I have used, this one doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Moderate minty flavor (not too strong).  </li>
            <li> The is a nice think paste that will not leak out if you forget to close the cap tightly.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for certain that I have really noticed any difference in the whitening of the teeth however.</li>
            <li> but you can do better giving away at least a free toothbrush to use with the paste</li>
            <li> These are three huge tubes for under ten dollars!</li>
            <li> This is added to the fact that I feel like no toothpaste product has really done anything for my teeth to become whiter.</li>
            <li> but now I really lie the taste.</li>
            <li> Everyone in the family prefers Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste Minty Fresh.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I try</li>
            <li> The tube with the removable cap is much cleaner when stored.  </li>
            <li> The Crest Complete whitening  with Scope has a fresh taste and leaves your teeth and mouth</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve really gotten used to the hinged lids</li>
            <li> I am saving so much money.  </li>
            <li> AIM is dirt cheap at my local supermarket, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> After using this product, I really can&#x27;t see that my teeth are any whiter or my breath any fresher than with AIM.</li>
            <li> If it can keep the tartar off your teeth for more months until your next cleaning, it has clearly done its job.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I avoid toothpaste;  my dentist told me that dry brushing removes more plaque.  </li>
            <li> The scope adds an overall clean feeling after you are done brushing.</li>
            <li> It leaves such a clean feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to note, same as what you&#x27;d buy in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I thought it was fast drying concrete.</li>
            <li> It claims to freshen breath, and I can definitely see that to be true.</li>
            <li> checking to see if mail order tooth paste would compare price and quality with local super market.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s enough that most people who like the idea of mouthwash mixed in with their toothpaste will not be overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> Good two tone striped green and white color.</li>
            <li> This particular Crest product does not disappoint in that department.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product it do what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend a pack of Crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommened.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a completely unreasonable price for one tube of crest toothpaste, but perfectly reasonable for three.  </li>
            <li> This product fits both requirements, and gets my teeth white and leaves my breath fresh too.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Crest line of toothpaste usually, but this Crest Complete Whitening Toothpaste has a particularly nice flavor.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me a long time ago to forget all the fancy toothpastes on the market and just go with tried and true Crest.</li>
            <li> In all, a good but not great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste, but neither have I found any significant benefits to make it worth the higher cost.</li>
            <li> This takes it to a new level by adding Scope gel into the paste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is better than any other toothpaste, but it was available for subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> My only question about this product is if it whitens any better than every other \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpaste on the market.</li>
            <li> They have added Scope(TM) mouthwash, and it is only slightly milder than most of Colgate&#x27;s toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> When you go down the dental hygiene aisle in your local store, you are faced with an astounding variety of different toothpaste products.</li>
            <li> However, when I opened the shipping box, I noticed that the toothpaste was Christmas themed (purchased the product in Oct. 2014), and had a relatively early expiration date.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive mouth</li>
            <li> I consciously made the switch because I found Crest milder tasting than Colgate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier on sensitive teeth than Colgate in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old, and have never had a cavity in my adult teeth.</li>
            <li> It works much like any other tooth paste, but I thought I would mention that this one (the first one ever for me) actually has whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid price for a pretty solid product, simple and works, pretty basic but rated highly due to price advantage.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not know if my teeth have become whiter since using this particular Crest product, and there is much more to cavity prevention than a single brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> If you have multiple children or live alone.</li>
            <li> I expected to have a really fresh feeling and smelling mouth, similar to when I swish with Scope.  </li>
            <li> You can often find it at major chains for $2.99 per tube.</li>
            <li> I have no other problems with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The minty flavor that Crest produces not only keeps my mouth feeling wintery fresh 30 minutes after brushing, but it apparently does a really thorough cleaning job as well since I hardly ever develop cavities while using Crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to say it is not cost effective.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste is kind of a difficult thing to review.</li>
            <li> When I first bought these, I thought they were a little minty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you have severely yellowed teeth, I would recommend talking to a dentist or getting whitening strips but slight discoloration could very well be taken care of.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less to floss and less to clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> It is just tooth paste, does its job, does not taste too bad, and good for the teeth</li>
            <li> The same can&#x27;t be said for other brands such as Close Up which is one company that has good-tasting toothpaste, but doesn&#x27;t provide a thorough enough cleaning job.  </li>
            <li> My wife is particular about her tooth past</li>
            <li> Had some gum problem and didn&#x27;t pay attention to teeth for a long time.</li>
            <li> Anyway, that&#x27;s just a minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest, it&#x27;s been around a long time for a reason: It does what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was actually somewhat disappointed with the whitening aspect of the toothpaste, as my favorite whitening effect is also a Crest toothpaste, the 3D White variety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tooth pastes that boast of this, this one actually has delivered.</li>
            <li> Similar to other mint flavored toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I personally prefer the taste of Crest to other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of other whitening toothpastes, it doesn&#x27;t taste bitter, overly minty or really gritty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe all of the hype surrounding advertising, but this is one does seem to at least partially live up to the claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Crest Complete whitening Plus Scope toothpaste is just another confusing</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste and have been using it for the last few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really used to the removable lid anymore</li>
            <li> No one should expect major results from the secondary additives.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this over any other brand.</li>
            <li> I suggest it to other who want to buy it.</li>
            <li> I never bother with any other variety of tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> Crest Complete with Scope ups the game.  </li>
            <li> A little too abrasive for me.</li>
            <li> and it just seems to be a little messier.  </li>
            <li> Even if I spend a few minutes rinsing out my toothbrush, there&#x27;s a layer of toothpaste at the bottom of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> From what I can tell, the ingredients in this toothpaste don&#x27;t differ terribly from a lot of other types of Crest, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure what makes it more</li>
            <li> I suppose this one does it a little better because it leaves the awful taste in your mouth longer.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The whitening and cavity fighting claims are hard to prove.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint about this toothpaste is that it gunks up my tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The fluoride does the job if you brush at least twice a day and stop sucking on lollipops the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I did have a complaint, it would be with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> At least it was for me.</li>
            <li> Sadly, with all the positives in this toothpaste, I can&#x27;t ignore the fact that there is hardly any foaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I got tired of searching in the stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like my go to choice when other brands disappoint, or when other brands get boring after a while.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with this product</li>
            <li> think you can&#x27;t go wrong with this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> False advertising or really bad math.</li>
            <li> I like tooth&#x3D;paste&#x3D; (rather than the gels, etc), and I detest candy flavored toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> It is especially annoying with my electric toothbrush, since the tooth paste sticks to the inside of the brush part.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No complaints about this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s minty fresh and works!  The 3 pack is the way to go as you get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to note, same as what you&#x27;d buy in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Great product but Duane-Reade has the same item, same size, 3 for $9.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of toothpaste. The product itself works wonderfully. However, when I opened the shipping box, I noticed that the toothpaste was Christmas themed (purchased the product in Oct. 2014), and had a relatively early expiration date. If you buy this online, it may have been sitting on the shelves waiting to be sold for quite sometime.</li>
            <li> I think it works great as a toothpaste, I don&#x27;t really know about its whitening prowess though. This is added to the fact that I feel like no toothpaste product has really done anything for my teeth to become whiter. What I can tell you is that it has definitely helped keep my teeth the same shade, and not anymore stained. Cleans your teeth great too!</li>
            <li> Sure was nice getting a 3 pack of our favorite toothpaste for the price of one we&#x27;d get in the store. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. It&#x27;s flavor is not too overwhelming. Good value as well.</li>
            <li> Unlike the picture of this that would lead one to believe that they would receive 3 tubes of toothpaste, only one tube arrived.  This is a completely unreasonable price for one tube of crest toothpaste, but perfectly reasonable for three.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste for fighting cavities and whitening teeth.  It tastes good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this toothpaste is that it gunks up my tooth brush. Even if I spend a few minutes rinsing out my toothbrush, there&#x27;s a layer of toothpaste at the bottom of the bristles.  It is especially annoying with my electric toothbrush, since the tooth paste sticks to the inside of the brush part.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste on the market.  The inclusion of Scope leaves a freshness after brushing.</li>
            <li> You may not be able to tell from the packaging but this is Crest toothpaste combined with scope mouthwash. Yeah I was fooled too. I thought it was fast drying concrete. It tastes good. Way better than concrete.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste.  This always leaves my mouth / teeth / gums feeling fresh and happy.</li>
            <li> I use this paste more than a year, Taste good, whitening effect, soft texture. Use our family, we like it.</li>
            <li> Good tasting leaves my breath smelling fresh teeth are clean. I highly recommend this product it do what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> Had some gum problem and didn&#x27;t pay attention to teeth for a long time. Now it gets back to me. Then I tried this Crest Toothpaste. It helps my gum to grow back and reduce my pain. I will keep using it, at the same time try two toothpaste at the same time just in case.</li>
            <li> Same or cheaper than store and I didn&#x27;t have to shop at store. My wife is particular about her tooth past and I got tired of searching in the stores. Online was easy!</li>
            <li> When I first bought these, I thought they were a little minty but now I really lie the taste. The scope adds an overall clean feeling after you are done brushing. Great for mornings.</li>
            <li> good price . but you can do better giving away at least a free toothbrush to use with the paste</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you but I like mint flavor, especially for mouthwash.  I regularly use Listerine Mint mouthwash.  I have tried Scope mouthwash and liked it, but not as much as Listerine&#x27;s version.  However, mixing a Scope gel mouthwash with a Crest whitening paste gives you a very pleasant tasting and refreshing experience.  I can&#x27;t comment on whether my teeth look brighter or whether this toothpaste cleans better than other brands and concoctions, but as for the tooth brushing experience I can say it was enjoyable. Moreover, after you have brushed (and flossed) you don&#x27;t feel you need to use mouthwash.  You mouth feels quite clean and you can taste a pleasant aftertaste that makes the experience worthwhile.  Will I buy this again?  If it goes on sale or a coupon is offered I will.</li>
            <li> Will be included in Operation Christmas Child gift boxes for kids around the world.  I&#x27;ve seen photos of kids with their boxes, and many hold up their toothbrushes and toothpaste, instead of toys !!</li>
            <li> This deal actually costs $.97/oz.  To get it at $.32/oz you would need to receive three triple-packs which I thought I was receiving. $6 for each tube of toothpaste? I returned them pronto.</li>
            <li> If this was the 80s, I&#x27;d say this toothpaste was totally tubular.  Cavities and plaque beware: Crest is putting you on notice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Creat what else can I say? I liked this as I could buy the three pack and it would last me awhile! I have always used Crest and probably always will!</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I like Crest products and this was a good deal.  My dentist recommends Crest and I have used it for 50 years</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Everyone in the family prefers Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste Minty Fresh. It leaves such a clean feeling in your mouth. It revitalizes your smile! I prefer this over any other brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper at Costco! I thought I was getting a bargain, but not the case. Three of a larger size was cheaper at costco</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. It makes my mouth feel really fresh and my teeth feel super nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I have a sensitive mouth but my teeth or tongue do not get irritated by this toothpaste. It has great minty taste that is strong enough but not so strong that my mouth is going to hurt afterwards because of it.</li>
            <li> i am fully satisfied with purchases. Everything was as described. I suggest it to other who want to buy it.</li>
            <li> Good price. Consistent product. Same as stores.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I expected to have a really fresh feeling and smelling mouth, similar to when I swish with Scope.  I could not detect any Scope flavor at all, and felt nothing that made my mouth feel or smell fresh.  As far as toothpaste, it cleans as well as most.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes great without any burning sensation and leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean.  If you like Scope you&#x27;ll like the Scope favoring--if you don&#x27;t like Scope I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste and have been using it for the last few years. I like the scope in the toothpaste, it keeps my breathe feeling fresh and clean and I love the taste. The whitening agent does leave a film of residue, but it is not persistent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for the past 3 years.  I never bother with any other variety of tooth paste.  It is one of the cheaper toothpastes but surprisingly effective.  It may not be as strong as the more expensive ones but it tastes good in my mouth and does a great job preventing cavity or erosion of my teeth.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this toothpaste. The flavor was mild to strong, and pleasant. I was actually somewhat disappointed with the whitening aspect of the toothpaste, as my favorite whitening effect is also a Crest toothpaste, the 3D White variety. In all, a good but not great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I liked this toothpaste and it was a great deal.a three tubes of toothpaste for that price I will be back.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with this product it&#x27;s a great great price for toothpaste, plus a trusted the brand. Why spend more at the pharmacy?</li>
            <li> Crest with scope is a great effective product, keeps my mouth clean and smells great. Completely satisfied with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> I like tooth&#x3D;paste&#x3D; (rather than the gels, etc), and I detest candy flavored toothpastes.  This product fits both requirements, and gets my teeth white and leaves my breath fresh too.  Great product, and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this product overall.  It has a fresh taste and a good (not too strong) aftertaste.  And unlike some toothpastes the texture isn&#x27;t gritty.  I also like that the tube comes with a removable cap unlike Crest Pro Health which has a hinged cap.  No matter how much I try I can&#x27;t keep the hinged cap from leaking in between use.  The tube with the removable cap is much cleaner when stored.  My only question about this product is if it whitens any better than every other \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpaste on the market. It will take a while to find that out but I suspect they are all about the same in that respect.  But separate from its as yet unproven whitening claim I like this toothpaste and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li> When you go down the dental hygiene aisle in your local store, you are faced with an astounding variety of different toothpaste products. The Crest Complete whitening Plus Scope toothpaste is just another confusing option.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using whitening tooth paste for years and my teeth are still the same shade of yellow they have always been. The fluoride does the job if you brush at least twice a day and stop sucking on lollipops the rest of the day. Most toothpastes will do a fair job freshening your breath. I suppose this one does it a little better because it leaves the awful taste in your mouth longer.&lt;br /&gt;When buying toothpaste, I follow my dentists advice, any fluoride toothpaste will do the job, just pick one you won&#x27;t avoid using... and don&#x27;t forget to floss (you only need the floss the teeth you wish to keep).</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, the ingredients in this toothpaste don&#x27;t differ terribly from a lot of other types of Crest, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure what makes it more \\&quot;Complete\\&quot; than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Scope flavor helps your breath stay fresh longer, and it gives the toothpaste one of the very best mint flavors I&#x27;ve experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not the greatest value given the ounce to price ratio, but if you want a good tasting toothpaste, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> checking to see if mail order tooth paste would compare price and quality with local super market.  I am sorry to say it is not cost effective.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid price for a pretty solid product, simple and works, pretty basic but rated highly due to price advantage.</li>
            <li> The Crest Complete whitening  with Scope has a fresh taste and leaves your teeth and mouth feeling really clean. Takes care of that morning breath while keeping your mouth healthy.</li>
            <li> Crest is my favorite tooth paste and this three pack is a money saver.</li>
            <li> No matter how often I might experiment with different kinds of toothpaste, I always come back to Crest.  It&#x27;s like my go to choice when other brands disappoint, or when other brands get boring after a while.  The minty flavor that Crest produces not only keeps my mouth feeling wintery fresh 30 minutes after brushing, but it apparently does a really thorough cleaning job as well since I hardly ever develop cavities while using Crest toothpaste.  The same can&#x27;t be said for other brands such as Close Up which is one company that has good-tasting toothpaste, but doesn&#x27;t provide a thorough enough cleaning job.  So I highly recommend a pack of Crest toothpaste.  Honestly however, you&#x27;d be better off buying Crest at your local Dollar Store because it&#x27;s not worth the high shipping and handling cost online.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste is kind of a difficult thing to review. What makes a good toothpaste?&lt;br /&gt;-Cleanliness&lt;br /&gt;-Taste&lt;br /&gt;-Texture&lt;br /&gt;-Whitening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the whitening as that takes a great deal of time, but taste and texture are great and my teeth feel clean afterward.</li>
            <li> A little too abrasive for me. I will use intermittently with a milder formula.</li>
            <li> I have always been a big fan of Crest mint flavored.  This takes it to a new level by adding Scope gel into the paste.  The is a nice think paste that will not leak out if you forget to close the cap tightly.  The flavor is great and definitely cuts through morning breath to leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This Crest Complete toothpaste tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling clean &amp; fresh.  I&#x27;ve been a Colgate user for years; but, this Crest seems to work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I did have a complaint, it would be with the packaging.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just personal preference - but I&#x27;ve really gotten used to the hinged lids and I do prefer them.  I&#x27;m not really used to the removable lid anymore and it just seems to be a little messier.  Anyway, that&#x27;s just a minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for great tasting toothpaste (not candy flavored) that leaves your mouth feeling clean, then you&#x27;ll like this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for teeth, it tastes minty, I like it a lot.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is better than any other toothpaste, but it was available for subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tooth paste. It works much like any other tooth paste, but I thought I would mention that this one (the first one ever for me) actually has whitened my teeth. They are not shiny, reflect light brightly kind of white but it has helped reduce the yellow staining. I&#x27;ve used other tooth pastes that boast of this, this one actually has delivered. If you have severely yellowed teeth, I would recommend talking to a dentist or getting whitening strips but slight discoloration could very well be taken care of. At least it was for me.</li>
            <li> It is just tooth paste, does its job, does not taste too bad, and good for the teeth, what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> I grew up using Colgate, but I switched to Crest during adulthood. I consciously made the switch because I found Crest milder tasting than Colgate.  Recently, I have switched back and forth.  Crest has fluoride (like Colgate) and a variety of versions (and flavors).  I now often choose the greater value according to price and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed first off about Crest \\&quot;Complete\\&quot; is that it is a step closer to tasting like Colgate (i.e. stronger).  They have added Scope(TM) mouthwash, and it is only slightly milder than most of Colgate&#x27;s toothpaste.  Besides the freshness and strong flavor for your breath, it cleans your teeth effectively.  I have noticed less to floss and less to clean after brushing.  That is the greatest benefit, which I like best of all:  If it can keep the tartar off your teeth for more months until your next cleaning, it has clearly done its job.  So far it is the best \\&quot;tartar control\\&quot; toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my mouth taste so clean. It cleans my teeth well. The mint and scope give it good flavor and let me know it&#x27;s working to completely clean my mouth--breath and teeth. I highly recommend this. The triple pack is a great deal too!</li>
            <li> Normally, I avoid toothpaste;  my dentist told me that dry brushing removes more plaque.  I got this from Vine on a whim, and I was really surprised at how good it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you a toothpaste hater?  Are you one of those people who is basically immune to caffeine, and who drinks coffee like it&#x27;s water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this is for you.  It will produce noticeably whiter teeth in about two weeks.  Also, it tastes really good, so you&#x27;ll be motivated to brush longer. Unlike a lot of other whitening toothpastes, it doesn&#x27;t taste bitter, overly minty or really gritty.</li>
            <li> A very refreshing toothpaste. Leaves teeth feeling clean and your mouth refreshed. The mint is strong but not too over the top. It&#x27;s enough that most people who like the idea of mouthwash mixed in with their toothpaste will not be overwhelmed. Good two tone striped green and white color. Pleasant for all the senses.</li>
            <li> This is the best Crest toothpaste I&#x27;ve used yet.  Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not my favorite toothpaste, but the ones I like more are also a lot more expensive per weight.  In its price range, it&#x27;s my favorite.  It&#x27;s easier on sensitive teeth than Colgate in my opinion.  It&#x27;s a lot easier on same than the Kirkland brand.  Sensodyne toothpaste is much better that Crest but also a lot more expensive, as just one example of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you can&#x27;t go wrong with this toothpaste.  If you don&#x27;t have any sensitivity, you can try saving money by using a store brand like Kirkland.  For most people, Crest is a safe bet.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth at all.  It&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.  I repeat, it&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> With great flavor and foamy action, this toothpaste is a winner.  Crest has always been our brand of choice, and this product meets our expectations.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today.  And I love how this thing tastes! It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes brushing teeth not seem like such a chore.  Combine this with Oral-B Satin Floss and also the ACT mouth wash and you&#x27;ll have a very squeaky clean mouth that&#x27;s ready for DATE NIGHT</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand and type of toothpaste, but I always thought it was too expensive.  Not anymore; my local drug store sells one of these tubes for $5.  I am saving so much money.  Fabulous deal and product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest toothpaste virtually all my life. My teeth have always been strong and clean and I&#x27;ve had minimal dental problems. Chalk some of that up to genetics and some to consistently good oral hygiene. This particular Crest toothpaste tastes good but has minimal additives for fresh breath and whitening. It doesn&#x27;t stand a chance of accomplishing its two stated supplementary missions for someone who drinks a lot of coffee like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy Crest in all its variations depending on what happens to be on sale. No one should expect major results from the secondary additives.  That is pretty much just marketing. At $8.77 for a three pack (with free shipping) it&#x27;s a good buy.  You can often find it at major chains for $2.99 per tube. Of course you have to pay sales tax and cover your cost of transportation to get there. More and more people are paying attention to getting items shipped free to their home rather than investing the time, money, and sometimes aggravation for trips to retailers.  Buying a product isn&#x27;t just about the price anymore.  It&#x27;s about the time, effort and total cost of getting it.</li>
            <li> Easy purchasing of items from Amazon.com instead of going to store. Great price for 3 individual toothpaste. The new crest with scope is indeed a wonderful way to brighten your smile and have a clean smelling mout.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste for brushing teeth.  Moderate minty flavor (not too strong).  Similar to other mint flavored toothpastes.  Flossing is still recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not eat.</li>
            <li> When we reaches for the shampoo to wash hair, we expect the bubbles and suds to reflect the fact that our hair is getting clean. This also stands for washing hands, dishes and teeth. Sadly, with all the positives in this toothpaste, I can&#x27;t ignore the fact that there is hardly any foaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a selling point for some, I realize, which is why I only removed one star. I have no other problems with this toothpaste. The mint isn&#x27;t too minty. The size is great. My kids like the striping that comes onto the toothpaste from the tube. I can&#x27;t comment on its ability to fight cavities and haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any real results as far as tooth health, but my teeth appear to be clean and bright after brushing.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Crest line of toothpaste usually, but this Crest Complete Whitening Toothpaste has a particularly nice flavor. I can&#x27;t say for certain that I have really noticed any difference in the whitening of the teeth however. I am generally happy though with the product as it leaves my mouth and teeth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve beeen a Crest user since I was a kind. It cleans well and tastes as good as you would expect a toothpaste to.  Crest Complete with Scope ups the game.  It provides all the same great cleaning power of Crest with that extra fresh minty taste of Scope. Highly recommened.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe all of the hype surrounding advertising, but this is one does seem to at least partially live up to the claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I personally prefer the taste of Crest to other toothpastes. This particular Crest product does not disappoint in that department.&lt;br /&gt;2) It claims to freshen breath, and I can definitely see that to be true. My family does have fresher breath when using this toothpaste than when using toothpaste - Crest or otherwise - without the Scope addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening and cavity fighting claims are hard to prove. I honestly do not know if my teeth have become whiter since using this particular Crest product, and there is much more to cavity prevention than a single brand of toothpaste. I think many toothpastes can live up to those two claims. But, the taste and noticeably fresher breath both convince me that this is a good choice! In fact, this stands as my family&#x27;s number one toothpaste choice.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite toothpaste but I have not been able to locate it locally. I thought they stopped making it until I found it here. These are three huge tubes for under ten dollars! I found it to be a bargain. The expiration date is over a year from now so it will stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel my teeth and breath are clean when I use this toothpaste. It does a great job of cleaning and keeping my mouth clean. I hope they continue to make it since I think it is the best out there.</li>
            <li> Since when is $18/18.6 ounces $0.32/ounce? 3 pack of 3 tubes each would be that. False advertising or really bad math.</li>
            <li> Makes our mouths feel minty and clean, which my boys have a tendency to have an issue with with some toothpastes ;)</li>
            <li> If you have multiple children or live alone. Why pay more for toothpaste? This is a great and smart purchase.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great.  Tastes good and leaves my mouth feeling clean and comfortable.  Unlike many toothpastes I have used, this one doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry mouth.  Also.....this may be trivial but.....it has a screw on lid which  works so much better on a \\&quot;squishy\\&quot; product such as this than the pop up tops.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me a long time ago to forget all the fancy toothpastes on the market and just go with tried and true Crest. And I have. Since then Crest has develop lots of add-ons to their product, all of it good. Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope is particularly excellent in that it combines breath mint, teeth whitening, and cavity prevention. It doesn&#x27;t get much better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest, it&#x27;s been around a long time for a reason: It does what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste, but neither have I found any significant benefits to make it worth the higher cost. AIM is dirt cheap at my local supermarket, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I&#x27;m 50 years old, and have never had a cavity in my adult teeth. After using this product, I really can&#x27;t see that my teeth are any whiter or my breath any fresher than with AIM.</li>
            <li> We hve been using this toothpaste for quite a while now.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  Some tootpastes leave my mouth with a irrated, slimey feeling.  Not this one.</li>
    </ol>
