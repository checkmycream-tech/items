            <li>I love this blend so much I&#x27;d like to make a perfume spray of it, but I think I&#x27;ll skip the patchouli.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this oil - really calming and uplifting.</li>
            <li>I cried in my bed for 2 days with a cool cloth on my head and some &amp;#34;chill pill&amp;#34; on another cloth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Such a lovely, calming scent!</li>
            <li>it great to add a little valerian to the blend.</li>
            <li>I sometimes carry it in my purse and when I open it to rummage around, the smell wafts out and people ask what that nice smell is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very calming and has a fresh, clean aroma.</li>
            <li>so I could relax right before bed.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Shipping wasn&#x27;t super fast, but it was delivered within the anticipated window of time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but once I put a few drops on my pillow, what was once pleasant turned pungent to the point it reeked</li>
            <li>a nice complex smelling and pleasant mix but with definite  patchouli notes</li>
            <li>For several years this has been one of the most calming treats I can do for myself.</li>
            <li>I Love this blend especially when diluted in a spray bottle as a body mist!</li>
            <li>I alternate between Chill Pill and Tranquility, which is similar-base of lavender, but with more pine scented undertones-</li>
            <li>Love this Chill Pill essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I was using just lavender oil in a hot bath after a long stressful day at work but this works even better to relax and reduce my anxiety.</li>
            <li>I usually get compliments saying how good I smell ...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>i buy the spray as well, and give it as gifts to new moms.  </li>
            <li>I constantly receive positive comments on the smell.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it has a masculine scent, I was looking for feminine and</li>
            <li>My coworker, who is a Doterra consultant (and swears that any other oil is terrible and made by the devil) always thinks it&#x27;s one of her overpriced oils, lol, and I just let her believe that to avoid a long spiel about why pyramid scheme oils are better quality and harvested in exclusive fields in exotic locales, whereas mine is made by satanic crackheads in a back alley in Los Angeles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an essential oil connoisseur nor do I normally wear perfume,..</li>
            <li>This oil can be added to your bath water or just leave the open bottle near your work desk or bed.</li>
            <li>Sort of smells like you&#x27;ve just come out of a Whole Foods or other health foods store.</li>
            <li>Helps calm the entire family down after a long day.</li>

            <li> My dog just suffered a stroke and it was not clear if he would make it.  </li>
            <li> - I put it on a handkerchief in my pocket, put a few drops on my scarf, use it just behind the ears as a perfume of sorts, or even use a little bit on top of my unscented deodorant.</li>
            <li> use it everyday now for my daily perfume , not just when i need to relax.</li>

            <li> Use this product on my dog&#x27;s collar (has anxiety issues). Not only does it calm him a bit - he smells delicious!</li>
            <li> What a soothing scent....  Perfect for a headache, or just putting your feet up after a long day.  Relax and enjoy!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite scent for many years ! For several years this has been one of the most calming treats I can do for myself. I always bought mine at Earth Fare, but now have found on Amazon at a better price. I just wish it would come in larger amounts as we keep it going in a diffuser in our office.</li>
            <li> This scent gives you serenity and take away your anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday now for my daily perfume , not just when i need to relax.</li>
            <li> Aura Cacia products are always in my opinion, excellent and this once again is  a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;  after yoga practice, during the saves meditation I take a drop and put it on my forehead- just like my yoga teacher does....&lt;br /&gt; amazing, and i wouldn&#x27;t be without this ...so chill in every way</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It really does help me sleep better.  I mix it with dead sea salt to take a bath before bed.</li>
            <li> I used this oil a lot on my diffuser for health matters and also makes the room smell so good.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it has a masculine scent, I was looking for feminine and I would rather shop for scents in a store to make sure it is what I like.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift by a good friend who wore it as perfume. I remarked that I liked the smell so she gave me a bottle. Like her, I wear it as perfume, putting a drop behind my ears and on my throat. I constantly receive positive comments on the smell. One acquaintance liked it so much that she bought some for herself. Even my 75-year-old uncle remarked on the scent and wanted to know what it is called. Sort of smells like you&#x27;ve just come out of a Whole Foods or other health foods store. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I got this essential oil as a relaxing smell to put on my pillow so I could relax right before bed. In the bottle, the oil smelled pleasant but once I put a few drops on my pillow, what was once pleasant turned pungent to the point it reeked and I could not get rid of the smell for weeks! I washed all of my sheets and my pillowcases and it still reeked like awful patchouli incense. I do NOT recommend this smell, it is not a lovely lavender, quite the opposite! Be warned and don&#x27;t spray drops on your pillow until you&#x27;ve had a chance to test it somewhere else beforehand. Unfortunately, I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> a nice complex smelling and pleasant mix but with definite  patchouli notes so if you don&#x27;t like patchouli... I&#x27;d like it better if this note was lessened.</li>
            <li> Very good scent! And it does have a nice calming effect. I loved it so much, I need to buy more. It&#x27;s great for bedtime too! Helps calm the entire family down after a long day. Love it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> my favorite oil for adding into things and using with a diffuser.  i buy the spray as well, and give it as gifts to new moms.  love it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!!!! Lovely calm lavender blend. If I know I&#x27;m going to have a potentially stressful day or want to relax after work,.. I put a few drops on my wrists. I&#x27;m not an essential oil connoisseur nor do I normally wear perfume,.. but someone was wearing it &amp; the smell was enchanting,.. I had to get it! Thanks for the quick shipping. Absolutely lovely! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Good value, fast shipping, thanks! This oil can be added to your bath water or just leave the open bottle near your work desk or bed.</li>
            <li> Chill pill essential oil blend smells incredible help me sleep better it great to add a little valerian to the blend.</li>
            <li> Great Product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I Love this blend especially when diluted in a spray bottle as a body mist!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a relaxing scent, you have found it.</li>
            <li> Always love their oils which are so pure and smell so wonderful.  Will definitely order once again when needed.  So there :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I was using just lavender oil in a hot bath after a long stressful day at work but this works even better to relax and reduce my anxiety. I have bad allergies to chemicals and sensitive skin and this smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> But... even though there&#x27;s just a hint of patchouli, patchouli has a life of it&#x27;s own and is strong. I would rather this didn&#x27;t have the patchouli. I love this blend so much I&#x27;d like to make a perfume spray of it, but I think I&#x27;ll skip the patchouli.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised. Shipping wasn&#x27;t super fast, but it was delivered within the anticipated window of time.&lt;br /&gt;I love this scent - I put it on a handkerchief in my pocket, put a few drops on my scarf, use it just behind the ears as a perfume of sorts, or even use a little bit on top of my unscented deodorant. It&#x27;s very calming and has a fresh, clean aroma.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this oil - really calming and uplifting.</li>
            <li> This is just the most relaxing scent ever.  When I am talking to a horrible person on the phone, I just open the bottle and hold it under my nose.  I swear it helps!!</li>
            <li> I use this as a fragrance and also mix it with other oils for perfume and massage.</li>
            <li> My dog just suffered a stroke and it was not clear if he would make it.  I cried in my bed for 2 days with a cool cloth on my head and some &amp;#34;chill pill&amp;#34; on another cloth.  Listened to some Deva Premal and it was all rather comforting.  For now my dog seems to be improving.  You never know what life will bring you, &amp;#34;chill pill&amp;#34; was a comfort during one of life&#x27;s storms.</li>
            <li> I use this oil several times a week, if not every day. I put some on a square of fabric in my car and fold it into the air conditioning vent to keep road rage to a minimum while I drive the mean streets of San Diego, haha. It works great! I alternate between Chill Pill and Tranquility, which is similar-base of lavender, but with more pine scented undertones- whereas this one is lavender with a more citrusy/orange scent. Both are great for relaxation and calming and I get compliments when I use them at work or in my car. I sometimes carry it in my purse and when I open it to rummage around, the smell wafts out and people ask what that nice smell is. My coworker, who is a Doterra consultant (and swears that any other oil is terrible and made by the devil) always thinks it&#x27;s one of her overpriced oils, lol, and I just let her believe that to avoid a long spiel about why pyramid scheme oils are better quality and harvested in exclusive fields in exotic locales, whereas mine is made by satanic crackheads in a back alley in Los Angeles.  Anyhow, I do my research and know that this is good oil, so go ahead and give it a go. You can also use this oil on bug bites, bruises, minor scrapes and such and it works wonderfully. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.  If you love the smell of sweet orange oil, this is for you.  If not, then you might want to pass this on to a friend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and relaxing! Such a lovely, calming scent!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It smells delicious. I use it on my skin, in baths and sprinkled on the pillow at night.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil, I mix it with rose water and spray it on every morning... I usually get compliments saying how good I smell ... I sometimes mix it with other oils to change it up... I may not be for AL, though, my one gf doesn&#x27;t like the smell... More compliments than anything and it brings a smile to my face, relaxes me every time I spray and smell &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this Chill Pill essential oil.  I mix it with water to make a yoga mat cleaner and fragrance spritzer.  When I clean my mat after class people ask me what that wonderful smell is.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite. It&#x27;s a relaxing scent. I use it in my diffuser for the aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Helps me relax at night. I also use it before I go to yoga. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this scent...very relaxing.</li>
