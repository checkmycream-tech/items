            <li> Horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your time  .trust me..</li>
            <li> I found my wig to be at a satisfactory level.  With minor adjustments it fits perfectly.  I a SERIOUS wig wearer (over twenty five years) so I have some experience.  ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> Shorter than expected. But still cute.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied withe the  short Bob that I bought. They also sent me a free wig cap. Will definitely order from them again. And also the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> This product came really quick!! I love it. It does shed a bit which you should expect but I definitely love. It was shipped with a cap to put under the wig.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the comments. This is the worse wig I have ever bought and the last one I will buy from Amazon. It&#x27;s way too short for my head and its shed uncontrollably. I will be giving this to the thrift store. I wish I could send it back but, its not worth my time or effort. Lesson learned.... Lessons learned.</li>
            <li> The style of the wig is great, but the hair is not dense to my liking and the hair material does not look realistic.</li>
            <li> The hair color is perfect. I am shocked. The length is just right. Although it&#x27;s a little on the thin side but will work for the price of 7.99. Not bad at all. Wow I am shocked.</li>
            <li> It came on time. It looked like my hair as well. I need to take pictures and upload them, which I may do later. Worth the price but sheds a lot when you brush it.</li>
            <li> The quality is great. I cant get the style of the wig to flow right.</li>
            <li> When I got it did shed a little until I brush it got the loose hairs out now I love it they say you can curl it not true you can&#x27;t curl it another then that I love it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all don&#x27;t look like picture and 2 shiny</li>
            <li> I have not tried it yet but it&#x27;s not what I usually wear !!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig after reading the reviews and seeing other customers pictures. When I got the wig it was nothing like what was advertised. It was much shorter and shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> this was an ok buy but the wig that is shown here is not the one that I received in the mail. Mine is longer and there is no bob cut to it. I don&#x27;t know if they just shipped me the wrong one or not but this is not the product that I received. It does wear well and I have gotten lots of compliments on it</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this wig it looks cheap and fake</li>
    </ol>
