            <li>The best mouth guard ever!  </li>
            <li>Product is functional, but not the best.</li>
            <li>Having had a custom made mouth guard, and having tried this, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Yet, after fussing with this in my mouth for about 10 minutes, I fell asleep and had the best sleep of my life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are the best night guards I have tried.</li>
            <li>They are the best I have ever found in comfort and practicality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s the best one i&#x27;ve found.  </li>

            <li>Works very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had great teeth, perfect bite, no braces, etc.  </li>
            <li>to clean&lt;br /&gt;Soft or cushy plates which give lots of protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price!</li>
            <li>Plus, for those of you that have to wear mouth guards at night, if you wear the full mouth guard you drool!!!!  </li>
            <li>I guess I can&#x27;t expect that it would be as good as the one I had fitted years ago that sat perfectly on my teeth...</li>
            <li>I am so very pleased with this mouth guard!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best fitting tooth guard I&#x27;ve found!</li>

            <li>but im happy with the buy.</li>
            <li>Never had I experienced pain from grinding with or without wearing a mouthguard at night.  </li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>I bought this about 4 years ago and it still works great.</li>
            <li>happy with it.</li>

            <li>so happy to have found this product.</li>

            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very happy.</li>
            <li>I received my package yesterday in great time.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all a great purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to protect your teeth from night grinding.</li>
            <li>100% great mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have the problem I do with chewing on this thing it will probably work great for you.</li>
            <li>In any case, I am happy with it and do recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great night guard for me.  </li>
            <li>Fits great, not bulky..</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>If you have to wear a night guard this kind is the best, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still happy with its quality.</li>
            <li>But happy nonetheless.</li>
            <li>, I used it for years (replacing it every 6 months or so) and thought I was doing great with protecting my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This product was great until they added a flap that now cuts into my bottom gum.  </li>
            <li>This is really great product for dental guard.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was a joy not to wake up with a headache and pain in my jaw.  </li>
            <li>Worked great, but found a cheaper product that holds up as well as these do.  </li>
            <li>a great product</li>
            <li>This product works great if you are worried about grinding your teeth.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and spend the money to get this great guard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to adjust and best of all you don&#x27;t need to boil water or bite into any goo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was there to protect my teeth!!</li>
            <li>And if not, they&#x27;ll make lovely Christmas tree ornaments!!</li>
            <li>OK, so I grind my teeth at night!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using the comfort fit, used during sleep, my mouth likes it !!!</li>

            <li>Great delivery, fair price.</li>
            <li>It was nice that it came with a case too!</li>
            <li>I go asleep with it at the smallest size and fitting perfectly, and wake up with</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After so many product trials this one by DenTek is the best.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ears and eyes were OK, but my teeth were not in very good shape.  </li>
            <li>On the bright side you did get 2...</li>
            <li>price is really good too.</li>
            <li>The toime frame in which it arrived was also good.</li>
            <li>This way I&#x27;m never bothered by it and can always have good nights sleep.</li>
            <li>DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard came out the best.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>the design itself is not so good.</li>
            <li>Good:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fairly durable; the one i bought came with two guards.  </li>
            <li>she didn&#x27;t have a good answer.</li>
            <li>I try to give it a good cleaning every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>there and it feels good to know that I&#x27;m taking some measures and protecting my teeth.</li>
            <li>The price and design make it a good place to start if you are looking for a dental guard.</li>
            <li>i thought this would be a good interim substitute.</li>
            <li>it feels good, compared to the rest</li>
            <li>still a good</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product that does what it says, prevents nighttime teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and works as well as those custom made</li>
            <li>good buy for me, and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I received two in the package and a case, which was really a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DenTek is good about sending me a replacement since they have a guarantee on them.</li>
            <li>As good as the ones the dentist made for me.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t hear me grinding at night anymore, which is good.</li>
            <li>It works good as protection from teeth grinding</li>
            <li>I could adjust the size accordingly, which is good.</li>
            <li>and I have loved it...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to</li>
            <li>This guard is really good.</li>
            <li>Actually, I loved them for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>Good quality,</li>
            <li>I rely onreviews to help me make good purchases; I hope this review helped you, as well.reviews to help me make good purchases; I hope this review helped you, as well.</li>
            <li>It is well priced, and Dentec is a good name to rely on.</li>
            <li>I lost my mouth guard and thought this would be a good temporary replacement.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go (after cleaning it of course).</li>
            <li>Perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I didn&#x27;t find this to be a good value.</li>
            <li>This is the best fitting and most comfortable dental guard out there, awesome!</li>
            <li>Great price and very comfortable product.  </li>
            <li>Great fit!</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t heart and very comfortable!</li>
            <li>and I am very glad we did.  </li>
            <li>I am not a spokesperson, just a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li>Adjustable piece is nice, but tends to loosen after good night&#x27;s sleep</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent quality, great fit makes it well worth it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months now and love it!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>The price here is much better than in the pharmacy!</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m a pretty happy customer!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE these!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty impressed that it does the job.</li>
            <li>but I started using it during the day as needed and it is actually pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>For the first two weeks, I thought I&#x27;d found the best mouth guard.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It does the job---no more grinding!</li>
            <li>found this product at a pharmacy first, but it didn&#x27;t have the storage case with it and lost the bite guard in a matter of months, so the storage case is a wonderful addition to this product as I now always know where my bite guard is, and also know that it doesn&#x27;t have any dust on it from sitting out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>though you have to boil water to form the fit, it&#x27;s nice having a perfect form fitting guard when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it every night since I&#x27;ve gotten it and am very pleased how effective it is helping me not clench or grind my teeth.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s adjustable and has numbers on the adjustable part!</li>
            <li>My top teeth have bridges, caps, and molars, so I don&#x27;t want to do anything that would harm them!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I am sure to reorder again!</li>
            <li>This DenTek is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The boil and bite night guards work great to prevent the jaw popping, but the Dentek Comfort Fit does not seem to help with this.</li>
            <li>and these are amazing.</li>
            <li>but once we did it fit great.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I also have wisdom teeth in so they are great for the fortunate ones who can keep their.  </li>
            <li>This one is great because it can move freely and just provides a cushion.  </li>
            <li>It was kind of giving me an another stress as a must do task.  </li>
            <li>I think the manufacturer gives you some kind of warranty on it, but I&#x27;ve never tried it.</li>
            <li>The DenTek appliance has proved to be a reliable, effective, and affordable oral appliance.</li>
            <li>I really liked the material the bitewings were made of because they were on the softer side and did not bang against my teeth, causing pain throughout the night.</li>
            <li>but really he&#x27;s just happy when mama is happy.  </li>
            <li>I initially liked the design concept, but I found the plastic crossbar contacts the lower teeth.</li>
            <li>kind of like the feel of wearing a retainer,</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to know this before I bought it and stuck it in my mouth because I can&#x27;t return it now.</li>
            <li>This is not the products fault but my own.  </li>
            <li>This seemed to work for many others, so it is probably a good product...</li>
            <li>It is nice that this mouth guard does NOT require any boiling-water-fit-customization.  </li>
            <li>I have already used this kind of product for a year now.</li>
            <li>Quite nice design.</li>
            <li>This is what my mom wants for her birthday, and amazon seems to have the best price .</li>
            <li>comes as a two pack which is nice</li>
            <li>I liked about it</li>
            <li>so I really liked them.  </li>
            <li>;  In my opinion, non-molded or non-fitted guards can change your bite and cause more harm than good.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the older model for years and really liked it; in fact the best fitted to my need in comparison to all the others in the market.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that I can clean and reuse it until I wreck it</li>
            <li>The older model without the sides was perfect, but they discontinued it.</li>
            <li>Luckily they fit perfectly in the case that came with my SleepRight ones..</li>
            <li>I phoned DenTek and to their great credit they suggested a full refund which they promptly sent out.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable - great fit.  </li>
            <li>I had some issues with the fit of this mouth guard because of this flexibility and when I contacted the company they were more than happy to resolve my problems and send replacements.</li>
            <li>I love them they fit great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, easy, portable product.</li>
            <li>I like that this product fits in my mouth fairly easily and does a good job of protecting my teeth at night.</li>
            <li>I loved that this night guard required no boiling, and I also really liked the adjustable fit settings.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across this one and was very surprised and impressed by the performance and cost of this product.</li>
            <li>The teeth grips scrape your gums and it slips out very easily.</li>
            <li>I adjusted the sizing (which is very easy to do) and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this mouthpiece &amp; am so glad to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love this mouth guard more than the ones my dentist has made!  </li>
            <li>Very quickly (like 4-5 seconds) and put it in my mouth very quickly (fitted it like a mouth piece) and wa-la!!</li>
            <li>It is quite comfortable and as good as any mouth-guard that I have tried.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something comfortable to wear at night, this is not it, but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative that is designed to do what its supposed to, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>you truly suffer from grinding, clenching, or TMJ problems, the best solution for you is a mouth guard that is molded professionally to your teeth.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled I was able to sleep thru the night with this device in place.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>so I have tried plenty of mouth guards and this is by far the best one!</li>
            <li>This would be a good product for light clenching and grinding.</li>
            <li>far s dental guards go, these are probably the best.</li>
            <li>the kind that you boil and LOVE that compared to this.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t completely wrap around ANY teeth, so I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are swimming in a bacterial sludge when I wake up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll spend a good 10 minutes every night trying to make it fit.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li>I believe the design of this dental guard, with a thick-ish pad covering just 3 teeth, effectively increases the pressure exerted on the top of the tooth.</li>
            <li>I could never get a good fit.  </li>
            <li>Affordable, very easy -no boil-, don&#x27;t move at night, and very light.</li>
            <li>This product is not as good as the original one that I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Most comfortable dental guard I&#x27;ve used, and a good price for two.  </li>
            <li>The piece is adjustable, however, it fit perfectly for me straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>This one fits perfect and is not uncomfortable and you can talk without sounding like your mouth is full.  </li>
            <li>These guards work great and are not uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Thus far the Sleep Rite has been best, and, despite my not caring for the Den Tek, I would consider it second best (that others were THAT bad).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great device but priced higher than the others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, doesn&#x27;t rearrange my teeth, and lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Until I come up with a better solution (perhaps a more honest dentist and better insurance), I&#x27;m glad I found what works for the time being.</li>
            <li>He now wears it every night and said it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>A very cheap product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The guard is very comfortable once I sized it.  </li>
            <li>This is very comfortable and stays in your mouth all night this one stays in place</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to wear and you do not feel bulky.</li>
            <li>which makes it very comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and will continue to buy from them</li>
            <li>i have tried many others but this is the best one!&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t hurt, very flexible</li>
            <li>It works, will still test new products as they come available as neither are perfect.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s HUGE!</li>
            <li>I have tried many guards that have not worked.</li>
            <li>On top of the quality of design, construction and materials.</li>
            <li>it works better than my dentist&#x27;s custom made dental guard which cost me a lot of bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just not all that sure as a mouth sleeper that I wouldn&#x27;t dislodge it in my sleep</li>
            <li>so i guess i am ok for a year</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 3: It has been about 2 or 3 weeks since my last update and things are still working perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully DenTeck can figure out a fix to make the adjustment tabs more sturdy or perhaps change the system in how these guards adjust in size.</li>
            <li>I am overjoyed to have finally found a mouth guard that works wonderfully for me!  </li>
            <li>and I had to use it on my top teeth instead.  </li>
            <li>on top it does the trick though the plastic sizing thing doesn&#x27;t stay put</li>
            <li>better than i thought ..</li>
            <li>But for me, it has been my favorite of all the night guards I have tried.</li>
            <li>Comfort Fit is the best item so far.</li>
            <li>I tried many brands but they gagged me and I spit them out at night...</li>
            <li>Hopefully I can help others get the relief I have had from trying these, and also receive his approval to keep using it.  :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have tried resizing many times, but it still ends up sore.</li>
            <li>LOVE these.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did try it.</li>
            <li>Although, it is better than my teeth throbbing.</li>
            <li>&amp; I find I clench my teeth even more to keep them on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t clench my teeth trying to keep it in,my jaw relaxes more.</li>
            <li>But I also tend to try to get the most wear out of them that I can</li>
            <li>But I also tend to try to get the most wear out of them that I can</li>
            <li>I really love this product because it doesnt fill up my mouth.</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;m finding that I sleep MUCH better with this night</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wake up, and I feel so much more refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li>i need them at the shortest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, better than the bulky plastic mouth guards.</li>
            <li>i love these as they are not bulky but serve the purpose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d swallowed it because it doesn&#x27;t stay in place well in the mouth and between the top and bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If they made it with better stronger plastic</li>
            <li>Much better than the $200 acrylic guard my dentist made for me.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>product caused me more problems than I started with.  </li>
            <li>This one works better than the thicker one</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>By using the Den Tek, my tongue has more room</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all worth it to feel good in the morning and throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I used to *love</li>
            <li>This was even better then the custom mouthguard my dentist made for me.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use however the guard rubs my lower gums at night.</li>
            <li>After a while I noticed sore spots when putting the guard in at night where it rubs my gums, mostly in the rear.</li>
            <li>Love that it is adjustable.</li>
            <li>$30 isn&#x27;t pocket change, but if you end up liking this one, you&#x27;ll be so glad you tried it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, this mouthguard seems quite comfortable and effective at its designed purpose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, this mouthguard seems quite comfortable and effective at its designed purpose.</li>
            <li>I woke up many a nights with it out of my mouth.</li>
            <li>This guard is comfortable and fits nicely.  </li>
            <li>When I called the 800 number to inquire about this, the answerer assured me it was OK to use with an implant.</li>
            <li>so I have to keep order more.  </li>
            <li>So I find myself buying the more often than I would like.</li>
            <li>I guess I will continue to use until a better product is created.</li>
            <li>These mouth guards stay in place way better</li>
            <li>This is a nice guard that can be sized to fit your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Surely there must be something that works.  </li>
            <li>This is the only way you can ensure that it has the best chance of working for your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you DO happen to find an OTC night guard that works for you, I would say it is ok to keep using it if:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>You replace it as recommendedd an OTC night guard that works for you, I would say it is ok to keep using it if:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Easier to speak, and stays in place better.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll try adjusting his levels and see if it works better.</li>
            <li>I can see that it would idel  for most people who need a dental guard.</li>
            <li>I love the adjustability</li>
            <li>so I can wear it on my top or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>This is comfortable, doesn&#x27;t require boiling, and it came with TWO!</li>
            <li>You can purchase these in many places including Amazon.</li>
            <li>For people that still have &amp; grind their wisdom teeth (like myself) this prevents most night time grindings &amp; clenching but your wisdom teeth can still make contact from time to time.</li>
            <li>DenTek t is much better than made by dentist - because it is also stopping the grinding (the design of DenTek</li>
            <li>The touching gum element is weaking the grinding.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it has a carrying case and it brings two mouth pieces.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found this dental guard.</li>
            <li>, I flipped it over, with the strip going around my top teeth and found that to be better for me.</li>
            <li>I suspect fitting on the top or bottom is based on the shape of each person&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am so pleased-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 4 of these particular mouth guards and they work splendidly.  </li>
            <li>Most are not.</li>
            <li>but these are cheaper than many others too.</li>
            <li>Kudos to DenTek for making a truly comfortable night guard!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many off the shelf products including the Splintek Sleepright.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely and comfortably and works wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>Probably because I am sure they are used to calls like that all the time.</li>
            <li>and I think it will be more durable.</li>
            <li>If you have a favorite I would love to hear about them.  </li>
            <li>So comfortable!  </li>
            <li>These bite guards are better than the custom one made at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I have had many night guards, both dentist made and over the counter.</li>
            <li>it threw my jaw alignment off even more than my teeth-grinding ever had, so I bought these.  </li>
            <li>SO much better.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the boil type of guard which is so bulky in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I never had it in my mouth for more like 15 minutes, I just couldn&#x27;t take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SOOOO glad I bought the DenTek</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slim yet works better than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, I am saving my pearly whites from being grinded into dust.</li>
            <li>But it has relieved many stress headaches from the jaw clenching and stopped me from cracking my molars at night.  </li>
            <li>so I am waiting until I am better off</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>If you have a problem with Dentek guard, make sure you call them within 30 days.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t rub my gums and don&#x27;t feel like my football mouthguard like most over the counter dental guards.</li>
            <li>Wish they came in more than &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of years and it beats most of the over the counter items.</li>
            <li>I would have returned product within 30 day period, if I was paying more attention to time.</li>
            <li>and I love that it has a case.  </li>
            <li>SISU night guards are better</li>
            <li>I think the bulkier guards are actually a better bet.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not a grinder as much as a clencher and these work great for me.</li>
            <li>Switching from a softer bite guard that has more give to this rigid version was not agreeable.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I do have to wear it on my top teeth because it rubbed on my gums when wearing it on the bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li>And on the side of my face that hurts, though most people recommend against that.  </li>
            <li>things are invaluable and have more than paid for themselves with my increased ability to work.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many off the shelf mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable length of it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love that it is adjustable.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>It made me clench my jaw even more.</li>
            <li>I got a Smartguard that works better ...</li>
            <li>This product really works great.</li>
            <li>If it had been shorter it might have worked better.  </li>
            <li>It keeps all of his teeth from touching.</li>
            <li>So he seems so be sleeping better at night and not waking up grumpy.</li>
            <li>He is glad I purchased this</li>
            <li>and I am enjoying sleeping in peace.</li>
            <li>Daughter wears an upper retainer and this dental guard is designed to wear on the bottom so it works perfectly for her!</li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to, but OK.</li>
            <li>and although I never had a fitting for a night guard from a dentist, I did try the boil variety</li>
            <li>that said, Im ordering my second one because this seems to be the best guard on the market for clenchers.</li>
            <li>This guard is a lot slimmer than most store-bought guards, but the bite pads are way too bulky.</li>
            <li>snored more when using&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure I have a preference yet.</li>
            <li>Great idea, but I was in so much pain</li>
            <li>Has saved my teeth. :)</li>
            <li>and I stopped using it and decided to try the much more minimalist DenTek.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>gums were in pain for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have worn a night guard from my dentist for many years without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I could then sleep through the night with it, most nights.</li>
            <li>It was OK.</li>
            <li>However, it was OK.  </li>
            <li>&quot; and it may even be better, but it is not what I am used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad he did</li>
            <li>but there were many upon many flaws with those that I can just say don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this night guard.  </li>
            <li>so it keeps my teeth apart better,</li>
            <li>This kit is definitely more affordable than the dentist made version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many dental guards</li>
            <li>Most of them fill up with saliva</li>
            <li>not saying this would happen to most people</li>
            <li>I love this dental guard -</li>
            <li>This pic is a better representation than the official product photo, of the guard I received.</li>
            <li>This is a much better solution to my teeth grinding problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product more than once</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>This may work well for someone who isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mobile&amp;#34; while they sleep, but I&#x27;m a kicker, and more often than not this thing falls out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m not in love</li>
            <li>and I will be able to use them again.</li>
            <li>So, it seems by trying to save money and not paying for the mouth guard made by the dentist, I will have to pay more for orthodontics.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Needs to be adjusted more than I would like.</li>
            <li>I switched to the Plackers dental guards and they work even better</li>
            <li>They made my jaw hurt more.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look too sturdy out of the box, but it does the job, stays in my mouth at night, not grinding, totally pleased.</li>
            <li>Does it&#x27;s job...and protects my teeth... :-)</li>
            <li>Better bargain than what the dentist provides.</li>
            <li>in that it had a guard that went over the top and bottom.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want that...but its still ok.</li>
            <li>The boil-and-bite type I use now is form-fitted to all my teeth, so the pressure is more evenly distributed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see signs of grinding on the guard, so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many bite guards and most are bulky or they rub my gums and cause sores.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the slim design of the mouth guard but with regards to protecting my molars specifically, it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having headaches when most mornings when I wake</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose to give this stars despite the issues I&#x27;ve come across because I really love the idea of the design.</li>
            <li>I wish they would be made more of rubber based material.</li>
            <li>Just need to keep them very clean as it does give you some funky breath.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good dental guard.  </li>
            <li>And truly, when I received the two-pack and inspected the product, I thought it a pretty wise buy.</li>
            <li>He says it fits pretty good</li>
            <li>At first I absolutely loved it,  </li>
            <li>However this detek is more convenent and really easy to wear/ adjust and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually more comfortable to wear it over the top teeth.  </li>
            <li>I took a razor blade and modified the guard to fit a bit better by trimming off some of the lower most plastic off.</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable than most.</li>
            <li>They are cheaper than many of the \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; type mouth guards I&#x27;ve seen and work fine.  </li>
            <li>ironically, even better than the SleepRights fit in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable now.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;d rather not wear one at all, but these are the most comfortable I&#x27;ve found for my mouth .</li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;d rather not wear one at all, but these are the most comfortable I&#x27;ve found for my mouth .</li>
            <li>After a lot of research, I chose the Dentek Comfort Fit Dental Guard and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li>The old version worked great.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the disposables as they have a better fit for my mouth.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s so much more comfortable than the ones that cover all your teeth.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not made to fit your top teeth, but it will work).</li>
            <li>It is more comfortable then others I have used.</li>
            <li>On my search for another dental guard that is of softer material and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is the most comfortable store bought guard I have used.</li>
            <li>This one is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit has a feature of touching the gum).</li>
            <li>I cannot say for sure that people with grinding/more severe cases that this would work well, but I think for just an average clencher, this works great!</li>
            <li>I tried one that fit over my top teeth-</li>
            <li>They were a bit more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Much more convent and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is thee most comfortable one to use while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>It stands up to my monster jaws&#x27; clenching and you can change the length to make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>, I find it more comfortable this way.</li>
            <li>Most comfortable night guard I have tried so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this mouthguard, it is so comfortable and lightweight</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I&#x27;m glad that I got this one instead of the bulky ones that are available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Lessen the bulkiness of the bite pads, and maybe it would be more universally comfortable.</li>
            <li>It fit much better that way.  </li>
            <li>These would be a LOT more comfortable if they were made out of a pliable rubber?!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ON top of that I can breathe, they are comfortable and they don&#x27;t look or feel  like a sports mouth guard hanging out of your mouth ( play rugby).</li>
            <li>The fit was pretty good and did not irritate my mouth at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most comfortable and best-fitting nightguard I&#x27;ve come across, and it includes two in each pack.</li>
            <li>This has been the most comfortable night guard I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>My jaw is more comfortable and relaxed throughout the day.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the position easily, and more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t need to be boiled, and it is not bulky at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is super easy to adjust and extremely comfortable and effective to wear.</li>
            <li>dental guard is slim, I am able to close my mouth comfortably, and my mouth feels fine in the morning.</li>
            <li>, other than that, the cost is perfect</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t find the original ones or anything better.  </li>
            <li>and I fall asleep easily now</li>
            <li>It is not bulky, instructions are easy to understand and THERE ARE 2 OF THEM IN THE BOX.</li>
            <li>My dentist tells me I gag easily but should use a night guard.  </li>
            <li>sure to clean it every morning.</li>
            <li>It fits easily in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>The product is adjustable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>easy to sleep.</li>
            <li>I can easily wear this all through the night without any discomfort or irritation.</li>
            <li>and easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li>The adjustments easy.</li>
            <li>It cleans easily every morning</li>
            <li>it is easy to sleep with since it is not bulky at all.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and work better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>They are easy on the mount.</li>
            <li>These work great and have better protection than my last pair.</li>
            <li>It is easy use</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust and serves the purpose of preventing jaw clenching.  </li>
            <li>and it is so easy to use</li>
            <li>Adjustments are easy</li>
            <li>I got used to them very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but I felt so strongly about it that I wanted to warn people not to buy this thinking it would help them at all.</li>
            <li>I strongly preferred  the Grind</li>
            <li>First, I tried the kind you boil.  </li>
            <li>Surely this couldn&#x27;t have been true.</li>
            <li>I sleep comfortably, better than a full mouth guard which makes me drool, and I just can&#x27;t stand to have on.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, the size is perfect, as my mouth is small.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like being required to use a certain number of words!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to fit (no boiling water required), and it lasts me 6 months.</li>
            <li>but I still think it works fine.</li>
            <li>However, it may work just fine for someone who does not have jaw problems in addition to teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>Well, when you wake up after a night with these things in your mouth, you realize that they stay in place just fine since you are buying the product b/c you clench your mouth at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this product could extended another quarter to half inch it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Its also easy to misplace with its light colors.</li>
            <li>it works fine but took a while to get the plastic taste off of it.  </li>
            <li>I can sleep just fine with it, and I wake up with no sore spots or anything like that.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and comfortable where it does not interfere with sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily I got over that, and the mouth guard survived!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wear, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard for her is extremely comfortable, not bulky at all, easy to use and wear, adjustable, no boiling-to-fit needed, and doesn&#x27;t interfere with her braces at all.</li>
            <li>acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;I am super bummed because I have not been able to find a comfortable night guard since I stopped using these ( a year ago).</li>
            <li>i adjusted it per the directions and it fit fine.</li>
            <li>After the first night, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, it&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing in the world, but I slept pretty soundly and without any mishaps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can easily talk and smile while wearing it!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and very comfortable after the first night or so.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so huge that I can&#x27;t get to sleep with it</li>
            <li>These night guards make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I adjusted one of the mouthguards to fit onto my lower teeth comfortably, and that night I was sleeping sound.</li>
            <li>they are the closest to what a dentist has to offer at a huge fraction of the costs.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, affordable, easy to clean and store.  </li>
            <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t huge</li>
            <li>and it was huge</li>
            <li>-- it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve placed some huge block of plastic in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>just not for me - didn&#x27;t fit and i have to get a dentist to make me a night guard - these may work for others but not for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the SleepRight custom fit night guards and they threw my jaw out of alignment, not to mention made my jaw sore and gave it cuts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable,</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get these things to fit well in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The part that goes across the front was digging into my lip and if I flipped it over it didn&#x27;t fit correctly on the sides.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>so I went on the search of a comfortable night guard</li>
            <li>fit\\&quot; guards to fit comfortably in their mouths.</li>
            <li>I have used the boil and fit type mouth guards for my teeth grinding and clenching.  </li>
            <li>I bought these Den Tek Comfort Fit Guards hoping these would work for me.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried the DenTek Comfort Fit.  </li>
            <li>Quite comfortable but the size adjustment won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a comfortable dental guard that works.</li>
            <li>The ones you boil for a custom fit always gagged me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried ones that you boil and one that just fit the front teeth.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars, but I still don&#x27;t enjoy having it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>My dentist wanted me to shell out (admittedly insurance would pay for it but still) over $500.00 for a guard that was custom made and fit for me.</li>
            <li>they all will), but you can just readjust the sizing to fit again.</li>
            <li>These are the best things I&#x27;ve found,I don&#x27;t have any trouble wearing them.</li>
            <li>would recommend DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard.</li>
            <li>I have worn these every night for a week now and they are extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>Should I need to replace them for any reason, I will do so happily because I would have to have purchased 10 sets of these to equal one made by the dentist.</li>
            <li>I am a female and the mouth guard fits great.  </li>
            <li>The problem it is made so cheaply.  </li>
            <li>If you need a mouth guard for TMJ, get one from your dentist so they can properly fit you and help you along the way.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s also relatively cheap and for me</li>
            <li>But if you have problems like me, then this will no longer be comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>Comfort Fit NightGuard</li>
            <li>primarily because it did not require any boiling.</li>
            <li>mouth guard fits comfortably around my lower jaw.</li>
            <li>It does not bite into the gums and I can close my mouth comfortably around it.</li>
            <li>It works great, but for some reason, I keep spitting out in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was so comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It fits nicely and very flexible.</li>
            <li>guard fit</li>
            <li>and my mouth closes comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do the job, but it&#x27;s not as comfortable as the custom fit ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adjustable to fit just about any mouth.</li>
            <li>The guards also last great.  </li>
            <li>This product is NOT a \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot;, rather, it fits SOME people correctly, but chancing that it will fit you is throwing $30 out the window, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in your mouth</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in your mouth</li>
            <li>reason I like this mouth guard is that it&#x27;s flexible and you can adjust the sides to fit into your mouth.</li>
            <li>I like the case and happy to have an extra one on hand!</li>
            <li>For me, i prefer the boil to custom fit type guards.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable for me, I have adjusted them for my mouth.  </li>
            <li>tried it on and After adjusting it, it did fit.</li>
            <li>It feels light in my mouth, it works and I can even talk with it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t sleep comfortably with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li>It is completely comfortable and does not interfere with my sleep.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable.</li>
            <li>Keeps you from grinding your teeth and it&#x27;s comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Took a few nights to figure out my perfect setting.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and leaves no sore spots in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable and protects my teeth.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the size to fit your mouth without the hassle of trying to boil and mold it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and there&#x27;s no need to boil water to fit.</li>
            <li>They were comfortable when they were in tack</li>
            <li>I had another really nice mouthguard but there was just too much going on in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Comfort Fit NightGuard.</li>
            <li>After using this item you may find that your teeth will no longer fit together like they used to once your jaw muscles weaken.  </li>
            <li>DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard did NOT work well for me.  </li>
            <li>But I think it is more hygienic to replace it and get fresh ones anyways, so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>Because saliva flows freely around your teeth, you don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with a gamey,</li>
            <li>They fit in your mouth well but do not have the cushion needed.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and has an adjusting strap to fit propertly.</li>
            <li>Comfort Fit because they are Guaranteed 1 year,  ...</li>
            <li>This guard uses a cheap bit of plastic that won&#x27;t hold its shape, and won&#x27;t even hold the adjustable positioning.  </li>
            <li>It fits comfortably and stays in place all night.</li>
            <li>However, I woke up with no headache and a week into it still headache free</li>
            <li>Recommend these over plastic, melt to fit type.</li>
            <li>The primary reason why I switched over to DenTek is the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, but fits comfortably over her teeth.  </li>
            <li>Like the style but not the fit.  </li>
            <li>This dental guard is a great size, it fits a smaller mouth with no problems.  </li>
            <li>It does the job and has held up well, but it is not as comfortable for me as the thinner version.</li>
            <li>They are light weight and comfortable for her to wear.</li>
            <li>I wash it every morning and adjust it to fit every evening before popping it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and adjust.  </li>
            <li>one (the smallest size) did fit lengthwise.  </li>
            <li>I tried this, &#x27;DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit&#x27;, and</li>
            <li>I am giving this guard 4 stars as it is comfortable for me to wear--way beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>, I feel they are move comfortable too.</li>
            <li>It does take some adjusting to get comfortable  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comfortable with no pinching or rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I just can&#x27;t seem to wear this comfortably.</li>
            <li>Experienced TMJ and needed to stop clenching at night to prevent massive headaches.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit that comfortably in my mouth</li>
            <li>I could find that fit my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced Comfort Dental Protector for Teeth Grinding&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The pad does have a rubbery &#x27;give&#x27; to it, and I found the guard comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>The price is great because the 2 guards can last for months.  </li>
            <li>Its adjustable to fit any mouth.</li>
            <li>it was comfortable and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have worn nightguards for over 20 years, and I loved the old DenTek comfort fit guard.</li>
            <li>The adjustment capability is more of a joke than anything; good luck getting them the same on both sides.</li>
            <li>The original design worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Wearing sleep right for many years.</li>
            <li>This is a very good alternative product other than prescription mouth guard.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use and nicer than the full coverage dental guards.</li>
            <li>This product is simple to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>this one is better than the huge hot water deal...</li>
            <li>I picked this one up and have been pretty happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>It is not bulky, I can still talk &amp; smile with it in...which is pretty amazing since it is a night guard</li>
            <li>I was also concerned about the durability since it seems pretty flimsy, but so far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit, small and compact..</li>
            <li>When I first tried the DenTek Dental guards they were so much more comfortable</li>
            <li>They are much more comfortable, but the slide around more since they are smaller and more flexible.</li>
            <li>Great product as long as durability holds up</li>
            <li>When I mentioned seeing them before, he wasn&#x27;t familiar with them.  </li>
            <li>mentioned seeing them before, he wasn&#x27;t familiar with them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Den Tek for about a month and it has significantly helped with my severe sleep apnea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that this voids warranty or what</li>
            <li>I tried many mouth guards that you put in hot water</li>
            <li>I have tried several dental guards and this is by far the best fit.</li>
            <li>My original mouth guard cost $400.  </li>
            <li>the pads had signs of significant wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple night guard, and like most people with a smaller mouth, this one fits wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>When I first received them I wasn&#x27;t sure they would work</li>
            <li>The adjustment option is unique and well received in my mouth.</li>
            <li>SleepRight&#x27;s equipment feels better at first.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I want the original product that is shown.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning it is not hard just clean it as if it was your own teeth.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t too large, it would be a very comfortable guard.</li>
            <li>I recommend hydrogen peroxide baths to clean these + toothbrushing.</li>
            <li>Super comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is super comfortable.</li>
            <li>Easier to clean than the fitted guards.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s comfortable (when its fit right).</li>
            <li>i like these better than the throw aways, i just wash them with super hot water and antiseptic mouth wash, and i found that using senseodine tooth paste helps with the irratation these can sometimes cause.</li>
            <li>Still looking for that great mouthguard that is durable and comfortable, it seems like you can get one or the other, but not both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that most of the mouth guards are so large they trigger a gag reflex</li>
            <li>Love them and it certainly saved me a lot of money.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the older model is still available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I would pay double for more finely honed plastic parts - smoother, more rounded, maybe some size choices.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving how it works.</li>
            <li>This was true for me</li>
            <li>I could find a guard that made full contact to my bite line without wearing on my gums or saliva buildup, I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li>I still gagged and returned it however if you are looking for a night guard with a low profile it is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m gagging &amp; have a mouth full of saliva all night.</li>
            <li>Good to know these can last.</li>
            <li>this is a good product....fits in my mouth well and there were two (blue) guards in the box with a one year warranty.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Den Tek.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than the boil guards that cover top teeth.</li>
            <li>The bitting pad is the only good thing about it, although the 1st one had to be replaced by the 4th night.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good thought, especially beings that is</li>
            <li>Good thing they come in double packs!</li>
            <li>Better than the whole mouth ones (my opinion)  can still talk with it in</li>
            <li>No one can really tell I am even wearing the guard most of the time.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t make my mouth water like the full size</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend it :)</li>
            <li>The full molds often give me neck pain in the morning, but I had none with this.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good option since it is smaller</li>
            <li>I used these when my NTI and full mouth piece mouth guard were being made.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to have a mouth full of crowns, so took my dentist&#x27;s advice and bought a bite guard.</li>
            <li>The dental guard is very slim and fits much better then</li>
            <li>but it does not actually work as good for avoiding headaches in the morning.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s better than getting a custom guard, but I haven&#x27;t found myself using this very often.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED these night guards initially.  </li>
            <li>For the price, they should last a lot longer, but I&#x27;ll still order them as they do a good job.</li>
            <li>and i slept soundly through the night(very rare).</li>
            <li>Both get chewed up in 3 months, then I send in for 1 more, so really you get 3 for your money.  </li>
            <li>The old one would rub my gums, so I&#x27;d have to wear it a bit shorter than I liked, which caused it to float in my mouth and make my unconscious body chew on it.</li>
            <li>The headaches are not gone completely but not as many or as strong.</li>
            <li>I used the first guard for almost a year and it stayed strong, did not break, crack or chewed thru at all.</li>
            <li>Edges a bit too sharp to be great.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any other guards, so can not compare them, but I am happy with these and would buy them again.</li>
            <li>So simple, easy to use and comfortable for the most part.</li>
            <li>MIght not be the best though for serious grinders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>formerly the unit would conform around on the top of your top teeth</li>
            <li>After months of intensifying jaw pain and increasing clicking and locking of my jaw muscles it was quickly reversed.</li>
            <li>It actually feels nice to have the light elevation on the jaw.</li>
            <li>They wear quickly.</li>
            <li>so I quickly purchased this.  </li>
            <li>and this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>and I do go through them much faster than the 6 months promised, but it is worth it to me to buy them more often for the comfort.</li>
            <li>This one is much better, I can actually keep it in most of the night.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, these came in a 2-pack, so to follow my dentist&#x27;s orders, as well as support my guy in wearing his, I tried out the remaining den-tek</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally found a worthwhile dental guard.</li>
            <li>This is the only  dental guard my wife is able to use, we are really pleased.  </li>
            <li>I often woke up with a mild jawache using this as a result.</li>
            <li>The original guard was very large and cumbersome.</li>
            <li>I was at first pleased by the positive reviews that I&#x27;d seen of this dental guard.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the Stop Grinding Mouth Guard by BioGrind, because its reviews were more positive than those for the DenTek Dental Guard.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended trying an over the counter guard first before spending $100s on a custom fit guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was worried when I first purchased them that they wouldn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>I have used these guards for the last year and am very satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>I do not like buying dental guards that I have to boil and put a very hot dental guard into my moouth to shape it.</li>
            <li>This one is more comfortable without a doubt, but the other one is definitely more durable.</li>
            <li>This one is more comfortable without a doubt, but the other one is definitely more durable.</li>
            <li>new one is bulkier with more plastic.  </li>
            <li>Proof positive for me was when my dentist confirmed that I&#x27;d halted the toll that grinding was taking on my molars *</li>
            <li>On the other hand, my sister loves hers, so to each his own!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different bite guards over the years, but this is the first that I&#x27;ve been able to keep in my mouth over night without gagging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be a LOT happier if I didn&#x27;t have to wear one in the first place though!</li>
            <li>I wish I had found this product first!</li>
            <li>This guard will help you reduce the pain from clenching while working on the reasons why you have this in the first place!</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Even more amazing is the fact that I can see slight improvement in my gum recession.  </li>
            <li>Then it popped out and on top of my tongue, but I didn&#x27;t swallow it and easily put it back.</li>
            <li>This got misshapen by the first night i used it, and the pockets for the expansions are a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>The smallest setting was a bit to large for my mouth, however it was useable and comfortable.</li>
            <li>If you want your teeth to look nice for your 90th birthday photos, consider spending a little more and get something that works (no, I am NOT a dentist).</li>
            <li>wish Den Tek would bring back the old design and give their customers a choice of the guard that works best for them instead of totally discontinuing and replacing a product that worked just fine.</li>
            <li>This guard is fairly easy to use, and is somewhat comfortable, but I find the other DenTek dental guard significantly more comfortable:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>like the fact that the strap is thinner, and the fit is much closer to my teeth.</li>
            <li>It definitely fit, thanks to the ability to adjust them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite comfortable as there is not so much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in your mouth.</li>
            <li>The adjustability really makes it comfortable to wear at night.</li>
            <li>The second night, I cut off the top of the T, so now I had a L shape to fit over my bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li>I bought these after using the ones you have to boil for about year, and the switch was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Beware: Most of the reviews here are based on the old design of this night guard.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using all types of \\&quot;nite-guards\\&quot; for years and have yet to find the most comfortable and longest lasting.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore my old dentist night guard covered my bottom teeth while these \\&quot;boil to fit\\&quot; models cover your top teeth.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>I think it works better than the professional ones too.</li>
            <li>My dentist also informed me that with guards such as this kind</li>
            <li>Even better, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with closing your mouth completely as the b&amp;b did.</li>
            <li>It is nice that this one comes with two, so I will just reorder when I need to start on the second guard.  </li>
            <li>This guard took some adjusting to get a comfortable fit, but if I pull the sizer out as far as it will go, it doesn&#x27;t rub on my gums.  </li>
            <li>Not like chewing a gum but biting on it and it kind of hurts my back teeth.</li>
            <li>Throughout my adult life, I have had many dental problems--my molars would crumble and I&#x27;d have to get them replaced, until all of my molars were crowns.</li>
            <li>now I will stick to the placker&#x27;s dental guard, as they are more comfortable and can be purchased at my local dollar store.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a go because you get two in the box</li>
            <li>I have tried several others that fit on top and it almost seems those cut my breath off...</li>
            <li>Essentially every kind you can buy, I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>For my money, worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that my teeth will move back on their own, but it looks like I will have to get the guard that is made for me at some point</li>
            <li>Hold up well, they do irritate my gums sometimes though, and the inside of my cheek too, but way worth the benefit.</li>
            <li>I found that I&#x27;ve had more, not less, soreness during the day since I started wearing this at night.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it is better than many other mainstream mouth guards I have tried.</li>
            <li>line: this one is ok, but the other is much better.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling that if you are a teeth grinder you might chew through this guard pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>they are pretty comfortable and most definitely a lot cheaper than what the dentist was going to charge.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these mouth guards for about a year and replace them about every 6 months (right after each dentist visit).  </li>
            <li>says right on the box do not use for TMJ disorder.&lt;br /&gt;Heard of the VA scandal?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced right and comes with two gaurds and a storage case.</li>
            <li>These wings rest right at my gumline</li>
            <li>I received this mouth guard and followed the instructions right away.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to boil it, shape it in any way, just use it right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Not the right product, didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I still really live this product as a person with a strong gag reflex (insert joke here).</li>
            <li>Also, since there isn&#x27;t much to it, I feel like it is easier to clean and just cleaner in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is surprising how small and comfortable it is, and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>It goes back to normal, but can that be good for your teeth?</li>
            <li>Please save your money or go with the classic boil and fit style guards-</li>
            <li>was anxious about it staying in place, but so far, it stays in place perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product, and I&#x27;d recommend anyone who&#x27;s used to using the full cover mouthguards to at least give these a try.</li>
            <li>The plastic shows no sign of wear where I bite down - pretty amazing!  </li>
            <li>I assume this new model is here to stay, but I wish they would go back to the older version, which I liked much better.</li>
            <li>contrast, this style of night guard is not only extremely comfortable - it is minimalist and gives just the right amount of protection; it&#x27;s also budget-friendly, easy to sterilize, transport, etc.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and much cheaper then the typical dental guards.</li>
            <li>I hardly notice it - and it is effective in greatly lessening the ache and occasional pain</li>
            <li>The first few nights, I was guessing, but I quickly found that it fits me best at 2 on the left and 3 on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow - so much better than the giant frontal mouthguards that require boiling and fitting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now my lower teeth have moved outward far enough that my upper teeth perfectly rest on my lower braces, even with the bonding material.  </li>
            <li>These would be great even if they were sold at the usual price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is so great, that it made me write one.</li>
            <li>We liked the idea that it doesn&#x27;t require melting plastic to mold it to your mouth, but this is one is clearly not one size fits all.</li>
            <li>Nothing large and protruding to try and sleep with Buy them!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have an unusual jaw (for example, m.tori), then you will most likely be okay with the new design.</li>
            <li>I have tried three different \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; night-time night guards, but could not get one to fit my mouth comfortably.  </li>
            <li>This was the ONLY mouth guard that fit in my mouth that was comfortable (</li>
            <li>does the job for $25 and is actually more comfortable (from what I have heard from those who spent that 2 grand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used generic versions of the same design and they were great.  </li>
            <li>These Comfort Fit dental guards are light and open but they protect well and stand up to my molars.  </li>
            <li>I doubt it would have lasted another month), my bite had significantly changed after each night and would take hours to return to normal.</li>
            <li>We have gone through several dental guards, but the DenTek&#x27;s are the first pair to actually fit comfortably</li>
            <li>caused me and my husband to grip even harder, not for me but glad I did not spend the money to have my dentist make one!</li>
            <li>RIGHT SLIM COMFORT is pricey and last up to a month top.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very much, cause it makes my inside cheek area puffy after wearing it all night.</li>
            <li>This is a very reasonably priced alternative to custom made guards.  </li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>This new one changes the blue plastic that your teeth hit in a way that is way more comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot decide whether I find this more comfortable than other mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>That one is almost the exact same design, except that this one is much more comfortable, as the plastic pieces that fit between top &amp; bottom teeth is so much smaller that it allows your jaw to rest comfortably (unlike the other brand&#x27;s model).  </li>
            <li>This particular package comes with cleaning powder, which is cool.  </li>
            <li>The new version is thicker than my original one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horribly priced, but it&#x27;s got me looking at other products again for items that may last longer or fit more</li>
            <li>An annoyance most guards give me is the inability to speak and these are definitely not sexy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These stayed exactly where they started from the beginning of the night to end.  </li>
            <li>: Make sure you get the ones with the blue bite pads.  </li>
            <li>I have been using DenTek for years and this is the first time i have used this model.  </li>
            <li>I saw their products on ebay, too, but the reviews on ebay are too short to be able to get an informed opinion.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds of over-the-counter night guards, trying to avoid paying hundreds of dollars for one from the dentist, and this one works well for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using the first one.</li>
            <li>The first night I spit them out because it hurt my lower gums.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I have posted</li>
            <li>This happened on the first night and with both of the guards in the twin pack.</li>
            <li>The first night I wore it,  the clicking and jaw discomfort did not subside.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get these first before getting the one the dentist recommends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to deal with migraines from it &amp; had to use muscle relaxers when the muscle in my jaw became so inflammed &amp; irritated that the whole side of my face &amp; neck swelled up!</li>
            <li>ok, first of all, i bought these at Target for $18 a month ago - way cheaper than Amazon&#x27;s current price of $29!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first mouth guard i can sleep with, even though i wake up every morning</li>
            <li>you shape with hot water and your teeth, but they are so bulky</li>
            <li>You get two of them in the package but my first set did not come with a case to put them in and I ended up loosing them when I was traveling.</li>
            <li>When I first got the product, I was pretty unimpressed.</li>
            <li>I thought it should have made it through the first week...  </li>
            <li>This mouth guard left sores in my mouth and had my jaw hurting more than</li>
            <li>As I said, this was a first for me.  </li>
            <li>this mouth guard for years- when it only had one ridge (covering just the side of the bottom teeth &amp; in between top &amp; bottom teeth).</li>
            <li>Then DenTek changed the design to add another ridge/wing, maybe 3-5 months ago, (now there&#x27;s plastic covering both the sides of upper &amp; lower teeth &amp; in-between top &amp; bottom)</li>
            <li>Just rinse under hot water and insert into the mouth.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for their first mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard is by far the easiest guard to use.  </li>
            <li>This is first night guard I tried after doing a bit of research.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is a better deal, overall.</li>
            <li>noticed after the first couple of nights wearing it that I had TMJ pain and soreness when my teeth touched together (which lingered for about an hour after waking up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TMJ has a natural \\&quot;resting\\&quot; point that is comfortable for your jaw.</li>
            <li>Just be aware when I used this dental guard for one night it threw my bite off for days</li>
            <li>Still, it seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li>I had greater pain in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a try first.</li>
            <li>Took me one or two nights to get used to it, but I am overall satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>the first two nights I lost it and found it in the sheets.</li>
            <li>The clenching and pressure is focused mostly on my molars, so I did not need any of those big bulky trays.</li>
            <li>First off, my problem is teeth clenching, not grinding, so this is what this review is based one.</li>
            <li>I wore it the first time and it hurt my bottom gums,but the following night i put it on my top teeth and</li>
            <li>This one by DenTek is different - comfortable from the time I put it in!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay $400 for a guard from the dentist, especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think I relax more since I know I won&#x27;t be chomping on my back molars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this, now i&#x27;m definitely saving my molars.</li>
            <li>After trying several over-the-counter mouth guards, I found this one to be by far the most comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I had one of those retainers you put in hot water</li>
            <li>actually sleep with it covering my top molars rather than my bottom</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the fault of the product exactly, but be warned you should consider a dental appliance for bruxing if you have the means.ancially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the fault of the product exactly, but be warned you should consider a dental appliance for bruxing if you have the means.</li>
            <li>They sent me Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard at no cost.  </li>
            <li>It requires heating in hot water to form to your teeth</li>
            <li>the Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard feels and looks just like my wife&#x27;s (and she paid a couple hundred at the dentist).  </li>
            <li>: First, I hear up a hot rice or heat pad and wrap it in a towel.  </li>
            <li>This one looked like it had been used for six months after the first night--</li>
            <li>This dental guard worked really well for me, but I think your success with it depends on your issue.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be working great the first couple weeks, but lately I do still wake up with a sore jaw and headache some mornings even though I wear it at night.</li>
            <li>And it actually prevented it(for most of the time), and my braces did not break from my tooth anymore.</li>
            <li>I was nervous after the first night</li>
            <li>but since this is made by a dental company with a support team that can help with questions, and they work for me, I am thinking its better than continuing to use nothing regularly grind away.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this dental guard would fall out of my mouth, as it seems like there is nothing holding it in place, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now</li>
            <li>When I first saw DenTek, out of the box, it did not feel as comfortable as the old SleepRight I was using.</li>
            <li>She has had the first one since January of this year and hasn&#x27;t had to change it out.</li>
            <li>This is my first time getting a mouth guard.</li>
            <li>I tried to put it on the first night</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it</li>
            <li>They do exactly as they are supposed to: they protect your teeth at night from grinding IF they stay in.</li>
            <li>Would probably work ok for someone with a larger mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first started buying one that you heat and shape</li>
            <li>its more than likely</li>
            <li>It hurt my gums at first for a couple of weeks, but once I got used to it, it was all comfort.</li>
            <li>(doesn&#x27;t stop the grinding, but it prevents the lower teeth from touching the upper teeth.)</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY dental guard I am able to wear.</li>
            <li>They recommend you \\&quot;see your dentist for a consultation within the first 3 months of using the product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Always come back for more.</li>
            <li>This is the only mouth guard I have been able to tolerate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through so many different kinds of nightguards.</li>
            <li>The pictures show EXACTLY what you get.</li>
            <li>I used my guard the first night, and while I did fall out the first night, that has not repeated in the weeks since.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s pretty bulky).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since moved onto cheaper and smaller moldable guards that have been much better.</li>
            <li>However, I have a filling on the top of my back molar which broke twice while I was using this guard --</li>
            <li>It cracked the first night after I started using the guard, and the repaired filling cracked again after about two months of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mouth guards and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my mouth hurt by the morning.</li>
            <li>i first purchased these</li>
            <li>this is my first mouth guard (box had two)</li>
            <li>first night using it</li>
            <li>They last a while, but I change these out more than recommended.</li>
            <li>Plus they sent 2, which I wasn&#x27;t aware of when I ordered.</li>
            <li>However, the first night it gave me blisters on my gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Custom made ones fit perfectly, but they are very expensive.</li>
            <li>I would have liked a case to store them in but they fit in the many cases left from the other gaurds I&#x27;ve tried or in Mom&#x27;s old denture dish, so</li>
            <li>Well, that&#x27;s about it,  better size and less material, but it isn&#x27;t comfortable, it irritates my gums and cheeks, and I don&#x27;t sleep well at night with it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The previous version without these was much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minimally invasive and easy to fit.</li>
            <li>After one night, DenTek delivers as promised, and most importantly, cost less.</li>
            <li>I have previously used an acqualizer which is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>the plastic will warp fairly easily with biting thus you will end up with a mutilated dental guard which WILL cut into your tongue, the good thing is that you can trim off the ends that are fairly thin and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>The blue pads go over your bottom teeth so for me this was much more familiar based on my old night guard.</li>
            <li>It seem to stay in the right spot without moving too much.</li>
            <li>so I grind right through these guards far too quickly.</li>
            <li>I placed mine on the upper teeth since it felt more comfortable and it barely looks like I have anything in.  </li>
            <li>I have a very small mouth and teeth an this dental guard is great for that.</li>
            <li>I clench my teeth at night and am a light sleeper/sleep walker &amp; talker so was a little worried about whether or not I would be able to keep a bite guard in my mouth all night without choking on it or taking it out in my sleep.</li>
            <li>Very small and does a great job.</li>
            <li>The other kind rubbed and loosened the filling.</li>
            <li>Please bring back the original!</li>
            <li>Someone recommended I try this smaller ready to wear DenTek Comfort Fit and my problems were over!  </li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s good overall, but I definitely prefer my custom one!</li>
            <li>If you really grind your teeth these will not last you for more than 6 month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are far, far better than that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably about 3 years overdue in getting a replacement, but it&#x27;s finally come to the point where I no longer feel good about putting that night guard back in my mouth.</li>
            <li>My first dental guard was too large and my teeth hurt in the morning from grinding on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first Dentek guard and it is going strong, about a year later.  </li>
            <li>This one is very small and very effective.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even believe that this product could get any positive reviews at all.</li>
            <li>so I have contacted Dentek about a replacement and on the issue of possibly designing future models with more secure adjustment straps.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that doesn&#x27;t really look like it would work at first until you try</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to compare it with since its my first one.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was strange but it surely happens it seems.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the lengthy notes on the back of the package, as there are some important considerations, such as TMJ, bite changes, etc., that users need to keep in mind.</li>
            <li>This product is the first (out of many I tried) that was small, comfortable and I could even talk while it is in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Good things do come in small packages.</li>
            <li>The size is good for small to medium mouth.</li>
            <li>The old adage is true: you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Very minimal so it doesn&#x27;t feel to invasive, and they last for months which is great.</li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve had is for the first 1-2 weeks, it did make my bottom gums a bit sore - they&#x27;re fine now, though.</li>
            <li>Although the bite guard didn&#x27;t work for me, because I have a SEVERE teeth grinding problem, think the guard is a clever idea and would work for most with a lesser problem.</li>
            <li>It will last longer, and has been a true teeth saver!</li>
            <li>It is low profile, so it grinds away more quickly than other dental guards, so expect to replace it more frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the regular mouth guards where you have to boil them first, then fit them, and this product has exceeded those plus my expectations.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my mouth is nearly the size that these night guards loosen up to.</li>
            <li>please just keep in mind that if you have a small mouth with a lot of crowding, perhaps this isn&#x27;t the most comfortable product to use.</li>
            <li>I had a previous version of this comfort-fit mouth guard that sat nicely on the lower teeth.</li>
            <li>have had no trouble keeping this device in my mouth; it is comfortable and I can talk normally while wearing it.</li>
            <li>I have a super sensitive gag reflex and</li>
            <li>If you have a mild problem, and if you have a sensitive gag reflex, this might help, but do see your dentist if it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>my mouth being super sensitive, but I just could not fall asleep with this thing on.</li>
            <li>If I opened my mouth a certain way, I could also feel the jaw pop out of place a bit.  </li>
            <li>It worked quite well, for the problem of clamping my teeth too much, but after a while my teeth were kind of uncomfortable, it may be my own particular problem and not the fault of the kit.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have the extra wings on the top which you see in the new design box picture.  </li>
            <li>The new design is just as comfortable as the old ones</li>
            <li>One week into using them, my headaches are gone, and I wake up with a much more relaxed, loose jaw.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fit &amp; wear; takes a few days to get use to it.</li>
            <li>This new version is fine; the extra piece that goes over the outside of the top teeth doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other mouth guards in the past but like these the best.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this is because  had a much more form fitting one before and wanted something less obvious.</li>
            <li>The material was comfortable and I barely felt the guard in my mouth, unlike other more obtrusive guards I had tried.</li>
            <li>I bought this with a little fear, I&#x27;ve used another kind for years, and I needed to replace it.</li>
            <li>The good thing is they aren&#x27;t bulky, but the hard plastic on the sides caused a sore on my gum that resulted in pain and inflamation.</li>
            <li>Better than those big over all the top teeth models, this little thing just sits between your molars.</li>
            <li>I have not tried these out yet, so I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars, but it a huge improvement from what the night guards used to be.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t understand how they fit properly, but now it is working like a charm.</li>
            <li>This one is very tiny and really didn&#x27;t fit my mouth, even with the adjustments.</li>
            <li>The DenTek &amp;#34;Comfort&amp;#34; Fit has to be my least favorite to date.</li>
            <li>My dentist wants me to have a $400+ dental guard to keep me from clenching my teeth, but I can&#x27;t afford that.</li>
            <li>My gums have yet to get irritated like before and the nightguard stayed in place the whole night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really helps fight bruxism.</li>
            <li>or so if I really wanted to stretch it</li>
            <li>I recently went to the dentist,and she wanted to custom fit me for a dental guard.</li>
            <li>I would definately this product to anyone who wants to save money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very conferable and protects without feeling bulky.</li>
            <li>There were once available at my local CVS, but I can no longer find them in the stores.  </li>
            <li>They are more expensive than the boil mouth guards, but also far more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have had bruxism my whole life</li>
            <li>and this is the only one that has helped, comfortable, and stays in place all night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really grind my teeth, but I clench them, and sometimes if my tongue or cheeks get in the way, I would wake up with sores.</li>
            <li>I am going to use an athletic mouth guard that costs about $1 and will form to your teeth by boiling it and placing it in your mouth and sucking on it to form fit your teeth until I can get back to the dentist.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really keep my mouth shut.  </li>
            <li>so I am not clenching as much during the day.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Even though it states on the box that it is not for TMJ, it really did work.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions on how to fit, and after one night of use I had cuts on my gums and sores on my inner cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I grind my teeth, but it should be noted that the product is very flimsy and it literally felt like razor blades were in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>This dental guard is flimsy and awkward and I have no idea what position is best for my alignment/jaw.  </li>
            <li>You can tell that the two rubber pieces really take a beating through the night but they have not shown any sign of falling apart or wearing out, just teeth marks.</li>
            <li>I left my custom nightguard at my boyfriend&#x27;s house, and I needed a cheap replacement until I saw him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really hope DenTek will take notice and redesign their mouth guard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some fractured teeth and my dentist wants me to spend $700 in guards.  </li>
            <li>This one is comfortable enough to keep in.</li>
            <li>I need a guard and can&#x27;t afford a real one</li>
            <li>This product was uncomfortable and incredibly flimsy.</li>
            <li>It really helps to reduce the morning after pain of the grinding.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t find a downside to this product at the moment.</li>
            <li>This is the smallest night guard I&#x27;ve tried but it works very well.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast forward 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>Trim too much and the slide will pop out ruining the guard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now alternating nights with and without the guard because it hurts too much.</li>
            <li>I like this newer model much more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe this product may have been responsible for ruining a composite crown.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t notice it too much in my mouth-</li>
            <li>This really helped her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight ans slim.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my headaches have been decreasing so this thing really is working for me.</li>
            <li>They are fairly comfortable and don&#x27;t force your mouth open at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the plates that fit around the teeth are larger, causing them to jut into the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I had been using a custom fit night guard that my dentist ordered back in 2005</li>
            <li>There are 5 settings that you can use to stretch out the plastic band so the blue pads securely cover your molars.</li>
            <li>My jaw muscles are usually very sore, and I realize that I clench during my day a lot.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I try to be</li>
            <li>I grind my teeth so much at night that I had ground out my fillings.</li>
            <li>Thank you, my jaw thanks you.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use than guards you have to boil.</li>
            <li>She said it fits comfortable enough and does help keep her from grinding her teeth.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different types/models and this is by far the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>only concern is that to make the fit adjustable, the connecting strip slides into a sort of tunnel in each of the wings.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way to really get in there and rinse that tunnel out.</li>
            <li>So I soak the whole thing in mouthwash once a week.</li>
            <li>It gets a bit sore there, but it&#x27;s only really noticeable when I first put the mouth guard in, and first thing in the morning, so at the moment it&#x27;s worth dealing with in order to not grind my teeth into pearly stumps.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li>and I can actually close my mouth comfortably.  </li>
            <li>The problem I had was that sense this product doesn&#x27;t conform to your teeth, there is nothing really holding it in place at night.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose with Dentek&#x27;s  money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li>Really like the slender profile and bulk-less design,</li>
            <li>If you grind your teeth, this is probably not the product for you as there is really nothing to keep it in place.</li>
            <li>There is really nothing to them but they have held up well.</li>
            <li>But they are very flimsy and not at all well made for grinding of the teeth in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The biting plate is now much thicker</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It lasted a whole 3 nights and both sides completely flattened out, ending up meeting in the middle, on top of my tongue, making it ineffective for grinding.</li>
            <li>They are low profile, light and the plastic bite plates are adjustable.</li>
            <li>The real pain is looking for them in the morning.</li>
            <li>how much it helped.  </li>
            <li>It adjusts to my mouth great and had saved my teeth from being damaged even worse.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and it took about 20 minutes before my jaw hurt so much</li>
            <li>However, the BioGrind was too much silicone for my mouth</li>
            <li>It took about a week to get through one whole night without it falling out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I was very concerned it would dislodge and choke me in my sleep.</li>
            <li>which is what my dentist wants.</li>
            <li>, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a lot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the cheap generics.</li>
            <li>and they have help me so much with my grinding of my teeth when I sleep at night.</li>
            <li>These are working out very well...</li>
            <li>I think that this can&#x27;t replace a real mouth guard done and adjusted by the dentist.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much to set this off.</li>
            <li>Personally, I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone would find that comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Absolute junk.  </li>
            <li>The only comfortable, adjustable dental guard on the market that I know</li>
            <li>Does its job, but the &#x27;click to adjust length&#x27; does not work very well after a time.</li>
            <li>like I do with the DenTek ones) and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>And much cheaper and a 10 count!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very adjustable.  </li>
            <li>- it was comfortable, stayed in place, and was ungrindable, but i&#x27;d only recommend it IF you&#x27;ve never had any orthodontic work.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for this product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the smallest, least instrusive mouth guarf and thought this would be good.</li>
            <li>The bite-pads are just too thin to prevent my top teeth from touching my bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more clutsy and bigger than the old Dentec I had.</li>
            <li>She asked about what kind of mouth guard I was wearing, and when I told her, she said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know why they still allow them to sell that type,&amp;#34; and explained how by not containing the front teeth, the pressure that is placed downward on the back teeth is displaced to the only place the energy can go--the front teeth.  </li>
            <li>They apparently released a new version which is WAY better than the old.</li>
            <li>Luckily Dentek offers a full money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>after my first night trying this mouthguard out, I started experiencing some mild pain the next day.  </li>
            <li>thanks to amazon for offering this on subscribe &amp; save, and many thanks to the other reviewers for sharing their experience.</li>
            <li>Its easy to clean, flexible enough to really fit anyone&#x27;s mouth, and its small, so you really can&#x27;t notice it when you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li>my TMJ pain was greatly increased due to it slipping around.</li>
            <li>My front teeth were straight on top of each other.  </li>
            <li>I have a serious problem with grinding my teeth &amp; have never been able to use any of the custom fit mouthguards because they are so bulky they throw my jaw out</li>
            <li>The old design only had the flanges that went down so that the dental guard fit nicely on your teeth.</li>
            <li>BUT I would say better than the other products out there.</li>
            <li>I bought these Dentek guards, and they were SO much better than any of the other guards that were made for me.  </li>
            <li>I found that mine worked better with one side on \\&quot;1\\&quot; and the other side on \\&quot;2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I had originally thought I had just spat it out in my sleep, but as I searched though the bedsheets, my husband awoke to inform me that I&#x27;d been choking on something earlier.</li>
            <li>So, moral is, it may or may not work for you, but worth a try!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I could close my mouth when I go to sleep unlike other bulky ones.</li>
            <li>Go back to the original minimalist design.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel durable at all, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I could pull it apart with little effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I find it more comfortable upside down with loop in front of upper teeth - it doesn&#x27;t matter, can be worn either way.  </li>
            <li>To clean it,I just run it under water &amp; slide the pads back &amp; forth on the adjustable piece to rinse it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, light, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This one also has parts that go alongside the upper teeth, making it more bulky and less comfortable.</li>
            <li>clean the guard with soap &amp; water (dr bronner&#x27;s peppermint) upon removal AND prior to insertion.</li>
            <li>Most bite guards last me at least a year, some more, but never have I gone through one this fast.</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and a strong gag reflex so the thought of trying to sleep with something in my mouth to prevent me from grinding my teeth was truely repulsive.</li>
            <li>This model is pretty comfortable because it doesn&#x27;t fill your mouth, it positions plastic bumpers at strategic places to keep teeth from contacting each other when the jaw is clenched.</li>
            <li>I know, how sad to be SO THRILLED about a mouth guard, but I think that&#x27;s a clear testament to how stressful it is to have no acceptable options for comfortable and efficient mouth guards - but now that this one is here, what a relief!  </li>
            <li>This is the first mouth-guard that doesn&#x27;t rub anywhere inside my mouth and isn&#x27;t completely embarrassing to sleep with in my mouth.</li>
            <li>For the most part, these last me longer than 6 months, more like 9 months at least.</li>
            <li>For the most part, these last me longer than 6 months, more like 9 months at least.</li>
            <li>The grinding can also be pretty loud, which my partner doesn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>It operates on the opposite concept from my original choice-instead of keeping my teeth separated from the front, it has two pieces that fit between my molars, top and bottom, with just a thin piece to go around my front teeth and keep it connected.</li>
            <li>size is nice and small.</li>
            <li>The product works ok, but is not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, when they get really sore, I&#x27;ll wear this on my top teeth instead to give them a little break</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live or sleep without it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cost me a mint in new fillings!)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will probably go back to the athletic style ones from Dentek, they seem more comfortable, no moving parts, they just don&#x27;t last as long...</li>
            <li>The only great thing I have to say about this product is the Dentek&#x27;s customer support was extrememly curtious,fast,patient, and didn&#x27;t give me a hard time about wanting to make a return.</li>
            <li>Unless they revert to the previous model i&#x27;d be better off not wearing any guard.</li>
            <li>somehow which made it more or less unwearable.</li>
            <li>I took it to my dentist on my next visit thinking that he won&#x27;t like it because he could have done better with a custom design by him, but when he looked at it he actually approved it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more of these in the future!</li>
            <li>People discussed that the one with blue guard was the better design, mine came in blue.</li>
            <li>use a file to shape-so it doesn&#x27;t push on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Decent product for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Luckily, my purchase included two guards and I promptly popped the next one on.</li>
            <li>My wife said that next time she&#x27;ll get the Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard when her couple-hundred dollar guard needs replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip:</li>
            <li>but I was surprised not only do they fit</li>
            <li>This also causes irritation to the teeth and ultimately could lead to gum-line recession, but, in the short term, it would probably just cause most people discomfort, as it did with me.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that they added an extra part on the top of the bite pad on each side.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, recommend it to anyone and will only buy this dental guard in the future.</li>
            <li>I think that the fit is just not tight enough for me.</li>
            <li>But these are way better because they are small and fit perfectly on upper or lower, whichever is your preference.</li>
            <li>It is cheap-- a package of 2 will last a full year-- compared to the hundreds of dollars I spent on the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comfort Fit Dental Guard first, the same guard that I have been using for several years, before going to all that expense.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the dark blue, round, pill-stacker canisters from the Vitamin Shoppe work perfectly.</li>
            <li>(Thanks, old dentist!  </li>
            <li>These were small and super comfortable and I used them for about 4 years.  </li>
            <li>It worked great at protecting my back molars, only problem is now my front four incisors have been ground down revealing dentin, which i believe happened while wearing the product.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend these</li>
            <li>Highly recommend getting from dentist.</li>
            <li>I tried it because of the high ratings.  </li>
            <li>Also the sides are so high that they sink into my gum and causing blisters.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The teeth pads do wear out relatively quickly if you are a heavy grinder - I can&#x27;t make them last more than 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is weird because now all the pressure is on your molars which becomes very noticeable and takes time to get used to, you can wear it upside down and have them hanging from the top which is slightly more comfortable</li>
            <li>My last one was a little simpler and just a little more comfortable, but this will work fine.</li>
            <li>I slept with it in last night and for the first time in months I woke without a headache!</li>
            <li>This one has little tabs that go up the top gums.  </li>
            <li>you have minor or infrequent grinding, I think this would be a good product, however, I also feel its a little pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li>When I first had it in, I thought it would be pretty tough to spit it out during sleep as it felt pretty securely placed.</li>
            <li>This guard takes up a lot less space in the mouth than other guards, so you might think that it would be more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Of all the Dentek products I&#x27;ve tried, this is probably one of the most comfortable, at least initially.</li>
            <li>I am really upset that the old version is no longer being made.  </li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t want something that completely encased my teeth when all I needed was a spacer.</li>
            <li>my top teeth cause after a few days on my bottom teeth it started to irritate my bottom gums...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just barely worn out my first guard after 2 months</li>
            <li>It does not fit on the teeth but just provides a barrier between top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>I guess its ok; I have tried a few over the counter dental guards.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth stockpiling for future use.</li>
            <li>If I get a lil sore spot on my gums, which rarely but occasionally happens, I just move the guard lil bit &amp; the irritation goes away in a day or two.  </li>
            <li>Pretty comfortable, I have used them for a few months now.</li>
            <li>at first i LOVED this product, but then my expensive orthodontic work got all out of whack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read reviews about people flipping them upside down because they hurt their gums, I didn&#x27;t have the problem but found it more comfortable to wear them unpside down for my jaw issues.</li>
            <li>sure to rinse it so that the saliva doesn&#x27;t dry and make it gross.</li>
            <li>adjustability is also nice at first, but after a few weeks it became loose, so the guard would resize itself overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is compact enough to not hurt your gums or jaws and it stays in place with just the right amount of thickness to protect your teeth from grinding.</li>
            <li>In order for this to stay put you have to bite down on it, other wise it wiggles all over the place.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to know that the front band connecting the two bitewings is flexible (in the picture you see I am bending it), which allows for some movement compared to other mouthguards.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the DenTek Comfort-Fit Dental Guards for years because they were BPA free, lighter than other brands, and they didn&#x27;t irritate my gums or the side of the mouth.</li>
            <li>I bought this until I could get a new one from my dentist and tried it out.</li>
            <li>With the new design, you can tell I have something in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>and they said they changed to this new design in January 2013.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to guard to keep my teeth from grinding at night.</li>
            <li>because this guard was causing my grinding to be restricted to my molars and causing all of that new jaw pain.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>-I have not found any issues with them &#x27;wearing out&#x27;, but when they do, I will just order a new set.</li>
            <li>The new design is a bit \\&quot;clunkier\\&quot; than what I am used to, with side guards going in both directions.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li>and I knew I couldn&#x27;t live with it.</li>
            <li>I do not like the new design.</li>
            <li>They cost more,but I can&#x27;t use the new model.</li>
            <li>I clench my teeth at night and it is hard to wear a full mouth guard with full ortho.  </li>
            <li>and it is very light and small</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although still need to test how long it can last (quick thin), but in general a good buy!</li>
            <li>It works, will still test new products as they come available as neither are perfect.to give it a 3 since its served me well enough in the last 3 pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also others I&#x27;ve tried that are adjustable are harder to clean.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that&#x27;s comfortable and actually last to three months.</li>
            <li>Amazon provided efficient service and offered an item I have used for several years but is no longer available at local stores in my area.</li>
            <li>I have used this item several nights now and like its low profile and fit of it.</li>
            <li>It is the same brand and product but the fit is different.  </li>
            <li>Moved around in the mouth too much and the plates themselves are too rigid - and too thick to me really comfortable!</li>
            <li>The pads are suppose to be mid molar, I couldn&#x27;t find a place that was comfortable with the strap around the bottom teeth it pulled my teeth back</li>
            <li>Tried this one first and have used it for a few nights, and so far it fits my small mouth nicely!</li>
            <li>The material is very soft.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;d highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I still tried it even though it really didn&#x27;t fit, and as I expected it was laying in the bed that next morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sharing my experience with everyone because I&#x27;ve gone through so many other night guards just to end up spitting them out in the middle of the night</li>
            <li>This was the last model I tried and when I woke after the first night of using it, it was not to be found.  </li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t know if it prevents me from grinding, but it definitely keeps my teeth from touching and filing each other down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After only the first night, the bite pads had dents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been fitted by professional dentist with other TMJ splints, none of which are as comfortable as this Dentek.</li>
            <li>I at first expressed displeasure in knowing he witnessed me choking in my sleep and did nothing to assist, but he assured me that it was a fairly brief matter with about thirty seconds of coughing and sputtering before the sounds subsided</li>
            <li>and I was swept back into a peaceful slumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first use that the dentek had stuck to this same crown.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot more money buying the mouth guard that covers your teeth completely and they never last.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them every night for more than 6 years and vastly prefer them to any other brands I&#x27;ve tried and to the ones that the dentist has custom-made for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every morning, I rinse with hot water and mouthwash and only have to replace about every 6 months.  </li>
            <li>-that was okay, but following a suggestion in one of the other reviews</li>
            <li>This is the third dental guard that I have bought, first the boil and bite type, which ended up moving my teeth and affecting my bite.  </li>
            <li>Disappointed since it is one of the best products I have found for grinding without paying a lot.</li>
            <li>The actual usage is very different, but not necessary better.</li>
            <li>Walmart in the store has the exact same 2 pack for about $30.00 !!</li>
            <li>first pack did not come with a case, but the second one did</li>
            <li>At first I tried the regular DenTek dental guard, didn&#x27;t like it, but suffered with it.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product, however, it is still too big for my tiny mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However this brings about new but for me less important issues.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I have a small mouth, and get a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I appreciate the blue pads, since I would put down the older one, and not be able to find it, because it was all clear</li>
            <li>He said he likes how he can move the guard up and down, adjusting it to where he feels comfortable.</li>
            <li>I wish they were white, or clear, as the blue makes them more noticable when I talk or open</li>
            <li>The bite pad seems a little thicker and the side wings on the top give it a distinctly different \\&quot;feel\\&quot; then the older version.  </li>
            <li>Only your back teeth are biting into this mouth guard, but it effectively stops your other teeth from grinding too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when I replace my old one with a new one, I have a couple of nights of re-adjusting to the difference in size in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Even when I replace my old one with a new one, I have a couple of nights of re-adjusting to the difference in size in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I needed a new mouthguard as my old one was lost.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that this new design wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the old one.  </li>
            <li>Typically I get about 7 hours sleep and still comfortable, but after sleep over 9 hours, I&#x27;ve noticed some discomfort with my gums.</li>
            <li>Not super comfortable if you are thinking about it or are not used to having something in your mouth but when you wear it every night you get used to it.</li>
            <li>The only problem I found was that after wearing it for a couple of weeks it gets stretched out and doesn&#x27;t fit as well.</li>
            <li>few problems:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s fairly easy to chew through these things.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as expected and came quickly.</li>
            <li>I believe that gravity + the fact that your molars are heavier and are more likely to clamp down than your front teeth.  </li>
            <li>When I had my first filling ever for the chipped molar (luckily I&#x27;ve never had cavities), the dentist noticed my bite was directly hitting that newly filled spot so much that we had to leave an empty space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have previously used the earlier version of this night guard, and it was okay.</li>
            <li>:  I&#x27;ve started wearing the guards upside down (having the groove cupping my upper teeth) and it has so far worked out better for me.  </li>
            <li>the very place where I should have put it right when I bought it: flushed down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the very place where I should have put it right when I bought it: flushed down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seemed to work as intended the first few nights but the wear was pretty evident after only 1 night.</li>
            <li>As I turned up with nothing, and thought about the description of the choking episode I had earlier in the evening, I was far less pleased with the purchase of this mouthguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband</li>
            <li>and I had an uneven fit that couldn&#x27;t have been less comfortable.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but is not comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>Now when I drink water I am more careful to keep my teeth loosely together when I swallow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small,flimsy, and pinches the gum line a little, but overall it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also developed a habit of sucking on them in my sleep (or sucking my cheeks in), which makes them press up so tight against my cheeks that it leave sore spots - but I think that is me &amp; not the guard causing it, I&#x27;m having big issues with insomnia which makes be grind my teeth more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also developed a habit of sucking on them in my sleep (or sucking my cheeks in), which makes them press up so tight against my cheeks that it leave sore spots - but I think that is me &amp; not the guard causing it, I&#x27;m having big issues with insomnia which makes be grind my teeth more.</li>
            <li>As my dentist explained to me, because of their large size and design in which they mold around all of the teeth, they inhibit the natural flow of saliva at night, which actually helps to prevent</li>
            <li>In most circumstances, it&#x27;s hardly detectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The comfort level is very high and though one may fear it choking someone while sleeping, it stays relatively in place throughout the night.</li>
            <li>It has effectively prevented damage to my teeth that previously occurred due to grinding while sleeping.</li>
            <li>not as big as other mouth protectors and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The bad part is that the guard sits on my molars, the place where I was grinding my teeth the most and having the most TMJ symptoms.  </li>
            <li>Plus I could not speak clearly without removing them.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m ready to take the next step and throw my 6 year old night guard into the trash.</li>
            <li>Just keep searching for the clear package.</li>
            <li>The problems I have encountered are: too soft</li>
            <li>I run across this one and so far.. 1 week in..</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t even come close to it so far.  </li>
            <li>This fixed that problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard Kit).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the money to have my detist make a professional guard</li>
            <li>so far..</li>
            <li>The soft adjustable band will not hold this in my mouth no matter how I adjust it.</li>
            <li>With the old design, I could speak clearly and no one could tell I had it in.  </li>
            <li>a soft rubber heat molded mouth guard</li>
            <li>I was very discouraged  after paying the big dollars for the device the dentist  sold me that made me gag.  </li>
            <li>they are very flexible, and don&#x27;t make me feel like i&#x27;ve got ten pounds of chewing gum stuck in my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;to be sure, DenTek&#x27;s adjustment part is shoddy as heck</li>
            <li>disgusting...overall, because it is so much smaller there isn&#x27;t as much room for bacteria to proliferate.</li>
            <li>Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard Kit for years and decided to take a look at this one out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>The pad doesn&#x27;t cover my teeth completely inward, and it pinches my gums.  </li>
            <li>and I have completely destroyed all of them.</li>
            <li>The 2nd one has lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t very bulky, but it totally didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that it keeps my teeth apart a bit too much &amp; makes my jaw sore in the morning but that feeling does wear off after a while.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a concept...</li>
            <li>And my cat really like chewing on them if left out and reachable....</li>
            <li>DO want to stress the importance of preventing the grinding of your natural teeth.</li>
            <li>The part that goes across your teeth sticks out too far and presses against your tongue.</li>
            <li>It is soft and pliable in my mouth</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s much to the night guard aside from a plastic strap and two blue pads, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I will be scouring stores to find the old style.</li>
            <li>I received the dentek guard and was surprised at how sleek the design was.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s is soft rubber-like feel and</li>
            <li>Completely cleared up jaw discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I must say that I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it on.</li>
            <li>I became really conscious of that.</li>
            <li>They fit firmly and NEVER come out.</li>
            <li>This one looks the same on the box, but in person, the pads are much thicker and this has lead to some discomfort for me in my jaws.  </li>
            <li>Upon arrival, I was surprised to discover they had changed the design.  </li>
            <li>Dentek Professional Maximum Protection Dental]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the current time, it works as a temporary measure, but if you have the finances for a real mouth guard that is fitted, I would recommend that option.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m not bothered by it.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised that it did not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>It is not huge and fits comfortably.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The plastic is too thick (AKA, the top teeth and the bottom teeth are too far apart upon biting down).&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think they are a bit too thick as my wife seems to grind more with them in (like her mind thinks hey there is something to chew on).</li>
            <li>These are good dental guards, but they are too expensive.</li>
            <li>Please bring back the old design which was slightly thinner and didn&#x27;t have the full &#x27;bite wing&#x27; design!  </li>
            <li>What was shipped was a redesigned product which is not at all comfortable due to its larger and thicker size.</li>
            <li>Granted, they won&#x27;t last as long as the expensive guard I had made by the dentist, but this is so much more comfortable to sleep with, and my teeth do not touch, which is the whole point of the guard.</li>
            <li>Supposed to be small and easy to use, but I did find it bulky</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and smaller than the other dental guards.</li>
            <li>I have a very small mouth and was thrilled to have a low profile guard that I could wear during the day also-</li>
            <li>I put it in just fine when I went to bed and went to sleep, nothing out of the ordinary so far.</li>
            <li>cons are it wears down fairly quick.</li>
            <li>They were both lower back teeth, not sure if that&#x27;s relevant, one real, one porcelain</li>
            <li>companies would not mess with products that work and people love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works good, but seems a little small.</li>
            <li>After using it for 2 weeks my back teeth on my right side are almost completely flat and they squeak every time I chew.</li>
            <li>I can tell in the morning I have been biting on it; the upper back teeth feel funny as a result.  </li>
            <li>Kind of awkward feeling at first,</li>
            <li>Initially, I was pleased that it was so small and flexible.  </li>
            <li>The first night I wore it I dreamt, multiple times, that I was eating food - only to find myself waking up and chewing on the mouth guard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many mouth guards in the past, and they always last about a month before they delaminate.  </li>
            <li>I used to have an older version of a bite guard from DenTek that looks similar to a guard people that play sports use.</li>
            <li>After having two of my older crowns--along with the roots--extracted, my dentist suggested that I was likely a night-time tooth-grinder/jaw clencher, and that&#x27;s why my teeth were crumbling.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the older version that only sits on bottom row.</li>
            <li>I usually wake up 4 or 5 times a night and when I wore the DenTek guard, I slept better and only awoke twice.  </li>
            <li>only thing I&#x27;ve found that is really a downfall of the product is that while yes, you can adjust them (each side has little nobs that you can pull/push to get it to fit your mouth) during the night, my mouth likes to readjust them apparently to a larger size.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but after several trie with this guard, I gave up.</li>
            <li>Although the former units were made of less comfortable plastic</li>
            <li>I went thru a custom fit guard that was supposed to last a year in less than 5 months).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping in it yet, but my initial reaction is that it is less comfortable than it was.  </li>
            <li>design is not very good and the plastic is kind of rough on your gums.</li>
            <li>Not too bad and still by far the most comfortable nightguards I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>even something so small and comfortable can begin to irritate.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable and small.</li>
            <li>I looked at $300 custom bite guards, but thought that was way too expensive, and was very satisfied when I found this</li>
            <li>Dental guard is small and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It cuts into the side of my gum and I really hope it is not causing long term gum damage.</li>
            <li>It is light and small.</li>
            <li>I really like using these dental guards but the sides around the bit are too long and they push on my gums.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to learn - when i switched dentists a couple of years ago - that I have apparently been grinding my teeth for years.  </li>
            <li>There is 2 in a pack but one of mine are already gone because I wasn&#x27;t careful when wearing it when I first started</li>
            <li>I took the guard to the dentist and he confirmed that this particular one is no good.  </li>
            <li>:  I slept with the new version last night.  </li>
            <li>The new design has an upper flange that cuts into my gums.</li>
            <li>I do think with the amount that I grind my teeth, I will probably go through both guards in less than a year, but its still completely worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not so good: I have a small mouth and small teeth.</li>
            <li>Nothing major.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve now been on my third of fourth pair and there is one glaring consistent issue that holds the product back...</li>
            <li>I honestly barely knew it was there; I am hooked!</li>
            <li>This is the major con for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>bruxism or teeth grinding has never been a major issue.  </li>
            <li>Unless the company brings back the old version then they have lost my business forever!</li>
            <li>I bought this locally at Target and was very content for the first few nights.</li>
            <li>First of all, no hot water.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend was using the other one and he chewed through it the first night.</li>
            <li>but I pull the little plastic front piece back and forth to clean it under running water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one shown is just the right shape for people like me who are not large in stature and have smaller mouths.</li>
            <li>After trying one my dentist made, several different guards from various stores and brands, I finally found the right one.</li>
            <li>wear it on my upper teeth, where it is very secure, as opposed to the lower, where it can rub against the gum.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these again if needed, because I alternate them with a custom made, hard acrylic night guard,&lt;br /&gt;They are approved by my dentist, who said there is no difference in what they accomplish...</li>
            <li>Very comfortable in that you hardly notice it when you are using it, especially if it is adjusted properly.  </li>
            <li>It is not bulky and doesn&#x27;t affect the other teeth such as some others do when it is a full mouth guard and not just for back teeth.</li>
            <li>The main problem I had with the mouth guard was that because it only touches the back two or three teeth, a lot of pressure is put on those teeth.  </li>
            <li>On top OF that all of my teeth are sensitive to cold beverages and certain sweets.  </li>
            <li>I really, really want this to win - the $500 &amp;#34;hockey puck&amp;#34; the dentists pushed on my was very unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Great idea to have it adjust to size, too bad it doesn&#x27;t stay the size you set</li>
            <li>The boil and fit types worked well but were not nice to my veneers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ended up doing that myself and its really the only long term solution.</li>
            <li>These work really well, but they do not last as long as suggested on the packaging.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning, my molars feel sensitive because of the constant pressure.  </li>
            <li>I clench my teeth (day and night) and it was starting to affect my TMJ with loud clicking and pain.</li>
            <li>The customer pic above shows what the old design looked like.  </li>
            <li>Well, I sent it back and ordered my old standby.</li>
            <li>barely know it&#x27;s in my mouth and</li>
            <li>No boil convenience, barely notice there is something in my mouth with these.  </li>
            <li>As a dental professional, I make a point to try different products to recommend to my patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As expected this didn&#x27;t work out very well</li>
            <li>my entire adult life</li>
            <li>It is definitely the sleekest I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
            <li>My jaw will no longer sit back as far as it used to</li>
            <li>the old version of this product was the only mouth guard I could use without gagging.  </li>
            <li>This mouthguard is relatively discreet and the connecting mouthpiece under the bottom jaw is completely unobtrusive.  </li>
            <li>I hope they go back to the old design.</li>
            <li>you can barely  tell it is in your mouth.</li>
            <li>The packaging has changed, but the guards have been pretty much the same the past 2-3 years</li>
            <li>I lost my old mouth guard and these were the only ones wal mart had.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve noticed that when they get really thin, I begin to chew on them more at night, which reminds me to replace it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve noticed that when they get really thin, I begin to chew on them more at night, which reminds me to replace it.</li>
            <li>Kind of uncomfortable when I realize I&#x27;m doing it.  </li>
            <li>I could not sleep with the full mouth devices I&#x27;ve purchased in the past</li>
            <li>so rather than having the thin piece that goes around your front teeth on the bottom, you have it going around them on top.  </li>
            <li>And the thin strip in the front is so much more comfortable than thick plastic.  </li>
            <li>I am not stating there is a direct correlation, but think that a full guard would have at least dissipated the pressure and not localized it.</li>
            <li>The guards are small enough that they don&#x27;t fill up your whole mouth and set your jaw out of alignment, but just cushy enough--in all the right places--to cushion the brutal force of my grinding jaw.  </li>
            <li>I am new to having any type of dental guard, so all would be strange.  </li>
            <li>and I am planning on buying a new night guard that will not cause me long term problems.</li>
            <li>Right because the bite pads are stronger; they hold up to my heavy grinding.</li>
            <li>Does not fit the mouth right and didn&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li>like I usually do during my sleep, but with the guard there, I could feel that my teeth were safe from grinding with each other.</li>
            <li>There was some slight irritation at first on your gums near your molars if you bite down really hard, but it has gotten better.</li>
            <li>This combination pack also makes them very inexpensive when compared to other models and the custom-made ones you can purchase through your dentist.  </li>
            <li>So much so that my front teeth were getting sharp.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this very brand due to the wear on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Also, this guard does not gag you as much of the other guards do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The low profile is nice, but the small bite pad means that all the pressure of your jaw is carried by a few teeth.</li>
            <li>first night, I slept nearly the entire night with the guard in, and only did I briefly wake in the early morning to remove it from my mouth, as after a few hours</li>
            <li>this was not easy or feel right.</li>
            <li>did modify my new design guard by cutting off the top wings with scissors and now it&#x27;s like the old design.  </li>
            <li>Listen, I&#x27;m old enough to remember a day when mouth guards were only used by boxers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not fit securely enough to prevent grinding between upper/lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I then went to the opposite end of the spectrum and bought the cheaper \\&quot;boil to fit\\&quot; model where you bite into that nasty goo and hope that you can form a decent fit on your own.</li>
            <li>I have heard it recommended and find it true after experimenting, to adjust it as small as you can to avoid any potential gagging problems.</li>
            <li>But since I grind my teeth too much and did not have a backup piece, I had to use a lighter to soften the pads and gently rub the sharp edges down.</li>
            <li>I used this mouthguard exactly as described for 6-8 months and it put slight pressure on two of my back gums (adjacent teeth).  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that they don&#x27;t go back far enough.</li>
            <li>the packs I have received, so far, the \\&quot;pad\\&quot; part is blue, not white, as currently seen in the official product photo.</li>
            <li>first few nights, I could feel a difference when I woke up.</li>
            <li>The design seems good in theory but is uncomfortable to wear and fits oddly due to the strap on the front.</li>
            <li>stand by my 3/5 star rating on the old product, however I would rate this new model 5/5 as it has solved my previous issues.</li>
            <li>It seems like the shock absorbing part you bite down on, got worn out within a week which causes it to sit lower on gums once it&#x27;s been &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This dental guard fits very well, doesn&#x27;t have sharp edges to hurt your gums, and there are two in the package!</li>
            <li>The first night was a lot of adjusting and a little extra saliva while I was getting used to it.  </li>
            <li>Every other night guard does... even their older model came with it.  </li>
            <li>my jaw and neck are a lot less stressed thanks to this.</li>
            <li>Each morning when I woke up, I noticed that my bite was different for the first few minutes after taking it out.</li>
            <li>I also tried the tray with moldable impressions that were uncomfortable and super large.  </li>
            <li>The back of a couple of molars are almost level with my gums because they are worn down so much</li>
            <li>This one seemed easy to wear and I didn&#x27;t sound too stupid when I talked with it in my mouth, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really light weight, does not fit tight again my teeth even when you try to adjust it.</li>
            <li>I have an overly large tongue which relaxes during REM sleep and blocks my narrow airway.</li>
            <li>Product was as described, howevert he blue parts were not flat, like they looked in the picture, but cupped around the teeth.</li>
            <li>The wire in middle is funny and harder to swallow than other types.</li>
            <li>If the thin little piece that goes under your front gums was more stiff instead of super flimsy- this product actually might work.</li>
            <li>I bought some large bulky- boil type night guard last year and it was a waste.</li>
            <li>While trimming the guard down some did improve my particular problem, it wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>Good company, too bad the product is not up to the job.</li>
            <li>There are good things and bad things about this mouth guard.  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s the best fitting tooth guard I&#x27;ve found!</li>

            <li> But happy nonetheless.</li>
            <li> , I used it for years (replacing it every 6 months or so) and thought I was doing great with protecting my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This product was great until they added a flap that now cuts into my bottom gum.  </li>
            <li> This is really great product for dental guard.</li>
            <li> In fact, it was a joy not to wake up with a headache and pain in my jaw.  </li>
            <li> Worked great, but found a cheaper product that holds up as well as these do.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was there to protect my teeth!!</li>
            <li> And if not, they&#x27;ll make lovely Christmas tree ornaments!!</li>

            <li> It was nice that it came with a case too!</li>
            <li> I go asleep with it at the smallest size and fitting perfectly, and wake up with</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After so many product trials this one by DenTek is the best.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ears and eyes were OK, but my teeth were not in very good shape.  </li>
            <li> On the bright side you did get 2...</li>
            <li> price is really good too.</li>
            <li> The toime frame in which it arrived was also good.</li>

            <li> DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard came out the best.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> the design itself is not so good.</li>
            <li> Good:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fairly durable; the one i bought came with two guards.  </li>
            <li> she didn&#x27;t have a good answer.</li>
            <li> I try to give it a good cleaning every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> there and it feels good to know that I&#x27;m taking some measures and protecting my teeth.</li>
            <li> The price and design make it a good place to start if you are looking for a dental guard.</li>
            <li> i thought this would be a good interim substitute.</li>
            <li> it feels good, compared to the rest</li>
            <li> still a good</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product that does what it says, prevents nighttime teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and works as well as those custom made</li>
            <li> good buy for me, and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I received two in the package and a case, which was really a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DenTek is good about sending me a replacement since they have a guarantee on them.</li>
            <li> As good as the ones the dentist made for me.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t hear me grinding at night anymore, which is good.</li>
            <li> It works good as protection from teeth grinding</li>
            <li> I could adjust the size accordingly, which is good.</li>
            <li> and I have loved it...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good to</li>
            <li> This guard is really good.</li>
            <li> Actually, I loved them for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Good quality,</li>
            <li> I rely onreviews to help me make good purchases; I hope this review helped you, as well.reviews to help me make good purchases; I hope this review helped you, as well.</li>
            <li> It is well priced, and Dentec is a good name to rely on.</li>
            <li> I lost my mouth guard and thought this would be a good temporary replacement.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go (after cleaning it of course).</li>
            <li> Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I didn&#x27;t find this to be a good value.</li>
            <li> This is the best fitting and most comfortable dental guard out there, awesome!</li>
            <li> Great price and very comfortable product.  </li>
            <li> Great fit!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t heart and very comfortable!</li>
            <li> and I am very glad we did.  </li>
            <li> I am not a spokesperson, just a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li> Adjustable piece is nice, but tends to loosen after good night&#x27;s sleep</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent quality, great fit makes it well worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months now and love it!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> The price here is much better than in the pharmacy!</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m a pretty happy customer!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely LOVE these!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty impressed that it does the job.</li>
            <li> but I started using it during the day as needed and it is actually pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks, I thought I&#x27;d found the best mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It does the job---no more grinding!</li>
            <li> found this product at a pharmacy first, but it didn&#x27;t have the storage case with it and lost the bite guard in a matter of months, so the storage case is a wonderful addition to this product as I now always know where my bite guard is, and also know that it doesn&#x27;t have any dust on it from sitting out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> though you have to boil water to form the fit, it&#x27;s nice having a perfect form fitting guard when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every night since I&#x27;ve gotten it and am very pleased how effective it is helping me not clench or grind my teeth.</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s adjustable and has numbers on the adjustable part!</li>
            <li> My top teeth have bridges, caps, and molars, so I don&#x27;t want to do anything that would harm them!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> I am sure to reorder again!</li>
            <li> This DenTek is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The boil and bite night guards work great to prevent the jaw popping, but the Dentek Comfort Fit does not seem to help with this.</li>
            <li> and these are amazing.</li>
            <li> but once we did it fit great.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I also have wisdom teeth in so they are great for the fortunate ones who can keep their.  </li>
            <li> This one is great because it can move freely and just provides a cushion.  </li>
            <li> It was kind of giving me an another stress as a must do task.  </li>
            <li> I think the manufacturer gives you some kind of warranty on it, but I&#x27;ve never tried it.</li>
            <li> The DenTek appliance has proved to be a reliable, effective, and affordable oral appliance.</li>
            <li> I really liked the material the bitewings were made of because they were on the softer side and did not bang against my teeth, causing pain throughout the night.</li>
            <li> but really he&#x27;s just happy when mama is happy.  </li>
            <li> I initially liked the design concept, but I found the plastic crossbar contacts the lower teeth.</li>
            <li> kind of like the feel of wearing a retainer,</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to know this before I bought it and stuck it in my mouth because I can&#x27;t return it now.</li>
            <li> This is not the products fault but my own.  </li>
            <li> This seemed to work for many others, so it is probably a good product...</li>
            <li> It is nice that this mouth guard does NOT require any boiling-water-fit-customization.  </li>
            <li> I have already used this kind of product for a year now.</li>
            <li> Quite nice design.</li>
            <li> This is what my mom wants for her birthday, and amazon seems to have the best price .</li>
            <li> comes as a two pack which is nice</li>
            <li> I liked about it</li>
            <li> so I really liked them.  </li>
            <li> ;  In my opinion, non-molded or non-fitted guards can change your bite and cause more harm than good.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the older model for years and really liked it; in fact the best fitted to my need in comparison to all the others in the market.</li>
            <li> The great thing is that I can clean and reuse it until I wreck it</li>
            <li> The older model without the sides was perfect, but they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Luckily they fit perfectly in the case that came with my SleepRight ones..</li>
            <li> I phoned DenTek and to their great credit they suggested a full refund which they promptly sent out.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable - great fit.  </li>
            <li> I had some issues with the fit of this mouth guard because of this flexibility and when I contacted the company they were more than happy to resolve my problems and send replacements.</li>
            <li> I love them they fit great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, easy, portable product.</li>
            <li> I like that this product fits in my mouth fairly easily and does a good job of protecting my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> I loved that this night guard required no boiling, and I also really liked the adjustable fit settings.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this one and was very surprised and impressed by the performance and cost of this product.</li>
            <li> The teeth grips scrape your gums and it slips out very easily.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the sizing (which is very easy to do) and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mouthpiece &amp; am so glad to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this mouth guard more than the ones my dentist has made!  </li>
            <li> Very quickly (like 4-5 seconds) and put it in my mouth very quickly (fitted it like a mouth piece) and wa-la!!</li>
            <li> It is quite comfortable and as good as any mouth-guard that I have tried.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something comfortable to wear at night, this is not it, but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative that is designed to do what its supposed to, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> you truly suffer from grinding, clenching, or TMJ problems, the best solution for you is a mouth guard that is molded professionally to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled I was able to sleep thru the night with this device in place.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> so I have tried plenty of mouth guards and this is by far the best one!</li>
            <li> This would be a good product for light clenching and grinding.</li>
            <li> far s dental guards go, these are probably the best.</li>
            <li> the kind that you boil and LOVE that compared to this.</li>
            <li> And the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t completely wrap around ANY teeth, so I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are swimming in a bacterial sludge when I wake up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll spend a good 10 minutes every night trying to make it fit.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li> I believe the design of this dental guard, with a thick-ish pad covering just 3 teeth, effectively increases the pressure exerted on the top of the tooth.</li>
            <li> I could never get a good fit.  </li>
            <li> Affordable, very easy -no boil-, don&#x27;t move at night, and very light.</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as the original one that I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Most comfortable dental guard I&#x27;ve used, and a good price for two.  </li>
            <li> The piece is adjustable, however, it fit perfectly for me straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> This one fits perfect and is not uncomfortable and you can talk without sounding like your mouth is full.  </li>
            <li> These guards work great and are not uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Thus far the Sleep Rite has been best, and, despite my not caring for the Den Tek, I would consider it second best (that others were THAT bad).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great device but priced higher than the others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, doesn&#x27;t rearrange my teeth, and lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Until I come up with a better solution (perhaps a more honest dentist and better insurance), I&#x27;m glad I found what works for the time being.</li>
            <li> He now wears it every night and said it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> A very cheap product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The guard is very comfortable once I sized it.  </li>
            <li> This is very comfortable and stays in your mouth all night this one stays in place</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to wear and you do not feel bulky.</li>
            <li> which makes it very comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and will continue to buy from them</li>
            <li> i have tried many others but this is the best one!&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t hurt, very flexible</li>
            <li> It works, will still test new products as they come available as neither are perfect.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s HUGE!</li>
            <li> I have tried many guards that have not worked.</li>
            <li> On top of the quality of design, construction and materials.</li>
            <li> it works better than my dentist&#x27;s custom made dental guard which cost me a lot of bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just not all that sure as a mouth sleeper that I wouldn&#x27;t dislodge it in my sleep</li>
            <li> so i guess i am ok for a year</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 3: It has been about 2 or 3 weeks since my last update and things are still working perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully DenTeck can figure out a fix to make the adjustment tabs more sturdy or perhaps change the system in how these guards adjust in size.</li>
            <li> I am overjoyed to have finally found a mouth guard that works wonderfully for me!  </li>
            <li> and I had to use it on my top teeth instead.  </li>
            <li> on top it does the trick though the plastic sizing thing doesn&#x27;t stay put</li>
            <li> better than i thought ..</li>
            <li> But for me, it has been my favorite of all the night guards I have tried.</li>
            <li> Comfort Fit is the best item so far.</li>
            <li> I tried many brands but they gagged me and I spit them out at night...</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can help others get the relief I have had from trying these, and also receive his approval to keep using it.  :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have tried resizing many times, but it still ends up sore.</li>
            <li> LOVE these.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did try it.</li>
            <li> Although, it is better than my teeth throbbing.</li>
            <li> &amp; I find I clench my teeth even more to keep them on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t clench my teeth trying to keep it in,my jaw relaxes more.</li>
            <li> But I also tend to try to get the most wear out of them that I can</li>
            <li> But I also tend to try to get the most wear out of them that I can</li>
            <li> I really love this product because it doesnt fill up my mouth.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;m finding that I sleep MUCH better with this night</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up, and I feel so much more refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li> i need them at the shortest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, better than the bulky plastic mouth guards.</li>
            <li> i love these as they are not bulky but serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d swallowed it because it doesn&#x27;t stay in place well in the mouth and between the top and bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> If they made it with better stronger plastic</li>
            <li> Much better than the $200 acrylic guard my dentist made for me.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> product caused me more problems than I started with.  </li>
            <li> This one works better than the thicker one</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> By using the Den Tek, my tongue has more room</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all worth it to feel good in the morning and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I used to *love</li>
            <li> This was even better then the custom mouthguard my dentist made for me.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of use however the guard rubs my lower gums at night.</li>
            <li> After a while I noticed sore spots when putting the guard in at night where it rubs my gums, mostly in the rear.</li>
            <li> Love that it is adjustable.</li>
            <li> $30 isn&#x27;t pocket change, but if you end up liking this one, you&#x27;ll be so glad you tried it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, this mouthguard seems quite comfortable and effective at its designed purpose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, this mouthguard seems quite comfortable and effective at its designed purpose.</li>
            <li> I woke up many a nights with it out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> This guard is comfortable and fits nicely.  </li>
            <li> When I called the 800 number to inquire about this, the answerer assured me it was OK to use with an implant.</li>
            <li> so I have to keep order more.  </li>
            <li> So I find myself buying the more often than I would like.</li>
            <li> I guess I will continue to use until a better product is created.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards stay in place way better</li>
            <li> This is a nice guard that can be sized to fit your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Surely there must be something that works.  </li>
            <li> This is the only way you can ensure that it has the best chance of working for your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you DO happen to find an OTC night guard that works for you, I would say it is ok to keep using it if:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> You replace it as recommendedd an OTC night guard that works for you, I would say it is ok to keep using it if:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Easier to speak, and stays in place better.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll try adjusting his levels and see if it works better.</li>
            <li> I can see that it would idel  for most people who need a dental guard.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustability</li>
            <li> so I can wear it on my top or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> This is comfortable, doesn&#x27;t require boiling, and it came with TWO!</li>
            <li> You can purchase these in many places including Amazon.</li>
            <li> For people that still have &amp; grind their wisdom teeth (like myself) this prevents most night time grindings &amp; clenching but your wisdom teeth can still make contact from time to time.</li>
            <li> DenTek t is much better than made by dentist - because it is also stopping the grinding (the design of DenTek</li>
            <li> The touching gum element is weaking the grinding.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it has a carrying case and it brings two mouth pieces.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this dental guard.</li>
            <li> , I flipped it over, with the strip going around my top teeth and found that to be better for me.</li>
            <li> I suspect fitting on the top or bottom is based on the shape of each person&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am so pleased-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 4 of these particular mouth guards and they work splendidly.  </li>
            <li> Most are not.</li>
            <li> but these are cheaper than many others too.</li>
            <li> Kudos to DenTek for making a truly comfortable night guard!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many off the shelf products including the Splintek Sleepright.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely and comfortably and works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> Probably because I am sure they are used to calls like that all the time.</li>
            <li> and I think it will be more durable.</li>
            <li> If you have a favorite I would love to hear about them.  </li>
            <li> So comfortable!  </li>
            <li> These bite guards are better than the custom one made at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I have had many night guards, both dentist made and over the counter.</li>
            <li> it threw my jaw alignment off even more than my teeth-grinding ever had, so I bought these.  </li>
            <li> SO much better.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the boil type of guard which is so bulky in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I never had it in my mouth for more like 15 minutes, I just couldn&#x27;t take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SOOOO glad I bought the DenTek</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slim yet works better than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did, I am saving my pearly whites from being grinded into dust.</li>
            <li> But it has relieved many stress headaches from the jaw clenching and stopped me from cracking my molars at night.  </li>
            <li> so I am waiting until I am better off</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> If you have a problem with Dentek guard, make sure you call them within 30 days.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t rub my gums and don&#x27;t feel like my football mouthguard like most over the counter dental guards.</li>
            <li> Wish they came in more than &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and it beats most of the over the counter items.</li>
            <li> I would have returned product within 30 day period, if I was paying more attention to time.</li>
            <li> and I love that it has a case.  </li>
            <li> SISU night guards are better</li>
            <li> I think the bulkier guards are actually a better bet.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not a grinder as much as a clencher and these work great for me.</li>
            <li> Switching from a softer bite guard that has more give to this rigid version was not agreeable.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I do have to wear it on my top teeth because it rubbed on my gums when wearing it on the bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> And on the side of my face that hurts, though most people recommend against that.  </li>
            <li> things are invaluable and have more than paid for themselves with my increased ability to work.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many off the shelf mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable length of it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love that it is adjustable.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> It made me clench my jaw even more.</li>
            <li> I got a Smartguard that works better ...</li>
            <li> This product really works great.</li>
            <li> If it had been shorter it might have worked better.  </li>
            <li> It keeps all of his teeth from touching.</li>
            <li> So he seems so be sleeping better at night and not waking up grumpy.</li>
            <li> He is glad I purchased this</li>
            <li> and I am enjoying sleeping in peace.</li>
            <li> Daughter wears an upper retainer and this dental guard is designed to wear on the bottom so it works perfectly for her!</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to, but OK.</li>
            <li> and although I never had a fitting for a night guard from a dentist, I did try the boil variety</li>
            <li> that said, Im ordering my second one because this seems to be the best guard on the market for clenchers.</li>
            <li> This guard is a lot slimmer than most store-bought guards, but the bite pads are way too bulky.</li>
            <li> snored more when using&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure I have a preference yet.</li>
            <li> Great idea, but I was in so much pain</li>
            <li> Has saved my teeth. :)</li>
            <li> and I stopped using it and decided to try the much more minimalist DenTek.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> gums were in pain for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have worn a night guard from my dentist for many years without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I could then sleep through the night with it, most nights.</li>
            <li> It was OK.</li>
            <li> However, it was OK.  </li>
            <li> &quot; and it may even be better, but it is not what I am used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad he did</li>
            <li> but there were many upon many flaws with those that I can just say don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this night guard.  </li>
            <li> so it keeps my teeth apart better,</li>
            <li> This kit is definitely more affordable than the dentist made version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many dental guards</li>
            <li> Most of them fill up with saliva</li>
            <li> not saying this would happen to most people</li>
            <li> I love this dental guard -</li>
            <li> This pic is a better representation than the official product photo, of the guard I received.</li>
            <li> This is a much better solution to my teeth grinding problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product more than once</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> This may work well for someone who isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mobile&amp;#34; while they sleep, but I&#x27;m a kicker, and more often than not this thing falls out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not in love</li>
            <li> and I will be able to use them again.</li>
            <li> So, it seems by trying to save money and not paying for the mouth guard made by the dentist, I will have to pay more for orthodontics.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Needs to be adjusted more than I would like.</li>
            <li> I switched to the Plackers dental guards and they work even better</li>
            <li> They made my jaw hurt more.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look too sturdy out of the box, but it does the job, stays in my mouth at night, not grinding, totally pleased.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job...and protects my teeth... :-)</li>
            <li> Better bargain than what the dentist provides.</li>
            <li> in that it had a guard that went over the top and bottom.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want that...but its still ok.</li>
            <li> The boil-and-bite type I use now is form-fitted to all my teeth, so the pressure is more evenly distributed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see signs of grinding on the guard, so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many bite guards and most are bulky or they rub my gums and cause sores.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the slim design of the mouth guard but with regards to protecting my molars specifically, it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having headaches when most mornings when I wake</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose to give this stars despite the issues I&#x27;ve come across because I really love the idea of the design.</li>
            <li> I wish they would be made more of rubber based material.</li>
            <li> Just need to keep them very clean as it does give you some funky breath.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good dental guard.  </li>
            <li> And truly, when I received the two-pack and inspected the product, I thought it a pretty wise buy.</li>
            <li> He says it fits pretty good</li>
            <li> At first I absolutely loved it,  </li>
            <li> However this detek is more convenent and really easy to wear/ adjust and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually more comfortable to wear it over the top teeth.  </li>
            <li> I took a razor blade and modified the guard to fit a bit better by trimming off some of the lower most plastic off.</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable than most.</li>
            <li> They are cheaper than many of the \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; type mouth guards I&#x27;ve seen and work fine.  </li>
            <li> ironically, even better than the SleepRights fit in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more comfortable now.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;d rather not wear one at all, but these are the most comfortable I&#x27;ve found for my mouth .</li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;d rather not wear one at all, but these are the most comfortable I&#x27;ve found for my mouth .</li>
            <li> After a lot of research, I chose the Dentek Comfort Fit Dental Guard and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li> The old version worked great.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the disposables as they have a better fit for my mouth.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s so much more comfortable than the ones that cover all your teeth.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not made to fit your top teeth, but it will work).</li>
            <li> It is more comfortable then others I have used.</li>
            <li> On my search for another dental guard that is of softer material and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is the most comfortable store bought guard I have used.</li>
            <li> This one is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit has a feature of touching the gum).</li>
            <li> I cannot say for sure that people with grinding/more severe cases that this would work well, but I think for just an average clencher, this works great!</li>
            <li> I tried one that fit over my top teeth-</li>
            <li> They were a bit more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Much more convent and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is thee most comfortable one to use while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> It stands up to my monster jaws&#x27; clenching and you can change the length to make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> , I find it more comfortable this way.</li>
            <li> Most comfortable night guard I have tried so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this mouthguard, it is so comfortable and lightweight</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I&#x27;m glad that I got this one instead of the bulky ones that are available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lessen the bulkiness of the bite pads, and maybe it would be more universally comfortable.</li>
            <li> It fit much better that way.  </li>
            <li> These would be a LOT more comfortable if they were made out of a pliable rubber?!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ON top of that I can breathe, they are comfortable and they don&#x27;t look or feel  like a sports mouth guard hanging out of your mouth ( play rugby).</li>
            <li> The fit was pretty good and did not irritate my mouth at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most comfortable and best-fitting nightguard I&#x27;ve come across, and it includes two in each pack.</li>
            <li> This has been the most comfortable night guard I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> My jaw is more comfortable and relaxed throughout the day.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the position easily, and more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t need to be boiled, and it is not bulky at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is super easy to adjust and extremely comfortable and effective to wear.</li>
            <li> dental guard is slim, I am able to close my mouth comfortably, and my mouth feels fine in the morning.</li>
            <li> , other than that, the cost is perfect</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t find the original ones or anything better.  </li>
            <li> and I fall asleep easily now</li>
            <li> It is not bulky, instructions are easy to understand and THERE ARE 2 OF THEM IN THE BOX.</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me I gag easily but should use a night guard.  </li>
            <li> sure to clean it every morning.</li>
            <li> It fits easily in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> The product is adjustable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> easy to sleep.</li>
            <li> I can easily wear this all through the night without any discomfort or irritation.</li>
            <li> and easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li> The adjustments easy.</li>
            <li> It cleans easily every morning</li>
            <li> it is easy to sleep with since it is not bulky at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and work better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They are easy on the mount.</li>
            <li> These work great and have better protection than my last pair.</li>
            <li> It is easy use</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust and serves the purpose of preventing jaw clenching.  </li>
            <li> and it is so easy to use</li>
            <li> Adjustments are easy</li>
            <li> I got used to them very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but I felt so strongly about it that I wanted to warn people not to buy this thinking it would help them at all.</li>
            <li> I strongly preferred  the Grind</li>
            <li> First, I tried the kind you boil.  </li>
            <li> Surely this couldn&#x27;t have been true.</li>
            <li> I sleep comfortably, better than a full mouth guard which makes me drool, and I just can&#x27;t stand to have on.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, the size is perfect, as my mouth is small.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like being required to use a certain number of words!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to fit (no boiling water required), and it lasts me 6 months.</li>
            <li> but I still think it works fine.</li>
            <li> However, it may work just fine for someone who does not have jaw problems in addition to teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> Well, when you wake up after a night with these things in your mouth, you realize that they stay in place just fine since you are buying the product b/c you clench your mouth at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this product could extended another quarter to half inch it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Its also easy to misplace with its light colors.</li>
            <li> it works fine but took a while to get the plastic taste off of it.  </li>
            <li> I can sleep just fine with it, and I wake up with no sore spots or anything like that.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and comfortable where it does not interfere with sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily I got over that, and the mouth guard survived!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wear, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard for her is extremely comfortable, not bulky at all, easy to use and wear, adjustable, no boiling-to-fit needed, and doesn&#x27;t interfere with her braces at all.</li>
            <li> acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;I am super bummed because I have not been able to find a comfortable night guard since I stopped using these ( a year ago).</li>
            <li> i adjusted it per the directions and it fit fine.</li>
            <li> After the first night, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, it&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing in the world, but I slept pretty soundly and without any mishaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can easily talk and smile while wearing it!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and very comfortable after the first night or so.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so huge that I can&#x27;t get to sleep with it</li>
            <li> These night guards make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I adjusted one of the mouthguards to fit onto my lower teeth comfortably, and that night I was sleeping sound.</li>
            <li> they are the closest to what a dentist has to offer at a huge fraction of the costs.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, affordable, easy to clean and store.  </li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t huge</li>
            <li> and it was huge</li>
            <li> -- it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve placed some huge block of plastic in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> just not for me - didn&#x27;t fit and i have to get a dentist to make me a night guard - these may work for others but not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the SleepRight custom fit night guards and they threw my jaw out of alignment, not to mention made my jaw sore and gave it cuts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable,</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get these things to fit well in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The part that goes across the front was digging into my lip and if I flipped it over it didn&#x27;t fit correctly on the sides.  </li>
            <li> and I enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> so I went on the search of a comfortable night guard</li>
            <li> fit\\&quot; guards to fit comfortably in their mouths.</li>
            <li> I have used the boil and fit type mouth guards for my teeth grinding and clenching.  </li>
            <li> I bought these Den Tek Comfort Fit Guards hoping these would work for me.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried the DenTek Comfort Fit.  </li>
            <li> Quite comfortable but the size adjustment won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a comfortable dental guard that works.</li>
            <li> The ones you boil for a custom fit always gagged me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ones that you boil and one that just fit the front teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but I still don&#x27;t enjoy having it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist wanted me to shell out (admittedly insurance would pay for it but still) over $500.00 for a guard that was custom made and fit for me.</li>
            <li> they all will), but you can just readjust the sizing to fit again.</li>
            <li> These are the best things I&#x27;ve found,I don&#x27;t have any trouble wearing them.</li>
            <li> would recommend DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard.</li>
            <li> I have worn these every night for a week now and they are extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> Should I need to replace them for any reason, I will do so happily because I would have to have purchased 10 sets of these to equal one made by the dentist.</li>
            <li> I am a female and the mouth guard fits great.  </li>
            <li> The problem it is made so cheaply.  </li>
            <li> If you need a mouth guard for TMJ, get one from your dentist so they can properly fit you and help you along the way.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s also relatively cheap and for me</li>
            <li> But if you have problems like me, then this will no longer be comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Comfort Fit NightGuard</li>
            <li> primarily because it did not require any boiling.</li>
            <li> mouth guard fits comfortably around my lower jaw.</li>
            <li> It does not bite into the gums and I can close my mouth comfortably around it.</li>
            <li> It works great, but for some reason, I keep spitting out in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was so comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It fits nicely and very flexible.</li>
            <li> guard fit</li>
            <li> and my mouth closes comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do the job, but it&#x27;s not as comfortable as the custom fit ones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adjustable to fit just about any mouth.</li>
            <li> The guards also last great.  </li>
            <li> This product is NOT a \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot;, rather, it fits SOME people correctly, but chancing that it will fit you is throwing $30 out the window, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in your mouth</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in your mouth</li>
            <li> reason I like this mouth guard is that it&#x27;s flexible and you can adjust the sides to fit into your mouth.</li>
            <li> I like the case and happy to have an extra one on hand!</li>
            <li> For me, i prefer the boil to custom fit type guards.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable for me, I have adjusted them for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> tried it on and After adjusting it, it did fit.</li>
            <li> It feels light in my mouth, it works and I can even talk with it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t sleep comfortably with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is completely comfortable and does not interfere with my sleep.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Keeps you from grinding your teeth and it&#x27;s comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Took a few nights to figure out my perfect setting.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and leaves no sore spots in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable and protects my teeth.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the size to fit your mouth without the hassle of trying to boil and mold it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and there&#x27;s no need to boil water to fit.</li>
            <li> They were comfortable when they were in tack</li>
            <li> I had another really nice mouthguard but there was just too much going on in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Comfort Fit NightGuard.</li>
            <li> After using this item you may find that your teeth will no longer fit together like they used to once your jaw muscles weaken.  </li>
            <li> DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard did NOT work well for me.  </li>
            <li> But I think it is more hygienic to replace it and get fresh ones anyways, so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Because saliva flows freely around your teeth, you don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with a gamey,</li>
            <li> They fit in your mouth well but do not have the cushion needed.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and has an adjusting strap to fit propertly.</li>
            <li> Comfort Fit because they are Guaranteed 1 year,  ...</li>
            <li> This guard uses a cheap bit of plastic that won&#x27;t hold its shape, and won&#x27;t even hold the adjustable positioning.  </li>
            <li> It fits comfortably and stays in place all night.</li>
            <li> However, I woke up with no headache and a week into it still headache free</li>
            <li> Recommend these over plastic, melt to fit type.</li>
            <li> The primary reason why I switched over to DenTek is the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, but fits comfortably over her teeth.  </li>
            <li> Like the style but not the fit.  </li>
            <li> This dental guard is a great size, it fits a smaller mouth with no problems.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and has held up well, but it is not as comfortable for me as the thinner version.</li>
            <li> They are light weight and comfortable for her to wear.</li>
            <li> I wash it every morning and adjust it to fit every evening before popping it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and adjust.  </li>
            <li> one (the smallest size) did fit lengthwise.  </li>
            <li> I tried this, &#x27;DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit&#x27;, and</li>
            <li> I am giving this guard 4 stars as it is comfortable for me to wear--way beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> , I feel they are move comfortable too.</li>
            <li> It does take some adjusting to get comfortable  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re comfortable with no pinching or rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t seem to wear this comfortably.</li>
            <li> Experienced TMJ and needed to stop clenching at night to prevent massive headaches.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit that comfortably in my mouth</li>
            <li> I could find that fit my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced Comfort Dental Protector for Teeth Grinding&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The pad does have a rubbery &#x27;give&#x27; to it, and I found the guard comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> The price is great because the 2 guards can last for months.  </li>
            <li> Its adjustable to fit any mouth.</li>
            <li> it was comfortable and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have worn nightguards for over 20 years, and I loved the old DenTek comfort fit guard.</li>
            <li> The adjustment capability is more of a joke than anything; good luck getting them the same on both sides.</li>
            <li> The original design worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Wearing sleep right for many years.</li>
            <li> This is a very good alternative product other than prescription mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and nicer than the full coverage dental guards.</li>
            <li> This product is simple to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li> this one is better than the huge hot water deal...</li>
            <li> I picked this one up and have been pretty happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> It is not bulky, I can still talk &amp; smile with it in...which is pretty amazing since it is a night guard</li>
            <li> I was also concerned about the durability since it seems pretty flimsy, but so far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, small and compact..</li>
            <li> When I first tried the DenTek Dental guards they were so much more comfortable</li>
            <li> They are much more comfortable, but the slide around more since they are smaller and more flexible.</li>
            <li> Great product as long as durability holds up</li>
            <li> When I mentioned seeing them before, he wasn&#x27;t familiar with them.  </li>
            <li> mentioned seeing them before, he wasn&#x27;t familiar with them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Den Tek for about a month and it has significantly helped with my severe sleep apnea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that this voids warranty or what</li>
            <li> I tried many mouth guards that you put in hot water</li>
            <li> I have tried several dental guards and this is by far the best fit.</li>
            <li> My original mouth guard cost $400.  </li>
            <li> the pads had signs of significant wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple night guard, and like most people with a smaller mouth, this one fits wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> When I first received them I wasn&#x27;t sure they would work</li>
            <li> The adjustment option is unique and well received in my mouth.</li>
            <li> SleepRight&#x27;s equipment feels better at first.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I want the original product that is shown.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning it is not hard just clean it as if it was your own teeth.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t too large, it would be a very comfortable guard.</li>
            <li> I recommend hydrogen peroxide baths to clean these + toothbrushing.</li>
            <li> Super comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is super comfortable.</li>
            <li> Easier to clean than the fitted guards.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s comfortable (when its fit right).</li>
            <li> i like these better than the throw aways, i just wash them with super hot water and antiseptic mouth wash, and i found that using senseodine tooth paste helps with the irratation these can sometimes cause.</li>
            <li> Still looking for that great mouthguard that is durable and comfortable, it seems like you can get one or the other, but not both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that most of the mouth guards are so large they trigger a gag reflex</li>
            <li> Love them and it certainly saved me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the older model is still available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I would pay double for more finely honed plastic parts - smoother, more rounded, maybe some size choices.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving how it works.</li>
            <li> This was true for me</li>
            <li> I could find a guard that made full contact to my bite line without wearing on my gums or saliva buildup, I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I still gagged and returned it however if you are looking for a night guard with a low profile it is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m gagging &amp; have a mouth full of saliva all night.</li>
            <li> Good to know these can last.</li>
            <li> this is a good product....fits in my mouth well and there were two (blue) guards in the box with a one year warranty.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Den Tek.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than the boil guards that cover top teeth.</li>
            <li> The bitting pad is the only good thing about it, although the 1st one had to be replaced by the 4th night.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good thought, especially beings that is</li>
            <li> Good thing they come in double packs!</li>
            <li> Better than the whole mouth ones (my opinion)  can still talk with it in</li>
            <li> No one can really tell I am even wearing the guard most of the time.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t make my mouth water like the full size</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> The full molds often give me neck pain in the morning, but I had none with this.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good option since it is smaller</li>
            <li> I used these when my NTI and full mouth piece mouth guard were being made.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have a mouth full of crowns, so took my dentist&#x27;s advice and bought a bite guard.</li>
            <li> The dental guard is very slim and fits much better then</li>
            <li> but it does not actually work as good for avoiding headaches in the morning.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s better than getting a custom guard, but I haven&#x27;t found myself using this very often.  </li>
            <li> I LOVED these night guards initially.  </li>
            <li> For the price, they should last a lot longer, but I&#x27;ll still order them as they do a good job.</li>
            <li> and i slept soundly through the night(very rare).</li>
            <li> Both get chewed up in 3 months, then I send in for 1 more, so really you get 3 for your money.  </li>
            <li> The old one would rub my gums, so I&#x27;d have to wear it a bit shorter than I liked, which caused it to float in my mouth and make my unconscious body chew on it.</li>
            <li> The headaches are not gone completely but not as many or as strong.</li>
            <li> I used the first guard for almost a year and it stayed strong, did not break, crack or chewed thru at all.</li>
            <li> Edges a bit too sharp to be great.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other guards, so can not compare them, but I am happy with these and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> So simple, easy to use and comfortable for the most part.</li>
            <li> MIght not be the best though for serious grinders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> formerly the unit would conform around on the top of your top teeth</li>
            <li> After months of intensifying jaw pain and increasing clicking and locking of my jaw muscles it was quickly reversed.</li>
            <li> It actually feels nice to have the light elevation on the jaw.</li>
            <li> They wear quickly.</li>
            <li> so I quickly purchased this.  </li>
            <li> and this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> and I do go through them much faster than the 6 months promised, but it is worth it to me to buy them more often for the comfort.</li>
            <li> This one is much better, I can actually keep it in most of the night.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, these came in a 2-pack, so to follow my dentist&#x27;s orders, as well as support my guy in wearing his, I tried out the remaining den-tek</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally found a worthwhile dental guard.</li>
            <li> This is the only  dental guard my wife is able to use, we are really pleased.  </li>
            <li> I often woke up with a mild jawache using this as a result.</li>
            <li> The original guard was very large and cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I was at first pleased by the positive reviews that I&#x27;d seen of this dental guard.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Stop Grinding Mouth Guard by BioGrind, because its reviews were more positive than those for the DenTek Dental Guard.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended trying an over the counter guard first before spending $100s on a custom fit guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was worried when I first purchased them that they wouldn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> I have used these guards for the last year and am very satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> I do not like buying dental guards that I have to boil and put a very hot dental guard into my moouth to shape it.</li>
            <li> This one is more comfortable without a doubt, but the other one is definitely more durable.</li>
            <li> This one is more comfortable without a doubt, but the other one is definitely more durable.</li>
            <li> new one is bulkier with more plastic.  </li>
            <li> Proof positive for me was when my dentist confirmed that I&#x27;d halted the toll that grinding was taking on my molars *</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my sister loves hers, so to each his own!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different bite guards over the years, but this is the first that I&#x27;ve been able to keep in my mouth over night without gagging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be a LOT happier if I didn&#x27;t have to wear one in the first place though!</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product first!</li>
            <li> This guard will help you reduce the pain from clenching while working on the reasons why you have this in the first place!</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Even more amazing is the fact that I can see slight improvement in my gum recession.  </li>
            <li> Then it popped out and on top of my tongue, but I didn&#x27;t swallow it and easily put it back.</li>
            <li> This got misshapen by the first night i used it, and the pockets for the expansions are a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> The smallest setting was a bit to large for my mouth, however it was useable and comfortable.</li>
            <li> If you want your teeth to look nice for your 90th birthday photos, consider spending a little more and get something that works (no, I am NOT a dentist).</li>
            <li> wish Den Tek would bring back the old design and give their customers a choice of the guard that works best for them instead of totally discontinuing and replacing a product that worked just fine.</li>
            <li> This guard is fairly easy to use, and is somewhat comfortable, but I find the other DenTek dental guard significantly more comfortable:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> like the fact that the strap is thinner, and the fit is much closer to my teeth.</li>
            <li> It definitely fit, thanks to the ability to adjust them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite comfortable as there is not so much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The adjustability really makes it comfortable to wear at night.</li>
            <li> The second night, I cut off the top of the T, so now I had a L shape to fit over my bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> I bought these after using the ones you have to boil for about year, and the switch was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Beware: Most of the reviews here are based on the old design of this night guard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using all types of \\&quot;nite-guards\\&quot; for years and have yet to find the most comfortable and longest lasting.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore my old dentist night guard covered my bottom teeth while these \\&quot;boil to fit\\&quot; models cover your top teeth.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I think it works better than the professional ones too.</li>
            <li> My dentist also informed me that with guards such as this kind</li>
            <li> Even better, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with closing your mouth completely as the b&amp;b did.</li>
            <li> It is nice that this one comes with two, so I will just reorder when I need to start on the second guard.  </li>
            <li> This guard took some adjusting to get a comfortable fit, but if I pull the sizer out as far as it will go, it doesn&#x27;t rub on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Not like chewing a gum but biting on it and it kind of hurts my back teeth.</li>
            <li> Throughout my adult life, I have had many dental problems--my molars would crumble and I&#x27;d have to get them replaced, until all of my molars were crowns.</li>
            <li> now I will stick to the placker&#x27;s dental guard, as they are more comfortable and can be purchased at my local dollar store.</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a go because you get two in the box</li>
            <li> I have tried several others that fit on top and it almost seems those cut my breath off...</li>
            <li> Essentially every kind you can buy, I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> For my money, worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that my teeth will move back on their own, but it looks like I will have to get the guard that is made for me at some point</li>
            <li> Hold up well, they do irritate my gums sometimes though, and the inside of my cheek too, but way worth the benefit.</li>
            <li> I found that I&#x27;ve had more, not less, soreness during the day since I started wearing this at night.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it is better than many other mainstream mouth guards I have tried.</li>
            <li> line: this one is ok, but the other is much better.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that if you are a teeth grinder you might chew through this guard pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> they are pretty comfortable and most definitely a lot cheaper than what the dentist was going to charge.  </li>
            <li> The price is right, too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these mouth guards for about a year and replace them about every 6 months (right after each dentist visit).  </li>
            <li> says right on the box do not use for TMJ disorder.&lt;br /&gt;Heard of the VA scandal?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced right and comes with two gaurds and a storage case.</li>
            <li> These wings rest right at my gumline</li>
            <li> I received this mouth guard and followed the instructions right away.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to boil it, shape it in any way, just use it right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Not the right product, didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I still really live this product as a person with a strong gag reflex (insert joke here).</li>
            <li> Also, since there isn&#x27;t much to it, I feel like it is easier to clean and just cleaner in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is surprising how small and comfortable it is, and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> It goes back to normal, but can that be good for your teeth?</li>
            <li> Please save your money or go with the classic boil and fit style guards-</li>
            <li> was anxious about it staying in place, but so far, it stays in place perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product, and I&#x27;d recommend anyone who&#x27;s used to using the full cover mouthguards to at least give these a try.</li>
            <li> The plastic shows no sign of wear where I bite down - pretty amazing!  </li>
            <li> I assume this new model is here to stay, but I wish they would go back to the older version, which I liked much better.</li>
            <li> contrast, this style of night guard is not only extremely comfortable - it is minimalist and gives just the right amount of protection; it&#x27;s also budget-friendly, easy to sterilize, transport, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and much cheaper then the typical dental guards.</li>
            <li> I hardly notice it - and it is effective in greatly lessening the ache and occasional pain</li>
            <li> The first few nights, I was guessing, but I quickly found that it fits me best at 2 on the left and 3 on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow - so much better than the giant frontal mouthguards that require boiling and fitting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now my lower teeth have moved outward far enough that my upper teeth perfectly rest on my lower braces, even with the bonding material.  </li>
            <li> These would be great even if they were sold at the usual price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is so great, that it made me write one.</li>
            <li> We liked the idea that it doesn&#x27;t require melting plastic to mold it to your mouth, but this is one is clearly not one size fits all.</li>
            <li> Nothing large and protruding to try and sleep with Buy them!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have an unusual jaw (for example, m.tori), then you will most likely be okay with the new design.</li>
            <li> I have tried three different \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; night-time night guards, but could not get one to fit my mouth comfortably.  </li>
            <li> This was the ONLY mouth guard that fit in my mouth that was comfortable (</li>
            <li> does the job for $25 and is actually more comfortable (from what I have heard from those who spent that 2 grand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used generic versions of the same design and they were great.  </li>
            <li> These Comfort Fit dental guards are light and open but they protect well and stand up to my molars.  </li>
            <li> I doubt it would have lasted another month), my bite had significantly changed after each night and would take hours to return to normal.</li>
            <li> We have gone through several dental guards, but the DenTek&#x27;s are the first pair to actually fit comfortably</li>
            <li> caused me and my husband to grip even harder, not for me but glad I did not spend the money to have my dentist make one!</li>
            <li> RIGHT SLIM COMFORT is pricey and last up to a month top.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very much, cause it makes my inside cheek area puffy after wearing it all night.</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonably priced alternative to custom made guards.  </li>
            <li> like it very much.</li>
            <li> This new one changes the blue plastic that your teeth hit in a way that is way more comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot decide whether I find this more comfortable than other mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> That one is almost the exact same design, except that this one is much more comfortable, as the plastic pieces that fit between top &amp; bottom teeth is so much smaller that it allows your jaw to rest comfortably (unlike the other brand&#x27;s model).  </li>
            <li> This particular package comes with cleaning powder, which is cool.  </li>
            <li> The new version is thicker than my original one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horribly priced, but it&#x27;s got me looking at other products again for items that may last longer or fit more</li>
            <li> An annoyance most guards give me is the inability to speak and these are definitely not sexy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These stayed exactly where they started from the beginning of the night to end.  </li>
            <li> : Make sure you get the ones with the blue bite pads.  </li>
            <li> I have been using DenTek for years and this is the first time i have used this model.  </li>
            <li> I saw their products on ebay, too, but the reviews on ebay are too short to be able to get an informed opinion.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds of over-the-counter night guards, trying to avoid paying hundreds of dollars for one from the dentist, and this one works well for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using the first one.</li>
            <li> The first night I spit them out because it hurt my lower gums.  </li>
            <li> This is the first review I have posted</li>
            <li> This happened on the first night and with both of the guards in the twin pack.</li>
            <li> The first night I wore it,  the clicking and jaw discomfort did not subside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get these first before getting the one the dentist recommends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to deal with migraines from it &amp; had to use muscle relaxers when the muscle in my jaw became so inflammed &amp; irritated that the whole side of my face &amp; neck swelled up!</li>
            <li> ok, first of all, i bought these at Target for $18 a month ago - way cheaper than Amazon&#x27;s current price of $29!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first mouth guard i can sleep with, even though i wake up every morning</li>
            <li> you shape with hot water and your teeth, but they are so bulky</li>
            <li> You get two of them in the package but my first set did not come with a case to put them in and I ended up loosing them when I was traveling.</li>
            <li> When I first got the product, I was pretty unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I thought it should have made it through the first week...  </li>
            <li> This mouth guard left sores in my mouth and had my jaw hurting more than</li>
            <li> As I said, this was a first for me.  </li>
            <li> this mouth guard for years- when it only had one ridge (covering just the side of the bottom teeth &amp; in between top &amp; bottom teeth).</li>
            <li> Then DenTek changed the design to add another ridge/wing, maybe 3-5 months ago, (now there&#x27;s plastic covering both the sides of upper &amp; lower teeth &amp; in-between top &amp; bottom)</li>
            <li> Just rinse under hot water and insert into the mouth.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for their first mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard is by far the easiest guard to use.  </li>
            <li> This is first night guard I tried after doing a bit of research.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is a better deal, overall.</li>
            <li> noticed after the first couple of nights wearing it that I had TMJ pain and soreness when my teeth touched together (which lingered for about an hour after waking up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TMJ has a natural \\&quot;resting\\&quot; point that is comfortable for your jaw.</li>
            <li> Just be aware when I used this dental guard for one night it threw my bite off for days</li>
            <li> Still, it seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li> I had greater pain in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try first.</li>
            <li> Took me one or two nights to get used to it, but I am overall satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> the first two nights I lost it and found it in the sheets.</li>
            <li> The clenching and pressure is focused mostly on my molars, so I did not need any of those big bulky trays.</li>
            <li> First off, my problem is teeth clenching, not grinding, so this is what this review is based one.</li>
            <li> I wore it the first time and it hurt my bottom gums,but the following night i put it on my top teeth and</li>
            <li> This one by DenTek is different - comfortable from the time I put it in!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay $400 for a guard from the dentist, especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think I relax more since I know I won&#x27;t be chomping on my back molars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this, now i&#x27;m definitely saving my molars.</li>
            <li> After trying several over-the-counter mouth guards, I found this one to be by far the most comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I had one of those retainers you put in hot water</li>
            <li> actually sleep with it covering my top molars rather than my bottom</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the fault of the product exactly, but be warned you should consider a dental appliance for bruxing if you have the means.ancially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the fault of the product exactly, but be warned you should consider a dental appliance for bruxing if you have the means.</li>
            <li> They sent me Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard at no cost.  </li>
            <li> It requires heating in hot water to form to your teeth</li>
            <li> the Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard feels and looks just like my wife&#x27;s (and she paid a couple hundred at the dentist).  </li>
            <li> : First, I hear up a hot rice or heat pad and wrap it in a towel.  </li>
            <li> This one looked like it had been used for six months after the first night--</li>
            <li> This dental guard worked really well for me, but I think your success with it depends on your issue.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be working great the first couple weeks, but lately I do still wake up with a sore jaw and headache some mornings even though I wear it at night.</li>
            <li> And it actually prevented it(for most of the time), and my braces did not break from my tooth anymore.</li>
            <li> I was nervous after the first night</li>
            <li> but since this is made by a dental company with a support team that can help with questions, and they work for me, I am thinking its better than continuing to use nothing regularly grind away.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this dental guard would fall out of my mouth, as it seems like there is nothing holding it in place, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now</li>
            <li> When I first saw DenTek, out of the box, it did not feel as comfortable as the old SleepRight I was using.</li>
            <li> She has had the first one since January of this year and hasn&#x27;t had to change it out.</li>
            <li> This is my first time getting a mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I tried to put it on the first night</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it</li>
            <li> They do exactly as they are supposed to: they protect your teeth at night from grinding IF they stay in.</li>
            <li> Would probably work ok for someone with a larger mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first started buying one that you heat and shape</li>
            <li> its more than likely</li>
            <li> It hurt my gums at first for a couple of weeks, but once I got used to it, it was all comfort.</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t stop the grinding, but it prevents the lower teeth from touching the upper teeth.)</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY dental guard I am able to wear.</li>
            <li> They recommend you \\&quot;see your dentist for a consultation within the first 3 months of using the product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Always come back for more.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouth guard I have been able to tolerate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many different kinds of nightguards.</li>
            <li> The pictures show EXACTLY what you get.</li>
            <li> I used my guard the first night, and while I did fall out the first night, that has not repeated in the weeks since.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s pretty bulky).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since moved onto cheaper and smaller moldable guards that have been much better.</li>
            <li> However, I have a filling on the top of my back molar which broke twice while I was using this guard --</li>
            <li> It cracked the first night after I started using the guard, and the repaired filling cracked again after about two months of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mouth guards and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my mouth hurt by the morning.</li>
            <li> i first purchased these</li>
            <li> this is my first mouth guard (box had two)</li>
            <li> first night using it</li>
            <li> They last a while, but I change these out more than recommended.</li>
            <li> Plus they sent 2, which I wasn&#x27;t aware of when I ordered.</li>
            <li> However, the first night it gave me blisters on my gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Custom made ones fit perfectly, but they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a case to store them in but they fit in the many cases left from the other gaurds I&#x27;ve tried or in Mom&#x27;s old denture dish, so</li>
            <li> Well, that&#x27;s about it,  better size and less material, but it isn&#x27;t comfortable, it irritates my gums and cheeks, and I don&#x27;t sleep well at night with it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The previous version without these was much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minimally invasive and easy to fit.</li>
            <li> After one night, DenTek delivers as promised, and most importantly, cost less.</li>
            <li> I have previously used an acqualizer which is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> the plastic will warp fairly easily with biting thus you will end up with a mutilated dental guard which WILL cut into your tongue, the good thing is that you can trim off the ends that are fairly thin and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> The blue pads go over your bottom teeth so for me this was much more familiar based on my old night guard.</li>
            <li> It seem to stay in the right spot without moving too much.</li>
            <li> so I grind right through these guards far too quickly.</li>
            <li> I placed mine on the upper teeth since it felt more comfortable and it barely looks like I have anything in.  </li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and teeth an this dental guard is great for that.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth at night and am a light sleeper/sleep walker &amp; talker so was a little worried about whether or not I would be able to keep a bite guard in my mouth all night without choking on it or taking it out in my sleep.</li>
            <li> Very small and does a great job.</li>
            <li> The other kind rubbed and loosened the filling.</li>
            <li> Please bring back the original!</li>
            <li> Someone recommended I try this smaller ready to wear DenTek Comfort Fit and my problems were over!  </li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s good overall, but I definitely prefer my custom one!</li>
            <li> If you really grind your teeth these will not last you for more than 6 month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are far, far better than that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably about 3 years overdue in getting a replacement, but it&#x27;s finally come to the point where I no longer feel good about putting that night guard back in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My first dental guard was too large and my teeth hurt in the morning from grinding on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first Dentek guard and it is going strong, about a year later.  </li>
            <li> This one is very small and very effective.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even believe that this product could get any positive reviews at all.</li>
            <li> so I have contacted Dentek about a replacement and on the issue of possibly designing future models with more secure adjustment straps.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that doesn&#x27;t really look like it would work at first until you try</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare it with since its my first one.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was strange but it surely happens it seems.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the lengthy notes on the back of the package, as there are some important considerations, such as TMJ, bite changes, etc., that users need to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> This product is the first (out of many I tried) that was small, comfortable and I could even talk while it is in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Good things do come in small packages.</li>
            <li> The size is good for small to medium mouth.</li>
            <li> The old adage is true: you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very minimal so it doesn&#x27;t feel to invasive, and they last for months which is great.</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve had is for the first 1-2 weeks, it did make my bottom gums a bit sore - they&#x27;re fine now, though.</li>
            <li> Although the bite guard didn&#x27;t work for me, because I have a SEVERE teeth grinding problem, think the guard is a clever idea and would work for most with a lesser problem.</li>
            <li> It will last longer, and has been a true teeth saver!</li>
            <li> It is low profile, so it grinds away more quickly than other dental guards, so expect to replace it more frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the regular mouth guards where you have to boil them first, then fit them, and this product has exceeded those plus my expectations.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my mouth is nearly the size that these night guards loosen up to.</li>
            <li> please just keep in mind that if you have a small mouth with a lot of crowding, perhaps this isn&#x27;t the most comfortable product to use.</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this comfort-fit mouth guard that sat nicely on the lower teeth.</li>
            <li> have had no trouble keeping this device in my mouth; it is comfortable and I can talk normally while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I have a super sensitive gag reflex and</li>
            <li> If you have a mild problem, and if you have a sensitive gag reflex, this might help, but do see your dentist if it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> my mouth being super sensitive, but I just could not fall asleep with this thing on.</li>
            <li> If I opened my mouth a certain way, I could also feel the jaw pop out of place a bit.  </li>
            <li> It worked quite well, for the problem of clamping my teeth too much, but after a while my teeth were kind of uncomfortable, it may be my own particular problem and not the fault of the kit.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the extra wings on the top which you see in the new design box picture.  </li>
            <li> The new design is just as comfortable as the old ones</li>
            <li> One week into using them, my headaches are gone, and I wake up with a much more relaxed, loose jaw.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fit &amp; wear; takes a few days to get use to it.</li>
            <li> This new version is fine; the extra piece that goes over the outside of the top teeth doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other mouth guards in the past but like these the best.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this is because  had a much more form fitting one before and wanted something less obvious.</li>
            <li> The material was comfortable and I barely felt the guard in my mouth, unlike other more obtrusive guards I had tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a little fear, I&#x27;ve used another kind for years, and I needed to replace it.</li>
            <li> The good thing is they aren&#x27;t bulky, but the hard plastic on the sides caused a sore on my gum that resulted in pain and inflamation.</li>
            <li> Better than those big over all the top teeth models, this little thing just sits between your molars.</li>
            <li> I have not tried these out yet, so I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars, but it a huge improvement from what the night guards used to be.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t understand how they fit properly, but now it is working like a charm.</li>
            <li> This one is very tiny and really didn&#x27;t fit my mouth, even with the adjustments.</li>
            <li> The DenTek &amp;#34;Comfort&amp;#34; Fit has to be my least favorite to date.</li>
            <li> My dentist wants me to have a $400+ dental guard to keep me from clenching my teeth, but I can&#x27;t afford that.</li>
            <li> My gums have yet to get irritated like before and the nightguard stayed in place the whole night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really helps fight bruxism.</li>
            <li> or so if I really wanted to stretch it</li>
            <li> I recently went to the dentist,and she wanted to custom fit me for a dental guard.</li>
            <li> I would definately this product to anyone who wants to save money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very conferable and protects without feeling bulky.</li>
            <li> There were once available at my local CVS, but I can no longer find them in the stores.  </li>
            <li> They are more expensive than the boil mouth guards, but also far more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have had bruxism my whole life</li>
            <li> and this is the only one that has helped, comfortable, and stays in place all night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really grind my teeth, but I clench them, and sometimes if my tongue or cheeks get in the way, I would wake up with sores.</li>
            <li> I am going to use an athletic mouth guard that costs about $1 and will form to your teeth by boiling it and placing it in your mouth and sucking on it to form fit your teeth until I can get back to the dentist.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really keep my mouth shut.  </li>
            <li> so I am not clenching as much during the day.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Even though it states on the box that it is not for TMJ, it really did work.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on how to fit, and after one night of use I had cuts on my gums and sores on my inner cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I grind my teeth, but it should be noted that the product is very flimsy and it literally felt like razor blades were in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This dental guard is flimsy and awkward and I have no idea what position is best for my alignment/jaw.  </li>
            <li> You can tell that the two rubber pieces really take a beating through the night but they have not shown any sign of falling apart or wearing out, just teeth marks.</li>
            <li> I left my custom nightguard at my boyfriend&#x27;s house, and I needed a cheap replacement until I saw him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really hope DenTek will take notice and redesign their mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some fractured teeth and my dentist wants me to spend $700 in guards.  </li>
            <li> This one is comfortable enough to keep in.</li>
            <li> I need a guard and can&#x27;t afford a real one</li>
            <li> This product was uncomfortable and incredibly flimsy.</li>
            <li> It really helps to reduce the morning after pain of the grinding.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t find a downside to this product at the moment.</li>
            <li> This is the smallest night guard I&#x27;ve tried but it works very well.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast forward 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Trim too much and the slide will pop out ruining the guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now alternating nights with and without the guard because it hurts too much.</li>
            <li> I like this newer model much more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe this product may have been responsible for ruining a composite crown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t notice it too much in my mouth-</li>
            <li> This really helped her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight ans slim.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my headaches have been decreasing so this thing really is working for me.</li>
            <li> They are fairly comfortable and don&#x27;t force your mouth open at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the plates that fit around the teeth are larger, causing them to jut into the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I had been using a custom fit night guard that my dentist ordered back in 2005</li>
            <li> There are 5 settings that you can use to stretch out the plastic band so the blue pads securely cover your molars.</li>
            <li> My jaw muscles are usually very sore, and I realize that I clench during my day a lot.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I try to be</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth so much at night that I had ground out my fillings.</li>
            <li> Thank you, my jaw thanks you.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to use than guards you have to boil.</li>
            <li> She said it fits comfortable enough and does help keep her from grinding her teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different types/models and this is by far the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> only concern is that to make the fit adjustable, the connecting strip slides into a sort of tunnel in each of the wings.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to really get in there and rinse that tunnel out.</li>
            <li> So I soak the whole thing in mouthwash once a week.</li>
            <li> It gets a bit sore there, but it&#x27;s only really noticeable when I first put the mouth guard in, and first thing in the morning, so at the moment it&#x27;s worth dealing with in order to not grind my teeth into pearly stumps.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li> and I can actually close my mouth comfortably.  </li>
            <li> The problem I had was that sense this product doesn&#x27;t conform to your teeth, there is nothing really holding it in place at night.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose with Dentek&#x27;s  money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Really like the slender profile and bulk-less design,</li>
            <li> If you grind your teeth, this is probably not the product for you as there is really nothing to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> There is really nothing to them but they have held up well.</li>
            <li> But they are very flimsy and not at all well made for grinding of the teeth in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The biting plate is now much thicker</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It lasted a whole 3 nights and both sides completely flattened out, ending up meeting in the middle, on top of my tongue, making it ineffective for grinding.</li>
            <li> They are low profile, light and the plastic bite plates are adjustable.</li>
            <li> The real pain is looking for them in the morning.</li>
            <li> how much it helped.  </li>
            <li> It adjusts to my mouth great and had saved my teeth from being damaged even worse.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it took about 20 minutes before my jaw hurt so much</li>
            <li> However, the BioGrind was too much silicone for my mouth</li>
            <li> It took about a week to get through one whole night without it falling out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was very concerned it would dislodge and choke me in my sleep.</li>
            <li> which is what my dentist wants.</li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the cheap generics.</li>
            <li> and they have help me so much with my grinding of my teeth when I sleep at night.</li>
            <li> These are working out very well...</li>
            <li> I think that this can&#x27;t replace a real mouth guard done and adjusted by the dentist.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take much to set this off.</li>
            <li> Personally, I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone would find that comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.  </li>
            <li> The only comfortable, adjustable dental guard on the market that I know</li>
            <li> Does its job, but the &#x27;click to adjust length&#x27; does not work very well after a time.</li>
            <li> like I do with the DenTek ones) and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> And much cheaper and a 10 count!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very adjustable.  </li>
            <li> - it was comfortable, stayed in place, and was ungrindable, but i&#x27;d only recommend it IF you&#x27;ve never had any orthodontic work.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the smallest, least instrusive mouth guarf and thought this would be good.</li>
            <li> The bite-pads are just too thin to prevent my top teeth from touching my bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more clutsy and bigger than the old Dentec I had.</li>
            <li> She asked about what kind of mouth guard I was wearing, and when I told her, she said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know why they still allow them to sell that type,&amp;#34; and explained how by not containing the front teeth, the pressure that is placed downward on the back teeth is displaced to the only place the energy can go--the front teeth.  </li>
            <li> They apparently released a new version which is WAY better than the old.</li>
            <li> Luckily Dentek offers a full money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> after my first night trying this mouthguard out, I started experiencing some mild pain the next day.  </li>
            <li> thanks to amazon for offering this on subscribe &amp; save, and many thanks to the other reviewers for sharing their experience.</li>
            <li> Its easy to clean, flexible enough to really fit anyone&#x27;s mouth, and its small, so you really can&#x27;t notice it when you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> my TMJ pain was greatly increased due to it slipping around.</li>
            <li> My front teeth were straight on top of each other.  </li>
            <li> I have a serious problem with grinding my teeth &amp; have never been able to use any of the custom fit mouthguards because they are so bulky they throw my jaw out</li>
            <li> The old design only had the flanges that went down so that the dental guard fit nicely on your teeth.</li>
            <li> BUT I would say better than the other products out there.</li>
            <li> I bought these Dentek guards, and they were SO much better than any of the other guards that were made for me.  </li>
            <li> I found that mine worked better with one side on \\&quot;1\\&quot; and the other side on \\&quot;2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I had originally thought I had just spat it out in my sleep, but as I searched though the bedsheets, my husband awoke to inform me that I&#x27;d been choking on something earlier.</li>
            <li> So, moral is, it may or may not work for you, but worth a try!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I could close my mouth when I go to sleep unlike other bulky ones.</li>
            <li> Go back to the original minimalist design.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel durable at all, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I could pull it apart with little effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I find it more comfortable upside down with loop in front of upper teeth - it doesn&#x27;t matter, can be worn either way.  </li>
            <li> To clean it,I just run it under water &amp; slide the pads back &amp; forth on the adjustable piece to rinse it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, light, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This one also has parts that go alongside the upper teeth, making it more bulky and less comfortable.</li>
            <li> clean the guard with soap &amp; water (dr bronner&#x27;s peppermint) upon removal AND prior to insertion.</li>
            <li> Most bite guards last me at least a year, some more, but never have I gone through one this fast.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and a strong gag reflex so the thought of trying to sleep with something in my mouth to prevent me from grinding my teeth was truely repulsive.</li>
            <li> This model is pretty comfortable because it doesn&#x27;t fill your mouth, it positions plastic bumpers at strategic places to keep teeth from contacting each other when the jaw is clenched.</li>
            <li> I know, how sad to be SO THRILLED about a mouth guard, but I think that&#x27;s a clear testament to how stressful it is to have no acceptable options for comfortable and efficient mouth guards - but now that this one is here, what a relief!  </li>
            <li> This is the first mouth-guard that doesn&#x27;t rub anywhere inside my mouth and isn&#x27;t completely embarrassing to sleep with in my mouth.</li>
            <li> For the most part, these last me longer than 6 months, more like 9 months at least.</li>
            <li> For the most part, these last me longer than 6 months, more like 9 months at least.</li>
            <li> The grinding can also be pretty loud, which my partner doesn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> It operates on the opposite concept from my original choice-instead of keeping my teeth separated from the front, it has two pieces that fit between my molars, top and bottom, with just a thin piece to go around my front teeth and keep it connected.</li>
            <li> size is nice and small.</li>
            <li> The product works ok, but is not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, when they get really sore, I&#x27;ll wear this on my top teeth instead to give them a little break</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live or sleep without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cost me a mint in new fillings!)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will probably go back to the athletic style ones from Dentek, they seem more comfortable, no moving parts, they just don&#x27;t last as long...</li>
            <li> The only great thing I have to say about this product is the Dentek&#x27;s customer support was extrememly curtious,fast,patient, and didn&#x27;t give me a hard time about wanting to make a return.</li>
            <li> Unless they revert to the previous model i&#x27;d be better off not wearing any guard.</li>
            <li> somehow which made it more or less unwearable.</li>
            <li> I took it to my dentist on my next visit thinking that he won&#x27;t like it because he could have done better with a custom design by him, but when he looked at it he actually approved it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> People discussed that the one with blue guard was the better design, mine came in blue.</li>
            <li> use a file to shape-so it doesn&#x27;t push on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Decent product for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Luckily, my purchase included two guards and I promptly popped the next one on.</li>
            <li> My wife said that next time she&#x27;ll get the Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard when her couple-hundred dollar guard needs replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip:</li>
            <li> but I was surprised not only do they fit</li>
            <li> This also causes irritation to the teeth and ultimately could lead to gum-line recession, but, in the short term, it would probably just cause most people discomfort, as it did with me.</li>
            <li> My only complain is that they added an extra part on the top of the bite pad on each side.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, recommend it to anyone and will only buy this dental guard in the future.</li>
            <li> I think that the fit is just not tight enough for me.</li>
            <li> But these are way better because they are small and fit perfectly on upper or lower, whichever is your preference.</li>
            <li> It is cheap-- a package of 2 will last a full year-- compared to the hundreds of dollars I spent on the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comfort Fit Dental Guard first, the same guard that I have been using for several years, before going to all that expense.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the dark blue, round, pill-stacker canisters from the Vitamin Shoppe work perfectly.</li>
            <li> (Thanks, old dentist!  </li>
            <li> These were small and super comfortable and I used them for about 4 years.  </li>
            <li> It worked great at protecting my back molars, only problem is now my front four incisors have been ground down revealing dentin, which i believe happened while wearing the product.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend these</li>
            <li> Highly recommend getting from dentist.</li>
            <li> I tried it because of the high ratings.  </li>
            <li> Also the sides are so high that they sink into my gum and causing blisters.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The teeth pads do wear out relatively quickly if you are a heavy grinder - I can&#x27;t make them last more than 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is weird because now all the pressure is on your molars which becomes very noticeable and takes time to get used to, you can wear it upside down and have them hanging from the top which is slightly more comfortable</li>
            <li> My last one was a little simpler and just a little more comfortable, but this will work fine.</li>
            <li> I slept with it in last night and for the first time in months I woke without a headache!</li>
            <li> This one has little tabs that go up the top gums.  </li>
            <li> you have minor or infrequent grinding, I think this would be a good product, however, I also feel its a little pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> When I first had it in, I thought it would be pretty tough to spit it out during sleep as it felt pretty securely placed.</li>
            <li> This guard takes up a lot less space in the mouth than other guards, so you might think that it would be more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Of all the Dentek products I&#x27;ve tried, this is probably one of the most comfortable, at least initially.</li>
            <li> I am really upset that the old version is no longer being made.  </li>
            <li> so I really didn&#x27;t want something that completely encased my teeth when all I needed was a spacer.</li>
            <li> my top teeth cause after a few days on my bottom teeth it started to irritate my bottom gums...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just barely worn out my first guard after 2 months</li>
            <li> It does not fit on the teeth but just provides a barrier between top and bottom.  </li>
            <li> I guess its ok; I have tried a few over the counter dental guards.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth stockpiling for future use.</li>
            <li> If I get a lil sore spot on my gums, which rarely but occasionally happens, I just move the guard lil bit &amp; the irritation goes away in a day or two.  </li>
            <li> Pretty comfortable, I have used them for a few months now.</li>
            <li> at first i LOVED this product, but then my expensive orthodontic work got all out of whack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read reviews about people flipping them upside down because they hurt their gums, I didn&#x27;t have the problem but found it more comfortable to wear them unpside down for my jaw issues.</li>
            <li> sure to rinse it so that the saliva doesn&#x27;t dry and make it gross.</li>
            <li> adjustability is also nice at first, but after a few weeks it became loose, so the guard would resize itself overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is compact enough to not hurt your gums or jaws and it stays in place with just the right amount of thickness to protect your teeth from grinding.</li>
            <li> In order for this to stay put you have to bite down on it, other wise it wiggles all over the place.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to know that the front band connecting the two bitewings is flexible (in the picture you see I am bending it), which allows for some movement compared to other mouthguards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the DenTek Comfort-Fit Dental Guards for years because they were BPA free, lighter than other brands, and they didn&#x27;t irritate my gums or the side of the mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this until I could get a new one from my dentist and tried it out.</li>
            <li> With the new design, you can tell I have something in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> and they said they changed to this new design in January 2013.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to guard to keep my teeth from grinding at night.</li>
            <li> because this guard was causing my grinding to be restricted to my molars and causing all of that new jaw pain.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> -I have not found any issues with them &#x27;wearing out&#x27;, but when they do, I will just order a new set.</li>
            <li> The new design is a bit \\&quot;clunkier\\&quot; than what I am used to, with side guards going in both directions.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li> and I knew I couldn&#x27;t live with it.</li>
            <li> I do not like the new design.</li>
            <li> They cost more,but I can&#x27;t use the new model.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth at night and it is hard to wear a full mouth guard with full ortho.  </li>
            <li> and it is very light and small</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although still need to test how long it can last (quick thin), but in general a good buy!</li>
            <li> It works, will still test new products as they come available as neither are perfect.to give it a 3 since its served me well enough in the last 3 pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also others I&#x27;ve tried that are adjustable are harder to clean.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that&#x27;s comfortable and actually last to three months.</li>
            <li> Amazon provided efficient service and offered an item I have used for several years but is no longer available at local stores in my area.</li>
            <li> I have used this item several nights now and like its low profile and fit of it.</li>
            <li> It is the same brand and product but the fit is different.  </li>
            <li> Moved around in the mouth too much and the plates themselves are too rigid - and too thick to me really comfortable!</li>
            <li> The pads are suppose to be mid molar, I couldn&#x27;t find a place that was comfortable with the strap around the bottom teeth it pulled my teeth back</li>
            <li> Tried this one first and have used it for a few nights, and so far it fits my small mouth nicely!</li>
            <li> The material is very soft.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;d highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I still tried it even though it really didn&#x27;t fit, and as I expected it was laying in the bed that next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sharing my experience with everyone because I&#x27;ve gone through so many other night guards just to end up spitting them out in the middle of the night</li>
            <li> This was the last model I tried and when I woke after the first night of using it, it was not to be found.  </li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t know if it prevents me from grinding, but it definitely keeps my teeth from touching and filing each other down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After only the first night, the bite pads had dents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been fitted by professional dentist with other TMJ splints, none of which are as comfortable as this Dentek.</li>
            <li> I at first expressed displeasure in knowing he witnessed me choking in my sleep and did nothing to assist, but he assured me that it was a fairly brief matter with about thirty seconds of coughing and sputtering before the sounds subsided</li>
            <li> and I was swept back into a peaceful slumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed after the first use that the dentek had stuck to this same crown.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot more money buying the mouth guard that covers your teeth completely and they never last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them every night for more than 6 years and vastly prefer them to any other brands I&#x27;ve tried and to the ones that the dentist has custom-made for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every morning, I rinse with hot water and mouthwash and only have to replace about every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> -that was okay, but following a suggestion in one of the other reviews</li>
            <li> This is the third dental guard that I have bought, first the boil and bite type, which ended up moving my teeth and affecting my bite.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed since it is one of the best products I have found for grinding without paying a lot.</li>
            <li> The actual usage is very different, but not necessary better.</li>
            <li> Walmart in the store has the exact same 2 pack for about $30.00 !!</li>
            <li> first pack did not come with a case, but the second one did</li>
            <li> At first I tried the regular DenTek dental guard, didn&#x27;t like it, but suffered with it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product, however, it is still too big for my tiny mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However this brings about new but for me less important issues.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I have a small mouth, and get a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I appreciate the blue pads, since I would put down the older one, and not be able to find it, because it was all clear</li>
            <li> He said he likes how he can move the guard up and down, adjusting it to where he feels comfortable.</li>
            <li> I wish they were white, or clear, as the blue makes them more noticable when I talk or open</li>
            <li> The bite pad seems a little thicker and the side wings on the top give it a distinctly different \\&quot;feel\\&quot; then the older version.  </li>
            <li> Only your back teeth are biting into this mouth guard, but it effectively stops your other teeth from grinding too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when I replace my old one with a new one, I have a couple of nights of re-adjusting to the difference in size in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Even when I replace my old one with a new one, I have a couple of nights of re-adjusting to the difference in size in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I needed a new mouthguard as my old one was lost.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that this new design wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the old one.  </li>
            <li> Typically I get about 7 hours sleep and still comfortable, but after sleep over 9 hours, I&#x27;ve noticed some discomfort with my gums.</li>
            <li> Not super comfortable if you are thinking about it or are not used to having something in your mouth but when you wear it every night you get used to it.</li>
            <li> The only problem I found was that after wearing it for a couple of weeks it gets stretched out and doesn&#x27;t fit as well.</li>
            <li> few problems:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s fairly easy to chew through these things.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as expected and came quickly.</li>
            <li> I believe that gravity + the fact that your molars are heavier and are more likely to clamp down than your front teeth.  </li>
            <li> When I had my first filling ever for the chipped molar (luckily I&#x27;ve never had cavities), the dentist noticed my bite was directly hitting that newly filled spot so much that we had to leave an empty space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have previously used the earlier version of this night guard, and it was okay.</li>
            <li> :  I&#x27;ve started wearing the guards upside down (having the groove cupping my upper teeth) and it has so far worked out better for me.  </li>
            <li> the very place where I should have put it right when I bought it: flushed down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the very place where I should have put it right when I bought it: flushed down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seemed to work as intended the first few nights but the wear was pretty evident after only 1 night.</li>
            <li> As I turned up with nothing, and thought about the description of the choking episode I had earlier in the evening, I was far less pleased with the purchase of this mouthguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband</li>
            <li> and I had an uneven fit that couldn&#x27;t have been less comfortable.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but is not comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> Now when I drink water I am more careful to keep my teeth loosely together when I swallow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small,flimsy, and pinches the gum line a little, but overall it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also developed a habit of sucking on them in my sleep (or sucking my cheeks in), which makes them press up so tight against my cheeks that it leave sore spots - but I think that is me &amp; not the guard causing it, I&#x27;m having big issues with insomnia which makes be grind my teeth more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also developed a habit of sucking on them in my sleep (or sucking my cheeks in), which makes them press up so tight against my cheeks that it leave sore spots - but I think that is me &amp; not the guard causing it, I&#x27;m having big issues with insomnia which makes be grind my teeth more.</li>
            <li> As my dentist explained to me, because of their large size and design in which they mold around all of the teeth, they inhibit the natural flow of saliva at night, which actually helps to prevent</li>
            <li> In most circumstances, it&#x27;s hardly detectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The comfort level is very high and though one may fear it choking someone while sleeping, it stays relatively in place throughout the night.</li>
            <li> It has effectively prevented damage to my teeth that previously occurred due to grinding while sleeping.</li>
            <li> not as big as other mouth protectors and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The bad part is that the guard sits on my molars, the place where I was grinding my teeth the most and having the most TMJ symptoms.  </li>
            <li> Plus I could not speak clearly without removing them.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m ready to take the next step and throw my 6 year old night guard into the trash.</li>
            <li> Just keep searching for the clear package.</li>
            <li> The problems I have encountered are: too soft</li>
            <li> I run across this one and so far.. 1 week in..</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t even come close to it so far.  </li>
            <li> This fixed that problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard Kit).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the money to have my detist make a professional guard</li>
            <li> so far..</li>
            <li> The soft adjustable band will not hold this in my mouth no matter how I adjust it.</li>
            <li> With the old design, I could speak clearly and no one could tell I had it in.  </li>
            <li> a soft rubber heat molded mouth guard</li>
            <li> I was very discouraged  after paying the big dollars for the device the dentist  sold me that made me gag.  </li>
            <li> they are very flexible, and don&#x27;t make me feel like i&#x27;ve got ten pounds of chewing gum stuck in my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;to be sure, DenTek&#x27;s adjustment part is shoddy as heck</li>
            <li> disgusting...overall, because it is so much smaller there isn&#x27;t as much room for bacteria to proliferate.</li>
            <li> Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard Kit for years and decided to take a look at this one out of curiosity.</li>
            <li> The pad doesn&#x27;t cover my teeth completely inward, and it pinches my gums.  </li>
            <li> and I have completely destroyed all of them.</li>
            <li> The 2nd one has lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t very bulky, but it totally didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it keeps my teeth apart a bit too much &amp; makes my jaw sore in the morning but that feeling does wear off after a while.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a concept...</li>
            <li> And my cat really like chewing on them if left out and reachable....</li>
            <li> DO want to stress the importance of preventing the grinding of your natural teeth.</li>
            <li> The part that goes across your teeth sticks out too far and presses against your tongue.</li>
            <li> It is soft and pliable in my mouth</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s much to the night guard aside from a plastic strap and two blue pads, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I will be scouring stores to find the old style.</li>
            <li> I received the dentek guard and was surprised at how sleek the design was.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s is soft rubber-like feel and</li>
            <li> Completely cleared up jaw discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it on.</li>
            <li> I became really conscious of that.</li>
            <li> They fit firmly and NEVER come out.</li>
            <li> This one looks the same on the box, but in person, the pads are much thicker and this has lead to some discomfort for me in my jaws.  </li>
            <li> Upon arrival, I was surprised to discover they had changed the design.  </li>
            <li> Dentek Professional Maximum Protection Dental]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the current time, it works as a temporary measure, but if you have the finances for a real mouth guard that is fitted, I would recommend that option.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not bothered by it.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised that it did not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> It is not huge and fits comfortably.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic is too thick (AKA, the top teeth and the bottom teeth are too far apart upon biting down).&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think they are a bit too thick as my wife seems to grind more with them in (like her mind thinks hey there is something to chew on).</li>
            <li> These are good dental guards, but they are too expensive.</li>
            <li> Please bring back the old design which was slightly thinner and didn&#x27;t have the full &#x27;bite wing&#x27; design!  </li>
            <li> What was shipped was a redesigned product which is not at all comfortable due to its larger and thicker size.</li>
            <li> Granted, they won&#x27;t last as long as the expensive guard I had made by the dentist, but this is so much more comfortable to sleep with, and my teeth do not touch, which is the whole point of the guard.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be small and easy to use, but I did find it bulky</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and smaller than the other dental guards.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and was thrilled to have a low profile guard that I could wear during the day also-</li>
            <li> I put it in just fine when I went to bed and went to sleep, nothing out of the ordinary so far.</li>
            <li> cons are it wears down fairly quick.</li>
            <li> They were both lower back teeth, not sure if that&#x27;s relevant, one real, one porcelain</li>
            <li> companies would not mess with products that work and people love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works good, but seems a little small.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks my back teeth on my right side are almost completely flat and they squeak every time I chew.</li>
            <li> I can tell in the morning I have been biting on it; the upper back teeth feel funny as a result.  </li>
            <li> Kind of awkward feeling at first,</li>
            <li> Initially, I was pleased that it was so small and flexible.  </li>
            <li> The first night I wore it I dreamt, multiple times, that I was eating food - only to find myself waking up and chewing on the mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many mouth guards in the past, and they always last about a month before they delaminate.  </li>
            <li> I used to have an older version of a bite guard from DenTek that looks similar to a guard people that play sports use.</li>
            <li> After having two of my older crowns--along with the roots--extracted, my dentist suggested that I was likely a night-time tooth-grinder/jaw clencher, and that&#x27;s why my teeth were crumbling.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the older version that only sits on bottom row.</li>
            <li> I usually wake up 4 or 5 times a night and when I wore the DenTek guard, I slept better and only awoke twice.  </li>
            <li> only thing I&#x27;ve found that is really a downfall of the product is that while yes, you can adjust them (each side has little nobs that you can pull/push to get it to fit your mouth) during the night, my mouth likes to readjust them apparently to a larger size.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but after several trie with this guard, I gave up.</li>
            <li> Although the former units were made of less comfortable plastic</li>
            <li> I went thru a custom fit guard that was supposed to last a year in less than 5 months).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping in it yet, but my initial reaction is that it is less comfortable than it was.  </li>
            <li> design is not very good and the plastic is kind of rough on your gums.</li>
            <li> Not too bad and still by far the most comfortable nightguards I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> even something so small and comfortable can begin to irritate.</li>
            <li> Its comfortable and small.</li>
            <li> I looked at $300 custom bite guards, but thought that was way too expensive, and was very satisfied when I found this</li>
            <li> Dental guard is small and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It cuts into the side of my gum and I really hope it is not causing long term gum damage.</li>
            <li> It is light and small.</li>
            <li> I really like using these dental guards but the sides around the bit are too long and they push on my gums.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to learn - when i switched dentists a couple of years ago - that I have apparently been grinding my teeth for years.  </li>
            <li> There is 2 in a pack but one of mine are already gone because I wasn&#x27;t careful when wearing it when I first started</li>
            <li> I took the guard to the dentist and he confirmed that this particular one is no good.  </li>
            <li> :  I slept with the new version last night.  </li>
            <li> The new design has an upper flange that cuts into my gums.</li>
            <li> I do think with the amount that I grind my teeth, I will probably go through both guards in less than a year, but its still completely worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not so good: I have a small mouth and small teeth.</li>
            <li> Nothing major.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve now been on my third of fourth pair and there is one glaring consistent issue that holds the product back...</li>
            <li> I honestly barely knew it was there; I am hooked!</li>
            <li> This is the major con for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bruxism or teeth grinding has never been a major issue.  </li>
            <li> Unless the company brings back the old version then they have lost my business forever!</li>
            <li> I bought this locally at Target and was very content for the first few nights.</li>
            <li> First of all, no hot water.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend was using the other one and he chewed through it the first night.</li>
            <li> but I pull the little plastic front piece back and forth to clean it under running water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one shown is just the right shape for people like me who are not large in stature and have smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> After trying one my dentist made, several different guards from various stores and brands, I finally found the right one.</li>
            <li> wear it on my upper teeth, where it is very secure, as opposed to the lower, where it can rub against the gum.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these again if needed, because I alternate them with a custom made, hard acrylic night guard,&lt;br /&gt;They are approved by my dentist, who said there is no difference in what they accomplish...</li>
            <li> Very comfortable in that you hardly notice it when you are using it, especially if it is adjusted properly.  </li>
            <li> It is not bulky and doesn&#x27;t affect the other teeth such as some others do when it is a full mouth guard and not just for back teeth.</li>
            <li> The main problem I had with the mouth guard was that because it only touches the back two or three teeth, a lot of pressure is put on those teeth.  </li>
            <li> On top OF that all of my teeth are sensitive to cold beverages and certain sweets.  </li>
            <li> I really, really want this to win - the $500 &amp;#34;hockey puck&amp;#34; the dentists pushed on my was very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Great idea to have it adjust to size, too bad it doesn&#x27;t stay the size you set</li>
            <li> The boil and fit types worked well but were not nice to my veneers!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ended up doing that myself and its really the only long term solution.</li>
            <li> These work really well, but they do not last as long as suggested on the packaging.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning, my molars feel sensitive because of the constant pressure.  </li>
            <li> I clench my teeth (day and night) and it was starting to affect my TMJ with loud clicking and pain.</li>
            <li> The customer pic above shows what the old design looked like.  </li>
            <li> Well, I sent it back and ordered my old standby.</li>
            <li> barely know it&#x27;s in my mouth and</li>
            <li> No boil convenience, barely notice there is something in my mouth with these.  </li>
            <li> As a dental professional, I make a point to try different products to recommend to my patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As expected this didn&#x27;t work out very well</li>
            <li> my entire adult life</li>
            <li> It is definitely the sleekest I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
            <li> My jaw will no longer sit back as far as it used to</li>
            <li> the old version of this product was the only mouth guard I could use without gagging.  </li>
            <li> This mouthguard is relatively discreet and the connecting mouthpiece under the bottom jaw is completely unobtrusive.  </li>
            <li> I hope they go back to the old design.</li>
            <li> you can barely  tell it is in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The packaging has changed, but the guards have been pretty much the same the past 2-3 years</li>
            <li> I lost my old mouth guard and these were the only ones wal mart had.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed that when they get really thin, I begin to chew on them more at night, which reminds me to replace it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed that when they get really thin, I begin to chew on them more at night, which reminds me to replace it.</li>
            <li> Kind of uncomfortable when I realize I&#x27;m doing it.  </li>
            <li> I could not sleep with the full mouth devices I&#x27;ve purchased in the past</li>
            <li> so rather than having the thin piece that goes around your front teeth on the bottom, you have it going around them on top.  </li>
            <li> And the thin strip in the front is so much more comfortable than thick plastic.  </li>
            <li> I am not stating there is a direct correlation, but think that a full guard would have at least dissipated the pressure and not localized it.</li>
            <li> The guards are small enough that they don&#x27;t fill up your whole mouth and set your jaw out of alignment, but just cushy enough--in all the right places--to cushion the brutal force of my grinding jaw.  </li>
            <li> I am new to having any type of dental guard, so all would be strange.  </li>
            <li> and I am planning on buying a new night guard that will not cause me long term problems.</li>
            <li> Right because the bite pads are stronger; they hold up to my heavy grinding.</li>
            <li> Does not fit the mouth right and didn&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> like I usually do during my sleep, but with the guard there, I could feel that my teeth were safe from grinding with each other.</li>
            <li> There was some slight irritation at first on your gums near your molars if you bite down really hard, but it has gotten better.</li>
            <li> This combination pack also makes them very inexpensive when compared to other models and the custom-made ones you can purchase through your dentist.  </li>
            <li> So much so that my front teeth were getting sharp.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this very brand due to the wear on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Also, this guard does not gag you as much of the other guards do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The low profile is nice, but the small bite pad means that all the pressure of your jaw is carried by a few teeth.</li>
            <li> first night, I slept nearly the entire night with the guard in, and only did I briefly wake in the early morning to remove it from my mouth, as after a few hours</li>
            <li> this was not easy or feel right.</li>
            <li> did modify my new design guard by cutting off the top wings with scissors and now it&#x27;s like the old design.  </li>
            <li> Listen, I&#x27;m old enough to remember a day when mouth guards were only used by boxers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not fit securely enough to prevent grinding between upper/lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I then went to the opposite end of the spectrum and bought the cheaper \\&quot;boil to fit\\&quot; model where you bite into that nasty goo and hope that you can form a decent fit on your own.</li>
            <li> I have heard it recommended and find it true after experimenting, to adjust it as small as you can to avoid any potential gagging problems.</li>
            <li> But since I grind my teeth too much and did not have a backup piece, I had to use a lighter to soften the pads and gently rub the sharp edges down.</li>
            <li> I used this mouthguard exactly as described for 6-8 months and it put slight pressure on two of my back gums (adjacent teeth).  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that they don&#x27;t go back far enough.</li>
            <li> the packs I have received, so far, the \\&quot;pad\\&quot; part is blue, not white, as currently seen in the official product photo.</li>
            <li> first few nights, I could feel a difference when I woke up.</li>
            <li> The design seems good in theory but is uncomfortable to wear and fits oddly due to the strap on the front.</li>
            <li> stand by my 3/5 star rating on the old product, however I would rate this new model 5/5 as it has solved my previous issues.</li>
            <li> It seems like the shock absorbing part you bite down on, got worn out within a week which causes it to sit lower on gums once it&#x27;s been &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This dental guard fits very well, doesn&#x27;t have sharp edges to hurt your gums, and there are two in the package!</li>
            <li> The first night was a lot of adjusting and a little extra saliva while I was getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> Every other night guard does... even their older model came with it.  </li>
            <li> my jaw and neck are a lot less stressed thanks to this.</li>
            <li> Each morning when I woke up, I noticed that my bite was different for the first few minutes after taking it out.</li>
            <li> I also tried the tray with moldable impressions that were uncomfortable and super large.  </li>
            <li> The back of a couple of molars are almost level with my gums because they are worn down so much</li>
            <li> This one seemed easy to wear and I didn&#x27;t sound too stupid when I talked with it in my mouth, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really light weight, does not fit tight again my teeth even when you try to adjust it.</li>
            <li> I have an overly large tongue which relaxes during REM sleep and blocks my narrow airway.</li>
            <li> Product was as described, howevert he blue parts were not flat, like they looked in the picture, but cupped around the teeth.</li>
            <li> The wire in middle is funny and harder to swallow than other types.</li>
            <li> If the thin little piece that goes under your front gums was more stiff instead of super flimsy- this product actually might work.</li>
            <li> I bought some large bulky- boil type night guard last year and it was a waste.</li>
            <li> While trimming the guard down some did improve my particular problem, it wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> Good company, too bad the product is not up to the job.</li>
            <li> There are good things and bad things about this mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> tmj is caused by clenching and stress problems, so this helps keep my jaw in the right place and from clenching too hard together while I recuperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less bulky, than the \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; guards, takes very little time to get used to, doesn&#x27;t need boiling water to fit the guard to your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It takes less than a week to get back to normal, where before it would take two or more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anything, the other ones I&#x27;ve tried sloshed around my mouth more because the \\&quot;wings\\&quot; were irritating my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Other DenTek products that you boil were not good enough for me, they worn out very quick.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouthpiece that I have found that does not have the heavy plastic near your front teeth, where you generally don&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li> If you place the guard on a flat service, the pad area (blue) looked like an L on</li>
            <li> How nice to be wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I feel like the price is a little too high.</li>
            <li> the price seems a little high for what you get.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have a small mouth and thought because some reviews said it was better for small mouths but they seem to be loose and I have the fear that I will swallow it in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> was used to a smaller night guard (much more expensive but much smaller) and thought I&#x27;d try these instead due to their low cost, but just too big and would keep me waking up night after night which finally caught up and had me giving up on them.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dentek dental guards for a few years and much preferred to old style that was made with less plastic.  </li>
            <li> No More Plackers, which are softer, last longer and are much cheaper</li>
            <li> I tried wearing the first order and it is VERY bulky and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do but doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough to justify the price.</li>
            <li> The issues I have are the front piece comes down so far it rubs my gums under my front bottom teeth and the side pieces have ridges that rub my gums in the back.</li>
            <li> I have pretty terrible bruxism evident by headaches in the morning, sore jaw, worn teeth and my g/f waking me up in the middle of the night because the sound of my grinding teeth woke her up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to others who are having trouble getting the \\&quot;custom</li>
            <li> There is only a very thin, but strong strip of plastic that holds the two back pieces together.  </li>
            <li> I really like the small connector in the front</li>
            <li> The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced Comfort Dental Protector for Teeth Grinding, 1 pack]] were not only extremely uncomfortable (to the point where I would get blisters on my gums, and often spit the guard out in my sleep and would wake up to find it on the pillow next to me.)</li>
            <li> AND the price has remained at least 10 dollars higher than the Walmart pricing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one is finally so worn out I need to replace it-believe me,that is a long time of wear for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE(3/2013)</li>
            <li> but that also means it doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> long enough that they&#x27;ve change what you get in the package twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I inspected the other mouthguard that had been contained in the two-pack, trying to determine exactly how much trouble</li>
            <li> /&gt;Husband and I inspected the other mouthguard that had been contained in the two-pack, trying to determine exactly how much trouble</li>
            <li> You wear them on your bottom teeth, and as you sleep they  naturally stay down, they don&#x27;t slip out or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little more than a month and hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> I have trouble falling asleep at night, and my doctor tried both a hard plastic custom fit guard for me (that I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep in) and</li>
            <li> They last a very long time, they&#x27;re adjustable, and two to a package.  </li>
            <li> Grinding was making my teeth very flat and jagged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a terrible grinding problem and after reading some of the reviews I decided to order this because I believed it would be more comfortable to have the guard on the bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> The pads are slightly thicker than the old design but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i don&#x27;t have severe TMJ, i have small teeth and a small mouth, and i find these quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> I gave up and had my dentist fit me for one of the lesser expensive moldable guards.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I needed to replace them &amp; Amazon only has them available if you are a &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; member.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of nearly $30.  </li>
            <li> My dentist strongly recommended a night guard, but suggested that I try an &#x27;over the counter&#x27; before investing in a custom made one, which would be quite expensive and not covered under my dental policy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Interestingly enough this cures every single problem listed</li>
            <li> so they felt loose in the morning or left sore gouges in my cheeks and/or gums.</li>
            <li> Even though they seemed more expensive than other devices shuch as the Plackers Grind</li>
            <li> The other one is similar to the DenTek guard, but much larger.  </li>
            <li> The other day I slept at a friends house and forgot the guard and was in excruciating pain the next week until I could get back to the chiropractor.</li>
            <li> And I highly recommend it espacially for people with small mouth.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands in the past, and all of them left me drooling, unable to breath through my mouth, chewing my cheeks to bits, or nearly choking to death in my sleep.</li>
            <li> I did have a little bit of a sore jaw the first few nights after using it, but I am now used to it.  </li>
            <li> It seems that this design ensures that pressure is put on the very back teeth, while the boil ones end up having pressure being put a little further up on the mid teeth.</li>
            <li> Totally useless, doesn&#x27;t fit in any way</li>
            <li> This is comfortable and works as well as the expensive dentist&#x27;s fitted mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bulky and, after a brief period of adjusting to it, it&#x27;s not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Now I can actually sleep with my mouth closed.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> After a few days, my cheeks were completely roughed up</li>
            <li> With my minor altercations of the roduct it has been working well.</li>
            <li> The sides that have a slip adjustment constantly came out of place and the guard its self kept slipping around in my mouth.</li>
            <li> they have been around for a long time for a reason-</li>
            <li> My husband said I was grinding my teeth ALL night long.  </li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to buy it.  </li>
            <li> This did not work for me as the smallest setting was too long for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I have suffered from headaches of unknown origin.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> however mine almost always end up stretched all the way out</li>
            <li> So far, I keep the lid off, but before we travel, I&#x27;ll have my guy drill a few holes in the side, to help with air circulation when I do cap</li>
            <li> and they hold up as long as the DenTek did.  </li>
            <li> The first few nights I wore it as directed on the package, with the narrow strip on my bottom teeth</li>
            <li> The bumps go away within a half hour of removing the guard, and now, several weeks later, they are much flatter and hardly noticeable when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d knock this item down to 3.5 stars if I could, but don&#x27;t wantto give it a 3 since its served me well enough in the last 3 pairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am prevented from clenching down which forces my tongue to the back of my mouth, making it likely it will relax and block my throat.</li>
            <li> when I use it upside down, I barely notice that they are there.</li>
            <li> It is a little loose; when I yawn it nearly comes out, but it doesn&#x27;t, so no problem.</li>
            <li> and* that I wasn&#x27;t presenting with new cavities due to the dry nighttime environment that my previous night guard had been causing.</li>
            <li> still don&#x27;t end up using it every day but for the most part it stays in my mouth all night and is much less uncomfortable than the heat and bite versions.</li>
            <li> The back part rubs on my gums, causing them to be slightly swollen the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve woken up with the guard half out of my mouth, on my pillow, and last night I must have pulled it out in the middle of the night</li>
            <li> so I chew through them quickly, too big or wrong shape</li>
            <li> If you had asked me at any point before the past 6 months or so, I would have given it 4 stars, but based on new information/experience, I would give it 1 star or even no stars, so I am giving it a 2 overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little time the next day for my bite to readjust, but I have to be careful until then because teeth hit each other where they usually do not meet.  </li>
            <li> The DenTek may be worth 5 stars, it&#x27;s hard for me to know with so little to compare it to.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small enough so as to not cause a problem while sleeping, but big enough to cover the grinding area.  </li>
            <li> This guard is so thin I can talk almost normally with it in, doesn&#x27;t keep my mouth from closing, and still feels solid enough to keep my grinding at bay.</li>
            <li> Due to recent pain and stress, I started clenching my teeth at night.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried other brands before and they were too big and bulky and made me gag.</li>
            <li> The other grind guards I have worn only added to the discomfort of the retainer by adding pressure.</li>
            <li> so much smaller than the other guards that I&#x27;ve used and allows for movement of the jaws.  </li>
            <li> It leaves sharp edges along the blue pads, which in turn leaves cuts and marks on my gums.</li>
            <li> I finally tied a string around the front and used a safety pin to attach the other end to my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus the blue &#x27;grind&#x27; pads are extremely cheapy-</li>
            <li> All the other mouth guards I have looked at or used were too big.</li>
            <li> though they seem slim/small, they still were too big and seemed to get in the way and would wake me due to their size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ( I had read other reviews of people experiencing the same problem).  </li>
            <li> I can also wear them flipped the other direction (over the upper teeth)</li>
            <li> They used to have only one flap and nothing would point toward the other gums.  </li>
            <li> I tried several other products that are intended to be dental &amp;#34;night guards&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t that big of a problem, because it&#x27;s really hard to completely chew through it, and it will still work even after taking some damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You end up waking up in the morning with a dry mouth feeling like you&#x27;ve had a stuffy nose all night because the guard keeps your mouth</li>
            <li> and my mouth will be dry when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> breathe all night and have problems because of how dry my mouth was.  </li>
            <li> The main negative thing I notice now..</li>
            <li> I tried a few different &amp;#34;boil and bite&amp;#34; night guards, but they were bulky and ultimately ended up rubbing my gums or tongue and causing pain.</li>
            <li> The only problem is I have trouble keeping them in the entire night.  </li>
            <li> The guard padding left my jaw at an angle that hurt after just a few minutes, and I did try adjusting it to different positions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a few days, I find myself back on Amazon to go back to the &amp;#34;The</li>
            <li> It came down to the bite pads just being too thick and the harsh abrasive material used on certain parts (mainly the pivots for the bite pads) - and I&#x27;ve tried all the sizes available in my desperate attempt to find something that didn&#x27;t feel like a hockey puck in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they seem to be pretty tough.</li>
            <li> (1 single guard will go for $40 at CVS)</li>
            <li> It was a little bigger and harder than the former Den Tex nighttime guard that I used to have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to cope with the other ones by moving the bite pads to the forward-most position so my jaw doesn&#x27;t have to open up as wide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to cope with the other ones by moving the bite pads to the forward-most position so my jaw doesn&#x27;t have to open up as wide.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have no idea how people usually grind their teeth in their sleep, so this might not matter, but if you grind your teeth completely horizontally from side to side, there are areas where this will not protect your teeth, whereas the ones you boil will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and soft and adjustable.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off of the reviews, but for me it was poorly fitting and very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have tried the full guards and they were really uncomfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> my grinding and clenching is bad enough that this thing looked old right away.  </li>
            <li> The first night I wore it, I woke up a few times through the night because of biting hard on it.  </li>
            <li> I have moved on to trying new products and hope to find one that works and lasts at least 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> So, I tried the Dentek thinking it is smaller and less bulky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now shopping around for a full-mouth mouthguard in hopes that it will put less pressure on my back teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the boil grind guard, it simply feels less...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care that I had to buy a box every month and a half (not saying that the guard doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for heavy grinders, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would last long for those who do that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt necessarily, but it&#x27;s pretty weird to feel the pieces of skin that were sucked through on my cheeks in the morning</li>
            <li> and it is small enough that I actually keep it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I did not notice it was subtlety changing my bite ever so slightly so that one of my upper molars were getting impacted by the tooth below.  </li>
            <li> Only used the thing for less than one month..</li>
            <li> Also, the crevasses are difficult to clean sometimes, so I do not recommend using the toothpaste cleaning method - use the other one.</li>
            <li> The material is a very flexible plastic, if you were to pick it up by the narrow center band you would find the guard drooping lazily between your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The connecting clear piece comes down too far over the front teeth allowing it to hit/push against the gums which causes unnecessary irritation.</li>
            <li> so sometimes I have to push it back tight...</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t sit tightly like a custom nightguard, I think that I subconsciously clench my jaw to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I noticed over the last few years that the specific molar getting worn with very sharp edges over time, but didn&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that works for me, other full-bodied mouthguards I bite into like hell and actually end up making my teeth crooked (seriously).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become so used to wearing it that I can&#x27;t sleep without it, sometimes I will forget &amp; go to bed without it, but I keep feeling likes something wrong until I realize it&#x27;s not in my mouth.ar one in the first place though!</li>
            <li> I needed to get a guard as I was really starting to tear up my cheeks to the point where I was taking out little chunks.</li>
            <li> I returned it to get my money back, but I am not being reimbursed for my doctor visits or the pain it caused me, which I&#x27;m a little</li>
            <li> I do like the smaller size of this, as it does not make you feel like gagging, but I woke up this morning and my teeth had been moved a little and my bite was off.</li>
            <li> A recent design change created bite pads that are a little thicker &amp; made of a stronger plastic.  </li>
            <li> They are a little too big</li>
            <li> I used it because my lower gums were a little red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> The plastic bite area dropps a little to low for me,  makes me gag.</li>
            <li> But it only hurts a little when I wake up and then goes away so maybe is just rubbing it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed to work well, although my mouth was a little sore the next couple of days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that kinda because it causes my mouth to open a little as the front part is so thick, and I personally cannot stand when my mouth is open while I sleep - causes snoring noises and dry mouth!</li>
            <li> My 8 yr old son grinds teeth so hard at night.</li>
            <li> Her&#x27;s is soft rubber-like feel and mine is hard plastic-like feel.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only grabbed by the back teeth, so it&#x27;s hardly noticeable when it&#x27;s in-</li>
            <li> BEWARE of long term effects!!!</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably and does not cause any awkward jaw movements.</li>
            <li> It makes removing the guard more painful than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable on my gums and my left gum would actually be very tender in the morning after I used it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the slim piece of plastic that wraps around the front of your bottom teeth sits a bit too low on me, and rubs at the spot where my gums become the inside of my lip.</li>
            <li> I always ended up spitting out the bigger mouth guards while I was sleeping, which made them completely useless, but this one is very unobtrusive.  </li>
            <li> minus a couple of stars for their problems adjusting and lack of staying power.</li>
            <li> When this happened, my teeth crushed the guard and permanently deformed it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was the second night that was the trouble.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the softness that makes them so un-annoying also means that a vigorous tooth grinder (like me) can grind through one of these in a few months.  </li>
            <li> As we age we do NOT need to add items to the bedtime ritual that make sleep even harder to come by.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no much else to say&lt;</li>
            <li> I almost spent $350.00 on a mouth guard from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have no issues drinking water or talking, and I can still keep my mouth closed when I sleep.</li>
            <li> I have no fear of it slipping or swallowing it.  </li>
            <li> And I really like how thin the front plastic is as well as the bite</li>
            <li> Flimsy..poorly made and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The guard fits well initially and is adjustable, but I had trouble with it staying put while sleeping.</li>
            <li> Tried to alter with scissors and edge became rough.</li>
            <li> so it is causing my teeth to grind harder during my sleep; consequently it is causing discomfort at the root level of my molars.</li>
            <li> I have spent years, literally, trying bite guards.</li>
            <li> I squeeze 9 months out of two of them but by the end they are in rough shape.</li>
            <li> SleepRight lasts for roughly about a year.</li>
            <li> They sent me a check for what I paid minus shipping costs.</li>
            <li> It seems rough and makes my gums sore.  </li>
            <li> My headaches went away after only a few nights of use.</li>
            <li> I could close my mouth with this guard with minimal effort (though it still took effort/muscle contraction</li>
            <li> can not live without these!!</li>
            <li> Half the price of the same product, down to the correct UPC code.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d rather replace this one every few months than try and sleep with those other medieval torture devices!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5: On my 4th pair, due to the adjustment strap not holding its place, I chewed through one of the bite pads in 3 days (bite pad would not stay in place due to loose adjustment).</li>
            <li> I had a super expensive rigid mold from dentist that was too hard and not a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li> Within a few weeks my tooth began to become sensitive to hot and cold temperatures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and withstands hard bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I ranked it down to 4 stars because upon further usage.. I notice a little discomfort on the bottom of my lower gums.  </li>
            <li> therefore, not very useful.  </li>
            <li> Each pack comes with two, and I find them long lasting (Have been using one for at least three months now.).</li>
            <li> This is such a thin profile that it feels &#x27;barely there&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It makes my bite feel a little strange in the morning when I take it out</li>
            <li> If your TMJ is forced to bite down on something too wide, it WILL GRIND down to find that natural \\&quot;resting\\&quot; spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, it took a few nights of tossing and turning to get used to, but I think that&#x27;s typical of mouth guards overall and not this one in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I have gotten used to having a \\&quot;foreign object\\&quot; in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This as a comparison to other guards.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t attempt to sleep in it due to</li>
            <li> I would probably give it a 4/5 due to price and durability.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bite pads seem sturdier than other ones I have used</li>
            <li> (ie the front portion of teeth that do not make contact could start to move toward each other).</li>
            <li> For me with my small mouth, this is the only device that seems to stay place.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I knew I had to do something to protect my teeth.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers -</li>
            <li> due to bone growth).</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever tried something like this, so I will use it as a learning experience and probably, unfortunately will have to have one custom made.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get my money back, don&#x27;t waste yours on this one!</li>
            <li> It puts all the pressure on one molar on other either side of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable at first, but after sleeping all night with it your tongue hurts in the morning.</li>
            <li> But just as some people have said in their reviews, I had my boyfriend try on the other piece</li>
            <li> and my dentist said it was due to grinding my teeth at night</li>
            <li> (I have bit through other ones) and not wear them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the boil mouth guards in the past</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than the other mouth guards I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m an extreme sleep grinder/gnasher).</li>
            <li> Of course, the dogs are  not interested in these inexpensive ones.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cushion for your teeth due to grinding do not buy these.</li>
            <li> It reduces my instinct to bite because there is something in my mouth which was a problem with other, bulkier guards.  </li>
            <li> I bought it after I had to get a crown put in on a rear molar due to clenching my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> No problems with rubbing my gums or anything that I&#x27;ve had with other choices.</li>
            <li> I do think other than that fear it stops the grinding because my pain seemed to lessen</li>
            <li> I intend to keep using other DenTek gear if Amazon keeps selling this product at a price that is lower than SleepRight\\&quot;s.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this because I have not worn other mouth guards before.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job of preventing my teeth from grinding on each other while I sleep</li>
            <li> I am not a grinder though, I clench and push my teeth against each other.</li>
            <li> (mainly due to comfort)</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s in, I can usually get through a big chunk of the night with it still in my mouth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small enough that it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like a hockey player.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I find it extremely</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, I have not noticed any sores, scrapes, or areas of discomfort on either my my cheeks or gums, as other users have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> For some reason I&#x27;ve ordered this twice and both times have received something other than what is in the photo.  </li>
            <li> It works to prevent grinding, but not comfortably, nor does it feel like it&#x27;d do the trick for long.</li>
            <li> Small mouth folks beware, eventhough its adjustable, it still may be too big for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It might just be the specific one I&#x27;m using (the second pair I have in the package seems to not have this problem), but at the very least.. it hasn&#x27;t been that big of a problem for me - but I can see it maybe being a problem for someone with a small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That might not seem like a big change, but it was really tough to sleep just knowing something different was in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading some horror stories on this product&#x27;s review here, I was skeptical about the product but thought I&#x27;d give it a try as this is a much better deal than what my rip-off dentist quoted me for a mouth guard ($1,250).</li>
            <li> The thin strip connecting the pieces, is durable enough to maintain stability and hold, while at the same time being discreet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just 2 small rubber like pads in the back (and I sleep with it upside down</li>
            <li> So far, she uses them every night without complaint!</li>
            <li> warnings include not to use if you have missing teeth, TMJ, loose fillings, caps, receding gums, periodontal disease, etc, etc. . . .</li>
            <li> Instead, the two thin plastic wings just rest above your back teeth and keep you from biting all the way down.</li>
            <li> My other half</li>
            <li> I have had 3 hard night guards from my dentist and have worn my last one out.</li>
            <li> first it was a little weird to have something in my mouth while trying to sleep.  </li>
            <li> (I guess I bite down on it hard enough to keep it in place all night.)  </li>
            <li> Two weeks ago the same molar chipped when i bit down on something hard.  </li>
            <li> It also made eating breakfast really hard because once I bite down on my food, my upper molars would hurt.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth pretty badly, though, so others&#x27; may last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only wish they had at least 2 sizes.</li>
            <li> The pads are thinner, which is the only negative about this guard, but it does not cause any problems in the positioning of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If this continues much longer I&#x27;m going to have to go to the doctor and see what happened because it is really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> So it should last you a for at least 12 months.</li>
            <li> I am now in my late twenties and recently, I noticed that the wear on my teeth was noticeable.</li>
            <li> so they should last at least the 6 months stated.</li>
            <li> Just too small and not secure enough to stay in place and not be chewed on.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that I have not yet managed talking w/</li>
            <li> Secondly the upper flaps can be irritating and since the guard doesn&#x27;t set on your teeth there are a few nights the guard popped out</li>
            <li> The the blue parts were too thick at the sides and rubbed my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are not comfortable and the flap pushes into my gums when my mouth is closed.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I talked to my dentist about this guard, and while I know it is in his interest to sell his products, he recommended against this type of guard saying that biting down on a back pad system like this could, slowly over time, affect the alignment of your bite</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a whole lot less expensive than than a dentist create a night guard.</li>
            <li> do not wear mine down, even after months.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth when, considering these are not wearing down, it appears I do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be in by gulping it down my hatch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be in by gulping it down my hatch.</li>
            <li> I felt I was clenching down at times</li>
            <li> Maybe because I clamped down on them all night with my grinding, though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another person that reviewed them here suggested you put them on upside down -</li>
            <li> , so, I turned it upside down</li>
            <li> , I also clench and grind  my teeth and have worn them down</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t wear my down</li>
            <li> It is basically the position your mouth is in 95% of the day- relaxed, slightly open (teeth not touching!).</li>
            <li> My jaw is sometimes a little sore in the morning due to clenching, but I know my teeth are protected.</li>
            <li> Will get another set soon for work , car, and other locations since I grind even when I am awake!</li>
            <li> Wore it for a week, the hard plastic is not giving enough, my bite muscles were sore and tight.</li>
            <li> Did not fit - adjustable but not really!</li>
            <li> It is very small and tolerable for the entire night.</li>
            <li> Anyone who tries this &amp; says it&#x27;s not comfortable, give it a week or so before you give up - I think anything you put in your mouth at night is going to be uncomfortable until you get used to it, it just isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li> Anyone who tries this &amp; says it&#x27;s not comfortable, give it a week or so before you give up - I think anything you put in your mouth at night is going to be uncomfortable until you get used to it, it just isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li> and they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t stop you from grinding/clenching so if the problem gets bad enough, you might have to give in and get a real one from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I feel it as soon as I put the guard in at night, like the soreness can never quite fully heal from the previous night.</li>
            <li> There are 5 settings and you just tug slightly to move through them.</li>
            <li> Here I got 2 for less than half</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t stand to keep this in my mouth, much less overnight.  </li>
            <li> They are so expenisve &amp; I was wearing them out at the rate of 1 in less than 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I said, I was wearing the others out in less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> DenTek Custom Comfort Nightguard is the worst - It did not last more than a week to have my son grind through each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered some serious issues with grinding my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s low profile enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like its suffocating me during the night.</li>
            <li> well although I did have some slight pinching along my gums.</li>
            <li> Seems to put less pressure on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I chose this guard because it was less cumbersome in my mouth than others seemed to be.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I found some relief from jaw pain with this guard.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a less bulky option....</li>
            <li> She says that it relieves her jaw pain and has less head aches now.</li>
            <li> a slightly dryer mouth&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> (sorry, gross I know) or are just too bulky for my mouth especially when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> The wave part in the front is still somewhat hidden, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic piece that you bite into is durable, though I do have a slight problem with the front part of the guard rubbing a part of my gums just a bit.  </li>
            <li> the previous dental guards I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Previously, I had never lost a filling.</li>
            <li> The pads are rigid and not fun to bite down on (think plastic spoon) and the strap across the front is also firm and would bump into my gums and scratch.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble getting accustomed to a foreign object in my mouth but after a couple days, it posed little interference with me falling asleep.</li>
            <li> Other guards were anywhere from bulky to down right painful.</li>
            <li> The idea is not bad, but after just one hour of having them on, it rubbed and bloodied my lower gums in a bad way...</li>
            <li> In trying to make the edge thin they left it sharp and too tall.  </li>
            <li> Some of the reviews mentioned the risk of swallowing it or spitting it out while you sleep - I don&#x27;t have either of these problems since my teeth are so tightly clenched when I sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You must close your mouth tightly to keep in in place.  </li>
            <li> He says because it repositions your jaw that you can&#x27;t clench your jaw as tightly and headaches should diminish.  </li>
            <li> It was ever so slightly tight on my front teeth</li>
            <li> I never had my fitted mouth guard fall out of my mouth and never accidentally chewed it because it was fitted tightly.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m skeptical about trying a new one and can&#x27;t imagine paying for a custom one at my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I only have one complaint: if you look at the zoomed picture, there are small slits on the side of the guard and when I sleep, in addition to clenching, I suck in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little disconcerting...</li>
            <li> This one took a little getting used to, because it doesn&#x27;t conform to your teeth like the boil and bite guards, but after a night or two wearing it, it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE TIP</li>
            <li> Sometimes it even takes me a little while in the morning to remember that I have it in.  </li>
            <li> It was a little pricey -</li>
            <li> It also had these little nobs that just irritated my gums.</li>
            <li> I sometimes used to wake myself up due to excessive grinding.</li>
            <li> but this little guy is holding up</li>
            <li> I have gotten little blisters from it.</li>
            <li> The bitewings do rub against the side of my mouth and from time to time will cause a little soreness.  </li>
            <li> It goes away after a little while, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> and he says that I have no more tooth damage due to grinding.  </li>
            <li> These tend to irritate a little bit</li>
            <li> I have been grinding my teeth since I&#x27;ve been little.</li>
            <li> Little bumps on the strip help it snap it in place and keep the two wings the desired distance apart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a little over a month now and they are showing no wear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite small and not cumbersome at all, and it doesn&#x27;t rub against my gums like other mouth guards</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ever change this product, unless it is to make the bite part a little softer.</li>
            <li> I bought these a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> and it puts a little bit of unnatural pressure on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> this is a little bulky - rubbed my gums</li>
            <li> I am now trying it out a little in the day to see if I will help remind me (and therefore, train me) to stop clenching.</li>
            <li> , I discovered these little, horizontal \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; (like a road speed bump) along the inside of my cheeks when I woke up.</li>
            <li> just adjust the little notches</li>
            <li> If you really grind your teeth, this material is too thin and weak, get something stronger.</li>
            <li> They are tough without the extra bulk.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other type!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chipped my back teeth and had to have them fixed because I grind my teeth so bad and clench my jaws when I sleep.</li>
            <li> The husband told me last night he&#x27;s not heard the awful grinding sound ever since I started using this.</li>
            <li> No, not really were uncomfortable to wear, kept me awake and finally just chucked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the night guard has trouble staying at the adjusted size.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve tried a few of the  over the counter mouthguards...</li>
            <li> my the inside of my cheek which goes away after I&#x27;ve been up for a few,  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any trouble with it sliding around in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These would not secure to my teeth at all, and wouldn&#x27;t even stay in while I was awake when trying them out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a heavy clencher during sleep.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the pain was only on one side of my jaw and the pain got much worse over the course of the week.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and look for another mouthguard.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, waste of money for me and it came as a 2 pack</li>
            <li> I can close my mouth, not drool like a creepy old man, and not choke to death on a device that is supposed to be helping me.  </li>
            <li> Night after night will that cause just as much trouble as grinding, which in my case is causing sensitivity according to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I ordered these (there are two in package) with the thought that they would not work or I would destroy them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of these and this worked for a few days,  then loosened up with use and kept coming out.  </li>
            <li> Purchased a 2 pack a few months ago for my wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few types of dental guards, but couldn&#x27;t tolerate sleeping with them.</li>
            <li> My problem is, I&#x27;m a heavy grinder</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic is fairly firm.</li>
            <li> She disliked it and I was out over $100.</li>
            <li> She gave up on it and that was a few years ago.</li>
            <li> or he was going to need his teeth capped in a few years from the damage his teeth grinding at night caused.</li>
            <li> I found it did NOT fit my mouth</li>
            <li> and I bought one of these and used it for a few years</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;e had been clacking his teeth at night (waking me), so I had bought him a few night guards, including this one.</li>
            <li> A few times per week, I also brush the guard with my toothbrush (oral-b, powered) &amp; toothpaste (uncle harry&#x27;s glycerin-free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I stopped using the product after a few weeks because it bothered my gum.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that you can get into trouble with OTC</li>
            <li> It is also too thick and forced my mouth to be open all night.  </li>
            <li> I have a serious grinding problem, I lost one tooth because of that, and about to loose the symmetric one.</li>
            <li> My mouth is small so the typical bite and mold dental guards do not fit me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve upgraded my previous 2 stars to 3!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers commented that the pads are too thick.  </li>
            <li> wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not easily seen in the official photo:</li>
            <li> I do have to replace it every few months since I&#x27;m still grinding, but at least my teeth are no longer being ground down.</li>
            <li> I not only have a serious night grinding problem, but genetically weak / thin enamel to boot, so while I was in the market for a night guard, boil-able styles such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and not only are they less expensive than a night guard at the dentist</li>
            <li> People with grinding problems like myself oftentimes bite down hard while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this bite guard if you tend to bite down was hard when you grind at night as I seem to.</li>
            <li> And it hurts pretty badly.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad grinding and these help a lot.  </li>
            <li> which is my only real complaint.</li>
            <li> We did have to make a few small adjustments where it rubbed my gums</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s much thicker and has two walls, very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> If I can make someone else&#x27;s decision easier, at least all my sleepless nights (and money down the chute) will not have gone in vain.  </li>
            <li> My complaint is the plastic breaks down after repeated biting during sleep.</li>
            <li> That being said, this new design has an additional edge on the side and it is cutting the I side of my cheek.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit too thick for my mouth</li>
            <li> The gums started to recede because if this and I had to have GUM GRAFTING surgery due to this mouthguard!!!</li>
            <li> Too bulky and hard, not comfortable at all, could not even close my mouth upon insertion.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is low-profile, but the really thin string-like thing that wraps around your bottom teeth was a little too irritating to make up for the comfort of the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the least invasive, however it would not stay in place and the parts you &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; down on are like rocks!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sad that they made this change - it&#x27;s been difficult to find a small comfortable mouth guard for bruxism during sleep.</li>
            <li> No more pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have read past reviews with concerns of people fearing they&#x27;ll swallow it...</li>
            <li> maybe my mouth is too small...</li>
            <li> So that being said, I&#x27;m not sure how this would work for someone who grinds a lot --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it would stay in place, since it doesn&#x27;t conform to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used any type of night guard in the past.</li>
            <li> No more hurt gums</li>
            <li> It is meant to be worn with the small loop in front of lower teeth</li>
            <li> I saw that it was in small pieces in my dogs bed.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how</li>
            <li> almost never wake up with it missing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Keep your receipt and the box with proof of purchase and the contact information comes with the product if you are not pleased with the dental guard.  </li>
            <li> No More Dental Night Protector&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Grind No More disposable ones</li>
            <li> My mouth is small and the guards that you &#x27;melt&#x27; in a pot of boiling water and then mold to your mouth are uncomfortable and too big.  </li>
            <li> I have used these in the past.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is small and my teeth are crowded</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it looks like they recently changed the design...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d choke on it since it was small.</li>
            <li> I had never used mouth guards and this one is small and confortable.</li>
            <li> I do have a small mouth and have never worried about swallowing it.</li>
            <li> It does the job, isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all, but you have to find it every morning because it falls out in the middle of the night</li>
            <li> I bought several types that were uncomfortable and I couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Not sure if there are long-term problems or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (they usually go away within an hour or two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried boil and form mouth guards several times and all were so bulky that I was unable to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> However, by the third week, the form of the area where you bite on began warping as my bite is not perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li> This guard is so small you almost forget its there.</li>
            <li> That being said, it usually fell out when I was sleeping, or I would wake up in the middle of the night and take it out because I found it too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable and kept my mouth slightly open.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s too small to throw your jaw alignment off anyway.</li>
            <li> how small it is-</li>
            <li> No More I bought the Den Tek  </li>
            <li> It is so small, yet it stays in place all night.</li>
            <li> have in the past.</li>
            <li> guards I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> Extremly small , wast of money</li>
            <li> My past experience with Dental protection gear is the SleepRight.</li>
            <li> I have small mouth and underbite.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the pair does not last me a year.</li>
            <li> He (along with an ear, nose throat specialist I&#x27;d seen for the headaches) suggested I go to Walmart and get a football mouthguard, but I had used one in the past, and I felt like I couldn&#x27;t breathe,</li>
            <li> &#x27;Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More</li>
            <li> guess my mouth is small and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that is or how it works.</li>
            <li> however I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> Perhaps, I should have ordered a small one.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel it promotes excessive saliva production, \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot;, or drooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I think they could change is the height of the side parts -- my mouth is small and they dig into my gums when I wear them over my botttom teeth (as they are designed).</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple of months, the blue part can be uncomfortable on the gums and the band in front will move around if not placed correctly.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly small mouth</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth (dentist must use children&#x27;s size dental equipment).</li>
            <li> Now, with the addition of the excessive rubber flap, I must return these.  </li>
            <li> At Walmart they now charge you the same for 1! IRRITATING!</li>
            <li> Mouth Guard Grind No More Night Time Use - 1 package (10 count) by Plackers</li>
            <li> I settled on this one because it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> In the past I have bought them and spit them out while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I suppose the concept behind it is to keep the guard from sliding back too far into the mouth, but the effect is exaggerated needlessly.</li>
            <li> But, this version has a thin band that goes around your bottom teeth, and my mouth stays closed!</li>
            <li> They have an older model and I&#x27;ve heard bad things about those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too thin, but thin enough that you don&#x27;t notice you are wearing them. . . .</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and small teeth</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions precisely and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The pads were too hard for me and made my teeth sore.  </li>
            <li> Once it is in you hardly even notice that it is there.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth so hard I broke a molar.</li>
            <li> and I now know just how hard I grind my teeth.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m crunching into a hard piece of plastic when I grind at night.</li>
            <li> I clench really hard and grind once in a while</li>
            <li> I have a hard bite</li>
            <li> I hardly know I have it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I am a HARD grinder.</li>
            <li> I found these dental guards to be too hard.</li>
            <li> The front piece hurt my gums, and the piece that goes between the teeth is too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bulky at all, however the pads are a bit too hard.</li>
            <li> I actually cracked a tooth from grinding but hated wearing those big bulky night guards.</li>
            <li> Halfway through the night, the adjustment band is almost all the way out at least on one side (sometimes both)</li>
            <li> at least let me catch some ZZZs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would have.</li>
            <li> , they made me gag and drool and uncomfortable with my mouth closed.  </li>
            <li> The plastic can actually be twisted and compacted into a space smaller than a quarter, and the guard does not have any metal components or nasty snags, even if you pull the two larger blue plastic pieces off.</li>
            <li> The plastic can actually be twisted and compacted into a space smaller than a quarter, and the guard does not have any metal components or nasty snags, even if you pull the two larger blue plastic pieces off.</li>
            <li> I approached my dentist about getting a replacement and immediately balked at the out of pocket cost of at least $300.</li>
            <li> Over months to years, that is not really effective.</li>
            <li> The adjustible pads do not stay adjusted overnight - at least in my mouth- resulting in cuts in my mouth and a cracked tooth.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that I will accidentally choke on this thing in the middle of the</li>
            <li> I expected DenTek to match or exceed the quality of the generics, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> At least they protect quite well.</li>
            <li> it was quite bulky-about 1/3 inch thick on both sides of my teeth-and made me feel suffocated, even though I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it is too thick.</li>
            <li> If I had to review the product out of the box, I&#x27;d give it a 3  because it fits poorly and is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> The bite plate is too thick, making my TMJ sore.</li>
            <li> so they cause me to gag, uncomfortable with sharp edges or pointy parts that poke my gums.</li>
            <li> This was to small to work, I gnashed my teeth anyway!</li>
            <li> No more headaches or tmj pain!</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth in my sleep due to the uncomfortable retainer I have to wear at night.</li>
            <li> and it is now just like every other mouthguard that I&#x27;ve tried before - uncomfortable and pushing into my gums, causing sores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sexy, but at least it works!</li>
            <li> And hopefully no more chipped teeth!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I will have to go about looking for other solutions to protecting my teeth.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is small!</li>
            <li> , the guard just puts a small layer between your teeth for protection!</li>
            <li> So in the mean time, I figured I would order something just in case</li>
            <li> No more wear and tear on my teeth!</li>
            <li> I say I have a serious problem grinding &amp; clenching my teeth, I really mean it.</li>
            <li> When I was using that other one, the forced myself to use it, but I would always get frustrated, wishing that there could be less material between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small,</li>
            <li> It is a very small unit and one that I feel I will chew into oblivion or swallow.  </li>
            <li> which becomes very uncomfortable if I wake up to pee and try to go back to sleep</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth (dentist uses kid-sized implements on me), and this guard does not feel bulky.</li>
            <li> The front jaw strap is uncomfortable as it will rub up and down on your gum line.</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t even feel it in my mouth when I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li> After getting a ridiculous quote from my dentist for a bite guard, I looked to Amazon in desperation.</li>
            <li> It is slightly adjustable but he was still unable to find any comfort.</li>
            <li> I have a serious grinding problem, I&#x27;ve broke two tooth&#x27;s from grinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this is a serious problem for you, get a custom one from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give this less expensive night guard a try.</li>
            <li> had some weird digestion pains for a couple of days, but other than that I am none worse for wear.</li>
            <li> had some weird digestion pains for a couple of days, but other than that I am none worse for wear.</li>
            <li> A little difficult for placement too.  </li>
            <li> Not a good feeling, and a cause for nervousness for what might happen while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I tried upper and lower positions but the rubbing was too painful.</li>
            <li> She was afraid she would swallow it, but when she tried it, there was absolutely no problem, even when asleep.  </li>
            <li> Not Good.</li>
            <li> It was very small and very hard.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to find in the store, so thank you for carrying it online!</li>
            <li> Also, hard to find in retail stores, buy it NOW!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I find the gentle pressure it applies to my lower front teeth to be surprisingly annoying.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that they are now like everyone else in mouthguard design in adding that 3rd plastic part (T- instead of L-shaped) because this was the smallest guard I could find.</li>
            <li> First off, I hate having to wear a dental guard!  </li>
            <li> Dumb.  </li>
            <li> However, it is made of a harder plastic and can be very uncomfortable on your gums and the insides of your cheeks.</li>
            <li> I still grind my teeth at night, but at least now I&#x27;m not ruining my teeth!  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a mouth guard that works over a retainer without stretching out your cheeks.</li>
            <li> No more waking up to headaches!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was a waste of my money!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chewed through expensive hard plastic night guards provided by my dentist</li>
            <li> Mine (the hard plastic-like feel) is so uncomfortable that I don&#x27;t wear it, even though I had to fork over a couple hundred bucks for it.  </li>
            <li> I wound up waking up feeling worse than when I woke up.  </li>
            <li> and I hate the traditional bulky mouth pieces!</li>
            <li> This redesign has led to worse problems.</li>
            <li> It does tend to wear out -- the bite grips loosen, as well as the cushions get thin</li>
            <li> keep the wings in place, a thin plastic strip connects them and tucks in front of your lower front teeth.</li>
            <li> She has TMJ in addition to the grinding problem, so I am hoping maybe this will help with that too, as I have heard teeth grinding can make TMJ worse.</li>
            <li> and I chewed into the thin plastic at the front</li>
            <li> /night guards to help with this irritating condition that I have.</li>
            <li> they can hold your teeth in an unnatural or unhealthy bite position.  </li>
            <li> I think this device made my problem even worse.</li>
            <li> I have broken three teeth, but since using this product I have not had any broken teeth.</li>
            <li> Oops sorry didn&#x27;t mean to review this one.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous that they are so expensive, but they work.</li>
            <li> I had complained to her about how my front teeth had become painful and crowding/shifting/twisting over the past 4 months or so</li>
            <li> I could have spent my $30.00 on something else :(  </li>
            <li> Also is really small and sometimes i&#x27;m afraid to swallow it.</li>
            <li> What I have not likes it that the tab that goes up and down hurts the bone under my gums fairly bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very hard, uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use them regularly because I hated the feeling.</li>
            <li> which is a very bad thing and can actually engage your jaw-</li>
            <li> Also, it was difficult to close my mouth with it</li>
            <li> it being so uncomfortable while I tried it during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sleeping all the way through the night without being woken up by an uncomfortable mouth piece.  </li>
            <li> I keep mine in the holders from the two &#x27;failed&#x27; mouth guards, and I brush it with toothpaste every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become so used to wearing it that I can&#x27;t sleep without it, sometimes I will forget &amp; go to bed without it, but I keep feeling likes something wrong until I realize it&#x27;s not in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This dental guard is extremely uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> My husband found this so uncomfortable to sleep in that we tossed it after one use.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to sleep on your side with the dental guard in there.</li>
            <li> I do get an imprint on the inside of my mouth from it in the morning, and it gives me the sesation of wanteding to create suction in my mouth which is kindof weird.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product at all.</li>
            <li> Wrong item.</li>
            <li> The description fails to mention that.  </li>
            <li> Like this product but too expensive.</li>
            <li> (if grinding occurs on your front teeth), and expensive dental bills to fix your teeth with crowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the money you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problem with thinking i was going to swallow it, but i can see how it would be scary for others.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of having the dentist make a really expensive nightguard.</li>
            <li> However, I have a tendency to clench my teeth and have found the product unable to withstand the clenching.</li>
            <li> but I am not impressed with this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Den Tek changed their model and this model is hurting my gum and my teeth.</li>
            <li> I got it and it felt so weird.</li>
            <li> This is the worse bite guard I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> I, unfortunately, have not ever kept the receipt to request a replacement.</li>
            <li> After only one night&#x27;s use, I woke with a horrible pain and a misaligned jaw.</li>
            <li> It wasnt as uncomfortable once I flipped it.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable for me, i prefer the moldable bite nightguards.</li>
            <li> They hurt, they lose shape, they fall out and they are difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various brands/styles of dental guard and this Dentek gaurd is the worst.  </li>
            <li> I can still grind my front teeth while wearing this guard, so it&#x27;s completely useless.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product and the price was outrageous for such a poor preforming item.</li>
            <li> I got 2 in the package and my sister tried the other one and agreed they were horrible.  </li>
            <li> If, like me, you think no human being should have to fall asleep with some nasty plastic thing in their mouth, but you&#x27;re tired of shattering your teeth, then this is your mouth guard!!!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been afraid of swallowing it.</li>
            <li> That seems downright dangerous.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would fall out or swallow it, but I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks with this product I am going to have to stop using as I am afraid I might injure myself.</li>
            <li> Too expensive!  </li>
            <li> I was so wrong!  </li>
            <li> (well...better than waking up with four broken teeth!!)</li>
            <li> My daughter told me her dentist advised her to get fitted for a mouth guard (expensive!)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me at all--was very uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t reduce my jaw pain.</li>
            <li> it was very uncomfortable and I knew it was not something</li>
            <li> I have had a very expensive dental guard, made by my dentist, that I have worn for years.</li>
            <li> Was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have a nighr guard from my dentist that while very expensive, doesn&#x27;t cause pain.</li>
            <li> The guards make it impossible to grind your teeth, but they do take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> However, in the morning, my bite was really bad.  </li>
            <li> , I just grind my teeth so badly</li>
            <li> I suffer from grinding my teeth really bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t say bad things to my husband when he&#x27;s sleeping now.  </li>
            <li> I grind so bad that I go through one every 6 months.</li>
            <li> have a bad habit of grinding my teeth</li>
            <li> I have a bad clenching teeth problem.  </li>
            <li> and they do not dig into my gums as badly that way.</li>
            <li> Bad change DenTek.  </li>
            <li> I found the connector bit to be painful.</li>
            <li> Extremely painful.</li>
            <li> It did not in any way help with my jaw pain either :(  </li>
            <li> and I hate them.  </li>
            <li> Hate it.  </li>
            <li> I hate the gagging bulky saliva build up feeling.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing.</li>
            <li> I hate mouth guards</li>
            <li> We paid a dentist for an Invisiline guard for my daughter, which she hated.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a bulky boil to mold mouth guard and hated it.  </li>
            <li> I grind my teeth very badly.</li>
            <li> Try it - you will NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am TOTALLY disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product and with Den Tek.</li>
            <li> The worst of the worst.  </li>
            <li> This is just awful!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible device and a terrible design.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard has made my teeth worst.</li>
            <li> I have been using night guards - both custom and OTC - for years, and this is one of the worst.  </li>
            <li> Terrible mouthguard .</li>
            <li> so mabye they are all awful.</li>
            <li> I am a TERRIBLE grinder.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! My first dental guard was too large and my teeth hurt in the morning from grinding on it. Also, it was difficult to close my mouth with it in.&lt;br /&gt;This dental guard is slim, I am able to close my mouth comfortably, and my mouth feels fine in the morning. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for me, other full-bodied mouthguards I bite into like hell and actually end up making my teeth crooked (seriously). This covers up just enough and provides 90-95% protection. I recommend hydrogen peroxide baths to clean these + toothbrushing.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible grinding problem and after reading some of the reviews I decided to order this because I believed it would be more comfortable to have the guard on the bottom teeth. The idea is not bad, but after just one hour of having them on, it rubbed and bloodied my lower gums in a bad way... back to searching for something that might help.</li>
            <li> just not for me - didn&#x27;t fit and i have to get a dentist to make me a night guard - these may work for others but not for me. The great news is that I got a refund and didn&#x27;t have to return the item.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am new to having any type of dental guard, so all would be strange.  But I can say this doesn&#x27;t hurt or bother me and I fall asleep easily now that I have gotten used to having a \\&quot;foreign object\\&quot; in my mouth.  My dentist wants me to have a $400+ dental guard to keep me from clenching my teeth, but I can&#x27;t afford that. This is a different design but I thought, at this price, what do I have to lose?  The great thing is that I can clean and reuse it until I wreck it and there are two!</li>
            <li> I have tried many guards that have not worked. The problems I have encountered are: too soft so I chew through them quickly, too big or wrong shape so they cause me to gag, uncomfortable with sharp edges or pointy parts that poke my gums. An annoyance most guards give me is the inability to speak and these are definitely not sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DenTek Guard is great. This as a comparison to other guards. On top of the quality of design, construction and materials. DenTek shows that it cares about me by not using BPA. DenTek shows that it cares about America by manufacturing its product here in the USA. DenTek uses USA packaging and the included dental guard cleaner is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for DenTek</li>
            <li> it works better than my dentist&#x27;s custom made dental guard which cost me a lot of bucks.&lt;br /&gt;If I know this before, I would not get that expansive stuff from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off of the reviews, but for me it was poorly fitting and very uncomfortable. It did. It seem to stay in the right spot without moving too much. I didn&#x27;t attempt to sleep in it due to it being so uncomfortable while I tried it during the day.</li>
            <li> Just not all that sure as a mouth sleeper that I wouldn&#x27;t dislodge it in my sleep so I discontinued using it. BUT I would say better than the other products out there.</li>
            <li> Bought this about a week ago. So far I&#x27;m loving how it works. So simple, easy to use and comfortable for the most part. I&#x27;ve tried the regular mouth guards where you have to boil them first, then fit them, and this product has exceeded those plus my expectations. Typically I get about 7 hours sleep and still comfortable, but after sleep over 9 hours, I&#x27;ve noticed some discomfort with my gums. Nothing major. I still really live this product as a person with a strong gag reflex (insert joke here).</li>
            <li> I have not tried these out yet, so I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars, but it a huge improvement from what the night guards used to be.  I like these are no boil, no bulk and they are worn on the lower teeth.</li>
            <li> As promised on the details it works so great.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using one from my dental doctor created for me for grinding teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Somehow this was not easy or feel right. I didnt like to wear it. It was kind of giving me an another stress as a must do task.  However this detek is more convenent and really easy to wear/ adjust and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Since i bought this i never skipped one day. I dont feel any achness or discomfort in the morning. No more pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is really good too. One box has two so i guess i am ok for a year around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price until now. So get it from here.</li>
            <li> Did not fit - adjustable but not really!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the SleepRight custom fit night guards and they threw my jaw out of alignment, not to mention made my jaw sore and gave it cuts.  It came down to the bite pads just being too thick and the harsh abrasive material used on certain parts (mainly the pivots for the bite pads) - and I&#x27;ve tried all the sizes available in my desperate attempt to find something that didn&#x27;t feel like a hockey puck in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I run across this one and so far.. 1 week in.. its been working great for me!  I seriously don&#x27;t even feel it in my mouth when I&#x27;m sleeping.  I have read past reviews with concerns of people fearing they&#x27;ll swallow it... but I haven&#x27;t even come close to it so far.  If anything, the other ones I&#x27;ve tried sloshed around my mouth more because the \\&quot;wings\\&quot; were irritating my mouth.  These stayed exactly where they started from the beginning of the night to end.  I&#x27;ll see how they pass up on durability and write a review again maybe in 6 months.  Great product as long as durability holds up (the package says each one should hold up to 6 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I might suggest for this product is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying case.  Every other night guard does... even their older model came with it.  Luckily they fit perfectly in the case that came with my SleepRight ones.. ironically, even better than the SleepRights fit in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Make sure you get the ones with the blue bite pads.  They have an older model and I&#x27;ve heard bad things about those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I ranked it down to 4 stars because upon further usage.. I notice a little discomfort on the bottom of my lower gums.  Not too bad and still by far the most comfortable nightguards I&#x27;ve used yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2:  I&#x27;ve started wearing the guards upside down (having the groove cupping my upper teeth) and it has so far worked out better for me.  I got this idea reading elsewhere from someone else doing the same.  My gums have yet to get irritated like before and the nightguard stayed in place the whole night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3: It has been about 2 or 3 weeks since my last update and things are still working perfectly for me.  I&#x27;m sleeping all the way through the night without being woken up by an uncomfortable mouth piece.  So looks like I&#x27;ll stick with this one.  I&#x27;m sharing my experience with everyone because I&#x27;ve gone through so many other night guards just to end up spitting them out in the middle of the night just so I can get some sleep.  If I can make someone else&#x27;s decision easier, at least all my sleepless nights (and money down the chute) will not have gone in vain.  The main negative thing I notice now.. the notches that keep the sizing in place.. one side seems to not stay in place.  It might just be the specific one I&#x27;m using (the second pair I have in the package seems to not have this problem), but at the very least.. it hasn&#x27;t been that big of a problem for me - but I can see it maybe being a problem for someone with a small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4: So I&#x27;ve now been on my third of fourth pair and there is one glaring consistent issue that holds the product back... the night guard has trouble staying at the adjusted size. Hopefully DenTeck can figure out a fix to make the adjustment tabs more sturdy or perhaps change the system in how these guards adjust in size. Luckily, my mouth is nearly the size that these night guards loosen up to. Having said that, I&#x27;ve still yet to find a night guard that works for me as well as these do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5: On my 4th pair, due to the adjustment strap not holding its place, I chewed through one of the bite pads in 3 days (bite pad would not stay in place due to loose adjustment). It is now unusable so I have contacted Dentek about a replacement and on the issue of possibly designing future models with more secure adjustment straps. Its a shame that this product has this one glaring flaw. I&#x27;d knock this item down to 3.5 stars if I could, but don&#x27;t wantto give it a 3 since its served me well enough in the last 3 pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6: I have been switching back and forth from this and the SleepRight nightguards, both have their perks. This one is more comfortable without a doubt, but the other one is definitely more durable. I&#x27;ve learned to cope with the other ones by moving the bite pads to the forward-most position so my jaw doesn&#x27;t have to open up as wide. It works, will still test new products as they come available as neither are perfect.to give it a 3 since its served me well enough in the last 3 pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6: I have been switching back and forth from this and the SleepRight nightguards, both have their perks.

            <li> I have been using DenTek for years and this is the first time i have used this model.  Great idea to have it adjust to size, too bad it doesn&#x27;t stay the size you set, it expands during the night and it doesn&#x27;t stay in place so there is a risk of choking on it.  formerly the unit would conform around on the top of your top teeth but now it crosses over your front teeth and never stays in place.  Although the former units were made of less comfortable plastic they kept my teeth from meeting through the night.  Maybe it should be back to the drawing board for Dentek.</li>
            <li> really helps fight bruxism. my jaw and neck are a lot less stressed thanks to this. dentist also happy i was not grinding my teeth anymore.</li>
            <li> Finally, an end to bruxism induced migraines! I tried those moldable guards and couldn&#x27;t close my mouth around them, but this one works wonders! It&#x27;s not bulky and, after a brief period of adjusting to it, it&#x27;s not very noticeable. The version I bought at Target is also adjustable, which is a lifesaver since my mouth is tiny.  I slept with it in last night and for the first time in months I woke without a headache! At a couple points in the night I could feel myself biting/chewing on it. I&#x27;m glad it was there to protect my teeth!! Just wish it came with a case, as I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with this mouth guard!  I tried a very similar style (I believe it was the &#x27;sleepright&#x27; brand, the &#x27;low-profile&#x27; mouth guard.  That one is almost the exact same design, except that this one is much more comfortable, as the plastic pieces that fit between top &amp; bottom teeth is so much smaller that it allows your jaw to rest comfortably (unlike the other brand&#x27;s model).  When I was using that other one, the forced myself to use it, but I would always get frustrated, wishing that there could be less material between my teeth.  And now here it is!  I am overjoyed to have finally found a mouth guard that works wonderfully for me!  I know, how sad to be SO THRILLED about a mouth guard, but I think that&#x27;s a clear testament to how stressful it is to have no acceptable options for comfortable and efficient mouth guards - but now that this one is here, what a relief!  I hope others find the same delight in this itty bitty piece of plastic (or silicone, or whatever the heck it is made of!).</li>
            <li> I bought this item after I had purchased a boil and bite one which I did not like at all.  Too bulky and hard, not comfortable at all, could not even close my mouth upon insertion.  So, I tried the Dentek thinking it is smaller and less bulky.  Well, that&#x27;s about it,  better size and less material, but it isn&#x27;t comfortable, it irritates my gums and cheeks, and I don&#x27;t sleep well at night with it in my mouth.  I can tell in the morning I have been biting on it; the upper back teeth feel funny as a result.  So, I&#x27;m skeptical about trying a new one and can&#x27;t imagine paying for a custom one at my dentist.  Too expensive!  I found a custom teeth night guard from this website:teethnightguard.com.  Anybody has an idea about their products?  I saw their products on ebay, too, but the reviews on ebay are too short to be able to get an informed opinion.  Please help!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The main problem I had with the mouth guard was that because it only touches the back two or three teeth, a lot of pressure is put on those teeth.  When I wake up in the morning, my molars feel sensitive because of the constant pressure.  Also, some of the reviewers mentioned that the plastic rubbed against the bottom gum.  This was true for me and I had to use it on my top teeth instead.  This fixed that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now shopping around for a full-mouth mouthguard in hopes that it will put less pressure on my back teeth.</li>
            <li> After using various night guards, I run into this on Amazon. Have been using it for a month. Like it. It is not bulky, instructions are easy to understand and THERE ARE 2 OF THEM IN THE BOX. Recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> Stores no longer carry this product that I have used for years. I was very happy to find it through Amazon.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt; This is the best fitting and most comfortable dental guard out there, awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who grinds my teeth every night (or maybe I do, and don&#x27;t realize it!) but when I started waking up in the AM with a clenched jaw, I could tell a night guard was getting to be necessary. My dentist recommended trying an over the counter guard first before spending $100s on a custom fit guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This night guard fits my needs perfectly. It&#x27;s comfortable, it&#x27;s easy to fit (no boiling water required), and it lasts me 6 months. I automatically change it out after each 6mo dentist appointment and it could probably last another month or so if I really wanted to stretch it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone who occasionally grinds their teeth and I wish I&#x27;d have started using a night guard like this years ago.</li>
            <li> This one has little tabs that go up the top gums.  The previous version without these was much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get these things to fit well in my mouth.  The part that goes across the front was digging into my lip and if I flipped it over it didn&#x27;t fit correctly on the sides.  If you have a smaller mouth, I&#x27;d pass on these.</li>
            <li> Kind of awkward feeling at first, but I didn&#x27;t wake up because of if like the others I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I recently went to the dentist,and she wanted to custom fit me for a dental guard. It would have cost me over $200.00. So I decided to try this one several months ago. It works GREAT !! I would definately this product to anyone who wants to save money. The toime frame in which it arrived was also good.</li>
            <li> Purchased this one (contains two nightguards) and another one (Dental Hygiene Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard Kit). Tried this one first and have used it for a few nights, and so far it fits my small mouth nicely! You can adjust the position easily, and more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t need to be boiled, and it is not bulky at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although still need to test how long it can last (quick thin), but in general a good buy! And I highly recommend it espacially for people with small mouth.</li>
            <li> Does not fit securely enough to prevent grinding between upper/lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money. Product does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> This was a bit big for my mouth but I still think it works fine. Not super comfortable if you are thinking about it or are not used to having something in your mouth but when you wear it every night you get used to it. It doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore and I enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> This is the night guard I&#x27;ve been looking for! I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months now and love it! It&#x27;s very conferable and protects without feeling bulky. I actually cracked a tooth from grinding but hated wearing those big bulky night guards. I didn&#x27;t have the money to have my detist make a professional guard so I went on the search of a comfortable night guard and I found it! I have a pretty small mouth and all the others I tried were too big. Now I can actually sleep with my mouth closed. I sleep all night now without sore teeth or jaw in the morning. It&#x27;s just 2 small rubber like pads in the back (and I sleep with it upside down so it doesn&#x27;t rub on my gums). I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried three different \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; night-time night guards, but could not get one to fit my mouth comfortably.  They were bulky, and they threw my jaw out of line.  Someone recommended I try this smaller ready to wear DenTek Comfort Fit and my problems were over!  It&#x27;s less bulky, than the \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; guards, takes very little time to get used to, doesn&#x27;t need boiling water to fit the guard to your mouth.  The price is right, too.  I highly recommend this product to others who are having trouble getting the \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; guards to fit comfortably in their mouths.</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t expect that it would be as good as the one I had fitted years ago that sat perfectly on my teeth...the dog chewed it up so I&#x27;ve tried a few of the  over the counter mouthguards...this one is better than the huge hot water deal...but I have to wear it on my top teeth cause after a few days on my bottom teeth it started to irritate my bottom gums...maybe my mouth is too small...on top it does the trick though the plastic sizing thing doesn&#x27;t stay put so sometimes I have to push it back tight...also when I sleep on my side the pressure of my cheek against the pillow presses against the guard and leaves an indentation my the inside of my cheek which goes away after I&#x27;ve been up for a few,  but it&#x27;s a little disconcerting...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these mouth guards for about a year and replace them about every 6 months (right after each dentist visit).  There were once available at my local CVS, but I can no longer find them in the stores.  They are easy to use and very comfortable after the first night or so.  They&#x27;re small enough so as to not cause a problem while sleeping, but big enough to cover the grinding area.  This combination pack also makes them very inexpensive when compared to other models and the custom-made ones you can purchase through your dentist.  They are more expensive than the boil mouth guards, but also far more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Theses night guards are AMAZING! I have tried many other brands in the past, and all of them left me drooling, unable to breath through my mouth, chewing my cheeks to bits, or nearly choking to death in my sleep. This guard is so thin I can talk almost normally with it in, doesn&#x27;t keep my mouth from closing, and still feels solid enough to keep my grinding at bay. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After trying one my dentist made, several different guards from various stores and brands, I finally found the right one. I have had bruxism my whole life and this is the only one that has helped, comfortable, and stays in place all night.</li>
            <li> better than i thought ..the form fitted ones hurt and i seem to take out in sleep..so far.. no pain and wake up with still in mouth!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dental guard in October of 2014 for nighttime teeth clenching. I don&#x27;t really grind my teeth, but I clench them, and sometimes if my tongue or cheeks get in the way, I would wake up with sores. So that being said, I&#x27;m not sure how this would work for someone who grinds a lot -- I&#x27;m not sure if it would stay in place, since it doesn&#x27;t conform to your teeth. But for me, it has been my favorite of all the night guards I have tried. I have tried many different kinds of over-the-counter night guards, trying to avoid paying hundreds of dollars for one from the dentist, and this one works well for me. I tried a few different &amp;#34;boil and bite&amp;#34; night guards, but they were bulky and ultimately ended up rubbing my gums or tongue and causing pain. This one took a little getting used to, because it doesn&#x27;t conform to your teeth like the boil and bite guards, but after a night or two wearing it, it works like a dream. I was also concerned about the durability since it seems pretty flimsy, but so far it&#x27;s been great. The pack I bought came with two and I&#x27;m still using the first one.</li>
            <li> I have a serious grinding problem, I lost one tooth because of that, and about to loose the symmetric one. I was told that I definitely needed a night guard. I have used any type of night guard in the past. I prefer the ones for lower jaw, they don&#x27;t fall, they don&#x27;t push your lips like a boxer, thus don&#x27;t cause nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Custom made ones fit perfectly, but they are very expensive. Other DenTek products that you boil were not good enough for me, they worn out very quick. This DenTek Comfort Fit is the best item so far. Affordable, very easy -no boil-, don&#x27;t move at night, and very light. I only wish they had at least 2 sizes. The blue part is a bit deep for me and sometimes it hurts the gum.</li>
            <li> I have used the boil and fit type mouth guards for my teeth grinding and clenching.  I didn&#x27;t like the bulk of these types of devices and the drooling I had when wearing one.  Plus I could not speak clearly without removing them. I bought these Den Tek Comfort Fit Guards hoping these would work for me.  The first night I spit them out because it hurt my lower gums.  The second night, I cut off the top of the T, so now I had a L shape to fit over my bottom teeth.  No more hurt gums and I slept all night with the altered guard in place.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I bought these after using the ones you have to boil for about year, and the switch was definitely worth it. This is one of those products that doesn&#x27;t really look like it would work at first until you try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few problems:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s fairly easy to chew through these things. I think the manufacturer gives you some kind of warranty on it, but I&#x27;ve never tried it. This isn&#x27;t that big of a problem, because it&#x27;s really hard to completely chew through it, and it will still work even after taking some damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I have no idea how people usually grind their teeth in their sleep, so this might not matter, but if you grind your teeth completely horizontally from side to side, there are areas where this will not protect your teeth, whereas the ones you boil will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product, and I&#x27;d recommend anyone who&#x27;s used to using the full cover mouthguards to at least give these a try.</li>
            <li> Save your money! I have worn a night guard for years. I have had 3 hard night guards from my dentist and have worn my last one out. I bought this until I could get a new one from my dentist and tried it out. The soft adjustable band will not hold this in my mouth no matter how I adjust it. I can&#x27;t even believe that this product could get any positive reviews at all. I am going to use an athletic mouth guard that costs about $1 and will form to your teeth by boiling it and placing it in your mouth and sucking on it to form fit your teeth until I can get back to the dentist. I was so disappointed in this product and the price was outrageous for such a poor preforming item. This is the first review I have posted but I felt so strongly about it that I wanted to warn people not to buy this thinking it would help them at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had great teeth, perfect bite, no braces, etc.  Due to recent pain and stress, I started clenching my teeth at night.  I went to my trusted dentist who advised getting an OTC night guard.  First, I tried the kind you boil.  It works...but it&#x27;s so huge that I can&#x27;t get to sleep with it and I can&#x27;t really keep my mouth shut.  Then I tried the DenTek Comfort Fit.  Initially, I was pleased that it was so small and flexible.  I could sleep with it.  However, in the morning, my bite was really bad.  My front teeth were straight on top of each other.  I took the guard to the dentist and he confirmed that this particular one is no good.  So the search continues...</li>
            <li> Wow - so much better than the giant frontal mouthguards that require boiling and fitting. This thing is super easy to adjust and extremely comfortable and effective to wear. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not solid enough to stay in place. U will still grind the s*** out of your teeth and tear up your cheeks.</li>
            <li> I found the plastic adjustment to be quite flimsy.  The pads were too hard for me and made my teeth sore.  It kept my mouth open too widely...which made my jaw hurt in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it just wasn&#x27;t for me.  Maybe someone else.</li>
            <li> Quite comfortable but the size adjustment won&#x27;t stay in place. The size opens up during wear and allows the guard to slip out of position. This happened on the first night and with both of the guards in the twin pack. I phoned DenTek and to their great credit they suggested a full refund which they promptly sent out. Good company, too bad the product is not up to the job. This would be a winner if the adjustment locked permanently.</li>
            <li> If this stayed at the size I adjusted it to I would probably give it a 4/5 due to price and durability. Note: For context, I clench my jaw, not grind my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bite pads seem sturdier than other ones I have used and it&#x27;s comfortable (when its fit right). The problem is I adjust it according to the guide with the package with respect to my teeth and then fall asleep. Halfway through the night, the adjustment band is almost all the way out at least on one side (sometimes both) and I have to readjust it to the 2nd notch. Still looking for that great mouthguard that is durable and comfortable, it seems like you can get one or the other, but not both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably go back to the athletic style ones from Dentek, they seem more comfortable, no moving parts, they just don&#x27;t last as long...</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth (day and night) and it was starting to affect my TMJ with loud clicking and pain. My dentist recommended a guard but insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it so I starting looking around.  I tried many brands but they gagged me and I spit them out at night...therefore, not very useful.  This DenTek is amazing.  It is very small and tolerable for the entire night. I have been using it for a month and noticed immediate decrease in TMJ pain and gradual decrease in TMJ clicking.  It is meant to be worn with the small loop in front of lower teeth but I find it more comfortable upside down with loop in front of upper teeth - it doesn&#x27;t matter, can be worn either way.  Another bonus - it actually seems to train your jaw to stay slightly open so I am not clenching as much during the day.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a comfortable dental guard that works. This model is pretty comfortable because it doesn&#x27;t fill your mouth, it positions plastic bumpers at strategic places to keep teeth from contacting each other when the jaw is clenched. I&#x27;m still playing with the positioning of the bumpers to keep the guard from moving out of position when I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> Beware: Most of the reviews here are based on the old design of this night guard.  I don&#x27;t know when they changed it(2012 or 2103)but both designs have the same UPC code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new one is bulkier with more plastic.  The customer pic above shows what the old design looked like.  It didn&#x27;t have the extra wings on the top which you see in the new design box picture.  If you place the guard on a flat service, the pad area (blue) looked like an L on it&#x27;s side.  It now looks like a T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put mine on my lower teeth.  With the old design, I could speak clearly and no one could tell I had it in.  With the new design, you can tell I have something in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish companies would not mess with products that work and people love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/28/2013:  Spoke to the DenTek Company and they said they changed to this new design in January 2013.&lt;br /&gt;I did modify my new design guard by cutting off the top wings with scissors and now it&#x27;s like the old design.  The pads are slightly thicker than the old design but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  It&#x27;s more comfortable now.</li>
            <li> This nightguard did not work for me personally. I use these because my teeth grinding at night causes my jaw to lock and pop all day. The boil and bite night guards work great to prevent the jaw popping, but the Dentek Comfort Fit does not seem to help with this. I think that the fit is just not tight enough for me. However, it may work just fine for someone who does not have jaw problems in addition to teeth grinding. In addition, it came with a 30 day money back guarantee so it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it. (The only reason I did not take advantage of this is because I ended up giving the second night guard to my sister to try out).</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for taking a chance on this product, I don&#x27;t think I would be sleeping at all.  I have trouble falling asleep at night, and my doctor tried both a hard plastic custom fit guard for me (that I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep in) and a soft rubber heat molded mouth guard (that I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically, the materials for this product say that I shouldn&#x27;t use it.  I had no idea for 30 years that I even grind my teeth!  Then, I was referred by a neuromuscular dentist to an orthodontist who specializes in realignment to prevent grinding.  My upper braces were put on about six months ago, and my lower braces were put on about two months ago.  At that time, my orthodontist put extra bonding material on two of my lower molars to hold my teeth apart because my overbite is severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my lower teeth have moved outward far enough that my upper teeth perfectly rest on my lower braces, even with the bonding material.  Not a good feeling, and a cause for nervousness for what might happen while sleeping.  I bought these Dentek guards, and they were SO much better than any of the other guards that were made for me.  They don&#x27;t take up much space in my mouth, and they don&#x27;t cause me to have trouble falling asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it was a little weird to have something in my mouth while trying to sleep.  The first night was a lot of adjusting and a little extra saliva while I was getting used to it.  A LITTLE TIP: don&#x27;t feel like you have to have both sides adjusted to the same level.  I found that mine worked better with one side on \\&quot;1\\&quot; and the other side on \\&quot;2\\&quot;.  By the third night, it was no big deal.  Sometimes it even takes me a little while in the morning to remember that I have it in.  I have no fears of swallowing it at all.  I keep mine in the holders from the two &#x27;failed&#x27; mouth guards, and I brush it with toothpaste every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to introduce this product to my orthodontist during my appointment today.  When I mentioned seeing them before, he wasn&#x27;t familiar with them.  Hopefully I can help others get the relief I have had from trying these, and also receive his approval to keep using it.  :)mentioned seeing them before, he wasn&#x27;t familiar with them.

            <li> It was a little bigger and harder than the former Den Tex nighttime guard that I used to have.  I don&#x27;t know if the company stopped making the one I used to have but I just can&#x27;t locate it anymore! 😞. It still does the job but I find my teeth and gums ache a bit from all the grinding I do.</li>
            <li> Of all the Dentek products I&#x27;ve tried, this is probably one of the most comfortable, at least initially. I like that this design addresses the saliva buildup issue found in sport mouthguard types. However, I now have sore spots on my gums where the blue pads tend to rub. I have tried resizing many times, but it still ends up sore. I feel it as soon as I put the guard in at night, like the soreness can never quite fully heal from the previous night. In addition, I talked to my dentist about this guard, and while I know it is in his interest to sell his products, he recommended against this type of guard saying that biting down on a back pad system like this could, slowly over time, affect the alignment of your bite (ie the front portion of teeth that do not make contact could start to move toward each other). To my dentist&#x27;s credit, he even recommended going with a different over the counter method where all teeth touch.&lt;br /&gt;If I could find a guard that made full contact to my bite line without wearing on my gums or saliva buildup, I would give it five stars. Hopefully Dentek reads these!</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me I gag easily but should use a night guard.  I&#x27;ve tried several and gagged on them all.  This product has such a low profile it seemed it would work for me.  I still gagged and returned it however if you are looking for a night guard with a low profile it is a good choice.  Sizing is also simple.  There are 5 settings and you just tug slightly to move through them.</li>
            <li> This is the first mouth-guard that doesn&#x27;t rub anywhere inside my mouth and isn&#x27;t completely embarrassing to sleep with in my mouth. It&#x27;s very comfortable and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. This is my new go-to guard to keep my teeth from grinding at night.</li>
            <li> LOVE these. I wear them every night. Super comfortable. I grind my teeth very badly. These night guards make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Even though it states on the box that it is not for TMJ, it really did work. I almost returned the item when I read that on the box, but changed my mind and gave it a shot. I am so glad I did try it. The first night I wore it,  the clicking and jaw discomfort did not subside. In fact I had an additional headache. after wearing it the second night, I woke up with no clicking of my jaw. It has remained that way after a week of use. After months of intensifying jaw pain and increasing clicking and locking of my jaw muscles it was quickly reversed. I am also getting used to having it in my mouth. It may have helped reduce my snoring too!</li>
            <li> There are good things and bad things about this mouth guard.  This is a bargain! I sent my husband to the drug store to get me one of these non-boil types, and the only one they had was a store brand one for $40! Here I got 2 for less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t bulky in my mouth. The ones you boil for a custom fit always gagged me. Sometimes the pieces that protect my teeth will slide around and I&#x27;ll wake up with my back gums sore. But it only happened once.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t stand to keep this in my mouth, much less overnight.  Made me salivate a lot, yuck.  Not using it.  On the other hand, my sister loves hers, so to each his own!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different bite guards over the years, but this is the first that I&#x27;ve been able to keep in my mouth over night without gagging.  I ruined one pair  because it wasn&#x27;t adjusted properly.  I really didn&#x27;t understand how they fit properly, but now it is working like a charm. I wish I ran across this device 20 years ago.  I was very discouraged  after paying the big dollars for the device the dentist  sold me that made me gag.  I&#x27;ve tried ones that you boil and one that just fit the front teeth.  For me with my small mouth, this is the only device that seems to stay place.  I can even drink water with it in my mouth. I would give it 5 stars, but I still don&#x27;t enjoy having it in my mouth.  Although, it is better than my teeth throbbing.</li>
            <li> My dentist wanted me to shell out (admittedly insurance would pay for it but still) over $500.00 for a guard that was custom made and fit for me. I said &amp;#34;uhhh, no&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went online and bought this and these are amazing. Very comfortable. They are also quite cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear mine down, even after months. Which makes me think my dentist was scamming me telling me I grind my teeth when, considering these are not wearing down, it appears I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these first before getting the one the dentist recommends.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mouthpiece &amp; am so glad to find it on Amazon! I have a serious problem with grinding my teeth &amp; have never been able to use any of the custom fit mouthguards because they are so bulky they throw my jaw out,I feel like I&#x27;m gagging all night &amp; I find I clench my teeth even more to keep them on.They are so expenisve &amp; I was wearing them out at the rate of 1 in less than 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this one,it sits on your bottom teeth, so I don&#x27;t clench my teeth trying to keep it in,my jaw relaxes more.It&#x27;s not as bulky so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m gagging &amp; have a mouth full of saliva all night. It&#x27;s adjustable-that means that as you use it,it will stretch out &amp; become flatter &amp; bigger(as they all will), but you can just readjust the sizing to fit again. I don&#x27;t have any trouble with it sliding around in my mouth.To clean it,I just run it under water &amp; slide the pads back &amp; forth on the adjustable piece to rinse it out. Sometimes I will drop it in a glass of mouthwash for the day to disinfect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I say I have a serious problem grinding &amp; clenching my teeth, I really mean it.I&#x27;ve had to deal with migraines from it &amp; had to use muscle relaxers when the muscle in my jaw became so inflammed &amp; irritated that the whole side of my face &amp; neck swelled up! The back of a couple of molars are almost level with my gums because they are worn down so much and I cracked THREE molars in 1 year because I couldn&#x27;t wear any of the night guards because of the gagging &amp; jaw aches they caused. These are the best things I&#x27;ve found,I don&#x27;t have any trouble wearing them. As I said, I was wearing the others out in less than 3 months. I bought a 2 pack of these last July 1st(2009) &amp; the 2nd one is finally so worn out I need to replace it-believe me,that is a long time of wear for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE(3/2013): This is still the only nightguard I can use. I&#x27;m stiil just as happy with it as I was when I wrote the review. I&#x27;d be a LOT happier if I didn&#x27;t have to wear one in the first place though! For the most part, these last me longer than 6 months, more like 9 months at least. But I also tend to try to get the most wear out of them that I can &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed that when they get really thin, I begin to chew on them more at night, which reminds me to replace it. Anyone who tries this &amp; says it&#x27;s not comfortable, give it a week or so before you give up - I think anything you put in your mouth at night is going to be uncomfortable until you get used to it, it just isn&#x27;t normal. Even when I replace my old one with a new one, I have a couple of nights of re-adjusting to the difference in size in my mouth. I&#x27;ve also developed a habit of sucking on them in my sleep (or sucking my cheeks in), which makes them press up so tight against my cheeks that it leave sore spots - but I think that is me &amp; not the guard causing it, I&#x27;m having big issues with insomnia which makes be grind my teeth more. Like I said, I&#x27;d rather not wear one at all, but these are the most comfortable I&#x27;ve found for my mouth . I&#x27;ve become so used to wearing it that I can&#x27;t sleep without it, sometimes I will forget &amp; go to bed without it, but I keep feeling likes something wrong until I realize it&#x27;s not in my mouth.ar one in the first place though!

            <li> This is the only mouthpiece that I have found that does not have the heavy plastic near your front teeth, where you generally don&#x27;t need it.  There is only a very thin, but strong strip of plastic that holds the two back pieces together.  No irratating plastic against your front teeth.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I am really upset that the old version is no longer being made.  I tried this one.  It is too big for my mouth.  It is also too thick and forced my mouth to be open all night.  I wish I could find a smaller guard that is adjustable(like they used too make.)  Does anyone have any ideas?</li>
            <li> I really love this product because it doesnt fill up my mouth. This way I&#x27;m never bothered by it and can always have good nights sleep.</li>
            <li> My 8 yr old son grinds teeth so hard at night. Our dentist kept telling us to ignore it. But my son literately grinds like a mill. I&#x27;ve had him tried almost every night guard out there. DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard came out the best. This is the only product that&#x27;s comfortable and actually last to three months. None of others would last to one month. SLEEP RIGHT SLIM COMFORT is pricey and last up to a month top. DenTek Custom Comfort Nightguard is the worst - It did not last more than a week to have my son grind through each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard. It comes in Twin Pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered some serious issues with grinding my teeth at night. I&#x27;ve woken up sore, in pain, and with a headache every day for about three months. After getting a ridiculous quote from my dentist for a bite guard, I looked to Amazon in desperation. This has been a life saver. I haven&#x27;t woken up with a headache or soreness since I bought this a month ago. And, I&#x27;m finding that I sleep MUCH better with this night guard - I don&#x27;t wake up, and I feel so much more refreshed in the morning. I cannot recommend this enough. I do think with the amount that I grind my teeth, I will probably go through both guards in less than a year, but its still completely worth it. Its easy to clean, flexible enough to really fit anyone&#x27;s mouth, and its small, so you really can&#x27;t notice it when you&#x27;re wearing it. The only issue I&#x27;ve had is for the first 1-2 weeks, it did make my bottom gums a bit sore - they&#x27;re fine now, though. Try it - you will NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This dental guard is extremely uncomfortable.  I followed the directions on how to fit, and after one night of use I had cuts on my gums and sores on my inner cheeks.  I do not want to blame the product if the issues were a result of my physical make-up or they way I grind my teeth, but it should be noted that the product is very flimsy and it literally felt like razor blades were in my mouth.  This product is definitely not \\&quot;one size fits all.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> ok, first of all, i bought these at Target for $18 a month ago - way cheaper than Amazon&#x27;s current price of $29!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t have severe TMJ, i have small teeth and a small mouth, and i find these quite comfortable. they are very flexible, and don&#x27;t make me feel like i&#x27;ve got ten pounds of chewing gum stuck in my teeth. the first mouth guard i can sleep with, even though i wake up every morning and they fell out during the night. i&#x27;ve tried the bigger mouth guards you shape with hot water and your teeth, but they are so bulky i can&#x27;t fall asleep - DenTek at least let me catch some ZZZs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to be sure, DenTek&#x27;s adjustment part is shoddy as heck, i don&#x27;t know how that is supposed to work. i need them at the shortest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, better than the bulky plastic mouth guards. minus a couple of stars for their problems adjusting and lack of staying power.</li>
            <li> It is quite comfortable and as good as any mouth-guard that I have tried.</li>
            <li> This was to small to work, I gnashed my teeth anyway! I had to buy another one</li>
            <li> I had a $550 custom guard from my former dentist that split in two after 3 years.  I tried DenTek&#x27;s boil-and-form guard, but it was like sleeping with a hockey puck in my mouth and it never stayed in place...I wound up waking up feeling worse than when I woke up.  This product is simple to use and very effective.  I honestly barely knew it was there; I am hooked!</li>
            <li> These would not secure to my teeth at all, and wouldn&#x27;t even stay in while I was awake when trying them out. No luck at all while sleeping. I followed the instructions precisely and was very disappointed. I took them up on their guarantee and returned the product to the CVS where I bought it.</li>
            <li> My husband found this so uncomfortable to sleep in that we tossed it after one use. We liked the idea that it doesn&#x27;t require melting plastic to mold it to your mouth, but this is one is clearly not one size fits all. It is slightly adjustable but he was still unable to find any comfort.</li>
            <li> i love these as they are not bulky but serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a splint to help with the jaw soreness I&#x27;ve been having during the day.  I&#x27;ve heard if you wear one while you sleep, it helps.  This dental guard is flimsy and awkward and I have no idea what position is best for my alignment/jaw.  I found that I&#x27;ve had more, not less, soreness during the day since I started wearing this at night.  Needless to say, it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to sleep on your side with the dental guard in there. I can&#x27;t use it every night as I need to get some sleep.</li>
            <li> The worst of the worst.  I&#x27;ve been using all types of \\&quot;nite-guards\\&quot; for years and have yet to find the most comfortable and longest lasting.  This was the last model I tried and when I woke after the first night of using it, it was not to be found.  I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d swallowed it because it doesn&#x27;t stay in place well in the mouth and between the top and bottom teeth.  After a search of the bed and floor underneath I saw that it was in small pieces in my dogs bed.  Seems it had fallen out of my mouth on to the floor and she had been chewing on it.  Stay away from this product because you could choke on it.  If I could give it negative stars I would have.</li>
            <li> I needed to get a guard as I was really starting to tear up my cheeks to the point where I was taking out little chunks. I have tried the full guards and they were really uncomfortable to sleep with. I have worn these every night for a week now and they are extremely comfortable. It actually feels nice to have the light elevation on the jaw. My roommate has also commented that he can no longer hear me snore at all. You can tell that the two rubber pieces really take a beating through the night but they have not shown any sign of falling apart or wearing out, just teeth marks.</li>
            <li> Most comfortable dental guard I&#x27;ve used, and a good price for two.  I&#x27;ve just barely worn out my first guard after 2 months but I&#x27;m a heavy clencher during sleep.  Good to know these can last.</li>
            <li> Amazon provided efficient service and offered an item I have used for several years but is no longer available at local stores in my area. The DenTek appliance has proved to be a reliable, effective, and affordable oral appliance. It has effectively prevented damage to my teeth that previously occurred due to grinding while sleeping.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the same product, down to the correct UPC code.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and a strong gag reflex so the thought of trying to sleep with something in my mouth to prevent me from grinding my teeth was truely repulsive. Equally repulsive was the cost of that something. On the other hand, I knew I had to do something to protect my teeth. After a lot of research, I chose the Dentek Comfort Fit Dental Guard and I am so glad that I did. It is not huge and fits comfortably. Once it is in you hardly even notice that it is there. I took it to my dentist on my next visit thinking that he won&#x27;t like it because he could have done better with a custom design by him, but when he looked at it he actually approved it. It has worked well and is infinately cheaper. You get two of them in the package but my first set did not come with a case to put them in and I ended up loosing them when I was traveling. They do include a case for them now, which is great. I look forward to using this set for sometime to come now that they have a home. Should I need to replace them for any reason, I will do so happily because I would have to have purchased 10 sets of these to equal one made by the dentist. Good things do come in small packages.</li>
            <li> I left my custom nightguard at my boyfriend&#x27;s house, and I needed a cheap replacement until I saw him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;- Does the job: I don&#x27;t know if it prevents me from grinding, but it definitely keeps my teeth from touching and filing each other down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- I agree with other reviewers - it&#x27;s actually more comfortable to wear it over the top teeth.  When I wear it over my bottom teeth as directed, it digs into my gums at the back of my mouth, even when I move it to the smallest setting.&lt;br /&gt;- Since it doesn&#x27;t sit tightly like a custom nightguard, I think that I subconsciously clench my jaw to keep it in place. Kind of uncomfortable when I realize I&#x27;m doing it.  This is the major con for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s good overall, but I definitely prefer my custom one!</li>
            <li> When I first got the product, I was pretty unimpressed. It is kind of flimsy in a way that doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence, and I was afraid that I might swallow it. Well, when you wake up after a night with these things in your mouth, you realize that they stay in place just fine since you are buying the product b/c you clench your mouth at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the boil grind guard, it simply feels less...disgusting...overall, because it is so much smaller there isn&#x27;t as much room for bacteria to proliferate. Also, my teeth and gums do not feel as sore as when I wear the boil guard. It seems that this design ensures that pressure is put on the very back teeth, while the boil ones end up having pressure being put a little further up on the mid teeth.</li>
            <li> I am a female and the mouth guard fits great.  The problem it is made so cheaply.  I broke through the plastic the second nite.  I felt ripped off.  I thought it should have made it through the first week...  If they made it with better stronger plastic this would be a great guard.  I clench my teeth so hard I broke a molar.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Dental Hygiene Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard Kit for years and decided to take a look at this one out of curiosity. Well, I sent it back and ordered my old standby. This is just awful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s low profile enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like its suffocating me during the night. It has a tendency to rub sore spots on the gums, but that goes away with use. Much better than the $200 acrylic guard my dentist made for me.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good dental guard.  I don&#x27;t have much to compare it with since its my first one.  But I can say that it prevents me from grinding, it comes with two sizes and a case.  I did have a little bit of a sore jaw the first few nights after using it, but I am now used to it.  I do get an imprint on the inside of my mouth from it in the morning, and it gives me the sesation of wanteding to create suction in my mouth which is kindof weird.  It was a little pricey - but im happy with the buy.</li>
            <li> this is a good product....fits in my mouth well and there were two (blue) guards in the box with a one year warranty.  but I wanted something for TMJ disorder...my jaw hurts and my neck hurts....says right on the box do not use for TMJ disorder.&lt;br /&gt;Heard of the VA scandal?  I got a cortisone injection for bursitis in my shoulder joint and when I told the ortho doctor that my jaw clicked, HE OFFERED TO TAKE MY JAW OFF!</li>
            <li> Great fit! This is the second box i bought and i love it. Ive tried other brands before and they were too big and bulky and made me gag. But these are way better because they are small and fit perfectly on upper or lower, whichever is your preference. No more headaches or tmj pain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mouth guards and i like this one because of the smaller size. I have found that most of the mouth guards are so large they trigger a gag reflex and this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard left sores in my mouth and had my jaw hurting more than before I wore the guard. I would never purchase another of these items, or anything like it for that matter. If you need a mouth guard for TMJ, get one from your dentist so they can properly fit you and help you along the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dental guards. This is my favorite. I&#x27;ve bought several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to clean it every morning. I move the adjustable part in and out when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I feel like the price is a little too high.</li>
            <li> I needed a new mouthguard as my old one was lost.  This one seemed easy to wear and I didn&#x27;t sound too stupid when I talked with it in my mouth, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bruxism or teeth grinding has never been a major issue.  It&#x27;s never caused me pain or medical issues, I just wear mouthguards to ensure I DON&#x27;T injur my jaw, teeth, or mouth.  The grinding can also be pretty loud, which my partner doesn&#x27;t like.  And so, I wear a mouthguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after my first night trying this mouthguard out, I started experiencing some mild pain the next day.  If I opened my mouth a certain way, I could also feel the jaw pop out of place a bit.  As I said, this was a first for me.  Never had I experienced pain from grinding with or without wearing a mouthguard at night.  I noticed the pain was only on one side of my jaw and the pain got much worse over the course of the week.  By Friday, I had to visit a doctor as I couldn&#x27;t chew food without feeling like my jaw was being hit with an iron club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product caused me more problems than I started with.  I returned it to get my money back, but I am not being reimbursed for my doctor visits or the pain it caused me, which I&#x27;m a little PO&#x27;ed about.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Save yourself the trouble and look for another mouthguard.</li>
            <li> This one works better than the thicker one however both units tend to move your teeth so take care when using also this company needs  to make the product so that the adjustable band stays where you set it</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve worn. I have a tendency to clench my jaw while I sleep so I really didn&#x27;t want something that completely encased my teeth when all I needed was a spacer. This is the perfect solution! The first night I wore it I dreamt, multiple times, that I was eating food - only to find myself waking up and chewing on the mouth guard. Luckily I got over that, and the mouth guard survived! It&#x27;s easy to wear, easy to clean. You don&#x27;t have to mold anything. It&#x27;s perfect. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth in my sleep due to the uncomfortable retainer I have to wear at night. It is very hard to find a mouth guard that works over a retainer without stretching out your cheeks. The other grind guards I have worn only added to the discomfort of the retainer by adding pressure. This is the only one that fits without causing discomfort. I have been wearing these for a year now, and my teeth -- which are damaged from all the grinding -- have finally stopped grinding themselves away. It is low profile, so it grinds away more quickly than other dental guards, so expect to replace it more frequently. But it&#x27;s also relatively cheap and for me it&#x27;s the only one that works, so I love this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a week. it wouldn&#x27;t stay put. It stayed in my mouth but it didn&#x27;t stay in place over my teeth. Several times the flesh on the side of my mouth wound up being pinched. Not sure how but I woke up in paid like I was bitting the side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> No bulk! It&#x27;s great!!! A bit pricey though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Den Tek for about a month and it has significantly helped with my severe sleep apnea. I have an overly large tongue which relaxes during REM sleep and blocks my narrow airway. By using the Den Tek, my tongue has more room and I am prevented from clenching down which forces my tongue to the back of my mouth, making it likely it will relax and block my throat. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Den Tek. Also note that I use the Den Tek while using the cpap. I also use a nasal pillow mask. It&#x27;s all worth it to feel good in the morning and throughout the day. I&#x27;m tempted to stockpile these guards.</li>
            <li> It worked quite well, for the problem of clamping my teeth too much, but after a while my teeth were kind of uncomfortable, it may be my own particular problem and not the fault of the kit.</li>
            <li> I used to *love* this mouth guard for years- when it only had one ridge (covering just the side of the bottom teeth &amp; in between top &amp; bottom teeth). This was the ONLY mouth guard that fit in my mouth that was comfortable (due to bone growth). This was even better then the custom mouthguard my dentist made for me. I didn&#x27;t care that I had to buy a box every month and a half (not saying that the guard doesn&#x27;t last, I just grind my teeth so badly I went thru a custom fit guard that was supposed to last a year in less than 5 months). Then DenTek changed the design to add another ridge/wing, maybe 3-5 months ago, (now there&#x27;s plastic covering both the sides of upper &amp; lower teeth &amp; in-between top &amp; bottom) and it is now just like every other mouthguard that I&#x27;ve tried before - uncomfortable and pushing into my gums, causing sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sad that they made this change - it&#x27;s been difficult to find a small comfortable mouth guard for bruxism during sleep. If you don&#x27;t have an unusual jaw (for example, m.tori), then you will most likely be okay with the new design. But if you have problems like me, then this will no longer be comfortable at all. I am so disappointed that they are now like everyone else in mouthguard design in adding that 3rd plastic part (T- instead of L-shaped) because this was the smallest guard I could find. I really hope DenTek will take notice and redesign their mouth guard.</li>
            <li> My husband had asked me repeatedly to look into a mouth guard because I woke him up often when I ground my teeth in my sleep. I bought the DenTek Comfort Fit NightGuard primarily because it did not require any boiling. Just rinse under hot water and insert into the mouth. I have tried this product for a week now and I now know just how hard I grind my teeth. After only the first night, the bite pads had dents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouth guard fits comfortably around my lower jaw. It does not bite into the gums and I can close my mouth comfortably around it. I&#x27;ve managed to spit it out in my sleep twice - both times I woke up in the morning and found it under me. LOL. But it&#x27;s a good product. The husband told me last night he&#x27;s not heard the awful grinding sound ever since I started using this. My gums also don&#x27;t feel swollen the way they used to. I would recommend this to anyone looking for their first mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on Oct 7, 2010: I have given up on this mouth guard. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product at all. It works great, but for some reason, I keep spitting out in the middle of the night. I woke up every morning finding it either on the floor or under me. I may try it again in the future, but for now, the guards have been washed and put away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item. I&#x27;ve had some fractured teeth and my dentist wants me to spend $700 in guards.  This will do the trick.  It fits easily in the mouth.  I have no concern about swallowing it.  It stayed in place and didn&#x27;t wake me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so much smaller than the other guards that I&#x27;ve used and allows for movement of the jaws.  My understanding is that the molded guards will hold the teeth in place and actually set your jaw out of alignment.  This one seems to keep that from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so comfortable.  I placed mine on the upper teeth since it felt more comfortable and it barely looks like I have anything in.  The product is adjustable and easy to use.  I&#x27;ll probably read the directions soon just in case there is something I don&#x27;t know.  Also, since there isn&#x27;t much to it, I feel like it is easier to clean and just cleaner in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to skip some nights from wearing a guard.  Not anymore.  This one is comfortable enough to keep in.</li>
            <li> I lost my \\&quot;boiled\\&quot; night guard on vacation and found one of these in a drug store.  It is the most awesome night guard - barely know it&#x27;s in my mouth and almost never wake up with it missing!</li>
            <li> Love these! I suffer from grinding my teeth really bad and I hate the traditional bulky mouth pieces! I will definitely purchase more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> I need a guard and can&#x27;t afford a real one so I thought this would do. It does not stay in your mouth while sleeping.</li>
            <li> The size is good for small to medium mouth. It fits nicely and very flexible. easy to sleep. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product was uncomfortable and incredibly flimsy. I felt like it was going to come apart and I&#x27;d choke on it. It also had these little nobs that just irritated my gums. I didn&#x27;t even want to risk using it for one night because I didn&#x27;t want to wake up having swallowed part of it. I&#x27;d recommend just getting one of the ones you have to boil. It&#x27;s not sexy, but at least it works!</li>
            <li> I wanted the product advertised on the package. What was shipped was a redesigned product which is not at all comfortable due to its larger and thicker size. This redesign has led to worse problems. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard is by far the easiest guard to use.  You open the package and use it, no boiling, and it stays in place.  It is surprising how small and comfortable it is, and works like a charm.  They last a very long time, they&#x27;re adjustable, and two to a package.  Great value!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a week now. It really helps to reduce the morning after pain of the grinding. I sometimes used to wake myself up due to excessive grinding. Now that&#x27;s over, too. I really can&#x27;t find a downside to this product at the moment. Flexible enough and not bulky at all...</li>
            <li> This is the smallest night guard I&#x27;ve tried but it works very well. It stays in place perfectly, aligns your jaw and protects your teeth wonderfully.  I&#x27;ve chewed through expensive hard plastic night guards provided by my dentist but this little guy is holding up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get a bit of irritation on the inside of my cheek but that may be because of something I do when sleeping, not the fault of the guard.</li>
            <li> The old version worked great.  Had no issues with them so when I popped in the last one in the package I decided to reorder them.  Well, I just started using these and they make my mouth hurt all the time now.  The pad doesn&#x27;t cover my teeth completely inward, and it pinches my gums.  Unless the company brings back the old version then they have lost my business forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many mouth guards in the past, and they always last about a month before they delaminate.  I&#x27;m on my first Dentek guard and it is going strong, about a year later.  Very comfortable, doesn&#x27;t rearrange my teeth, and lasts forever.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I have pretty terrible bruxism evident by headaches in the morning, sore jaw, worn teeth and my g/f waking me up in the middle of the night because the sound of my grinding teeth woke her up. Decided I finally needed to get a night guard but didn&#x27;t want to spend the 500$ at the dentist office for the customs. This is first night guard I tried after doing a bit of research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard fit well although I did have some slight pinching along my gums. Didn&#x27;t bother me enough to not wear them. Seemed to work as intended the first few nights but the wear was pretty evident after only 1 night. Fast forward 2 weeks and I have completely destroyed all of them. What seems to happen is they become dislodged and I proceed to chomp on them throughout the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have minor or infrequent grinding, I think this would be a good product, however, I also feel its a little pricey for what it is. For people with moderate to severe grinding, I say go with the customs from the dentists. Ended up doing that myself and its really the only long term solution.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than the boil guards that cover top teeth. I love the ease of use however the guard rubs my lower gums at night. I have gotten little blisters from it. I had to switch to the 2nd guard in the box to prevent the rubbing. It seems like the shock absorbing part you bite down on, got worn out within a week which causes it to sit lower on gums once it&#x27;s been &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase this product again. I prefer the disposables as they have a better fit for my mouth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me at all--was very uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t reduce my jaw pain.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable - great fit.  I can easily wear this all through the night without any discomfort or irritation.</li>
            <li> Oops sorry didn&#x27;t mean to review this one. Wrong item.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the smallest, least instrusive mouth guarf and thought this would be good. It wasnt. The bitting pad is the only good thing about it, although the 1st one had to be replaced by the 4th night. The 2nd one has lasted much longer. It&#x27;s pretty thick and withstands hard bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the design itself is not so good. It leaves sharp edges along the blue pads, which in turn leaves cuts and marks on my gums. And it hurts pretty badly. But since I grind my teeth too much and did not have a backup piece, I had to use a lighter to soften the pads and gently rub the sharp edges down. I&#x27;m pretty sure that this voids warranty or what not so I&#x27;m not going to bother with a refund or anything. I just ordered disposable ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this if you grind hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add pictures later.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good thought, especially beings that is isn&#x27;t very bulky, but it totally didn&#x27;t work for me at all. This is the first time I have ever tried something like this, so I will use it as a learning experience and probably, unfortunately will have to have one custom made. This one is very tiny and really didn&#x27;t fit my mouth, even with the adjustments. I still tried it even though it really didn&#x27;t fit, and as I expected it was laying in the bed that next morning. Unfortunately, waste of money for me and it came as a 2 pack so I have another one and a case that will never be touched. As I said, learning experience. Really don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Better than expensive fitted guards</li>
            <li> I bought this locally at Target and was very content for the first few nights. After a while I noticed sore spots when putting the guard in at night where it rubs my gums, mostly in the rear. I tried upper and lower positions but the rubbing was too painful. I took a razor blade and modified the guard to fit a bit better by trimming off some of the lower most plastic off. This is tricky because the adjustment slide is seated through this area. Trim too much and the slide will pop out ruining the guard. While trimming the guard down some did improve my particular problem, it wasn&#x27;t enough. I&#x27;m now alternating nights with and without the guard because it hurts too much. I think I will be trying the SleepRight product next. I just need something that won&#x27;t touch my gums!!</li>
            <li> Good:  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years.  I chose it as an affordable alternative to the dentist&#x27;s custom guard.  I could not sleep with the full mouth devices I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, they made me gag and drool and uncomfortable with my mouth closed.  This does not cause me to gag and my mouth closes comfortably.  I really like the small connector in the front - it&#x27;s so much more comfortable than the ones that cover all your teeth. This does the job and protects my teeth, and given the price, I&#x27;ll take the negatives and save my $500.  It&#x27;s also fairly durable; the one i bought came with two guards.  I have been using the same one regularly for about 18 months and while it&#x27;s showing signs of wear, it&#x27;s still holding up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so good: I have a small mouth and small teeth. This mouthguard is adjustable, but even the smallest setting is still just a tad to big for my mouth. The back part rubs on my gums, causing them to be slightly swollen the next morning. Sometimes, when they get really sore, I&#x27;ll wear this on my top teeth instead to give them a little break (it&#x27;s not made to fit your top teeth, but it will work). It should be noted that this device will allow you to still grind and clench your teeth - it just provides a cushion in between to protect your teeth and alleviate the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I will buy this product again, but I wish they made a smaller version or even a child&#x27;s version.  A smaller guard would eliminate all my dislikes for this product.</li>
            <li> Love that it is adjustable. Only downside is that it keeps my teeth apart a bit too much &amp; makes my jaw sore in the morning but that feeling does wear off after a while.</li>
            <li> If, like me, you think no human being should have to fall asleep with some nasty plastic thing in their mouth, but you&#x27;re tired of shattering your teeth, then this is your mouth guard!!!  It&#x27;s small, light, and comfortable.  This is the only one out there that doesn&#x27;t make you feel like the dentist left their bite-wing x-ray in your mouth!  Just try it.  You actually get two in the package.  The description fails to mention that.  This type does eventually mold to the shape of your teeth, making it so comfy but that also means it doesn&#x27;t last as long.  But I&#x27;d rather replace this one every few months than try and sleep with those other medieval torture devices!  Wow, what a concept...I can close my mouth, not drool like a creepy old man, and not choke to death on a device that is supposed to be helping me.  $30 isn&#x27;t pocket change, but if you end up liking this one, you&#x27;ll be so glad you tried it.  And if not, they&#x27;ll make lovely Christmas tree ornaments!!</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped but I have noticed that it catches on the side of my mouth sometimes and wakes me up.</li>
            <li> it is prone to fall out of place during sleep.  When this happened, my teeth crushed the guard and permanently deformed it.  Lasted about 1 month until is was no longer usable.</li>
            <li> I have previously used the earlier version of this night guard, and it was okay. I like this newer model much more.&lt;br /&gt;First, I have a small mouth, and get a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I appreciate the blue pads, since I would put down the older one, and not be able to find it, because it was all clear material.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the strap is thinner, and the fit is much closer to my teeth. The pads are thinner, which is the only negative about this guard, but it does not cause any problems in the positioning of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it on my upper teeth, where it is very secure, as opposed to the lower, where it can rub against the gum.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these again if needed, because I alternate them with a custom made, hard acrylic night guard,&lt;br /&gt;They are approved by my dentist, who said there is no difference in what they accomplish...it is simply a matter of preference.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to alleviate some TMJ pain associated with clencing. I really liked the material the bitewings were made of because they were on the softer side and did not bang against my teeth, causing pain throughout the night. The bitewings do rub against the side of my mouth and from time to time will cause a little soreness.  It&#x27;s important to know that the front band connecting the two bitewings is flexible (in the picture you see I am bending it), which allows for some movement compared to other mouthguards.  I had some issues with the fit of this mouth guard because of this flexibility and when I contacted the company they were more than happy to resolve my problems and send replacements. Keep your receipt and the box with proof of purchase and the contact information comes with the product if you are not pleased with the dental guard.  I have been fitted by professional dentist with other TMJ splints, none of which are as comfortable as this Dentek. If you have TMJ pain from grinding or clenching, you should give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I was at first pleased by the positive reviews that I&#x27;d seen of this dental guard. And truly, when I received the two-pack and inspected the product, I thought it a pretty wise buy. I adjusted one of the mouthguards to fit onto my lower teeth comfortably, and that night I was sleeping sound. The material was comfortable and I barely felt the guard in my mouth, unlike other more obtrusive guards I had tried. The material is a very flexible plastic, if you were to pick it up by the narrow center band you would find the guard drooping lazily between your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night, I slept nearly the entire night with the guard in, and only did I briefly wake in the early morning to remove it from my mouth, as after a few hours even something so small and comfortable can begin to irritate. I chalked this up to being unaccustomed to wearing the device and looked forward to my next night of wearing it, knowing I&#x27;d be protecting my chompers against future tooth wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the second night that was the trouble. I put it in just fine when I went to bed and went to sleep, nothing out of the ordinary so far. I awoke, however, in the wee hours of the night, to find there was no guard in my mouth at all. I had originally thought I had just spat it out in my sleep, but as I searched though the bedsheets, my husband awoke to inform me that I&#x27;d been choking on something earlier. I at first expressed displeasure in knowing he witnessed me choking in my sleep and did nothing to assist, but he assured me that it was a fairly brief matter with about thirty seconds of coughing and sputtering before the sounds subsided and I was swept back into a peaceful slumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept searching through the bedsheets, on the floor. Surely this couldn&#x27;t have been true. Could I have swallowed the thing? As I turned up with nothing, and thought about the description of the choking episode I had earlier in the evening, I was far less pleased with the purchase of this mouthguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband and I inspected the other mouthguard that had been contained in the two-pack, trying to determine exactly how much trouble I&#x27;d be in by gulping it down my hatch. The plastic can actually be twisted and compacted into a space smaller than a quarter, and the guard does not have any metal components or nasty snags, even if you pull the two larger blue plastic pieces off. We decided against a trip to urgent care and decided to simply... let it pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some weird digestion pains for a couple of days, but other than that I am none worse for wear. The mouth guard eventually ended up where it needed to be, the very place where I should have put it right when I bought it: flushed down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this mouthguard seems quite comfortable and effective at its designed purpose. But I have to subtract copious stars here, because it can only do that if it stays in your mouth, and out of your digestional tract.guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband and I inspected the other mouthguard that had been contained in the two-pack, trying to determine exactly how much trouble I&#x27;d be in by gulping it down my hatch.

            <li> The product works ok, but is not very long lasting. If you really grind your teeth these will not last you for more than 6 month. On the plus side they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The teeth grips scrape your gums and it slips out very easily. I woke up many a nights with it out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> This guard is comfortable and fits nicely.  It is not bulky and doesn&#x27;t affect the other teeth such as some others do when it is a full mouth guard and not just for back teeth.</li>
            <li> I believe this product may have been responsible for ruining a composite crown. I had only been using it for a couple of weeks when the problem was discovered during a dental cleaning. I noticed after the first use that the dentek had stuck to this same crown. Also there&#x27;s a warning on the material inside the packaging not to use it with dental implants. This information needs to be on the outside of the package. When I called the 800 number to inquire about this, the answerer assured me it was OK to use with an implant. When I asked why it stated the opposite on the package insert she didn&#x27;t have a good answer. I should have known from that not to trust this product.</li>
            <li> We got this to help with grinding and clenching teeth at night.  It seems to do the job, but it&#x27;s not as comfortable as the custom fit ones.  If you&#x27;re looking for something comfortable to wear at night, this is not it, but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative that is designed to do what its supposed to, this is a good choice.  It&#x27;s adjustable to fit just about any mouth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t say bad things to my husband when he&#x27;s sleeping now.  I finally sleep all through the night.  He says it fits pretty good but really he&#x27;s just happy when mama is happy.  I give him five stars too.</li>
            <li> I initially liked the design concept, but I found the plastic crossbar contacts the lower teeth. In my case, it was pushing my teeth out of alignment; so I stopped using it. Then I tried the &amp;#34;Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More Dental Night Protector&amp;#34;. It uses a similar bite pad design, but the crossbar does not contact my teeth; so there&#x27;s no worry about teeth shifting.</li>
            <li> I have used this item several nights now and like its low profile and fit of it. It is more comfortable then others I have used. Seems to put less pressure on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Does not stay in place and hurts the gum.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but after several trie with this guard, I gave up. It made my jaw sore the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 08/05/15&lt;br /&gt;I gave the second set to my wife to try. So far, she uses them every night without complaint! So, moral is, it may or may not work for you, but worth a try! I&#x27;ve upgraded my previous 2 stars to 3!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the least invasive, however it would not stay in place and the parts you &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; down on are like rocks!  I got 2 in the package and my sister tried the other one and agreed they were horrible.  Wish I could get my money back, don&#x27;t waste yours on this one!</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised. It is convenient to use. Having only just started using it, I cannot comment on durability but the package does come with two bite guards and the warranty does state that they will last six months each or you can contact the manufacturer for a refund.</li>
            <li> No boil convenience, barely notice there is something in my mouth with these.  The only downside is that the softness that makes them so un-annoying also means that a vigorous tooth grinder (like me) can grind through one of these in a few months.  And my cat really like chewing on them if left out and reachable....so I have to keep order more.  *sigh*  Good thing they come in double packs!</li>
            <li> I have not found a mouth anti-grind guard that does not make my teeth feel like that have been misaligned. Are they all like that unless you get them from the dentist? I do like the smaller size of this, as it does not make you feel like gagging, but I woke up this morning and my teeth had been moved a little and my bite was off. It goes back to normal, but can that be good for your teeth? Night after night will that cause just as much trouble as grinding, which in my case is causing sensitivity according to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Like this product but too expensive. It is plastic, after all, and doesn&#x27;t last.  My son was going through on every two weeks or so.  We purchased Plackers Grind No More disposable ones and it is a better deal, overall.</li>
            <li> This dental guard did not work for me. It was uncomfortable on my gums and my left gum would actually be very tender in the morning after I used it.  I contacted the manufacturer to get a refund. Hopefully I will receive it. On my search for another dental guard that is of softer material and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> These work really well, but they do not last as long as suggested on the packaging.  They are very comfortable.  They wear quickly. So I find myself buying the more often than I would like. I guess I will continue to use until a better product is created. This particular package comes with cleaning powder, which is cool.  Although soap and water work well, and I soak in mouthwash on a regular basis too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, and these are the best!</li>
            <li> OK, so I grind my teeth at night!! I have spent a lot more money buying the mouth guard that covers your teeth completely and they never last.  Plus, for those of you that have to wear mouth guards at night, if you wear the full mouth guard you drool!!!!  These mouth guards stay in place way better then I had hoped, they cover the upper back molars and are just enough to protect your teeth when they come together.  The guards also last great.  This is a great product and much cheaper then the typical dental guards.</li>
            <li> This is a nice guard that can be sized to fit your mouth.  It guards where needed and does not cover all your teeth. It is the most comfortable store bought guard I have used. My mouth is small and the guards that you &#x27;melt&#x27; in a pot of boiling water and then mold to your mouth are uncomfortable and too big.  The price here is much better than in the pharmacy!</li>
            <li> People with grinding problems like myself oftentimes bite down hard while sleeping.  As a result my nerve below my teeth has been bothering me for days.  I may end up with root canal.  This is a terrible device and a terrible design. I should have thought about it before.  It puts all the pressure on one molar on other either side of your mouth. I&#x27;m going to try the biogrind device next.  Surely there must be something that works.  This Dentek device is a nightmare!</li>
            <li> As a dental professional, I make a point to try different products to recommend to my patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a week, I cannot recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after the first couple of nights wearing it that I had TMJ pain and soreness when my teeth touched together (which lingered for about an hour after waking up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the week it was very uncomfortable and I knew it was not something I could just get \\&quot;used to.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t notice it too much in my mouth- kind of like the feel of wearing a retainer, and you&#x27;ll forget it is there before you fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is too thick (AKA, the top teeth and the bottom teeth are too far apart upon biting down).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TMJ has a natural \\&quot;resting\\&quot; point that is comfortable for your jaw. It is basically the position your mouth is in 95% of the day- relaxed, slightly open (teeth not touching!). This product is NOT a \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot;, rather, it fits SOME people correctly, but chancing that it will fit you is throwing $30 out the window, if you ask me. If your TMJ is forced to bite down on something too wide, it WILL GRIND down to find that natural \\&quot;resting\\&quot; spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of different causes to grinding/clenching, but stress is probably the #1 reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO want to stress the importance of preventing the grinding of your natural teeth. You only get one set of permanent teeth, and if you let the grinding continue, you are just asking for your teeth to chip, crack, appear unnatural and unnattractive (if grinding occurs on your front teeth), and expensive dental bills to fix your teeth with crowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you truly suffer from grinding, clenching, or TMJ problems, the best solution for you is a mouth guard that is molded professionally to your teeth. Fitted by a dentist. This is the only way you can ensure that it has the best chance of working for your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you DO happen to find an OTC night guard that works for you, I would say it is ok to keep using it if:&lt;br /&gt;1) It fits comfortably in your mouth&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t cause pain/soreness in your jaw or when you tap your teeth together&lt;br /&gt;3) You replace it as recommendedd an OTC night guard that works for you, I would say it is ok to keep using it if:&lt;br /&gt;1) It fits comfortably in your mouth&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t cause pain/soreness in your jaw or when you tap your teeth together&lt;br /&gt;3) You replace it as recommended</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, I have used it before and it&#x27;s the best fitting tooth guard I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I bought this about 4 years ago and it still works great. I&#x27;ve actually been using the same pack. I&#x27;m going to be re-ordering another one soon because I lost one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I like this mouth guard is that it&#x27;s flexible and you can adjust the sides to fit into your mouth. I have a serious grinding problem, I&#x27;ve broke two tooth&#x27;s from grinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are a lot sharper now. Grinding was making my teeth very flat and jagged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have this on, nobody can hear me grinding. I can tell I have been grinding because there are marks on the plastic, but it hasn&#x27;t torn through yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to rinse it so that the saliva doesn&#x27;t dry and make it gross. I try to give it a good cleaning every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been in pain once with this product. But it all depends on how big your mouth is and how spaced out your teeth are.</li>
            <li> I have used these in the past.  I like the case and happy to have an extra one on hand!</li>
            <li> For me, i prefer the boil to custom fit type guards. Easier to speak, and stays in place better. The wire in middle is funny and harder to swallow than other types. The pads doseem durable though.</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as the original one that I ordered.  It has &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; that I had to modify.</li>
            <li> The part that goes across your teeth sticks out too far and presses against your tongue. It&#x27;s uncomfortable at first, but after sleeping all night with it your tongue hurts in the morning. Like sleeping on a marble would hurt your back.</li>
            <li> After reading some horror stories on this product&#x27;s review here, I was skeptical about the product but thought I&#x27;d give it a try as this is a much better deal than what my rip-off dentist quoted me for a mouth guard ($1,250). People discussed that the one with blue guard was the better design, mine came in blue. After the first night, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, it&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing in the world, but I slept pretty soundly and without any mishaps. I felt I was clenching down at times like I usually do during my sleep, but with the guard there, I could feel that my teeth were safe from grinding with each other. I&#x27;ve been having my teeth chip here and there and it feels good to know that I&#x27;m taking some measures and protecting my teeth. Until I come up with a better solution (perhaps a more honest dentist and better insurance), I&#x27;m glad I found what works for the time being. When I first had it in, I thought it would be pretty tough to spit it out during sleep as it felt pretty securely placed. But just as some people have said in their reviews, I had my boyfriend try on the other piece and he woke up telling me he lost it some time during the night and went on a scavenger hunt for it under the covers. I thought it was strange but it surely happens it seems. We&#x27;ll try adjusting his levels and see if it works better. All in all, I&#x27;m a pretty happy customer!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my girlfriend since she suffered from teeth grinding . Her pain is gone. This really helped her. Cleaning it is not hard just clean it as if it was your own teeth. The material is very soft.</li>
            <li> Just be aware when I used this dental guard for one night it threw my bite off for days so I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> The smallest setting was a bit to large for my mouth, however it was useable and comfortable. It&#x27;s very lightweight ans slim.  I can see that it would idel  for most people who need a dental guard. It&#x27;s priced right and comes with two gaurds and a storage case. The price and design make it a good place to start if you are looking for a dental guard.</li>
            <li> I recently chipped a tooth (!!) and my dentist said it was due to grinding my teeth at night and she recommended I get a dental guard to wear while sleeping. I picked this one up and have been pretty happy with it so far. It&#x27;s minimally invasive and easy to fit. It is soft and pliable in my mouth so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m crunching into a hard piece of plastic when I grind at night. Still, it seems pretty durable. Sometimes I wake up and I&#x27;m chewing it! But I don&#x27;t seem to have damaged it at all and I&#x27;ve never been afraid of swallowing it. It makes my bite feel a little strange in the morning when I take it out which is my only real complaint. It goes away after a little while, though. I&#x27;ve noticed my headaches have been decreasing so this thing really is working for me. And hopefully no more chipped teeth!</li>
            <li> Great delivery, fair price.</li>
            <li> Works very good. Its comfortable and small.</li>
            <li> Perfectly fits my needs and I don&#x27;t have to spend 300.00 at the dentist to have something designed/molded for my mouth.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by a friend after my teenaged daughter tried several types of dental guards. My daughter has braces and has started to grind her teeth at night causing her a lot of pain. Other guards were anywhere from bulky to down right painful. The DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard for her is extremely comfortable, not bulky at all, easy to use and wear, adjustable, no boiling-to-fit needed, and doesn&#x27;t interfere with her braces at all. Best of all she&#x27;s not grinding her teeth at night therefore she&#x27;s not in pain in the morning. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this dental guard for my husband. He now wears it every night and said it&#x27;s very comfortable. It was nice that it came with a case too!</li>
            <li> they did not issue warnings on amazon site in description. i have TMJ and am getting a dental implant in the next month or so, and did not want to invest in $500 mouth guard from dentist until after the surgery. i thought this would be a good interim substitute. nope! warnings include not to use if you have missing teeth, TMJ, loose fillings, caps, receding gums, periodontal disease, etc, etc. . . .</li>
            <li> First off, I hate having to wear a dental guard!  I do not suffer from bruxism, but I do clench which leads to gum recession.  My dentist wanted around $400 for a dental guard.  I ordered these (there are two in package) with the thought that they would not work or I would destroy them (I have bit through other ones) and not wear them.  I was so wrong!  First of all, no hot water.  Secondly, I will not go to sleep without them.  They are comfortable for me, I have adjusted them for my mouth.  The plastic shows no sign of wear where I bite down - pretty amazing!  Even more amazing is the fact that I can see slight improvement in my gum recession.  I will try to update after I see the dentist in May.</li>
            <li> Better than the whole mouth ones (my opinion)  can still talk with it in</li>
            <li> My other half and I absolutely LOVE these!  I&#x27;ve been using them every night for more than 6 years and vastly prefer them to any other brands I&#x27;ve tried and to the ones that the dentist has custom-made for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning, I rinse with hot water and mouthwash and only have to replace about every 6 months.  I grind my teeth pretty badly, though, so others&#x27; may last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do adjust themselves a bit during the night, but there&#x27;s NEVER been a danger of me swallowing one...  Maybe because I clamped down on them all night with my grinding, though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Seems to be built of durable plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Good price - 2 included in box.&lt;br /&gt;I use a file to shape-so it doesn&#x27;t push on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Decent product for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this type of device, try this one for size (adjustable).</li>
            <li> I purchased these for some relief from the pain I was getting from grinding my teeth. I chose this guard because it was less cumbersome in my mouth than others seemed to be.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I found some relief from jaw pain with this guard. Each morning when I woke up, I noticed that my bite was different for the first few minutes after taking it out. After a two months of use (Which the dental guard didn&#x27;t hold up well by the way- I doubt it would have lasted another month), my bite had significantly changed after each night and would take hours to return to normal. I had greater pain in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;I talked to my dentist and they recommended I get a different bite tray that would actually spread the impact of my grinding- because this guard was causing my grinding to be restricted to my molars and causing all of that new jaw pain.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am using heat and massage on my jaw to relieve pain and I am planning on buying a new night guard that will not cause me long term problems.</li>
            <li> This an adjustable and I tried every combination but could not get the guard to stay in place during the nite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a little over a week now and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  I&#x27;ve only used the boil mouth guards in the past and I hate them.  You end up waking up in the morning with a dry mouth feeling like you&#x27;ve had a stuffy nose all night because the guard keeps your mouth open.&lt;br /&gt;These are far, far better than that.  I have a very small mouth and small teeth so I was worried when I first purchased them that they wouldn&#x27;t fit.  It definitely fit, thanks to the ability to adjust them.  They keep your back teeth apart, which causes all of your teeth to stay apart.  They are fairly comfortable and don&#x27;t force your mouth open at night.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;ve found that is really a downfall of the product is that while yes, you can adjust them (each side has little nobs that you can pull/push to get it to fit your mouth) during the night, my mouth likes to readjust them apparently to a larger size.  I&#x27;ve woken up with the guard half out of my mouth, on my pillow, and last night I must have pulled it out in the middle of the night and it was sitting on its case on the bedside table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  They do their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another person that reviewed them here suggested you put them on upside down - so rather than having the thin piece that goes around your front teeth on the bottom, you have it going around them on top.  I think I&#x27;ll try that.  Maybe that will help.</li>
            <li> I love this mouth guard more than the ones my dentist has made!  Thin, comfortable (well...better than waking up with four broken teeth!!) and easy to get used to.  It also helped with my jaw and ear pain.  I love the adjustability so I can wear it on my top or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> This is SO CLOSE - but not quite there. I get the feeling they designed for a man size mouth. Edges a bit too sharp to be great. I would pay double for more finely honed plastic parts - smoother, more rounded, maybe some size choices. I really, really want this to win - the $500 &amp;#34;hockey puck&amp;#34; the dentists pushed on my was very unpleasant. As we age we do NOT need to add items to the bedtime ritual that make sleep even harder to come by. I was thrilled I was able to sleep thru the night with this device in place. Pls DenTek - keep trying to make this great - WE WILL BUY IT! :D</li>
            <li> If you really grind your teeth, this material is too thin and weak, get something stronger. This got misshapen by the first night i used it, and the pockets for the expansions are a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> I have an overbite so this doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It would have been nice to know this before I bought it and stuck it in my mouth because I can&#x27;t return it now.</li>
            <li> Used this for 3 days and it threw my jaw out of alignment. I quit using the guard and my jaw has been sore for 4 days since and feels like my jaw won&#x27;t shut correctly without pain. If this continues much longer I&#x27;m going to have to go to the doctor and see what happened because it is really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Best mouth guard, I tried 5.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no much else to say&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s adjustable&lt;br /&gt;Andddddd&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t fall out which is the MOST&lt;br /&gt;Important aspect&lt;br /&gt;And it feels good, compared to the rest</li>
            <li> Not as bulky as the boil mouth guards I have tried. This one is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> No more waking up to headaches!! My dentist makes a bite guard fod me for over $100 and insurance does not help. I grind so bad that I go through one every 6 months. This is comfortable, doesn&#x27;t require boiling, and it came with TWO! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I admit, I grind my teeth at night when I am stressed.  I have tried other mouth guards in the past but like these the best.  You don’t have to boil them or mold them.  And the thin strip in the front is so much more comfortable than thick plastic.  The only problem is I have trouble keeping them in the entire night.  This is not the products fault but my own.  You can purchase these in many places including Amazon.</li>
            <li> I almost spent $350.00 on a mouth guard from my dentist. I thought I would give this a try first. I am pretty impressed that it does the job. Took me one or two nights to get used to it, but I am overall satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I got the dental guard for my TMJ.  Although it&#x27;s adjustable, it was still too big for my mouth.  They seemed to rub a lot on the gums below my bottom front teeth.  My mouth is small and my teeth are crowded so maybe that makes a difference, comfort-wise.  This seemed to work for many others, so it is probably a good product...please just keep in mind that if you have a small mouth with a lot of crowding, perhaps this isn&#x27;t the most comfortable product to use.</li>
            <li> These guards work great and are not uncomfortable to use.  I have not tried any other guards, so can not compare them, but I am happy with these and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 4 months.  Just checked in with my dentist and he says that I have no more tooth damage due to grinding.  A very effective, inexpensive solution!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the DenTek Comfort-Fit Dental Guards for years because they were BPA free, lighter than other brands, and they didn&#x27;t irritate my gums or the side of the mouth. Unfortunately it looks like they recently changed the design... the plates that fit around the teeth are larger, causing them to jut into the sides of my mouth. After a few days, my cheeks were completely roughed up and I had to switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> I not only have a serious night grinding problem, but genetically weak / thin enamel to boot, so while I was in the market for a night guard, boil-able styles such as [[ASIN:B0036WTV2C The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced Comfort Dental Protector for Teeth Grinding, 1 pack]] were not only extremely uncomfortable (to the point where I would get blisters on my gums, and often spit the guard out in my sleep and would wake up to find it on the pillow next to me.) As my dentist explained to me, because of their large size and design in which they mold around all of the teeth, they inhibit the natural flow of saliva at night, which actually helps to prevent cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, this style of night guard is not only extremely comfortable - it is minimalist and gives just the right amount of protection; it&#x27;s also budget-friendly, easy to sterilize, transport, etc. Proof positive for me was when my dentist confirmed that I&#x27;d halted the toll that grinding was taking on my molars *and* that I wasn&#x27;t presenting with new cavities due to the dry nighttime environment that my previous night guard had been causing. I&#x27;ve found my night guard for life.</li>
            <li> Adjustable piece is nice, but tends to loosen after good night&#x27;s sleep and so it has to be readjusted every night before bed. Best of all, hubby and friends report that this has also &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; my snoring!</li>
            <li> In short, it&#x27;s too short but still a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product that does what it says, prevents nighttime teeth grinding. My only problem is that they don&#x27;t go back far enough. For people that still have &amp; grind their wisdom teeth (like myself) this prevents most night time grindings &amp; clenching but your wisdom teeth can still make contact from time to time. If this product could extended another quarter to half inch it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> DenTek t is much better than made by dentist - because it is also stopping the grinding (the design of DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit has a feature of touching the gum). The touching gum element is weaking the grinding.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never go to dentist for the Dental Guard - because the dentist is not helping with stopping grinding and the dentist is much more expensive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried many mouth guards that you put in hot water and they always fall out or misaligned my jaw.&lt;br /&gt;I have a bad habit of grinding my teeth and I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on and After adjusting it, it did fit. It took awhile for it to get to my body temp but it finaly stuck to my teeth. I was nervous sleeping with the product b/c I fet I&#x27;d choke on it since it was small. the first two nights I lost it and found it in the sheets. Paying [...] bucks for it I didnt want to lose it. I finally tied a string around the front and used a safety pin to attach the other end to my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;I woke up later that night and it was still in my mouth. When I took it out it did kinda hurt. I was sleeping on my side and pressure was set on the mouth piece that it hurt the side of my mouth when I removed it. The downside is that it can and will get lost and it being tiny you will lose it. Its also easy to misplace with its light colors. With my minor altercations of the roduct it has been working well. i dont wake up with head aches anymore from grinding my teeth away. &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;Im happy with it.</li>
            <li> i decided to buy these as a travel night guard instead of the one i had made from the dentist for several hundred dollars. i adjusted it per the directions and it fit fine. however, the night guard never stays in place. i always wake up with it somewhere in my bed, not in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I had never used mouth guards and this one is small and confortable. Bought the drs.night guard based on my dentist instructions and it was way to big. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I had been using a custom fit night guard that my dentist ordered back in 2005 that was custom fitted to my mouth. I&#x27;m probably about 3 years overdue in getting a replacement, but it&#x27;s finally come to the point where I no longer feel good about putting that night guard back in my mouth. I approached my dentist about getting a replacement and immediately balked at the out of pocket cost of at least $300. I then went to the opposite end of the spectrum and bought the cheaper \\&quot;boil to fit\\&quot; model where you bite into that nasty goo and hope that you can form a decent fit on your own. As expected this didn&#x27;t work out very well and I had an uneven fit that couldn&#x27;t have been less comfortable. Furthermore my old dentist night guard covered my bottom teeth while these \\&quot;boil to fit\\&quot; models cover your top teeth. That might not seem like a big change, but it was really tough to sleep just knowing something different was in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I ended up trying this model and after 1 week I think I&#x27;m ready to take the next step and throw my 6 year old night guard into the trash. It doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s much to the night guard aside from a plastic strap and two blue pads, but it gets the job done. There are 5 settings that you can use to stretch out the plastic band so the blue pads securely cover your molars. It&#x27;s very easy to adjust and best of all you don&#x27;t need to boil water or bite into any goo. The blue pads go over your bottom teeth so for me this was much more familiar based on my old night guard. There was some slight irritation at first on your gums near your molars if you bite down really hard, but it has gotten better. Some of the reviews mentioned the risk of swallowing it or spitting it out while you sleep - I don&#x27;t have either of these problems since my teeth are so tightly clenched when I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product and if you have FSA dollars from your employer this is eligible for reimbursement.</li>
            <li> I found the connector bit to be painful.</li>
            <li> It is nice that this mouth guard does NOT require any boiling-water-fit-customization.  It lasts longer than the other mouth guards I&#x27;ve tried.  Only your back teeth are biting into this mouth guard, but it effectively stops your other teeth from grinding too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot decide whether I find this more comfortable than other mouth guards.  This guard takes up a lot less space in the mouth than other guards, so you might think that it would be more comfortable.  Unfortunately, I find the gentle pressure it applies to my lower front teeth to be surprisingly annoying.</li>
            <li> I have tried several dental guards and this is by far the best fit. It feels light in my mouth, it works and I can even talk with it. Very happy with it. I have already used this kind of product for a year now.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product because my dentist expressed how severe my clenching was, and because of it I had actually fractured a tooth. My jaw muscles are usually very sore, and I realize that I clench during my day a lot. No matter how much I try to be self-conscious I still clench. I am not the grinding type at all. I only clench. I needed something ASAP since I was at work and jaw was sore, so I ordered this through Amazon Prime Now, it says night time but I started using it during the day as needed and it is actually pretty awesome. The mouth piece is slim, I did not want anything bulky. I can still talk with it on. It is super comfortable. I love that it has a carrying case and it brings two mouth pieces.However, you only use one at a time. So it should last you a for at least 12 months. The clenching and pressure is focused mostly on my molars, so I did not need any of those big bulky trays. The thin strip connecting the pieces, is durable enough to maintain stability and hold, while at the same time being discreet. No one can really tell I am even wearing the guard most of the time. The piece is adjustable, however, it fit perfectly for me straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> I have had a very expensive dental guard, made by my dentist, that I have worn for years. Hate it.  I saw these, they were inexpensive, thought what do I have to lose.  I am so glad I tried it.  Granted, they won&#x27;t last as long as the expensive guard I had made by the dentist, but this is so much more comfortable to sleep with, and my teeth do not touch, which is the whole point of the guard. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> First off, my problem is teeth clenching, not grinding, so this is what this review is based one. I used to have an older version of a bite guard from DenTek that looks similar to a guard people that play sports use. I didn&#x27;t like that kinda because it causes my mouth to open a little as the front part is so thick, and I personally cannot stand when my mouth is open while I sleep - causes snoring noises and dry mouth! But, this version has a thin band that goes around your bottom teeth, and my mouth stays closed! I cannot say for sure that people with grinding/more severe cases that this would work well, but I think for just an average clencher, this works great!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this dental guard. I grind my teeth so much at night that I had ground out my fillings. My dentist strongly recommended a night guard, but suggested that I try an &#x27;over the counter&#x27; before investing in a custom made one, which would be quite expensive and not covered under my dental policy. I tried one that fit over my top teeth-it was quite bulky-about 1/3 inch thick on both sides of my teeth-and made me feel suffocated, even though I wasn&#x27;t. I couldn&#x27;t sleep comfortably with it in my mouth. I decided to search further and found the DenTek. It operates on the opposite concept from my original choice-instead of keeping my teeth separated from the front, it has two pieces that fit between my molars, top and bottom, with just a thin piece to go around my front teeth and keep it connected. It is completely comfortable and does not interfere with my sleep. The first few nights I wore it as directed on the package, with the narrow strip on my bottom teeth-that was okay, but following a suggestion in one of the other reviews, I flipped it over, with the strip going around my top teeth and found that to be better for me. I suspect fitting on the top or bottom is based on the shape of each person&#x27;s mouth. Anyway, I am so pleased-the kit came with two mouth guards and a case-I have not found any issues with them &#x27;wearing out&#x27;, but when they do, I will just order a new set.</li>
            <li> Dumb.  Was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and teeth an this dental guard is great for that. I wore it the first time and it hurt my bottom gums,but the following night i put it on my top teeth and its worked great. I have had no problem with thinking i was going to swallow it, but i can see how it would be scary for others. I would not recommend this for heavy grinders, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would last long for those who do that.</li>
            <li> My original mouth guard cost $400.  I wore it faithfully until my dog ate it.  I&#x27;ve purchased 4 of these particular mouth guards and they work splendidly.  Each morning I wake up to find my jaws chomped onto the guard; I soak it in hydrogen peroxide til evening.  The guards last quite a while but I pull the little plastic front piece back and forth to clean it under running water.&lt;br /&gt; I do have a small mouth and have never worried about swallowing it.</li>
            <li> Thank you, my jaw thanks you.  I think I can say goodbye to grinding my teeth and getting headaches.  They are comfortable.</li>
            <li> It does the job, isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all, but you have to find it every morning because it falls out in the middle of the night</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dentek dental guards for a few years and much preferred to old style that was made with less plastic.  They were a bit more comfortable.  These tend to irritate a little bit but I am getting used to it.  I will be scouring stores to find the old style.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and works as well as those custom made ones.&lt;br /&gt;A good buy for me, and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Keeps you from grinding your teeth and it&#x27;s comfortable.  I bought several types that were uncomfortable and I couldn&#x27;t use them. This one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable than most. It&#x27;s small and soft and adjustable. Most are not. These would be great even if they were sold at the usual price but these are cheaper than many others too. Almost perfect. I would have liked a case to store them in but they fit in the many cases left from the other gaurds I&#x27;ve tried or in Mom&#x27;s old denture dish, so no problem. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I tried several night guards that required boiling, and they made my teeth sore in the morning. I felt like I was going into the boxing ring wearing those. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use them regularly because I hated the feeling. This one by DenTek is different - comfortable from the time I put it in! And there was no soreness. Kudos to DenTek for making a truly comfortable night guard!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many off the shelf products including the Splintek Sleepright. I stumbled across this one and was very surprised and impressed by the performance and cost of this product. It fits nicely and comfortably and works wonders for me. It is compact enough to not hurt your gums or jaws and it stays in place with just the right amount of thickness to protect your teeth from grinding.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the boil style. Took a few nights to figure out my perfect setting. Occasionally I&#x27;ll wake up trying to chomp on it and bending it sideways, not often though (and I&#x27;m an extreme sleep grinder/gnasher). All in all for the price I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Much easier to use than guards you have to boil. Much more convent and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  It does not fit on the teeth but just provides a barrier between top and bottom.  You must close your mouth tightly to keep in in place.  This simply doesn&#x27;t work when you are trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive and work well for those of us who grind our teeth at night.  One of my dogs chomped my $200. guard fashioned by the dentist and these work as well.  Of course, the dogs are  not interested in these inexpensive ones.</li>
            <li> Totally useless, doesn&#x27;t fit in any way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of these and this worked for a few days,  then loosened up with use and kept coming out.  If this is a serious problem for you, get a custom one from the dentist.  Save up if you have to - it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a been a tooth grinder my entire adult life so I have tried plenty of mouth guards and this is by far the best one! It is not bulky and it stays in place. I think it works better than the professional ones too. This is hard to find in the store, so thank you for carrying it online! No issues with transaction.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product, It improved my headaches I was getting from grinding my teeth at night.  The headaches are not gone completely but not as many or as strong.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard is very comfortable - the best of anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I received two in the package and a case, which was really a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after just a couple weeks, it no longer stays at the size that I adjusted it to be.  I go asleep with it at the smallest size and fitting perfectly, and wake up with it readjusted to the largest size and floating around my mouth.  That seems downright dangerous.  If anyone knows of a way to force it to stay the smallest size, that would solve it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews mentioned it changing your bite, and I&#x27;ll admit it truly does do that.  It takes a little time the next day for my bite to readjust, but I have to be careful until then because teeth hit each other where they usually do not meet.  Not sure if there are long-term problems or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going out looking for another alternative because it changes size during the night.</li>
            <li> Purchased a 2 pack a few months ago for my wife. She said it fits comfortable enough and does help keep her from grinding her teeth. Easy to fit &amp; wear; takes a few days to get use to it.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and this is thee ONE!  It is thee most comfortable one to use while sleeping.  With this one, you don&#x27;t feel like you have 3 pounds of plastic in your mouth. It is comfortable and leaves no sore spots in your mouth.  I will never use any other type!!  Also, hard to find in retail stores, buy it NOW!</li>
            <li> After reading LOTS of reviews on this product I decided to take the dive and just get it already. I am TOTALLY disappointed! Luckily Dentek offers a full money back guarantee. The sides that have a slip adjustment constantly came out of place and the guard its self kept slipping around in my mouth. If the thin little piece that goes under your front gums was more stiff instead of super flimsy- this product actually might work. I have a very small mouth and was thrilled to have a low profile guard that I could wear during the day also- but if I even opened my lips just in the slightest it would slip around and come un adjusted. Plus the blue &#x27;grind&#x27; pads are extremely cheapy- I only used mine a couple of times and the pads had signs of significant wear. The only great thing I have to say about this product is the Dentek&#x27;s customer support was extrememly curtious,fast,patient, and didn&#x27;t give me a hard time about wanting to make a return. Probably because I am sure they are used to calls like that all the time. My dentist also informed me that with guards such as this kind it actually make you tmj muscle stronger which is a very bad thing and can actually engage your jaw- I totally see this now that I have used it- my TMJ pain was greatly increased due to it slipping around. Please save your money or go with the classic boil and fit style guards- they have been around for a long time for a reason- they are the closest to what a dentist has to offer at a huge fraction of the costs.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth in my sleep; I don&#x27;t grind them. I have a feeling that if you are a teeth grinder you might chew through this guard pretty quickly. For me, it has lasted over a year. It is comfortable and protects my teeth. I only have one complaint: if you look at the zoomed picture, there are small slits on the side of the guard and when I sleep, in addition to clenching, I suck in my cheeks. During the night, my cheeks get sucked through these slits. It doesn&#x27;t hurt necessarily, but it&#x27;s pretty weird to feel the pieces of skin that were sucked through on my cheeks in the morning (they usually go away within an hour or two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, other than that, the cost is perfect (1 single guard will go for $40 at CVS) and I&#x27;m perfectly happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few types of dental guards, but couldn&#x27;t tolerate sleeping with them. I didn&#x27;t want to pay $400 for a guard from the dentist, especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me. I&#x27;ve been using this guard for about a month and have had no problems.I almost forget that it is in my mouth. In fact, I think I relax more since I know I won&#x27;t be chomping on my back molars. I&#x27;m relieved that I found this product.</li>
            <li> Best thing i ever bought. I sleep comfortably, better than a full mouth guard which makes me drool, and I just can&#x27;t stand to have on. I can actually feel when i am biting at night. I&#x27;m glad I got this, now i&#x27;m definitely saving my molars.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get the feel of this. I know its doing its job but it moves around a lot in your mouth as your sleeping.</li>
            <li> After trying several over-the-counter mouth guards, I found this one to be by far the most comfortable.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years.  A recent design change created bite pads that are a little thicker &amp; made of a stronger plastic.  The new design is just as comfortable as the old ones and I think it will be more durable.</li>
            <li> I found these a couple of times at Walmart and they were awesome.  But I can&#x27;t find them anymore so I tried online.  It is the same brand and product but the fit is different.  They are a little too big and so I can feel it as I wake up in the morning.  Sometimes I have a sore where it was poking.  But I can&#x27;t find the original ones or anything better.  If you have a favorite I would love to hear about them.  I wear them for night grinding.</li>
            <li> The good thing is they aren&#x27;t bulky, but the hard plastic on the sides caused a sore on my gum that resulted in pain and inflamation.</li>
            <li> Like the adjustability and they don&#x27;t make my mouth water like the full size</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting an upper portion. I had a previous version of this comfort-fit mouth guard that sat nicely on the lower teeth. This one also has parts that go alongside the upper teeth, making it more bulky and less comfortable. Nevertheless, it is better than many other mainstream mouth guards I have tried. I assume this new model is here to stay, but I wish they would go back to the older version, which I liked much better.</li>
            <li> So comfortable!  These bite guards are better than the custom one made at the dentist&#x27;s office.  They are tough without the extra bulk.  You can adjust the size to fit your mouth without the hassle of trying to boil and mold it.  I will never go back to a traditional bite guard.</li>
            <li> I  clench and grind my teeth at night. I have had many night guards, both dentist made and over the counter. This is the best over the counter one I have tried. The big test? I can sleep with it in my mouth, and I have not chewed it up. It keeps my teeth apart without filling my entire mouth with plastic that gags me. If you are considering night guards, this would be the one to try.</li>
            <li> BEWARE of long term effects!!! I used this mouthguard exactly as described for 6-8 months and it put slight pressure on two of my back gums (adjacent teeth).  The gums started to recede because if this and I had to have GUM GRAFTING surgery due to this mouthguard!!! By the way, I&#x27;ve never had any gum issue and I am only 30! This is NO joke!! Please take my advice and save yourself!</li>
            <li> I have been grinding my teeth since I was in my teens. I tried boil and form mouth guards several times and all were so bulky that I was unable to fall asleep.Out of frustration, I neglected to wear such items to protect my teeth. I am now in my late twenties and recently, I noticed that the wear on my teeth was noticeable. So much so that my front teeth were getting sharp. So I finally decided that I needed to bite the bullet and begin using guards. I received the dentek guard and was surprised at how sleek the design was. I had a bit of trouble getting accustomed to a foreign object in my mouth but after a couple days, it posed little interference with me falling asleep. For the first two weeks, I thought I&#x27;d found the best mouth guard. However, by the third week, the form of the area where you bite on began warping as my bite is not perfectly aligned. By the fourth week, I had to dispose of the guard. This was dissppointing as the item is described as being durable. I believe the packaging stated six months. Luckily, my purchase included two guards and I promptly popped the next one on. This also lasted another month. Sadly, I will have to go about looking for other solutions to protecting my teeth. The comfort level is very high and though one may fear it choking someone while sleeping, it stays relatively in place throughout the night. I sleep on my side so I suppose the guard being shifted within my mouth caused the warping of the guard. The durability is why I rate this product as a three. It does what it is supposed to do but doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough to justify the price. I have moved on to trying new products and hope to find one that works and lasts at least 3-6 months. For someone that has never used mouth guards, I would recommend this product as a way of getting used to having something in your mouth while trying to sleep. It is definitely the sleekest I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
            <li> Best mouth guard in the market.</li>
            <li> I like this low profile guard. It&#x27;s comfortable and there&#x27;s no need to boil water to fit. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do while I sleep. My problem is, I&#x27;m a heavy grinder so I grind right through these guards far too quickly. I can&#x27;t even get 30 days out of one. DenTek is good about sending me a replacement since they have a guarantee on them. I just switched to Sleep Right because the bite pads are stronger; they hold up to my heavy grinding.</li>
            <li> I have tried others and they hurt my jaw.  This one works GREAT.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different types/models and this is by far the most comfortable. Also others I&#x27;ve tried that are adjustable are harder to clean.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of having the dentist make a really expensive nightguard. It started messing up my teeth. I wish I had found this product first! It is cheap-- a package of 2 will last a full year-- compared to the hundreds of dollars I spent on the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no trouble keeping this device in my mouth; it is comfortable and I can talk normally while wearing it. I have used this type of nightguard for over 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time it got dislodged in my mouth was when I took a big gulp of water without thinking! Then it popped out and on top of my tongue, but I didn&#x27;t swallow it and easily put it back. Now when I drink water I am more careful to keep my teeth loosely together when I swallow. (Or take it out to drink.)</li>
            <li> I had one of those retainers you put in hot water so it molds to your mouth and it threw my jaw alignment off even more than my teeth-grinding ever had, so I bought these.  SO much better.  It stands up to my monster jaws&#x27; clenching and you can change the length to make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Moved around in the mouth too much and the plates themselves are too rigid - and too thick to me really comfortable! Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again or recommend.</li>
            <li> I was told I grind my teeth by my dentist so I quickly purchased this.  On the plus side you get two and they don&#x27;t need to be molded.  The bad part is that the guard sits on my molars, the place where I was grinding my teeth the most and having the most TMJ symptoms.  Secondly the upper flaps can be irritating and since the guard doesn&#x27;t set on your teeth there are a few nights the guard popped out and I was scared out of my mind thinking I swallowed it!</li>
            <li> I chewed these up in a week, If your a heavy grinder they wear out fast. They were comfortable when they were in tack</li>
            <li> Perfect to resolve my teeth grinding issue. So much better than the boil type of guard which is so bulky in your mouth. This guard is so small you almost forget its there. We did have to make a few small adjustments where it rubbed my gums but once we did it fit great.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  After having suffered through months of pain I figured I was either clinching my teeth or grinding while sleeping.  This product takes care of those problems.  It took me about a week to get used to it but now I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I had another really nice mouthguard but there was just too much going on in my mouth. I felt like my jaw wasn&#x27;t in a relaxed position so it felt somewhat strained. I never had it in my mouth for more like 15 minutes, I just couldn&#x27;t take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SOOOO glad I bought the DenTek Comfort Fit NightGuard. It&#x27;s slim yet works better than I could have imagined. I can still talk while it&#x27;s in my mouth. The price is great and you get 2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually sleep with it covering my top molars rather than my bottom, I find it more comfortable this way. I clench really hard and grind once in a while and this helps tremendously. I don&#x27;t wake up with my teeth, jaw, or head aching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about getting this. I would definitely try it. I&#x27;m so glad I did, I am saving my pearly whites from being grinded into dust.</li>
            <li> I loved that this night guard required no boiling, and I also really liked the adjustable fit settings. That being said, it usually fell out when I was sleeping, or I would wake up in the middle of the night and take it out because I found it too uncomfortable. Not for me.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this less expensive night guard a try. The product provided a divider between the upper jaw from the lower jaw. However, I have a tendency to clench my teeth and have found the product unable to withstand the clenching. This would be a good product for light clenching and grinding.</li>
            <li> I have been grinding my teeth since I&#x27;ve been little. I purchased these because of all the favorable reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few nights, I could feel a difference when I woke up. I could also see indentations my teeth made on the guard while I was sleeping. After a while, I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of having 1/8\\&quot; of plastic between my teeth and I started taking them out while sleeping in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far s dental guards go, these are probably the best. But I couldn&#x27;t get used to them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for awhile...long enough that they&#x27;ve change what you get in the package twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using them probably close to 4 years ago after I cracked a tooth from clenching my jaws at night.  They relieved my jaw pain and got me to where my jaw muscles are weaker now that I don&#x27;t spend all night when my teeth locked together clenching and grinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this time, they used to come with a case and ONE guard for about 15-20 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they moved to buy one get one, and started including an extra guard along with the case and guard..you could buy these at Walmart for maybe 15-20.  And then Walmart stopped carrying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started ordering them from Amazon, at one point they sold them with included cases.......and now they don&#x27;t even come with the case.  AND the price has remained at least 10 dollars higher than the Walmart pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get maybe 3 months out of a guard before it gets too mangled or shaped to my teeth to serve it&#x27;s purpose any longer.  So one case gets me about 6 months of coverage.  It&#x27;s not horribly priced, but it&#x27;s got me looking at other products again for items that may last longer or fit more comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they aren&#x27;t the perfect solution......but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A warning to others, if your bite is causing your teeth to loosen or hurt toward the front.  After using this item you may find that your teeth will no longer fit together like they used to once your jaw muscles weaken.  My jaw will no longer sit back as far as it used to so my front teeth hit and my teeth no longer align like any dentist would like to see.  But it has relieved many stress headaches from the jaw clenching and stopped me from cracking my molars at night.  I probably need braces to some degree to pull my teeth around and re-align my jaws and teeth to where they should be, but it&#x27;s a costly thing to get into so I am waiting until I am better off financially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So......it&#x27;s not the fault of the product exactly, but be warned you should consider a dental appliance for bruxing if you have the means.ancially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So......it&#x27;s not the fault of the product exactly, but be warned you should consider a dental appliance for bruxing if you have the means.</li>
            <li> DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard did NOT work well for me.  It was uncomfortable and kept my mouth slightly open.  Other reviewers commented that the pads are too thick.  I felt the same.  I bought it because no melting necessary and the pads are adjustable (they can be moved closer to front or closer to the back of your mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Dentek customer service.  They sent me Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard at no cost.  I love it.  It requires heating in hot water to form to your teeth but it is very simple to do.  My wife and I both have dental guards from our dentist.  Her&#x27;s is soft rubber-like feel and mine is hard plastic-like feel.  Mine (the hard plastic-like feel) is so uncomfortable that I don&#x27;t wear it, even though I had to fork over a couple hundred bucks for it.  My wife&#x27;s is soft rubber-like feel and the Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard feels and looks just like my wife&#x27;s (and she paid a couple hundred at the dentist).  My wife said that next time she&#x27;ll get the Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard when her couple-hundred dollar guard needs replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip: If you have a problem with Dentek guard, make sure you call them within 30 days.</li>
            <li> As good as the ones the dentist made for me. They don&#x27;t rub my gums and don&#x27;t feel like my football mouthguard like most over the counter dental guards. I highly recommend these</li>
            <li> so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, affordable, easy to clean and store.  Completely cleared up jaw discomfort.  Would recommend this product to anyone who has jaw problems.</li>
            <li> I have a filling in my upper front tooth. This mouth guard does not rub against the upper front teeth.  The other kind rubbed and loosened the filling. This one didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s also quite comfortable as there is not so much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, easy, portable product. I have not lost, swallowed, or damaged mine. It does tend to wear out -- the bite grips loosen, as well as the cushions get thin every 8+ weeks or so. But I think it is more hygienic to replace it and get fresh ones anyways, so I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to sleep with a big plastic nugget in their mouth.</li>
            <li> After trying the \\&quot;boil &amp; bite\\&quot; models, I was really happy to discover this. Unlike the b&amp;b, this doesn&#x27;t encase your teeth. Instead, the two thin plastic wings just rest above your back teeth and keep you from biting all the way down. Because saliva flows freely around your teeth, you don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with a gamey, filmy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep the wings in place, a thin plastic strip connects them and tucks in front of your lower front teeth. It&#x27;s unobtrusive and it works. Even better, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with closing your mouth completely as the b&amp;b did. With that, I used to wake up in the middle of the night and find myself drooling onto my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is fairly firm. It took a week or two for it to conform to my bite. But that doesn&#x27;t affect its comfort or performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that to make the fit adjustable, the connecting strip slides into a sort of tunnel in each of the wings. Little bumps on the strip help it snap it in place and keep the two wings the desired distance apart. There&#x27;s no way to really get in there and rinse that tunnel out. So I soak the whole thing in mouthwash once a week.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is small! All the other mouth guards I have looked at or used were too big. This product didn&#x27;t bother my gums and keeps me from grinding my teeth (which my husband appreciates!)! I especially liked that it doesn&#x27;t have to be \\&quot;formed\\&quot; to your teeth, the guard just puts a small layer between your teeth for protection! Would absolutely recommend it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way: some reviews said it threw their jaw out of alignment, but the truth is if you grind your teeth your jaw is shifting as you do it, so the product isn&#x27;t causing it, grinding your teeth is doing it (it&#x27;s too small to throw your jaw alignment off anyway.</li>
            <li> The best mouth guard ever!  All of the others are too bulky and I take them out in my sleep.  This one fits perfect and is not uncomfortable and you can talk without sounding like your mouth is full.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I can not recommend this mouth guard. After using it for 2 weeks my back teeth on my right side are almost completely flat and they squeak every time I chew. I would also wake up with a sore jaw. This mouth guard has made my teeth worst.</li>
            <li> Granted, it took a few nights of tossing and turning to get used to, but I think that&#x27;s typical of mouth guards overall and not this one in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how small it is- it&#x27;s only grabbed by the back teeth, so it&#x27;s hardly noticeable when it&#x27;s in- I have no issues drinking water or talking, and I can still keep my mouth closed when I sleep. My only complaint is that the slim piece of plastic that wraps around the front of your bottom teeth sits a bit too low on me, and rubs at the spot where my gums become the inside of my lip. It gets a bit sore there, but it&#x27;s only really noticeable when I first put the mouth guard in, and first thing in the morning, so at the moment it&#x27;s worth dealing with in order to not grind my teeth into pearly stumps.</li>
            <li> Please bring back the old design which was slightly thinner and didn&#x27;t have the full &#x27;bite wing&#x27; design!  These are too bulky.</li>
            <li> Works good, but seems a little small. Wish they came in more than &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I guess its ok; I have tried a few over the counter dental guards. Thus far the Sleep Rite has been best, and, despite my not caring for the Den Tek, I would consider it second best (that others were THAT bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is nice and small. The adjustments easy. What I have not likes it that the tab that goes up and down hurts the bone under my gums fairly bad.</li>
            <li> it works fine but took a while to get the plastic taste off of it.  I soaked it for quite a while</li>
            <li> The plates that are meant to keep your molars from grinding have &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; to krrp them in place. These wings rest right at my gumline so I wake up with sore gums each morning.  I have a nighr guard from my dentist that while very expensive, doesn&#x27;t cause pain.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and it beats most of the over the counter items. DenTek recommends using the product no longer than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Product is functional, but not the best. I would have returned product within 30 day period, if I was paying more attention to time. I don&#x27;t use it very much, cause it makes my inside cheek area puffy after wearing it all night. It also doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy. I will try a boil one next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple night guard, and like most people with a smaller mouth, this one fits wonderfully.  The full molds often give me neck pain in the morning, but I had none with this.  I like that it isn&#x27;t huge and I can actually close my mouth comfortably.  I have no fear of it slipping or swallowing it.  It cleans easily every morning and I love that it has a case.  I expect that after several months of use I will eventually grind through the bite guards, but I&#x27;ve done that on every dental guard I&#x27;ve tried.  It is nice that this one comes with two, so I will just reorder when I need to start on the second guard.  Quality product that helps keep me from ruining my teeth, and helps prevent wicked headaches from grinding and clenching at night.</li>
            <li> If you clench or bite at night this moves around. SISU night guards are better</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good option since it is smaller and I was looking for a less bulky option....but I am not impressed with this. The design seems good in theory but is uncomfortable to wear and fits oddly due to the strap on the front. I think the bulkier guards are actually a better bet.</li>
            <li> can not live without these!!</li>
            <li> I like that this product fits in my mouth fairly easily and does a good job of protecting my teeth at night. The problem I had was that sense this product doesn&#x27;t conform to your teeth, there is nothing really holding it in place at night. I found that I would wake up with the guard out of my mouth. Dentek refunded my money which I appreciate. You&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose with Dentek&#x27;s  money-back guarantee. Try it out and see if it might work for you. I doubt whether Amazon would refund your money, but Dentek does with a minimum of fuss.</li>
            <li> Most comfortable night guard I have tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;However, I should note that I&#x27;m using it upside down.&lt;br /&gt;When I use the suggested orientation, the wings on the bottom dig into my gums to the point of being painful.&lt;br /&gt;But when I use it upside down, I barely notice that they are there.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Works great. Not intrusive at all. I use it for nighttime and when I go to the gym.</li>
            <li> i like these better than the throw aways, i just wash them with super hot water and antiseptic mouth wash, and i found that using senseodine tooth paste helps with the irratation these can sometimes cause. i&#x27;m not a grinder as much as a clencher and these work great for me. they do not feel too bulky at all and i like that you can adjust them, sometimes i find my jaw adjusts them on it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li> Wore it for a week, the hard plastic is not giving enough, my bite muscles were sore and tight. Switching from a softer bite guard that has more give to this rigid version was not agreeable. Really like the slender profile and bulk-less design, but I think a mold-able bite guard area is still needed. These are not mold-able.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cushion for your teeth due to grinding do not buy these.They fit in your mouth well but do not have the cushion needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having lost my custom made mouth guard. I have been trying to find it since it cost over $500 to make. So in the mean time, I figured I would order something just in case I found it. I did not want to go ahead and pay the $500 again just yet. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it on. It is comfortable and has an adjusting strap to fit propertly. it is easy to sleep with since it is not bulky at all. It is cushioned enough to shield the teeth from the clenching also. Having had a custom made mouth guard, and having tried this, I am very happy with it. It was inexpensive, and the package had 2 guards in it. It has worked for me, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I do have to wear it on my top teeth because it rubbed on my gums when wearing it on the bottom teeth.  It has not stopped me from grinding my teeth, but has stopped the damage I was doing to my teeth from grinding.  Very comfortable, the size is perfect, as my mouth is small.  I do have to replace it every few months since I&#x27;m still grinding, but at least my teeth are no longer being ground down.</li>
            <li> Even though they seemed more expensive than other devices shuch as the Plackers Grind No More I bought the Den Tek  Comfort Fit because they are Guaranteed 1 year,  ...the 2 of them together didn&#x27;t last two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;The design is not very good and the plastic is kind of rough on your gums. I strongly preferred  the Grind No More Plackers, which are softer, last longer and are much cheaper, so you have no second thoughts when disposing them, which is healthier by the way.</li>
            <li> I am so relieved to have a mouthguard that works, especially one that fits in my mouth.  It is adjustable, though as another reviewer noted it doesn&#x27;t stay to the settings I out it at.  This hasn&#x27;t been a problem, though, and I just readjust it each time I out it in.  Each pack comes with two, and I find them long lasting (Have been using one for at least three months now.). I recommend switch it between the lower and bottom jaw.  I tend not to use mine every night, because if I do that my teeth start to feel funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tmj is caused by clenching and stress problems, so this helps keep my jaw in the right place and from clenching too hard together while I recuperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I do for my TMJ: First, I hear up a hot rice or heat pad and wrap it in a towel.  I put some tiger balm on my neck and shoulders (And on the side of my face that hurts, though most people recommend against that.  It stings, but I am used to it, and I don&#x27;t do it every day.).  Then I lay with the rice bag under my neck and I put the mouth guard in.  It takes less than a week to get back to normal, where before it would take two or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are invaluable and have more than paid for themselves with my increased ability to work.</li>
            <li> I used these when my NTI and full mouth piece mouth guard were being made. I woke up multiple times in the night gagging from the mouth piece moving from its initial position and also found that my jaw was sore the following morning.</li>
            <li> Great product! Can&#x27;t live or sleep without it! Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthguard, it is so comfortable and lightweight, I don&#x27;t notice it there. It helps me not to have headaches.</li>
            <li> Even the slightest thing bothers me when I sleep- my husband has dubbed me \\&quot;princess and the pea.\\&quot;  Yet, after fussing with this in my mouth for about 10 minutes, I fell asleep and had the best sleep of my life.&lt;br /&gt;I broke a molar grinding my teeth last month and the dentist wnated $2000 for a nightguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does the job for $25 and is actually more comfortable (from what I have heard from those who spent that 2 grand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using night guards - both custom and OTC - for years, and this is one of the worst.  The style is based on custom night guards that use a dental wire (similar to the ones used for braces) in order to hold the biting surfaces in place.  This guard uses a cheap bit of plastic that won&#x27;t hold its shape, and won&#x27;t even hold the adjustable positioning.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that an item like this obviously cannot be returned once it has been used, I would have sent it back the next day.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth at night and it is hard to wear a full mouth guard with full ortho.  This is still doable with the braces.  It stays in place, and I in turn am saving my teeth from attrition.</li>
            <li> These are the best night guards I have tried. When I first received them I wasn&#x27;t sure they would work but I was surprised not only do they fit they seem to be pretty tough. I&#x27;ve been using them for a little over a month now and they are showing no wear so they should last at least the 6 months stated.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this new design wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the old one.  I have a super sensitive gag reflex and the old version of this product was the only mouth guard I could use without gagging.  This new version is fine; the extra piece that goes over the outside of the top teeth doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I ended up getting fitted for a guard from my dentist though, because, as they explained, this is like a chew toy.  It helps, to a point.  But it doesn&#x27;t stop you from grinding/clenching so if the problem gets bad enough, you might have to give in and get a real one from the dentist.  This one looked like it had been used for six months after the first night--my grinding and clenching is bad enough that this thing looked old right away.  If you have a mild problem, and if you have a sensitive gag reflex, this might help, but do see your dentist if it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It is so small, yet it stays in place all night. It does the job---no more grinding!</li>
            <li> This dental guard worked really well for me, but I think your success with it depends on your issue. If you grind your teeth, this is probably not the product for you as there is really nothing to keep it in place. My issue is that I clench my teeth when I sleep and I suffered from resulting tension headaches. This mouth guard keeps my teeth from clenching together and I notice that within one night of using it, my headaches are gone. It&#x27;s quite small and not cumbersome at all, and it doesn&#x27;t rub against my gums like other mouth guards have in the past. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who clenches their teeth at night.</li>
            <li> Rally made a difference in how i sleep and wake up feeling of relive comes over me. MY jaw doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore !!! And Amazing Price! walmart sells this for 1 &#x3D; 30$</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably and stays in place all night. My husband doesn&#x27;t hear me grinding at night anymore, which is good. It seemed to be working great the first couple weeks, but lately I do still wake up with a sore jaw and headache some mornings even though I wear it at night. I don&#x27;t think it prevents me from clenching my jaw, just from grinding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many off the shelf mouth guards.  This is the only one I don&#x27;t choke one.  A quality product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different guards and all others either moved my teeth so they felt loose in the morning or left sore gouges in my cheeks and/or gums. This is such a thin profile that it feels &#x27;barely there&#x27;. It reduces my instinct to bite because there is something in my mouth which was a problem with other, bulkier guards.  I have a hard bite and I do go through them much faster than the 6 months promised, but it is worth it to me to buy them more often for the comfort. This guard allows for closed-mouth sleeping which is also a big plus as I am a singer and mouth breathing dries my throat and vocal chords.</li>
            <li> Finally!! I have a small mouth and am a avid grinder. These devices work . They are the best I have ever found in comfort and practicality. The adjustment option is unique and well received in my mouth. Nothing large and protruding to try and sleep with Buy them!</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth at night and am a light sleeper/sleep walker &amp; talker so was a little worried about whether or not I would be able to keep a bite guard in my mouth all night without choking on it or taking it out in my sleep. I bought it after I had to get a crown put in on a rear molar due to clenching my teeth at night. I didn&#x27;t want to have a mouth full of crowns, so took my dentist&#x27;s advice and bought a bite guard. I looked at $300 custom bite guards, but thought that was way too expensive, and was very satisfied when I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sleep with it in my mouth every night without any problems. The adjustable length of it is fantastic! And I really like how thin the front plastic is as well as the bite part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product at a pharmacy first, but it didn&#x27;t have the storage case with it and lost the bite guard in a matter of months, so the storage case is a wonderful addition to this product as I now always know where my bite guard is, and also know that it doesn&#x27;t have any dust on it from sitting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ever change this product, unless it is to make the bite part a little softer. My jaw is sometimes a little sore in the morning due to clenching, but I know my teeth are protected.</li>
            <li> The dental guard is very slim and fits much better then guards I have purchased in the past.  The only problem I found was that after wearing it for a couple of weeks it gets stretched out and doesn&#x27;t fit as well.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t heart and very comfortable! I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s the best one i&#x27;ve found.  No problems with rubbing my gums or anything that I&#x27;ve had with other choices. Definitely recommend these</li>
            <li> The connecting clear piece comes down too far over the front teeth allowing it to hit/push against the gums which causes unnecessary irritation. This is a design flaw in my opinion. I suppose the concept behind it is to keep the guard from sliding back too far into the mouth, but the effect is exaggerated needlessly. This also causes irritation to the teeth and ultimately could lead to gum-line recession, but, in the short term, it would probably just cause most people discomfort, as it did with me.</li>
            <li> A very cheap product that doesn&#x27;t work. Flimsy..poorly made and a total waste of money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this to prevent accidental &amp;#34;clashing&amp;#34; of my upper tooth to my lower brace during sleep. And it actually prevented it(for most of the time), and my braces did not break from my tooth anymore.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I didn&#x27;t want to pay to have the dentist make me one, yet I was having weeks where my headaches would not go away.  My husband said I was grinding my teeth ALL night long.  The first night I wore it, I woke up a few times through the night because of biting hard on it.  However, I woke up with no headache and a week into it still headache free, I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to buy it.  The guard is very comfortable once I sized it.  I was nervous after the first night I used it because my lower gums were a little red and irritated.  I adjusted the sizing (which is very easy to do) and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Extremly small , wast of money</li>
            <li> Recommend these over plastic, melt to fit type. Easy to clean and work better in my opinion. There is really nothing to them but they have held up well. Ridiculous that they are so expensive, but they work.</li>
            <li> The guard fits well initially and is adjustable, but I had trouble with it staying put while sleeping. Came dislodged or shifted often.  I know others who have not had this issue, but it was mine.</li>
            <li> Scrapes gums. Finally got a dental guard at the dentist. Wish I had done this years ago. Highly recommend getting from dentist.</li>
            <li> This is very comfortable and stays in your mouth all night this one stays in place</li>
            <li> Very small and does a great job. Love that it is adjustable. Doesn&#x27;t overwhelm my mouth. But with any guard you have to give yourself time to adjust.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and nicer than the full coverage dental guards. My dentist doesn&#x27;t like these as he claims it makes you push your teeth forward but since this is made by a dental company with a support team that can help with questions, and they work for me, I am thinking its better than continuing to use nothing regularly grind away.</li>
            <li> The plastic bite area dropps a little to low for me,  makes me gag. Tried to alter with scissors and edge became rough.</li>
            <li> It works good as protection from teeth grinding but it does not actually work as good for avoiding headaches in the morning.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone!  I tried it because of the high ratings.  But they are very flimsy and not at all well made for grinding of the teeth in my opinion.  I thought it was a waste of my money!!!  I could have spent my $30.00 on something else :(  It did not in any way help with my jaw pain either :(  I bought a mouth piece from Walmart for $1.00....the kind that you boil and LOVE that compared to this.</li>
            <li> I have been using the older model for years and really liked it; in fact the best fitted to my need in comparison to all the others in the market. Unfortunately Den Tek changed their model and this model is hurting my gum and my teeth. The biting plate is now much thicker so it is causing my teeth to grind harder during my sleep; consequently it is causing discomfort at the root level of my molars. Also the sides are so high that they sink into my gum and causing blisters. Total TRASH! Unless they revert to the previous model i&#x27;d be better off not wearing any guard.</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonably priced alternative to custom made guards.  I am using mine for up to four weeks without a problem</li>
            <li> Used these for years, bought a ton. Now it&#x27;s much thicker and has two walls, very uncomfortable. Please bring back the original!</li>
            <li> Has been a great help with my teeth clenching!!!  I don&#x27;t like being required to use a certain number of words!!!</li>
            <li> I have spent years, literally, trying bite guards. I hate the gagging bulky saliva build up feeling. I finally found this one and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only cons are it wears down fairly quick. I squeeze 9 months out of two of them but by the end they are in rough shape. But for $30 over 9 months it&#x27;s a no brainer if it means keeping my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used these guards for the last year and am very satisfied with them.  Each guard lasted about six months, but I think everyone&#x27;s experience will vary.  This is the third dental guard that I have bought, first the boil and bite type, which ended up moving my teeth and affecting my bite.  The other one is similar to the DenTek guard, but much larger.  It works fine, but is not comfortable to sleep in.  This guard took some adjusting to get a comfortable fit, but if I pull the sizer out as far as it will go, it doesn&#x27;t rub on my gums.  My dentist recommends the custom made one that clips onto your front teeth.  He says because it repositions your jaw that you can&#x27;t clench your jaw as tightly and headaches should diminish.  I may try it, but insurance doesn&#x27;t cover it and $285 seems like a lot of money for a maybe.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have a small mouth and thought because some reviews said it was better for small mouths but they seem to be loose and I have the fear that I will swallow it in the middle of the night. I do think other than that fear it stops the grinding because my pain seemed to lessen but I&#x27;m too concerned with choking to death! Not for me I guess.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this dental guard would fall out of my mouth, as it seems like there is nothing holding it in place, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and it hasn&#x27;t fallen out yet. It might if I tried to have a conversation while wearing it, but I only wear it while sleeping. It works every bit as well as the custom made one I got from my dentist and paid $600 for. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> My past experience with Dental protection gear is the SleepRight. Great device but priced higher than the others. SleepRight lasts for roughly about a year. SleepRight&#x27;s equipment feels better at first. The primary reason why I switched over to DenTek is the price. At the local WalGreen store across the street, they only carry the more expensive SleepRight. When I first saw DenTek, out of the box, it did not feel as comfortable as the old SleepRight I was using. After one night, DenTek delivers as promised, and most importantly, cost less. I intend to keep using other DenTek gear if Amazon keeps selling this product at a price that is lower than SleepRight\\&quot;s.</li>
            <li> My partner grinds her teeth a lot at night. We have gone through several dental guards, but the DenTek&#x27;s are the first pair to actually fit comfortably so she wears them daily. She has had the first one since January of this year and hasn&#x27;t had to change it out. I think it might actually last the 6 months as advertised. She says that it relieves her jaw pain and has less head aches now. I will be purchasing these again. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Terrible mouthguard . It made me clench my jaw even more. I woke up one night chewing it like gum. I got a Smartguard that works better ...not perfectly but its much better than this Dentek one. They do honor their money back guarantee . They sent me a check for what I paid minus shipping costs.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Good quality for the price! I will keep using this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to any one who has to use sleeping guard. They are easy on the mount.</li>
            <li> Really light weight, does not fit tight again my teeth even when you try to adjust it. I am going to return it.</li>
            <li> This product really works great. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product and that I would definitely recommend this item for  people to purchase.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my mouth being super sensitive, but I just could not fall asleep with this thing on. It was ever so slightly tight on my front teeth and I just could not bring myself to ignore the feeling and fall asleep. I like that it is low-profile, but the really thin string-like thing that wraps around your bottom teeth was a little too irritating to make up for the comfort of the back teeth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time getting a mouth guard. After reading the reviews, I&#x27;m glad that I got this one instead of the bulky ones that are available on Amazon. I like how slim it is. I could adjust the size accordingly, which is good. I am still not used to having something in my mouth when I&#x27;m sleeping. I tried to put it on the first night I got it and it felt so weird. I do not like the feeling of having a lot of saliva on the mouth guard. I became really conscious of that. I don&#x27;t know if I was supposed to swallow my saliva or leave them in my mouth with the mouth guard. I tend to chew on it when it&#x27;s in my mouth. Not like chewing a gum but biting on it and it kind of hurts my back teeth. I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this because I have not worn other mouth guards before. But hopefully this helps!</li>
            <li> I received my package yesterday in great time.  I didn&#x27;t even pay attention to the details in getting a case ans two cleaning packets with this.  I have bought these at CVS for double the price almost!  My only complain is that they added an extra part on the top of the bite pad on each side.  My last one was a little simpler and just a little more comfortable, but this will work fine.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me her dentist advised her to get fitted for a mouth guard (expensive!) for night use.  I suggested that she try the DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard first, the same guard that I have been using for several years, before going to all that expense.  She agreed, and I bought it for her.  She loves it!  She was afraid she would swallow it, but when she tried it, there was absolutely no problem, even when asleep.  It&#x27;s lightweight, but fits comfortably over her teeth.  It&#x27;s adjustable, too.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the type of night guard I like, but it seems to be made big. The blue edges rub up against my cheeks at night and I wind up with a canker sore.</li>
            <li> I have a bad clenching teeth problem.  Dental made one hurt my teeth and started ringing in my ear.  So I decided to try the different types.  I have small mouth and underbite.  This did not work for me as the smallest setting was too long for my mouth.  If it had been shorter it might have worked better.  Like the style but not the fit.  It might work for others but will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this dental guard for my husband and later one for my daughter, both who have grinding problems. We paid a dentist for an Invisiline guard for my daughter, which she hated. It cut into her gums, it was cumbersome, etc. She disliked it and I was out over $100. She gave up on it and that was a few years ago. My husband was recently told he needed a mouth guard immediately or he was going to need his teeth capped in a few years from the damage his teeth grinding at night caused. Well, I knew he was going to dislike what the dentist provides and didn&#x27;t want to have to spend another $100 to find that out. So I researched on Amazon for a couple of hours and chose this guard for him. It didn&#x27;t look too invasive, which is why I chose it. Who needs an entire thing covering every tooth for a grinding problem? He loves it! He said he likes how he can move the guard up and down, adjusting it to where he feels comfortable. It keeps all of his teeth from touching. It is durable and non-invasive. And get this, it stopped his snoring!! That was a bonus for me. I did not think that was possible. So he seems so be sleeping better at night and not waking up grumpy. All-in-all a great purchase. I just bought a set for my daughter. She has TMJ in addition to the grinding problem, so I am hoping maybe this will help with that too, as I have heard teeth grinding can make TMJ worse. I am very happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: July 9, 2015:&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using this every night, he no longer snores at all (a bonus), and the guard is holding up well. He is glad I purchased this and I am enjoying sleeping in peace.</li>
            <li> Daughter wears an upper retainer and this dental guard is designed to wear on the bottom so it works perfectly for her!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to protect your teeth from night grinding. It is very comfortable to wear and you do not feel bulky. I will definitely recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is the worse bite guard I have ever tried! It lasted a whole 3 nights and both sides completely flattened out, ending up meeting in the middle, on top of my tongue, making it ineffective for grinding. I would not recommend this bite guard if you tend to bite down was hard when you grind at night as I seem to. Most bite guards last me at least a year, some more, but never have I gone through one this fast.</li>
            <li> Dental guard is small and comfortable. The first time I wore it I was afraid it would fall out or swallow it, but I have had no problems. It fits comfortably and does not cause any awkward jaw movements. Unfortunately, the pair does not last me a year. I chew through them both in about 8 months. DenTek does offer a replacement if they do not last a year. I, unfortunately, have not ever kept the receipt to request a replacement.</li>
            <li> This dental guard is a great size, it fits a smaller mouth with no problems.  However, it is made of a harder plastic and can be very uncomfortable on your gums and the insides of your cheeks.</li>
            <li> Love it! It is not bulky, I can still talk &amp; smile with it in...which is pretty amazing since it is a night guard we are talking about. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these a little over a year ago. They are low profile, light and the plastic bite plates are adjustable. They do exactly as they are supposed to: they protect your teeth at night from grinding IF they stay in. I&#x27;m only estimating but I would say I would wake up with them in place 50-60% of the time. Over months to years, that is not really effective. The real pain is looking for them in the morning. Is it under the bed? under the pillows? floor somewhere? I gave up and had my dentist fit me for one of the lesser expensive moldable guards. It looks like a nicer version of a football mouth protector. They fit firmly and NEVER come out. The old adage is true: you get what you pay for. If you want your teeth to look nice for your 90th birthday photos, consider spending a little more and get something that works (no, I am NOT a dentist).</li>
            <li> I have worn nightguards for over 20 years, and I loved the old DenTek comfort fit guard. This one looks the same on the box, but in person, the pads are much thicker and this has lead to some discomfort for me in my jaws.  It does the job and has held up well, but it is not as comfortable for me as the thinner version.</li>
            <li> Easier to clean than the fitted guards. Takes some getting used to, but OK.</li>
            <li> like it very much. Quite nice design.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing. I can&#x27;t close my mouth. It is bulky and did into my gums. I have never used another night gaurd, though, so mabye they are all awful.</li>
            <li> This guard was recommended by my dentist. It does it&#x27;s job of preventing my teeth from grinding on each other while I sleep and it is small enough that I actually keep it in my mouth. The issues I have are the front piece comes down so far it rubs my gums under my front bottom teeth and the side pieces have ridges that rub my gums in the back.</li>
            <li> No, not really were uncomfortable to wear, kept me awake and finally just chucked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though they seem slim/small, they still were too big and seemed to get in the way and would wake me due to their size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was used to a smaller night guard (much more expensive but much smaller) and thought I&#x27;d try these instead due to their low cost, but just too big and would keep me waking up night after night which finally caught up and had me giving up on them.</li>
            <li> 100% great mouth guard.  It&#x27;s very small, when I opened I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work well, but after a few months I can see how much I grind and how much it helped.  I can wear it to the point that I forget it is even in, a few times I woke up and got ready with it in and didn&#x27;t notice till I went to brush my teeth.  It adjusts to my mouth great and had saved my teeth from being damaged even worse.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd order of this now and I doubt I will ever stop using it.  If you grind your teeth at all get this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my guard now for 5 months and although I never had a fitting for a night guard from a dentist, I did try the boil variety and it was huge and  there was no way I was going to put that thing in my mouth.  I suffer from teeth and facial pain and when I go to see the chiropractor and he releases my Pterygoid muscles and adjusts my neck and I wear this guard my symptoms reduce about 80 %. The other day I slept at a friends house and forgot the guard and was in excruciating pain the next week until I could get back to the chiropractor. I am not a grinder though, I clench and push my teeth against each other. This guard will help you reduce the pain from clenching while working on the reasons why you have this in the first place! MIght not be the best though for serious grinders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things I don&#x27;t like about this product, though :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I wake up with plastic stuff stuck to my molars from my teeth imprinting the guard and a plasticy taste which is gross.&lt;br /&gt;2. It cuts into the side of my gum and I really hope it is not causing long term gum damage. But it only hurts a little when I wake up and then goes away so maybe is just rubbing it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, Im ordering my second one because this seems to be the best guard on the market for clenchers.</li>
            <li> I have bought these guards two for my daughter.  They work perfectly for her.  She grinds her teeth at night and we were planning on buying her a dentist made guard, but decided to give these a try and I am very glad we did.  They are light weight and comfortable for her to wear.</li>
            <li> This guard is a lot slimmer than most store-bought guards, but the bite pads are way too bulky. After only one night&#x27;s use, I woke with a horrible pain and a misaligned jaw. It makes removing the guard more painful than it needs to be. Lessen the bulkiness of the bite pads, and maybe it would be more universally comfortable.</li>
            <li> it is too thick. started getting Jaw pain. The older model without the sides was perfect, but they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Did lots of research.  Supposed to be small and easy to use, but I did find it bulky and it puts a little bit of unnatural pressure on my teeth.  I guess it&#x27;s better than getting a custom guard, but I haven&#x27;t found myself using this very often.  (mainly due to comfort)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouth guard for over 4 years and I have loved it... That being said, this new design has an additional edge on the side and it is cutting the I side of my cheek.  In trying to make the edge thin they left it sharp and too tall.  Disappointed since it is one of the best products I have found for grinding without paying a lot.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have suffered from headaches of unknown origin.  Not knowing what was causing the headaches, I had my ears checked, my eyes checked, and my teeth checked.  Ears and eyes were OK, but my teeth were not in very good shape.  Throughout my adult life, I have had many dental problems--my molars would crumble and I&#x27;d have to get them replaced, until all of my molars were crowns. After having two of my older crowns--along with the roots--extracted, my dentist suggested that I was likely a night-time tooth-grinder/jaw clencher, and that&#x27;s why my teeth were crumbling.  He (along with an ear, nose throat specialist I&#x27;d seen for the headaches) suggested I go to Walmart and get a football mouthguard, but I had used one in the past, and I felt like I couldn&#x27;t breathe, plus, the odor bothered me.  Therefore, I did a bit of shopping around, and found this design, and decided to give it a try.  One week into using them, my headaches are gone, and I wake up with a much more relaxed, loose jaw.  The guards are small enough that they don&#x27;t fill up your whole mouth and set your jaw out of alignment, but just cushy enough--in all the right places--to cushion the brutal force of my grinding jaw.  I can sleep just fine with it, and I wake up with no sore spots or anything like that.  I wash it every morning and adjust it to fit every evening before popping it in my mouth.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and adjust.  So far, I&#x27;d highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Product was as described, howevert he blue parts were not flat, like they looked in the picture, but cupped around the teeth. The the blue parts were too thick at the sides and rubbed my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size one (the smallest size) did fit lengthwise.  Would probably work ok for someone with a larger mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I will stick to the placker&#x27;s dental guard, as they are more comfortable and can be purchased at my local dollar store.</li>
            <li> I prefer the older version that only sits on bottom row.</li>
            <li> fits well, I can still talk with them on and I don&#x27;t think my husband even notices when I have them on!!!</li>
            <li> I have veneers. The boil and fit types worked well but were not nice to my veneers!&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this, &#x27;DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit&#x27;, and &#x27;Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More Night Time Use&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of this DenTek&lt;br /&gt;Reusable and I don&#x27;t have to keep buying them every month&lt;br /&gt;Very Adjustable&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Soft or cushy plates which give lots of protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I guess my mouth is small and this is a little bulky - rubbed my gums&lt;br /&gt;Took about 3 weeks to get acclimated to it (I would wake up having taken it out while sleeping)&lt;br /&gt;I snored more when using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like both of them. Neither cause damage to my veneers.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I have a preference yet. Still using both of them.</li>
            <li> Great idea, but I was in so much pain, I couldn&#x27;t sleep. I followed the directions and it took about 20 minutes before my jaw hurt so much I took the guard out and decided to &amp;#34;return&amp;#34; it. I would not suggest this product.</li>
            <li> Not Good. Wearing sleep right for many years. Tried this item because it is cheaper. The adjustible pads do not stay adjusted overnight - at least in my mouth- resulting in cuts in my mouth and a cracked tooth. Stay away.</li>
            <li> Dentek has changed the guard. It fits perfect, does not move, and is now thicker. It will last longer, and has been a true teeth saver! I&#x27;m not a grinder, but a clencher while I sleep.  This guard is perfect for clenching or grinding. Has saved my teeth. :)</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks with this product I am going to have to stop using as I am afraid I might injure myself. On multiple occasions I found myself waking up with the guard in a ball chewing on it. I am afraid that I will accidentally choke on this thing in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is that it does help with night time teeth clenching, however, I will have to look elsewhere for relief. If you don&#x27;t have the problem I do with chewing on this thing it will probably work great for you. Just too small and not secure enough to stay in place and not be chewed on.</li>
            <li> I still grind my teeth at night, but at least now I&#x27;m not ruining my teeth!  This mouthguard is relatively discreet and the connecting mouthpiece under the bottom jaw is completely unobtrusive.  Definitely worth stockpiling for future use.</li>
            <li> I received this mouth guard and followed the instructions right away.  I found it did NOT fit my mouth well the way it was instructed, so, I turned it upside down ( I had read other reviews of people experiencing the same problem).  It fit much better that way.  It wasnt as uncomfortable once I flipped it.  It seemed to work well, although my mouth was a little sore the next couple of days. It seems the plastic may have rubbed my gums.  These would be a LOT more comfortable if they were made out of a pliable rubber?!&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if I would purchase this again....the price seems a little high for what you get.</li>
            <li> i have tried many others but this is the best one!&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t hurt, very flexible&lt;br /&gt;i definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Stop Grinding Mouth Guard by BioGrind, because its reviews were more positive than those for the DenTek Dental Guard. However, the BioGrind was too much silicone for my mouth and I stopped using it and decided to try the much more minimalist DenTek.  I am glad I did. I can keep it in my mouth all night without discomfort - I hardly notice it - and it is effective in greatly lessening the ache and occasional pain I had been getting from grinding my teeth. The DenTek may be worth 5 stars, it&#x27;s hard for me to know with so little to compare it to. In any case, I am happy with it and do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good alternative product other than prescription mouth guard. The latter is ten time more expensive. The actual usage is very different, but not necessary better.</li>
            <li> I am 25, petite and in grad school/ looking for a job. When I stress out, I tend to grind my teeth without noticing ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT and when I wake up in the morning.  On top OF that all of my teeth are sensitive to cold beverages and certain sweets.  Last year my dentist told me I could buy a guard, or they could mold one specifically for my teeth ( which would b 150- $250). I&#x27;m looking for a job so that wasn&#x27;t going to happen. I bought some large bulky- boil type night guard last year and it was a waste. It ALWAYS fell out of my mouth. I went to the dentist a week ago for my 6month check up, and she said I need to wear something to help with sensitivity. Went for something smaller like she said, and found these.  They may not appear to stay in, but don&#x27;t judge a football player by their size!  You wear them on your bottom teeth, and as you sleep they  naturally stay down, they don&#x27;t slip out or anything. I also have wisdom teeth in so they are great for the fortunate ones who can keep their.  I believe that gravity + the fact that your molars are heavier and are more likely to clamp down than your front teeth.  ON top of that I can breathe, they are comfortable and they don&#x27;t look or feel  like a sports mouth guard hanging out of your mouth ( play rugby). This is what my mom wants for her birthday, and amazon seems to have the best price .</li>
            <li> I wore this night guard last night, and I was up all night in discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;My gums were in pain for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I have worn a night guard from my dentist for many years without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was a  mistake.</li>
            <li> I am giving this guard 4 stars as it is comfortable for me to wear--way beyond my expectations. I started it out during the day for short periods until I got used to it. Then put it in while I read in bed, took it out for a while and then back in just before going to sleep and that worked for me. I could then sleep through the night with it, most nights. I did not believe I could use a mouth guard as I have severe insomnia and everything keeps me awake, but the price was low enough for me to give it a try. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I CLENCH my teeth, I don&#x27;t grind them and I am not convinced that it helps me with that as now I think I just clench the guard which is still gritting or clenching. I am now trying it out a little in the day to see if I will help remind me (and therefore, train me) to stop clenching. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> best out of the 3 I have tryed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple of years.  They are cheaper than many of the \\&quot;custom fit\\&quot; type mouth guards I&#x27;ve seen and work fine.  I hardly know I have it in my mouth. I get close to a year out of one before it becomes too chewed up (or in one instance, the dog got a hold of it and put a lot of extra mileage on it.)  No issues with comfort or fit/adjustments.  They do tend to accumulate tartar, but that&#x27;s just the environment in my mouth.  I scrape the tartar build-up off every couple of months and it&#x27;s good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Immediately after writing the above, I ordered a replacement Dental Guard.  Upon arrival, I was surprised to discover they had changed the design.  The new design is a bit \\&quot;clunkier\\&quot; than what I am used to, with side guards going in both directions.  The material seems to be a bit thicker too.  I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping in it yet, but my initial reaction is that it is less comfortable than it was.  The original design worked fine.  Can&#x27;t imagine why they would change it.  I&#x27;m lowering my rating.  After I&#x27;ve had a chance to sleep in it, I might put it back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2:  I slept with the new version last night.  It was OK. The bite pad seems a little thicker and the side wings on the top give it a distinctly different \\&quot;feel\\&quot; then the older version.  However, it was OK.  If I didn&#x27;t have experience with the way these used to be, I would probably give it a \\&quot;5\\&quot; but in comparison I have to give it a \\&quot;4\\&quot;.  Maybe it is \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; and it may even be better, but it is not what I am used to.</li>
            <li> I usually wake up 4 or 5 times a night and when I wore the DenTek guard, I slept better and only awoke twice.  The fit was pretty good and did not irritate my mouth at all.  My dentist recommended this very brand due to the wear on my teeth.  I&#x27;m glad he did</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable for me, i prefer the moldable bite nightguards. Digs into the side of my cheeks/inside of my mouth as I sleep.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. Too flimsy to even stay in the mouth. Choking hazard. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great night guard for me.  I rotate between upper &amp; lower teeth whatever I&#x27;m in the mood for. If I get a lil sore spot on my gums, which rarely but occasionally happens, I just move the guard lil bit &amp; the irritation goes away in a day or two.  I have purchased these on Amazon before. Sadly, I needed to replace them &amp; Amazon only has them available if you are a &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; member. I&#x27;m not sure what that is or how it works. But I had to spend my money on eBay since I could not find them here. Please bring them back Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Dentek Night guards for 1.5 years and finally wore my pair out by grinding a hole in them. These work great and have better protection than my last pair. These are the only night guards that I can wear because I can breathe in them. I can&#x27;t tell that I am wearing them while a sleep.</li>
            <li> This guard is fairly easy to use, and is somewhat comfortable, but I find the other DenTek dental guard significantly more comfortable:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CF0FNVO Dentek Professional Maximum Protection Dental]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though you have to boil water to form the fit, it&#x27;s nice having a perfect form fitting guard when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this one is ok, but the other is much better.</li>
            <li> I had a formal mouth guard made by my dentist and it lasted about 10 years until one day it cracked and was not usable.  Looking for an alternative, I decided to try this out.  It took about a week to get through one whole night without it falling out of my mouth.  There are often occasions when I find myself dreaming of food and I wake to find myself chewing on the dental guard.  It is a very small unit and one that I feel I will chew into oblivion or swallow.  I never had my fitted mouth guard fall out of my mouth and never accidentally chewed it because it was fitted tightly.  For the current time, it works as a temporary measure, but if you have the finances for a real mouth guard that is fitted, I would recommend that option.</li>
            <li> This is just about the only night guard I can sleep in.  Needed to prevent bruxism (sleep teeth grinding).</li>
            <li> I am a TERRIBLE grinder. I&#x27;ve had those lame-o trays before.. Awful! If I had to review the product out of the box, I&#x27;d give it a 3  because it fits poorly and is not comfortable. It rubbed on my lower gum and I knew I couldn&#x27;t live with it. So I took this &amp;#34;no boil&amp;#34; guard and boiled it.. Very quickly (like 4-5 seconds) and put it in my mouth very quickly (fitted it like a mouth piece) and wa-la!! Perfect fit, small and compact.. Fits my mouth perfectly with no pain! I figured it was worth a go because you get two in the box and I&#x27;m so glad I did!! Fits great, not bulky.. No more wear and tear on my teeth! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This dental guard is the only one that has managed to stick around so it is interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started buying one that you heat and shape but there were many upon many flaws with those that I can just say don&#x27;t buy them. They hurt, they lose shape, they fall out and they are difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough this cures every single problem listed above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this brings about new but for me less important issues.&lt;br /&gt;1) the plastic will warp fairly easily with biting thus you will end up with a mutilated dental guard which WILL cut into your tongue, the good thing is that you can trim off the ends that are fairly thin and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;2) it is weird because now all the pressure is on your molars which becomes very noticeable and takes time to get used to, you can wear it upside down and have them hanging from the top which is slightly more comfortable however I have a small mouth so I think I end up snoring because I wake up with a slightly dryer mouth&lt;br /&gt;3) the guard is adjustable however mine almost always end up stretched all the way out which becomes very uncomfortable if I wake up to pee and try to go back to sleep its more than likely I will not bother to resize the guard, so the locking mechanism should be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t end up using it every day but for the most part it stays in my mouth all night and is much less uncomfortable than the heat and bite versions. There is 2 in a pack but one of mine are already gone because I wasn&#x27;t careful when wearing it when I first started and I chewed into the thin plastic at the front somehow which made it more or less unwearable.</li>
            <li> It hurt my gums at first for a couple of weeks, but once I got used to it, it was all comfort. I love the fact that I could close my mouth when I go to sleep unlike other bulky ones.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work. I was very concerned it would dislodge and choke me in my sleep. How nice to be wrong! This stays put on my lower teeth all night and it prevents me from grinding my teeth together (doesn&#x27;t stop the grinding, but it prevents the lower teeth from touching the upper teeth.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit too thick for my mouth and I am trying to get used to it. Perhaps, I should have ordered a small one.</li>
            <li> These are great. Not too thin, but thin enough that you don&#x27;t notice you are wearing them. . . .</li>
            <li> This guard is really good. It is light and small. Until now it has been the best one i tried. You can ajust the length for diferente size of mouths.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this night guard.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and not only are they less expensive than a night guard at the dentist, I feel they are move comfortable too.</li>
            <li> The new version is thicker than my original one so it keeps my teeth apart better, which is what my dentist wants. This kit is definitely more affordable than the dentist made version. I&#x27;ll keep getting this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chipped my back teeth and had to have them fixed because I grind my teeth so bad and clench my jaws when I sleep. I&#x27;ve had many dental guards/night guards to help with this irritating condition that I have. Most of them fill up with saliva (sorry, gross I know) or are just too bulky for my mouth especially when I&#x27;m trying to sleep. So I thought I&#x27;d order this guard to try yet another one, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a lot but I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It comes as a two pack which is nice and it is very light and small which makes it very comfortable in my mouth. I&#x27;ve used it every night since I&#x27;ve gotten it and am very pleased how effective it is helping me not clench or grind my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various brands/styles of dental guard and this Dentek gaurd is the worst.  I can still grind my front teeth while wearing this guard, so it&#x27;s completely useless.  The bite-pads are just too thin to prevent my top teeth from touching my bottom teeth.  I&#x27;ve used generic versions of the same design and they were great.  I expected DenTek to match or exceed the quality of the generics, but I was wrong.  This was a total waste of nearly $30.  I&#x27;m going back to the cheap generics.</li>
            <li> I love them they fit great and they have help me so much with my grinding of my teeth when I sleep at night.</li>
            <li> These are working out very well...they are pretty comfortable and most definitely a lot cheaper than what the dentist was going to charge.  Will get another set soon for work , car, and other locations since I grind even when I am awake!</li>
            <li> I think that this can&#x27;t replace a real mouth guard done and adjusted by the dentist. Also is really small and sometimes i&#x27;m afraid to swallow it.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and I think that even on the smallest setting, it&#x27;s still big.  In the morning, my bite feels off.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY dental guard I am able to wear. I have tried several others that fit on top and it almost seems those cut my breath off...not saying this would happen to most people but it did to me. So I was eager to try the one that fits on my lower teeth. No such problems with this one at all. It does take some adjusting to get comfortable  but once it&#x27;s in, I can usually get through a big chunk of the night with it still in my mouth. The way it&#x27;s designed is reassuring to me that I won&#x27;t come close to swallowing the thing! I have heard it recommended and find it true after experimenting, to adjust it as small as you can to avoid any potential gagging problems. I have acid reflux anyway so it doesn&#x27;t take much to set this off. I also have TMJ and I know the box warns about wearing it with this;however, I also clench and grind  my teeth and have worn them down and they are very sharp. My dentist told me to just try something OTC so that&#x27;s why I even gave it a try. This is probably the best price you will find. Walmart in the store has the exact same 2 pack for about $30.00 !! So this is a big savings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more clutsy and bigger than the old Dentec I had. I hope they go back to the old design.</li>
            <li> My dog ate the mouth guard the dentist made.  It was going to be $725 to replace it and I bought one of these and used it for a few years and it finally wore out.  This was a replacement set.  Love them and it certainly saved me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I LOVED these night guards initially.  Actually, I loved them for 2 years.  They&#x27;re comfortable with no pinching or rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t grind my teeth while I&#x27;m awake, but I do while sleeping and I faithfully use a night guard for every nap and slumber.&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, I have cracked 2 molars while using this night guard (I even replaced it every 2-3 months).  They were both lower back teeth, not sure if that&#x27;s relevant, one real, one porcelain crown.&lt;br /&gt; Not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;I am super bummed because I have not been able to find a comfortable night guard since I stopped using these ( a year ago). On the plus side I haven&#x27;t cracked anymore teeth!</li>
            <li> Good quality, but I think they are a bit too thick as my wife seems to grind more with them in (like her mind thinks hey there is something to chew on). At least they protect quite well. Just need to keep them very clean as it does give you some funky breath.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a bulky boil to mold mouth guard and hated it.  This one is much better, I can actually keep it in most of the night.  If you have to wear a night guard this kind is the best, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several mouth guards over the years, because I&#x27;m a clencher &amp; grinder.  I love this dental guard - it&#x27;s small enough that it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like a hockey player.  I always ended up spitting out the bigger mouth guards while I was sleeping, which made them completely useless, but this one is very unobtrusive.  I like that it&#x27;s adjustable and I haven&#x27;t had problems with it adjusting while it&#x27;s actually in my mouth.  (I guess I bite down on it hard enough to keep it in place all night.)  And the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t completely wrap around ANY teeth, so I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are swimming in a bacterial sludge when I wake up.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;e had been clacking his teeth at night (waking me), so I had bought him a few night guards, including this one. He prefers the \\&quot;football type\\&quot;, partly because, I think, he can imagine that he&#x27;s football player. Personally, I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone would find that comfortable. Lo and behold, my dentist recently recommended I use a night guard (is grinding contagious??). Luckily, these came in a 2-pack, so to follow my dentist&#x27;s orders, as well as support my guy in wearing his, I tried out the remaining den-tek guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USER EXPERIENCE:&lt;br /&gt;I was anxious about it staying in place, but so far, it stays in place perfectly. I have a very small mouth (dentist uses kid-sized implements on me), and this guard does not feel bulky. In fact, I find it extremely comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s adjustable and has numbers on the adjustable part! The first few nights, I was guessing, but I quickly found that it fits me best at 2 on the left and 3 on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily talk and smile while wearing it! In most circumstances, it&#x27;s hardly detectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel it promotes excessive saliva production, \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot;, or drooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, I discovered these little, horizontal \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; (like a road speed bump) along the inside of my cheeks when I woke up. One on each side. I was worried, but upon investigation, found that there are similarly-sized slots in the guard and my cheeks must be pressing against them, creating the \\&quot;imprint\\&quot;. The bumps go away within a half hour of removing the guard, and now, several weeks later, they are much flatter and hardly noticeable when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I have not noticed any sores, scrapes, or areas of discomfort on either my my cheeks or gums, as other users have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;I clean the guard with soap &amp; water (dr bronner&#x27;s peppermint) upon removal AND prior to insertion. I slide the adjustable spine thing in and out several times, under running water, to help cleanse that part. A few times per week, I also brush the guard with my toothbrush (oral-b, powered) &amp; toothpaste (uncle harry&#x27;s glycerin-free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first pack did not come with a case, but the second one did and it&#x27;s HUGE! I might give it to my guy for his hulk-sized guard. I have found that the dark blue, round, pill-stacker canisters from the Vitamin Shoppe work perfectly. They are much, much smaller (&amp; they stack!). So far, I keep the lid off, but before we travel, I&#x27;ll have my guy drill a few holes in the side, to help with air circulation when I do cap it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER PRODUCT DETAILS:&lt;br /&gt;In the packs I have received, so far, the \\&quot;pad\\&quot; part is blue, not white, as currently seen in the official product photo. I wish they were white, or clear, as the blue makes them more noticable when I talk or open wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not easily seen in the official photo: the front \\&quot;bracket piece\\&quot; has a wave to it, so it fits over the frenulum labii inferioris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the product picture posted by Logan Dillard, which has notes. If you are on the mobile site, you have to switch to viewing the desktop site to see it. This pic is a better representation than the official product photo, of the guard I received. The wave part in the front is still somewhat hidden, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package states: \\&quot;Always been BPA FREE\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot;. They recommend you \\&quot;see your dentist for a consultation within the first 3 months of using the product\\&quot;. Their # is 800-4DENTEK, if you have questions. Be sure to read the lengthy notes on the back of the package, as there are some important considerations, such as TMJ, bite changes, etc., that users need to keep in mind. The info may be similar, but my package looks different than the one posted by another user (newer version?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to amazon for offering this on subscribe &amp; save, and many thanks to the other reviewers for sharing their experience. I rely onreviews to help me make good purchases; I hope this review helped you, as well.reviews to help me make good purchases; I hope this review helped you, as well.</li>
            <li> I do not like the new design. The old design only had the flanges that went down so that the dental guard fit nicely on your teeth. The new design has an upper flange that cuts into my gums. It is very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I wish Den Tek would bring back the old design and give their customers a choice of the guard that works best for them instead of totally discontinuing and replacing a product that worked just fine. I am very disappointed with this product and with Den Tek.</li>
            <li> I do not like buying dental guards that I have to boil and put a very hot dental guard into my moouth to shape it. This is a much better solution to my teeth grinding problem. One thing I think they could change is the height of the side parts -- my mouth is small and they dig into my gums when I wear them over my botttom teeth (as they are designed). I can also wear them flipped the other direction (over the upper teeth) and they do not dig into my gums as badly that way.</li>
            <li> For me, one of these will last about 6 weeks max. At about that time they start to split and pieces begin to come off. For the price, they should last a lot longer, but I&#x27;ll still order them as they do a good job.</li>
            <li> the the the the the the a a  be c d e f g h i j k l m</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooo happy this product works! The adjustability really makes it comfortable to wear at night. Also thank you for shipping to Canada!!</li>
            <li> This is comfortable and works as well as the expensive dentist&#x27;s fitted mouth guards.  It is well priced, and Dentec is a good name to rely on.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a little fear, I&#x27;ve used another kind for years, and I needed to replace it. My top teeth have bridges, caps, and molars, so I don&#x27;t want to do anything that would harm them! This dental guard fits very well, doesn&#x27;t have sharp edges to hurt your gums, and there are two in the package! It doesn&#x27;t make my jaw hurt in the morning, yay!! I would recommend it for anyone who tends to clench your jaws at night.</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple of months, the blue part can be uncomfortable on the gums and the band in front will move around if not placed correctly.  Other than that,  I don&#x27;t wake up with my teeth clenched together so I&#x27;m thankful for that.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Very minimal so it doesn&#x27;t feel to invasive, and they last for months which is great. Very comfortable and will continue to buy from them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this in a pinch.  It seems rough and makes my gums sore.  Maybe a bit too big, too.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve bought this product more than once and I&#x27;m still happy with its quality.</li>
            <li> Although the bite guard didn&#x27;t work for me, because I have a SEVERE teeth grinding problem, think the guard is a clever idea and would work for most with a lesser problem.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than a dentist. Reliable. Replace 1-2x/year with my grinding. Love them. Always come back for more.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard no matter how adjusted would cut into my gums under my lips. Extremely painful. Had to find a different solution.</li>
            <li> This may work well for someone who isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mobile&amp;#34; while they sleep, but I&#x27;m a kicker, and more often than not this thing falls out of my mouth.  A little difficult for placement too.  Don&#x27;t care for this, was hoping it was going to work being that it wasn&#x27;t bulky.  OH WELL.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product. I lost my mouth guard and thought this would be a good temporary replacement. It seems that that this guard focused pressure on one of my molars and may have caused or exacerbated existing damage. I stopped using the product after a few weeks because it bothered my gum. Within a few weeks my tooth began to become sensitive to hot and cold temperatures. I ended up having to have a root canal. I am not stating there is a direct correlation, but think that a full guard would have at least dissipated the pressure and not localized it.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly small mouth and I just can&#x27;t seem to wear this comfortably. It feels almost like it&#x27;s changing my bite and I&#x27;ll spend a good 10 minutes every night trying to make it fit. It has helped some with my nighttime grinding, but I may have to go back to the heat-and-wear guards.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth (dentist must use children&#x27;s size dental equipment). This is the only mouth guard I have been able to tolerate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many different kinds of nightguards. Essentially every kind you can buy, I&#x27;ve tried it. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve tested. It&#x27;s the most comfortable and best-fitting nightguard I&#x27;ve come across, and it includes two in each pack. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. I&#x27;m so glad I finally found a worthwhile dental guard.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about people flipping them upside down because they hurt their gums, I didn&#x27;t have the problem but found it more comfortable to wear them unpside down for my jaw issues. I hate mouth guards anyway so i&#x27;m not in love but it did the job. I only have to wear them for a month or so every couple years so I didn&#x27;t wear my down and I will be able to use them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 others and like this one best.</li>
            <li> I like this dental guard because it fits in my mouth such that I can close it while I sleep.  My mouth is small so the typical bite and mold dental guards do not fit me and my mouth will be dry when I wake up.  The plastic piece that you bite into is durable, though I do have a slight problem with the front part of the guard rubbing a part of my gums just a bit.  So far, I&#x27;m not bothered by it.</li>
            <li> At the recommendation of my dentist to try before spending money on a &amp;#34;fitted&amp;#34; bite guard, I purchased a package from Amazon. The pictures show EXACTLY what you get. I used my guard the first night, and while I did fall out the first night, that has not repeated in the weeks since. The guards make it impossible to grind your teeth, but they do take some getting used to. For my money, worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW: Buy the bite guard cleaner that is recommended and keep them stored in thier container.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband - This did not stay in place while he slept. Consequently, he woke up feeling that he might have choked.</li>
            <li> It was very small and very hard.  I was concerned about swallowing it.  I have previously used an acqualizer which is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Experienced TMJ and needed to stop clenching at night to prevent massive headaches. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing. It is easy use and I have had no problems. The bonus is that it fits OVER my retainers, which I also wear nightly. My headaches went away after only a few nights of use.</li>
            <li> The only comfortable, adjustable dental guard on the market that I know of!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if grinding your teeth is an issue.</li>
            <li> the guard fits perfectly is easliy adjustable and does the job of preventing the grinding of your teeth at night (bruxism).. It&#x27;s a whole lot less expensive than than a dentist create a night guard.</li>
            <li> Have been dealing with bruxism for the last seven years. If I don&#x27;t wear my bite-guard, my husband says that it sounds like I&#x27;m grinding my teeth to a powder. Didn&#x27;t even know that I was teeth grinding until he told me. At first I tried the regular DenTek dental guard, didn&#x27;t like it, but suffered with it. The original guard was very large and cumbersome. Didn&#x27;t fit that comfortably in my mouth (it&#x27;s pretty bulky). Found these and gave them a try. They are much more comfortable, but the slide around more since they are smaller and more flexible. Sometimes I&#x27;ll wake up and find that one side slid off. But happy nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouth guard (and the style they had before the re-design) for about 3 years.  If you had asked me at any point before the past 6 months or so, I would have given it 4 stars, but based on new information/experience, I would give it 1 star or even no stars, so I am giving it a 2 overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about it was that it was the only dental guard I could find that fit my mouth.  All others were so big and bulky that I could not close my mouth, leading me to mouth breathe all night and have problems because of how dry my mouth was.  I could close my mouth with this guard with minimal effort (though it still took effort/muscle contraction--it wasn&#x27;t as if I could just relax my face and my mouth would be closed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I used it for years (replacing it every 6 months or so) and thought I was doing great with protecting my teeth.  But then, I went to my dentist a couple of weeks ago, and she informed me that this dental guard was accelerating (if not causing) my teeth to shift forward.  I had complained to her about how my front teeth had become painful and crowding/shifting/twisting over the past 4 months or so (I could feel them moving!).  She asked about what kind of mouth guard I was wearing, and when I told her, she said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know why they still allow them to sell that type,&amp;#34; and explained how by not containing the front teeth, the pressure that is placed downward on the back teeth is displaced to the only place the energy can go--the front teeth.  She said to stop wearing it immediately and left my teeth shift back a bit, but that it is possible I will need orthodontics to undo the damage.  So, it seems by trying to save money and not paying for the mouth guard made by the dentist, I will have to pay more for orthodontics.  I must also note that since I stopped wearing the guard at night, my front teeth do not hurt anymore.  I am hopeful that my teeth will move back on their own, but it looks like I will have to get the guard that is made for me at some point soon.get the guard that is made for me at some point soon.</li>
            <li> Pretty comfortable, I have used them for a few months now. Hold up well, they do irritate my gums sometimes though, and the inside of my cheek too, but way worth the benefit.</li>
            <li> Does its job, but the &#x27;click to adjust length&#x27; does not work very well after a time. Also, the crevasses are difficult to clean sometimes, so I do not recommend using the toothpaste cleaning method - use the other one.</li>
            <li> This one did not fit me very well, so I&#x27;ve gone back to Plackers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing night guards for several years and have tried multiple brands, including the fitted device from my dentist. The DenTek &amp;#34;Comfort&amp;#34; Fit has to be my least favorite to date. The front jaw strap is uncomfortable as it will rub up and down on your gum line. The guard padding left my jaw at an angle that hurt after just a few minutes, and I did try adjusting it to different positions. The adjustment capability is more of a joke than anything; good luck getting them the same on both sides. On the bright side you did get 2...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days, I find myself back on Amazon to go back to the &amp;#34;The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced Comfort Dental Protector for Teeth Grinding&amp;#34;, the name may not be short, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the DenTek Dental guards they were so much more comfortable the previous dental guards I&#x27;ve tried so I really liked them.  I had a super expensive rigid mold from dentist that was too hard and not a perfect fit.  I also tried the tray with moldable impressions that were uncomfortable and super large.  These were small and super comfortable and I used them for about 4 years.  They did get worn out after 3/4 of a year but I kept replacing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not notice it was subtlety changing my bite ever so slightly so that one of my upper molars were getting impacted by the tooth below.  I noticed over the last few years that the specific molar getting worn with very sharp edges over time, but didn&#x27;t know why.  Two weeks ago the same molar chipped when i bit down on something hard.  When I had my first filling ever for the chipped molar (luckily I&#x27;ve never had cavities), the dentist noticed my bite was directly hitting that newly filled spot so much that we had to leave an empty space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR;  In my opinion, non-molded or non-fitted guards can change your bite and cause more harm than good.  I&#x27;ve since moved onto cheaper and smaller moldable guards that have been much better.</li>
            <li> I believe the design of this dental guard, with a thick-ish pad covering just 3 teeth, effectively increases the pressure exerted on the top of the tooth. The pad does have a rubbery &#x27;give&#x27; to it, and I found the guard comfortable to wear. However, I have a filling on the top of my back molar which broke twice while I was using this guard -- It cracked the first night after I started using the guard, and the repaired filling cracked again after about two months of use. Previously, I had never lost a filling.</li>
            <li> Listen, I&#x27;m old enough to remember a day when mouth guards were only used by boxers.&lt;br /&gt;After so many product trials this one by DenTek is the best. I am a HARD grinder. And my teeth&lt;br /&gt;suffer because of it. Ever since I started using the comfort fit, used during sleep, my mouth likes it !!!</li>
            <li> not as big as other mouth protectors and is easy to use. you can barely  tell it is in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This product was great until they added a flap that now cuts into my bottom gum.  They used to have only one flap and nothing would point toward the other gums.  Now, with the addition of the excessive rubber flap, I must return these.  They are not comfortable and the flap pushes into my gums when my mouth is closed.  Bad change DenTek.  Go back to the original minimalist design.</li>
            <li> For some reason I&#x27;ve ordered this twice and both times have received something other than what is in the photo.  I want the original product that is shown.  I tried wearing the first order and it is VERY bulky and uncomfortable.  The one shown is just the right shape for people like me who are not large in stature and have smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Can fall out of your mouth while you&#x27;re sleeping.  Needs to be adjusted more than I would like.</li>
            <li> I really like using these dental guards but the sides around the bit are too long and they push on my gums. I wish they offered a smaller option</li>
            <li> Product didnt do what it said it would. It worked great at protecting my back molars, only problem is now my front four incisors have been ground down revealing dentin, which i believe happened while wearing the product. (notice this mouth guard doesnt protect your front teeth?) Only used the thing for less than one month..</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust and serves the purpose of preventing jaw clenching.  The only negative is that I have not yet managed talking w/the guard in place.</li>
            <li> The bite plate is too thick, making my TMJ sore. Fortunately, the older model is still available on Amazon! Just keep searching for the clear package. They cost more,but I can&#x27;t use the new model.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.  In order for this to stay put you have to bite down on it, other wise it wiggles all over the place.  The pads are suppose to be mid molar, I couldn&#x27;t find a place that was comfortable with the strap around the bottom teeth it pulled my teeth back like I was wearing braces.  The pads are rigid and not fun to bite down on (think plastic spoon) and the strap across the front is also firm and would bump into my gums and scratch.</li>
            <li> Perfect  for  what  it  is  intended  for .</li>
            <li> This is really great product for dental guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mouth guards and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my mouth hurt by the morning. The teeth pads do wear out relatively quickly if you are a heavy grinder - I can&#x27;t make them last more than 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i first purchased these i was worried that the teeth portions would come off in the night and I&#x27;d swallow them - don&#x27;t worry, they are built so that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> caused me and my husband to grip even harder, not for me but glad I did not spend the money to have my dentist make one!</li>
            <li> Could not keep it in at night and never got it to conform to my teeth. Save your money and go to your dentist and have him make denture guard especially for your teeth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very hard, uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I have been a tooth grinder for years. My dentist told me  to look for a dental guard. These last for months and sometimes i will know i am grinding while sleeping. with the guard in place there is no pain in the morning. 5 Stars</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay where you set them. I could never get a good fit.  Perhaps this is because  had a much more form fitting one before and wanted something less obvious.</li>
            <li> These are good dental guards, but they are too expensive. I switched to the Plackers dental guards and they work even better (I don&#x27;t grind off the rubber/plastic like I do with the DenTek ones) and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> this is my first mouth guard (box had two) and it is so easy to use just adjust the little notches and you&#x27;re good to go (after cleaning it of course). first night using it and i slept soundly through the night(very rare). i will continue to purchase over and over again never will i ever consider the custom $400 mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Did not like these.  They made my jaw hurt more.</li>
            <li> Was in a bind after my chocolate lab ate my 900$ custom job.  Didn&#x27;t look too sturdy out of the box, but it does the job, stays in my mouth at night, not grinding, totally pleased.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is so great, that it made me write one. Truly the best dental guard I have every used! I used the first guard for almost a year and it stayed strong, did not break, crack or chewed thru at all. This product is the first (out of many I tried) that was small, comfortable and I could even talk while it is in my mouth. You don&#x27;t need to boil it, shape it in any way, just use it right out of the box. It&#x27;s excellent quality, great fit makes it well worth it! I love this product, recommend it to anyone and will only buy this dental guard in the future.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend.  Does not fit the mouth right and didn&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> This is the only  dental guard my wife is able to use, we are really pleased.  JRMc</li>
            <li> I like it. It has adjustments to place in your mouth. My complaint is the plastic breaks down after repeated biting during sleep. The front ribbon that keeps it in place has to be adjusted nightly. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t cover all my teeth. I don&#x27;t feel like I am going to choke.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Comfy. Does it&#x27;s job...and protects my teeth... :-)</li>
            <li> Guard protects my teeth.  Comes with two guards.  Both get chewed up in 3 months, then I send in for 1 more, so really you get 3 for your money.  Better bargain than what the dentist provides.</li>
            <li> I found these dental guards to be too hard. The front piece hurt my gums, and the piece that goes between the teeth is too hard. I stil woke up with headaches and sore jaw.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as expected and came quickly. It&#x27;s very small,flimsy, and pinches the gum line a little, but overall it works just fine. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little more than a month and hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> These did not provide the same protection as the plastic models (either from the store, or from the dentist,)  may work for others.</li>
            <li> Great price and very comfortable product.  I have never worn a dental guard and I was surprised that it did not bother me at all.  In fact, it was a joy not to wake up with a headache and pain in my jaw.  I am truly impressed.</li>
            <li> Works well for my grinding.  I go through about 2 mouth guards every 6 months.  I have pretty bad grinding and these help a lot.  The packaging has changed, but the guards have been pretty much the same the past 2-3 years</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t what I thought it was...in that it had a guard that went over the top and bottom. I didn&#x27;t want that...but its still ok. Does it&#x27;s purpose, and you do get 2! At Walmart they now charge you the same for 1! IRRITATING!</li>
            <li> Worked great, but found a cheaper product that holds up as well as these do.  I purchased these and they hold up as long as the DenTek did.  And much cheaper and a 10 count!!!&lt;br /&gt;Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More Night Time Use - 1 package (10 count) by Plackers</li>
            <li> It does not work. This can fall out of your mouth when using it. Not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Best dental guards. They last a while, but I change these out more than recommended. They are comfortable and smaller than the other dental guards.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable in that you hardly notice it when you are using it, especially if it is adjusted properly.  Adjustments are easy</li>
            <li> This is the minimalist version of a mouth guard and it definitely works. Better than those big over all the top teeth models, this little thing just sits between your molars. It is a little loose; when I yawn it nearly comes out, but it doesn&#x27;t, so no problem. Plus they sent 2, which I wasn&#x27;t aware of when I ordered.</li>
            <li> Not the right product, didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I tried several other products that are intended to be dental &amp;#34;night guards&amp;#34;.  I settled on this one because it&#x27;s small -- it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve placed some huge block of plastic in your mouth.  It&#x27;s very adjustable.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but it had several issues that finally made me reject it in favor of boil-and-bite type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low profile is nice, but the small bite pad means that all the pressure of your jaw is carried by a few teeth. I often woke up with a mild jawache using this as a result. The boil-and-bite type I use now is form-fitted to all my teeth, so the pressure is more evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustability is also nice at first, but after a few weeks it became loose, so the guard would resize itself overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the entire thing is just flimsy. It doesn&#x27;t feel durable at all, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I could pull it apart with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I didn&#x27;t find this to be a good value. It works to prevent grinding, but not comfortably, nor does it feel like it&#x27;d do the trick for long.</li>
            <li> The listing specified that the box contained 2 mouth guards, but it only contained 1.</li>
            <li> Best product for those that tend to grind their teeth at night. Easy to use and comfortable where it does not interfere with sleep.&lt;br /&gt;They do wear out over time.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Only had this mouth guard for about a week but it seems to be helping immensely. I picked it up after breaking a crown on a back molar tooth from grinding at night. This has been the most comfortable night guard I have ever purchased. In the past I have bought them and spit them out while sleeping. This one has stayed in all night. I can see signs of grinding on the guard, so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth while I sleep.  I have cracked teeth from the grinding.  I have tried many bite guards and most are bulky or they rub my gums and cause sores.  This one is very small and very effective.  The price is great because the 2 guards can last for months.  Its adjustable to fit any mouth.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to learn - when i switched dentists a couple of years ago - that I have apparently been grinding my teeth for years.  (Thanks, old dentist!  It&#x27;s cost me a mint in new fillings!)  These Comfort Fit dental guards are light and open but they protect well and stand up to my molars.  I got used to them very quickly.  I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product, however, it is still too big for my tiny mouth. Small mouth folks beware, eventhough its adjustable, it still may be too big for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to cut off the back ends of the guard to see if I can get a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasn&#x27;t too large, it would be a very comfortable guard.</li>
            <li> I lost my old mouth guard and these were the only ones wal mart had. At first I absolutely loved it,  it was comfortable and unobtrusive. However, the first night it gave me blisters on my gums. My boyfriend was using the other one and he chewed through it the first night. I dealt with the pain from the blister for a week thinking I just needed to get used to it but I have already chewed halfway through this. I would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that you can get into trouble with OTC mouth guards b/c they can hold your teeth in an unnatural or unhealthy bite position.  This one is great because it can move freely and just provides a cushion.  Love them!</li>
            <li> at first i LOVED this product, but then my expensive orthodontic work got all out of whack.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great product - it was comfortable, stayed in place, and was ungrindable, but i&#x27;d only recommend it IF you&#x27;ve never had any orthodontic work.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe what a difference wearing this dental guard has made. I do not wake up with jaw pain and I don&#x27;t grind my teeth! Thanks so much for this product. I am sure to reorder again!</li>
            <li> This product works great if you are worried about grinding your teeth. You might still grind, but you&#x27;ll grind on the rubber - not your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m a clencher. I think this device made my problem even worse. While sleeping, my body seemed to think it was a piece of gum in my mouth. I would wake up in the middle of the night just chewing on the thing. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I no longer use it anymore. I was waking up in the morning with a sore jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/19/2014: I re-purchased this product after using it for about a year. They apparently released a new version which is WAY better than the old. The old one would rub my gums, so I&#x27;d have to wear it a bit shorter than I liked, which caused it to float in my mouth and make my unconscious body chew on it. This new one changes the blue plastic that your teeth hit in a way that is way more comfortable. I&#x27;ll keep buying these for the foreseeable future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stand by my 3/5 star rating on the old product, however I would rate this new model 5/5 as it has solved my previous issues.</li>
            <li> I love the slim design of the mouth guard but with regards to protecting my molars specifically, it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I would constantly wake up the next morning with my jaw clicking and it being not aligned. It also made eating breakfast really hard because once I bite down on my food, my upper molars would hurt. I&#x27;ve been having headaches when most mornings when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose to give this stars despite the issues I&#x27;ve come across because I really love the idea of the design. It&#x27;s not bulky at all, however the pads are a bit too hard. I wish they would be made more of rubber based material.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for relieving my horrible teeth grinding while sleeping. I have broken three teeth, but since using this product I have not had any broken teeth. Also, this guard does not gag you as much of the other guards do. My jaw is more comfortable and relaxed throughout the day. Do yourself a favor and spend the money to get this great guard. I am not a spokesperson, just a very pleased customer.</li>
