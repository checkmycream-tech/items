            <li>this product, you minimize the thought you put in daily routine and knowing you are doing it right.</li>
            <li>I use BB cream and foundation, I&#x27;ve tried using Olay brushes clean my face first, or use just facial pad with cleaner to wipe off first, or do nothing, and then use this product, each case I saw more or less yellow stuff on facial pad after using the feature (very little after Olay brush).</li>
            <li>used for two weeks, like it so far.</li>
            <li>I used them to apply multiple times floral water to deep moisturise my skin, works very well.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>

            <li> I have been taking care of my ailing parents and after 6 months my face (and my soul) looked very tired, lack of glow and sad. I decided to do something about it before all these sad lines became permanent. I found this device and bought it.  I used the lightest mode and my face instantly felt and looked tightened and freshen after the very first use. Now I am using it every other evening and 1 week passed my face looks so much better and resume the glow my face used to have. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Nice product. I use it everyday to my face before I go to bed. My skin feels very comfortable after using. Good.</li>
            <li> so far so good. I like it.</li>
            <li> very good produce,my husband and i use it every day.we can see have change in the skin and i will recommend it wo my friend.</li>
            <li> This is NOT WORTH to buy. It only makes you feel &amp;#34;STICKY&amp;#34; on your face. It did not work as what it had described. Don&#x27;t see any improve on skin or moisture. Very disappoint of this product. If you want to spend this much money, I would recommend Clarisonic. It has same function and it&#x27;s much CHEAP. The most important thing is their service is BETTER!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 1 week now. I can see obvious improvement on my skin, I would definitely recommend it to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleansing feature works really well despite I heard from my friends saying this feature doesn&#x27;t help too much. I use BB cream and foundation, I&#x27;ve tried using Olay brushes clean my face first, or use just facial pad with cleaner to wipe off first, or do nothing, and then use this product, each case I saw more or less yellow stuff on facial pad after using the feature (very little after Olay brush). And I can see my pores are getting smaller. Probably just like the menu says you may shrink pores simply by cleaning them. I would say Olay brush cleans my face really well too, but it feels a bit harsh on your skin (and I didn&#x27;t see my pores shrink), this one is quite gentle.&lt;br /&gt;2. Other 2 features are great out of question, definitely help your skin absorb skin products. I used them to apply multiple times floral water to deep moisturise my skin, works very well.&lt;br /&gt;3. Product comes with English menu, no guessing. 5 minutes auto time out feature is handy. Charge once, last for long time.&lt;br /&gt;With this product, you minimize the thought you put in daily routine and knowing you are doing it right. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> quite useful on my boyfriend&#x27;s face, and I love the absorb function very much. Logistics is fast. satisfy shopping experience,</li>
            <li> Love it ! quick shipped from Japan! easy to use. Recommend add ENGLISH version hand book in it. :)</li>
            <li> Little miracle worker. My skin is visibly more hydrated after using this product. Worth very penny.</li>
            <li> Good small gadget that helps the skin</li>
            <li> the device come with 3 mode,&lt;br /&gt;cleansing *ion move from the your skin to the device&lt;br /&gt;moisturizing *ion move from the device to skin&lt;br /&gt;mask *ion move back and forward..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;technically the ion help to push the impurity out from  ur skin to the cotton pad during cleansing, and ion will help to push the moisture in during moisturizing and during mask, the ion will pulse in and out from ur skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far loving it. it does make a different skin texture after 2 weeks of daily usage&lt;br /&gt;the skin feel more supple and hydrated</li>
            <li> Good product, been using it for a month, like it a lot!</li>
