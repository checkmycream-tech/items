            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really do much for my type 2C swavy hair; it does however provide some much needed moisture and it does leave my swavy hair feeling soft and ithas an ok scent to it that doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>Recommend for mothers with babies with curly hair who want something light that brings out the natural curls.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I know that this isn&#x27;t an all natural produce, but I don&#x27;t care. This product works wonderfully on my 4a natural hair!! My hair feels moisturized without feeling oily. At the same time, my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s suffocating.  My husband can&#x27;t stop playing in my new oober soft hair! Also, the product prevent my hair from snapping and breaking when I&#x27;m detangling . This will become a permanent part of my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> Great price and good product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff work well&lt;br /&gt;Soften my hair&lt;br /&gt;This product is best for my hair medium to course hair</li>
            <li> Great product.  I did not purchase this to activate curls.  I bought it as a hair moisturizer.  I only use on dry hair as I saw little if any effect on wet hair.  I am VERY pleased with this product.  I use it in conjunction with S curl activator which moisturizes my hair in a totally different manner.  This gold product is the MOST effective detangler on dry hair I have ever used.  I can no longer use shea butter or coconut oil and these &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; products  do not have those products in them.  This will be a staple product for me for sure. It applies odorless but there is a little odor noticed the morning after application.</li>
            <li> This product is the best moisturizer. You will be pleased!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product to Moisturize my hair, because my hair was very dry, and the dryness was causing my hair to break. I tried alot of product, but non was helpful until i discovered SOFT SHEEN CARE FREE CURL GOLD INSTANT ACTIVATOR.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Combined with some mousse, works terrific on long curls.</li>
            <li> Love this, use this daily.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for my 4c hair. It melts my hair making it soft to the touch. It also helps my hair grow faster.</li>
            <li> This product is very useful.</li>
            <li> Best hair cream on the market...been using for 20+ years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work but my hear did look better with it</li>
            <li> While I do not think this product will give you curls if your hair is not &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or has a &amp;#34;natural curl&amp;#34; pattern. It will however enhance your curls and moisturize your hair better than many products of triple the price.</li>
            <li> This Soft Sheen, care free curl Activator, was bought for a friend that lives in Switzerland, she loves it, and can not buy it there.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and it works well on curly hair to keep in moisture. It did not leak, like another product that I ordered at the same time and were delivered together.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST STUFF FOR YOUR NATURAL HAIR. USED IT FOR YEARS AND HOPE THEY NEVER TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET. IT DOES NOT WEIGH YOUR HAIR DOWN OR MAKE IT STICKY. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Finally i found a product that works w my crazy curly hair!!! Use it after shower and let it air dry! Incredible curls!!!</li>
            <li> I am a natural that has curly dry hair. This summer as been hotter than the devils den!!! I wish I could be the natural lady that could do wash &amp; go&#x27;s..not so much. I get horrible single strand knots! I realized that its just not for me. My hair tends to be dry and I just had to find a product to help me. I purchased this from Walmart for 6 bucks;  if you do not/ can not find this in your area purchase it from here. My hair feels so  soft, I just can&#x27;t stop touching it. I recommend spraying your hair with  water first then apply it followed by a butter to seal it. I plan to reapply  it daily or every other day. I read reapplying the butters can blockout the moisture and hair will be dry. I honestly really recommend this product to ppl that are seeking healthy moisturized hair! Loves it !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product from WalMart for only 6 dollars. I was looking for something to help my transitioning hair in the front of my head really curl up like the rest of my natural hair, when I stumbled across this. It DIDN&#x27;T help my relaxed ends to wave or curl, but it really brought out the curl pattern near my roots. It is also a WONDERFUL moisturizer. My hair feels so soft and manageable once I apply a quarter sized drop to that section. It also has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp oily. Does leave my hands kind of sticky, though.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have awkward curls. Not perfect beach curls, and not kinky tight curls, and the type of curls that HAVE to have product in them to be maintained. I use this before I gel or moose my hair and the curls stay nice all day and my hair has definitely benefited.</li>
            <li> Soft Sheen Care Free Curl Gold Instant Activator is an AMAZING PRODUCT!!!..It&#x27;s great for straight, curly, relaxed or natural hair!..I use this daily and it&#x27;s very moisturizing! It&#x27;s never leaves my feeling heavey or greasy! Just really soft and well moisturized!..After I Co-wash my hair I apply this as my leave in moisturizer and then fan-dry...It works well whether I use heat on my hair or not...(Which is not often b/c heat is so damaging) But this product is a staple in my hair regimen!:)</li>
            <li> Love my hair with Care Free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest. I was skeptical about Care Free Curl Gold, because I thought it would be slimy, goopy, and/or drippy. (Some of you who remember the Soul Glo commercial in Coming to America know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a trusted stylist recommended it to me, I gave it a try and am now a believer. This took my wash and go style to another level. It&#x27;s the best curl defining product I&#x27;ve ever used and and it&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer too. Curls and shine ALL day! The mild and pleasant scent isn&#x27;t irritating and the product is reasonably priced. For this curly girl, that&#x27;s a win all around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Bought this at Walmart today it makes my curly thick hair so soft and less frizzy its a great price for the bottle too</li>
            <li> Wife always uses this product. Says she can&#x27;t have anything else</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of moisturizer and leave-in conditioners and none of them work half as well as this does! My hair feels great and looks great. I have thick, bushy, curly hair and this is the only thing that works well with it. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer this is great as a &amp;#34;curl activator&amp;#34; not so much...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been giving this &amp;#34;curl activator&amp;#34; the benefit of the doubt for about six months now and it doesn&#x27;t really do much for my type 2C swavy hair; it does however provide some much needed moisture and it does leave my swavy hair feeling soft and ithas an ok scent to it that doesn&#x27;t linger.  I&#x27;m half way through the bottle and I will finish it but I will not be re-purchasing it because it honestly does nothing to &amp;#34;activate my curls&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the drugstores and I have used this product for most of my adult life. Love it. It does its job with my&lt;br /&gt;curls and dryness.</li>
            <li> Im mixed my mothers white, growing up my mother was recommended to use this on my sister and I hair especially when I was a baby. It really brought out our little curls and til this day I use this in my daily hair routine really moisturizes great. Love that it does it&#x27;s job and is light- not greasy. Recommend for mothers with babies with curly hair who want something light that brings out the natural curls. My mother used this back in the 90s I&#x27;m sure theres new products out there but I find this product to always be the one I run back too. Hope this helps.</li>
