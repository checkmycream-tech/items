            <li>I don&#x27;t know why Roagaine stopped selling the sprayer, but it worked best for me.  </li>
            <li>Best part about this product is that its a spray and not a dropper.  </li>
            <li>Product works great, and the applicator is the best way to use liquid rogaine.</li>
            <li>I’ve had great results with Precision Minoxidil Spray</li>
            <li>Great product!&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think he would have loved this applicator</li>
            <li>Got one satisfied husband here!</li>
            <li>It’s a highly effective spray.</li>
            <li>What I liked most about this product is it being a spray.</li>
            <li>How easy is that?!</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t know how effective this will be, but the applicator is better than the dropper and way better than the foam.</li>
            <li>but it works better than the foam</li>
            <li>sure.......</li>
            <li>I think he is pleased with the results he has achieved so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received  this product free or at a reduced rate to evaluate and give my (our) honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I all agree results may take more than a month or 2 to be noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased it mostly for the spray...</li>
            <li>He says there is no unpleasant smell (I can&#x27;t say for sure because he won&#x27;t let me watch him use it.lol)</li>
            <li>this at a huge discount to test and review.</li>
            <li>--- I have great accuracy when I need to pinpoint specific parts of my hair that need growth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This appears to be working fast as I can see a new crop of fuzz popping up that I have not seen before, so that is a good sign that this stuff as something over most of the minoxidils out there.  </li>
            <li>What makes this stand apart is the unique applicator.</li>
            <li>He loved being able to spray it to target specific areas, and of course he said it worked (I could also tell that his hair looked much thicker and fuller).</li>
            <li>His hair is becoming thicker and I&#x27;m not seeing as much scalp through his hair.</li>
            <li>It is very promising.</li>
            <li>I purchase it and found that this only for top part of head but not for front what I was hopping.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks my hair was becoming thicker and lovelier and he got jealous :-)</li>
            <li>Still awaiting the results, still using first bottle.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to use than Rogaine.  </li>
            <li>The elongated nozzle allows it to really get onto the scalp without wasting it soaking your hair.</li>
            <li>He recommends massaging it in after applying to really get it in there and to not have any of it run away.</li>
            <li>This stuff appears to work fast.  </li>
            <li>I am partially bald, on top, and at a minimum my goal is to stop the balding, and close the bald spot.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a foam, it still is very runny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m diligent about the morning dose, but not so much the evening one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He says it is easy to use, he just sprays a little where he needs it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if he has been totally faithful to using it day and night.</li>
            <li>Even so, I can see a thickening and even some regrowth near my hairline.  </li>
            <li>This product came highly recommended from a friend who had recently switched from Rogaine to this product.</li>
            <li>this was from the same company and this would work really well with the shampoo and conditioner, he finally agreed to give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is only in his early twenties and already suffering from thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using generic minoxidil  for years and barely a change.  </li>

            <li> Sprayer didn&#x27;t work for me.  Sprayer is on a swivel - who needs it.  Looked to me like the package had been opened before and stuff had drizzled out the side.  Spray just dripped out of the nozzle it didn&#x27;t mist.  They should just stop selling this.  I don&#x27;t know why Roagaine stopped selling the sprayer, but it worked best for me.  I&#x27;ll just go back to finding other spraying bottles and repurposing them.  I had been using the small bottles for eyeglass cleaner, that my optometrist gave me for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended from a friend who had recently switched from Rogaine to this product. He loved being able to spray it to target specific areas, and of course he said it worked (I could also tell that his hair looked much thicker and fuller). So, I gave it a try and…. It works, it works, it works. It’s a highly effective spray. What I liked most about this product is it being a spray. It makes it so much easier to use than Rogaine.  I’ve had great results with Precision Minoxidil Spray --- I have great accuracy when I need to pinpoint specific parts of my hair that need growth. My fiancée has commented about how my hair looks and feels thicker and I can also tell after using this spray. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Now what I expected! will see in a month.I purchase it and found that this only for top part of head but not for front what I was hopping. So, now I have try and use because I can&#x27;t return this product.</li>
            <li> Need hear to grow try it</li>
            <li> Product works great, and the applicator is the best way to use liquid rogaine. However, the liquid does cause itching and dandruff but it works better than the foam so it balances out.</li>
            <li> I have just started to use it and I do seem some minor difference in the results.</li>
            <li> My Sasquatch has been extremely hesistant to use any hair growth products, he is all &amp;#34;if I go bald, I go bald. I don&#x27;t care!&amp;#34; That was until I started using Regenepure&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner. After a few weeks my hair was becoming thicker and lovelier and he got jealous :-) Actually, he used the excuse that he wanted to see if it helped his dandruff. Yeah....... sure....... So when I told him that hey. this was from the same company and this would work really well with the shampoo and conditioner, he finally agreed to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good. His hair is becoming thicker and I&#x27;m not seeing as much scalp through his hair. With Minoxidil you have to give it time to work, it doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it does work. What makes this stand apart is the unique applicator. The elongated nozzle allows it to really get onto the scalp without wasting it soaking your hair. He recommends massaging it in after applying to really get it in there and to not have any of it run away. My ex used minoxidil and I think he would have loved this applicator, he always complained about the foam and the drops being hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This formula is for MEN ONLY. There are women&#x27;s formulas, but this is strictly for the gents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a discount as a blogger, to review, however that in no way affected my review.</li>
            <li> Got this for my hubby and this is what he can say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;m using it!  I like it.  Especially the self directed Sprayer.  I have been using generic minoxidil  for years and barely a change.  This stuff appears to work fast.  I am partially bald, on top, and at a minimum my goal is to stop the balding, and close the bald spot.  This appears to be working fast as I can see a new crop of fuzz popping up that I have not seen before, so that is a good sign that this stuff as something over most of the minoxidils out there.  Great product!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this at a huge discount to test and review. Got one satisfied husband here!</li>
            <li> I got this Minoxidil Spray for my son ( who shall remain nameless ; ) He is only in his early twenties and already suffering from thinning hair. When he was younger he was known for his awesome hair, so losing it has been devastating to say the least. He has been using this product for about a month now, and we are starting to see a regrowth. Not a huge amount yet, but there is definitely a change. It is very promising. I can&#x27;t really say if he has been totally faithful to using it day and night. I really think with continued regular use, he just may get the head of hair that he used to have, or at least somewhat close to that.&lt;br /&gt;He says it is easy to use, he just sprays a little where he needs it. He says there is no unpleasant smell (I can&#x27;t say for sure because he won&#x27;t let me watch him use it.lol) I think he is pleased with the results he has achieved so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received  this product free or at a reduced rate to evaluate and give my (our) honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t know how effective this will be, but the applicator is better than the dropper and way better than the foam.</li>
            <li> Still awaiting the results, still using first bottle. Hair stylist, the directions and I all agree results may take more than a month or 2 to be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and application method are a big PLUS. Other products tell you to apply XXX oz. How the heck can I measure that out in the shower with shampoo in my eyes?! This item tells you 6 sprays using the directional nozzle twice a day. How easy is that?! This is the strongest selling point to me, as all 5% Minoxidil should be the same, huh?</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a foam, it still is very runny</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this product for my friend. He has noticed that His hair is not coming out in his comb and his hair seems thicker.</li>
            <li> I purchased it mostly for the spray... but it broke after using it 3 or 4 times only. I will go for the cheaper options in the future and transfer the product to a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Precision for a couple months now. I&#x27;m diligent about the morning dose, but not so much the evening one. Even so, I can see a thickening and even some regrowth near my hairline.  Best part about this product is that its a spray and not a dropper.  4 sprays on towel dry hair and I can even style with it (imagine a very weak gel).</li>
            <li> I bought this in combination with Rogaine for men. The two works faster together.</li>
