            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product even if only for the great smell it adds to your hair.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser told me about this after my Keratin treatment but the price at the salon was sky-high as usual, so amazon had the best price for this.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works as a detangler as well as blow dry protectant spray.</li>
            <li>I smells tropical and clean.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell of the product, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>This blow dry spray smells so good</li>
            <li>for my fine, tangly hair it is way too much oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another star is that Kenra Professional Platinum Blow-Dry Spray was available through Prime (I seldom buy anything that isn&#x27;t available through Prime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for shining my hair and keeping the flat iron from damaging it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft and dries quickly!</li>
            <li>I do think this product helps my hair dry more quickly.</li>
            <li>I first found out about this product from a friend who was a beautician.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not overpowering, and reminds me of chocolate/coffee, but not in an instantly recognizable way</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product at my salon while getting my hair done.  </li>
            <li>I smell my hair all dayyyy after using this ;)</li>
            <li>Soaked the nozzle in hot water, but it did not solve the problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice to have when you&#x27;re short on time to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>This really cuts down on the blowdry time and more importantly the frizz after.</li>
            <li>Not sure how good it is for her hair though.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair and this spray</li>
            <li>I highly recommend !</li>
            <li>hair is also very oily/thin and frizzy hair (before and after the keratin) and had no issues with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>but if you spray too much your hair may look stringy or oily.</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy, fairly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The oil is not right at the top of the list</li>
            <li>This is a &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; product!</li>
            <li>Too bad because the smell is wonderful,</li>
            <li>This product would probably work okay for someone with coarse, dry hair but</li>
            <li>&amp; I literally cannot live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>Helps my hair dry quick</li>
            <li>The way it arrived was a bit sloppy, it was inside a package filled with peanuts and just a bottle with tape to secure the lid on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have super thick, super curly hair that I need to straighten obsessively each day.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a smaller amount on the crown and more on the bottom half of the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly anyway, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything, but</li>
            <li>never blow dry my hair without this first.</li>
            <li>my daughter wants it sprayed in her hair that she does not blow dry.  </li>
            <li>With this being said, the product leaked out into the packaging making the product half full and sticky on the outside.</li>
            <li>my hair is still wet, I apply Kenra - I can use as much as I want without it ending up with a greasy texture or appearing greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a ton of split ends, and when this is in my hair you can barely even tell that I haven&#x27;t had a trim in years.</li>
            <li>It does not take much at all, even for long hair, so it lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> Not only does it protect my hair while I&#x27;m flat ironing</li>
            <li> It really does cut down the dry time and if they had a perfume of this smell I&#x27;d purchase that and use it like I use butter!!</li>
            <li> It is not enough moisture of my dry hair alone</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry hair each time I use the flat iron, and spray it in my hair when damp after I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> It used to take my hair about 30 minutes to be fully dry.</li>
            <li> It reall does reduce blow dry time.</li>
            <li> drying typically use to take me near almost 20-25 minutes just to get my hair completely dry and round brushed.</li>
            <li> I have thick and natural curly blonde hair and blow</li>
            <li> especially if you flat iron everyday, leaves your hair shiny and protected from heat damage..</li>
            <li> As far as reduced drying time, I&#x27;m not sure because I have not timed it.</li>
            <li> This product cuts down on drying time, adds a little extra volume, leaves hair feeling soft and cuts down the frizz.</li>
            <li> Shortens blow dry time by quite a bit!</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was pink for breast cancer awareness.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this the other night and my hair was dry in less then 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I will never not own this again, it has made a summer blow dry possible instead of going curly all summer.</li>
            <li> We use it about every other wash.</li>
            <li> so I am in search of a leave in cream that it not too oily or too dry to apply to my hair on the lower half and then spray a few sprays of this to protect it while drying.  </li>
            <li> I have thinnish hair and usually takes me 15-25 minutes to dry my hair, when I used this it took me under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Cuts my blow drying time in half</li>
            <li> I look like a rat that has crawled out of the sewer when I use this and even when I just use a little my hair is greasy.  </li>
            <li> i prefer not to buy an item and have to worry about it being wasted on the packaging.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I was obsessed with using &amp;#34;its a 10 blow dry cream&amp;#34; before this and now find myself reaching for this Kenra Blow Dry  </li>
            <li> I have never had an issue with packaging but this has by far been a disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday without it leaving a thick layer in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product has decreased my blow drying time in half.</li>
            <li> If you are hesitant about this product, please try a smaller bottle to try it, but I promise you, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have always hated drying my hair because it takes so long and in the summer time it totally sucks.</li>
            <li> but I have to use it sparingly because it makes my hair dirty faster.</li>
            <li> It was at my door before the phone got cold!</li>
            <li> &amp; then I end up with crap that smells like mens&#x27; deodorant spray or dial hand soap in my hair.</li>

            <li> Smells wonderful, like all Kenra products. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This blow dry spray smells so good my daughter wants it sprayed in her hair that she does not blow dry.  I think it really does cut down on the blow dry time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year . I am very happy with it . Leaves my hair soft and smells so amazing . Cuts my blow drying time in half</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Not only does it protect my hair while I&#x27;m flat ironing, it helps it look and feel very smooth and manageable. Very delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> I first found out about this product from a friend who was a beautician. She used this on my hair and I was amazed by how great this worked! The smell of it is amazing! I could wear it as a perfume and if you can go a day or two without washing your hair it creates an even sweeter smell to your hair. I have thick and natural curly blonde hair and blow drying typically use to take me near almost 20-25 minutes just to get my hair completely dry and round brushed. With this product it takes me 10-15 minutes tops! It really does cut down the dry time and if they had a perfume of this smell I&#x27;d purchase that and use it like I use butter!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Shortens blow dry time by quite a bit!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this product and the texture it gives my hair. My stylist uses this, and it always leaves my hair shiny and silky when she blow dries it, which is a feat with my course, curly hair.</li>
            <li> This spray on detangler is  super. It does exactly what it says  It was at my door before the phone got cold!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Leaves my hair very soft and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> Great product and timely  delivery</li>
            <li> Pros, product arrived earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Cons, when I opened the package the two products weren&#x27;t even wrapped in plastic to keep them from spilling. With this being said, the product leaked out into the packaging making the product half full and sticky on the outside. I have never had an issue with packaging but this has by far been a disappointing experience. i prefer not to buy an item and have to worry about it being wasted on the packaging.</li>
            <li> I do think this product helps my hair dry more quickly. I don&#x27;t love the smell of the product, but I can live with it. The bottle I received was pink for breast cancer awareness. I will reorder this product again when it runs out. It&#x27;s very nice to have when you&#x27;re short on time to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> This was a a surprise christmas gift. She said it was hwe favorite gift. Cuts hair drying from 45 min. To about 14 min.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I have very frizzy hair and this spray keeps it under control and smells awesome!!</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dry spray ever made! If you are hesitant about this product, please try a smaller bottle to try it, but I promise you, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The way it arrived was a bit sloppy, it was inside a package filled with peanuts and just a bottle with tape to secure the lid on the bottle. The smell is delicious it&#x27;s not overpowering, and reminds me of chocolate/coffee, but not in an instantly recognizable way, it&#x27;s just the closest thing i could describe it to. i love the way it sprays like a mist, most heat protectant sprays kinda just shoot a lot into one area, but this kinda goes everywhere with an even amount, it also makes drying time way faster. I have thinnish hair and usually takes me 15-25 minutes to dry my hair, when I used this it took me under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, fairly frizzy hair. This really cuts down on the blowdry time and more importantly the frizz after. I will never not own this again, it has made a summer blow dry possible instead of going curly all summer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for shining my hair and keeping the flat iron from damaging it. I use it everyday without it leaving a thick layer in my hair.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in my daily routine!</li>
            <li> LOVE!  I was first introduced to this product at my salon while getting my hair done.  I have SUPER-fine hair, but LOTS of it, and it takes forever to blow-dry.  This product cuts down on drying time, adds a little extra volume, leaves hair feeling soft and cuts down the frizz.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It does not take much at all, even for long hair, so it lasts a long time.I recommend using a smaller amount on the crown and more on the bottom half of the hair. The smell is amazing and lingers all day. I have really fine hair but a lot of it, this product works wonders especially if you flat iron everyday, leaves your hair shiny and protected from heat damage.. I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product, I absolutely love love love it!!! Smells wonderful and protects dry damaged, processed Hair!!!</li>
            <li> Like this product and protects hair from Elmer&#x27;s of blow dryer</li>
            <li> I love the Kenra line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived as described and packaged to ensure no damage.  My bottle was taped so there was no way the cap would slip off during shipping - smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another star is that Kenra Professional Platinum Blow-Dry Spray was available through Prime (I seldom buy anything that isn&#x27;t available through Prime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair is still wet, I apply Kenra - I can use as much as I want without it ending up with a greasy texture or appearing greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the Kenra line was more affordable.  Ordering from Amazon, however, is still cheaper than going through my local salon for this product.</li>
            <li> YES! amazing. My hairdresser told me about this after my Keratin treatment but the price at the salon was sky-high as usual, so amazon had the best price for this. I also use this after the Keratin treatment was gone and it leaves your blowdryed hair so silky and shiny. Anyone can use this. It also smells amazing when you spray it and even after blowdrying. MMM I smell my hair all dayyyy after using this ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an oil spray mist so a little goes a long way. Two sprays - mid shaft and ends of hair and run through with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is also very oily/thin and frizzy hair (before and after the keratin) and had no issues with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I was obsessed with using &amp;#34;its a 10 blow dry cream&amp;#34; before this and now find myself reaching for this Kenra Blow Dry  spray instead.</li>
            <li> never blow dry my hair without this first.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on me and I&#x27;ve now started using it.  It smells great and makes my hair smoother.  As far as reduced drying time, I&#x27;m not sure because I have not timed it.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good!  It does a good job on protecting hair from heat, but the smell is the best part!!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Helps my hair dry quick but I have to use it sparingly because it makes my hair dirty faster. I would recommend this product even if only for the great smell it adds to your hair.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the bottle&#x27;s spray mechanism didn&#x27;t work - product just leaked out. Soaked the nozzle in hot water, but it did not solve the problem. The seller said to mail it back to her, but if she got it to work, she would charge me for postage to return it to me. The fact was that I could not get it to work, nor could my husband, my friend or my mom. So I transferred the product to another bottle, then sent the faulty bottle to the seller so she could see for herself that it just did NOT work. I will buy the product again, but through another seller.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works as a detangler as well as blow dry protectant spray. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have always hated drying my hair because it takes so long and in the summer time it totally sucks. This product has decreased my blow drying time in half. It used to take my hair about 30 minutes to be fully dry. I used this the other night and my hair was dry in less then 15 minutes. This is an awesome product and when I am done with it I will be buying the full size. It sprays a nice mist and comes out evenly and has a pretty nice fruity smell. Similiar to a tropical fruit smell. Don&#x27;t pass this up!</li>
            <li> i love the way this spray smells</li>
            <li> Yes, yes and yes.  I do like this spray.  It is not enough moisture of my dry hair alone so I am in search of a leave in cream that it not too oily or too dry to apply to my hair on the lower half and then spray a few sprays of this to protect it while drying.  The oil is not right at the top of the list but if you spray too much your hair may look stringy or oily. I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this when I was there last. It smells incredible and the price on Amazon was very good. My hair dries quickly anyway, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything, but did I mention how GOOD it smells? :-)</li>
            <li> I have heard it called the Crack for hair! I love it lol</li>
            <li> Definitely speeds up drying of my daughter&#x27;s hair. Not sure how good it is for her hair though. We use it about every other wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 years now &amp; I literally cannot live without this stuff. I have super thick, super curly hair that I need to straighten obsessively each day. I have a ton of split ends, and when this is in my hair you can barely even tell that I haven&#x27;t had a trim in years. I use it on my dry hair each time I use the flat iron, and spray it in my hair when damp after I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another strong selling point is that it smells wonderful... Now, I have read reviews where people say something smells great &amp; then I end up with crap that smells like mens&#x27; deodorant spray or dial hand soap in my hair. I am telling you, that if you enjoy smelling feminine and like you could eat your own hair that it smells so good, this is the stuff for you and you can trust me.</li>
            <li> This product would probably work okay for someone with coarse, dry hair but for my fine, tangly hair it is way too much oil.  I look like a rat that has crawled out of the sewer when I use this and even when I just use a little my hair is greasy.  Too bad because the smell is wonderful, but it&#x27;s too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> Excelent and easy read</li>
            <li> I love this product. I smells tropical and clean. It reall does reduce blow dry time. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great hair product.  Protects the hair while straightening it.  It also smells great &amp; makes your hair soft.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A few sprays and it really speeds up your drying time while smoothing your hair and adding a bit of shine. It also smells delicious.</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; product!</li>
