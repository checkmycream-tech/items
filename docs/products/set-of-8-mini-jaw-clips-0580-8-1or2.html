            <li> Theyre beautiful and strong enough to keep in place for the most unruly hair.</li>
            <li> The picture makes them look bigger than they really are. When they say &amp;#34;Mini&#x27; they mean it, 1&amp;#34; high, 1&amp;#34; wide</li>

            <li> a little smaller than I thought, so hard to get around my pony tail</li>
            <li> Great, little decorative clips!  My only suggestion for improvement is to package multiple clips of the same color together, or allow the buyer to choose which colors are included.</li>
