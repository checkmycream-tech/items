            <li>Longevity was outstanding, so was sillage.</li>
            <li>Came off more feminine to me.</li>
            <li>Mine had the top pop off in shipping.</li>
            <li>It was interesting but just not for me as it was very sweet.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne and it arrived quickly as well!</li>
            <li>I would have to say this seemed to have a very sweet and strong smell.</li>

            <li>It really lasts and you should be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So I got a half full sample as well.</li>
            <li>It is subtle and sophisticated.</li>

            <li> The one on the right is one I purchased late last year.  </li>
            <li> It maybe be a small bottle but the quality of this makes you need not so much.</li>
            <li> First time I smelled it was on a hair cutting client of mine</li>
            <li> You will at first be shocked by how small this bottle is, but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its not authentic, but she still loves it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I only give it a one star this time because it&#x27;s OBVIOUSLY a knock off.  The one on the right is one I purchased late last year.  The one on the left was most recent.  Beware!  Givenchy is AMAZING when it&#x27;s the authentic stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed PI before.  The fragrance is my husband&#x27;s favorite. If you love PI, this little one is good for travel.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Good worth for its size.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this scent! I bought the larger size for home and the smaller for traveling.  It goes perfect with my signature fragrance Givenchy Amarige. We have tried many, our kids have given us many, but we both come back to Givenchy!</li>
            <li> Good product, I recommend it 100%, savory aroma to seduce a beautiful woman. Shop responsible and attentive, I recommend it. .</li>
            <li> WISH I HAD A BIGGER BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time and I couldnt be happier with the price and size. It maybe be a small bottle but the quality of this makes you need not so much. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne and it arrived quickly as well! Perfect transaction!!! Would definitely buy from them again! Bought for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and he loved it like I knew he would! :)</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size. We just wanted to try this out the see if it worked for me. Not a lot of money and a nice sample size. Great value.</li>
            <li> Smells good but iv smelled better. Definitely a unique smelling cologne but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again. Just not for me. I suggest you buy a sample size bottle before you invest in a larger one.</li>
            <li> Smells great, was a gift and he loved it.</li>
            <li> I know this is for men, but my stepdaughter smelled it on her Dad and wanted it for herself!  Lol. I didn&#x27;t want her to use up all of her Dad&#x27;s, so I got her this mini to see if it would work for her.  Its not authentic, but she still loves it.  Once she&#x27;s a little older, I&#x27;ll spring for the real thing.</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorite colognes. The ladies love it and I cant get enough of them loving it just like I do. Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mens cologne! First time I smelled it was on a hair cutting client of mine and I asked what he was wearing, when he said Pi by Givenchy. I ran out and bought it for my then husband for Christmas, that was 15 years ago! Still love the smell, just not on my ex-husband! LOL, a great deal at a great price as a tester, you will want to buy larger once you smell it!</li>
            <li> First off PI is probably my favorite fragrant. It is subtle and sophisticated. You will at first be shocked by how small this bottle is, but it goes a long way. It really lasts and you should be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This was a good cologne overall. Longevity was outstanding, so was sillage. Literally could smell it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that said. I would have to say this seemed to have a very sweet and strong smell. Came off more feminine to me. It was interesting but just not for me as it was very sweet. It also seemed to have one note the whole time. No real depth as far as what it hinted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get this tester be advised. Mine had the top pop off in shipping. So I got a half full sample as well.</li>
            <li> Omg this is not even funny this is  a free sample and shouldn&#x27;t be sold at cost DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for travel and at the office.</li>
