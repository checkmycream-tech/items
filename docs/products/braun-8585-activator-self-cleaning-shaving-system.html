            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Also the self cleaning feature works wonderful as well.  </li>
            <li>turns out it also does a great job of telling you where you have and have not shaved as well!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Brauan 8585 for over a week now, and I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>

            <li>after experimenting with almost everything i feel like i can tell you what the best shave is.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;first, the best blade is the Mach 3 Power,</li>
            <li>the Mach 3 Power is the best.</li>
            <li>The Braun 8585 is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used - including the Braun shaver I had in college.  </li>

            <li>The battery life is impressive with this razor.  </li>
            <li>Very impressive.</li>
            <li>I bought it anyways, and this shaver is the best thing I have every gotten.  </li>
            <li>With that said this shavor is great!</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m getting a almost perfect shave.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t believe that any electric will come quite as close as a blade, this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li>The auto cleaning works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>And, it still gives an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>That is incredible service!!!</li>
            <li>For my face, Braun has the best blade technology of anyone.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re thinking about a great shaver, this is it! &lt;</li>
            <li>This shaver is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I like best: &lt;br</li>
            <li>Works flawlessly!!  </li>
            <li>The machine works excellently in all regards.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt the best!</li>
            <li>and he was very happy</li>
            <li>It is excellent to have a shaver that cleans itself, and I hope that it continues working well for years to come.  </li>
            <li>will not deny that this is the best electric razor I have tried.</li>
            <li>The Braun 8585 Activator is one of the best shavers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that Braun makes the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Once you learn how to use it, it works excellently.</li>
            <li>It is, without exaggeration, awesome.</li>
            <li>He has to have the best and finest things in any category, and he hates everything unless it was his decision to purchase.  </li>
            <li>My search for the perfect electric continues.</li>
            <li>It is perfect!</li>
            <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>This is the best product that I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product.</li>
            <li>The build quality appears very good, with exception to the plastic travel case.</li>
            <li>You get a very good close shave without harming the skin.</li>
            <li>I have heard great things about their products and I must admit that I am quite impressed.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s as good as an electric likly gets, and I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need a \\&quot;perfect shave\\</li>
            <li>and yes I fell for the Fusion which worked beautifully</li>
            <li>shaver seems to have excellent build quality and everything from packaging to touching is very good (as you would expect from high-end shaver).</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>It gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li>Also the self-cleaning mechanism is a great add-on as well.</li>
            <li>I have been happily using Braun shavers for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>My friend had one and the convienence seemed great, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s 60 power Intel Play microscope did a great job answering this question.</li>
            <li>After four months, I&#x27;m still happy with it, and still works as I described.  </li>
            <li>The Mach3 tripple blade razors did a great job giving me a close shave, but sometimes TOO close.   </li>
            <li>Working great.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco is great, but requires lots of maintenance.  </li>
            <li>I get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>The shaver still works great, no problems at all.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt I am absolultely happy with my shaver.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the self-cleaning system work great.</li>
            <li>this machine is great.  </li>
            <li>Cleans, and shaves great.  </li>
            <li>It is a great shaving system.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First shave out of the box was great.</li>
            <li>But after a week, it is great.</li>
            <li>lol) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li>This is a great unit.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The self cleaning system is great.  </li>
            <li>A great shave, and self cleaning.  </li>
            <li>By the way, the docking/cleaning station works great also.</li>
            <li>if you wanted a great close shave, add up the cost and then you will see that this thing is a steal.  </li>
            <li>cleaner is a great part of it too.  </li>
            <li>The charger cleaner is a great idea but stock up on the refills.</li>
            <li>I was immediately happy with the shaver.</li>
            <li>This Razor is great</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my husband based on the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>The self cleaning is great.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the Braun 8585, or 8595!!!</li>
            <li>If the shave was amazing or even very good, I would probably indulge these inconveniences, but the shave is nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li>I have used a corded Eltron 770 for many years with excellent results.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this razor but good luck if you need warrantee work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a lot of raves in the reviews here that might lead one to believe this shaver can give you a perfect shave while doing your taxes and improving your love life.  </li>
            <li>Best electric shaver he ever had better than Norelco or Remington has owned both.  </li>
            <li>Let me start out by saying the Braun 8585 EASILY provides the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Excellent machine makes the move from a blade easy.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best electric razor there is.  </li>
            <li>Very Happy with it, feels great, the cleaner is cool.  </li>
            <li>in all though, the 8585 is an excellent product, LOUD but excellent.</li>
            <li>is that its lights are bright</li>
            <li>this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>this is really a good option.</li>
            <li>While it was a good shaver, I still had a problem with shaving rash every morning.   </li>
            <li>The good:  </li>
            <li>But not as good as the premium two to four blade razors like Sensor and Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Have been using a Norelco for about 10 years and it was a good razor, but this shaver gives me alot closer shave.</li>
            <li>The Braun razors are just that good.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the shaver for four months now, so I believe I can give a good overview of its performance.</li>
            <li>all in all, spend the darn money and get a good...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get just as good a shave.</li>
            <li>This razor is a good compromise.  </li>
            <li>It gives him a good shave and the cleaning system</li>
            <li>With this razor, no problems at all, the shave is really superior.  </li>
            <li>razor does a good job getting to all of the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>quite* that good.  </li>
            <li>The stand also eats up a fair amount of space and an electric outlet in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>good at getting hard-to-reach curved surfaces (chin, jaw, adam&#x27;s apple).</li>
            <li>but the quality of the shaver suggests that the cleaner may be just as good.</li>
            <li>I often wonder whether they suggest that waiting period to give you more time to forget what a good shave looks like! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>So if you want the best shaver and the best shave possible, go with the 8585 Braun Activator shaver!</li>
            <li>Super product - does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased with his \\&quot;self-cleaning\\&quot; razor, although he didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to keep purchasing the cleaning solution packs.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>He seemed very satisfied with it</li>
            <li>My mom was happy too, so I&#x27;ve said all that to say, he seemed really pleased with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good shaver with an effective cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, the shaving quality is superb.</li>
            <li>clean&amp;charge is very cool - and the smell is GREAT.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>But after using this razer since Christmas, I have to admit that I LOVE THIS THING!  </li>
            <li>razor is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll tell you first hand that I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Number One pick for foil shavers and I am glad I went with their reccomendation!</li>
            <li>Very good quality unit here - definately worth the money</li>
            <li>Braun works really great and is impressively better than my old one which I was very happy with.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing machine.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is amazing and works like a champ.  </li>
            <li>Its just amazing</li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave .Very</li>
            <li>I can honestly say the shave is as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>he said that he was going to buy his own when he got home.  </li>
            <li>which is nice.  </li>
            <li>(Kind of like ink in your printer.)</li>
            <li>it would have been nice if Braun had a delay start or an automatic timer -</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is anything I should be blaming on the blade though, and it&#x27;s improved over time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every time because I don&#x27;t think it is nessesary but to each their own.  </li>
            <li>Safe and close but not as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li>got a lower end norelco 3 head shaver a year ago - and i liked it -</li>
            <li>I thought that was the best that an electric razor could do at a reasonable price.    </li>
            <li>Does anyone want a good deal on a top of the line Norelco?    </li>
            <li>The razor is I think one of the best, my boyfriend really really likes it.</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution is in its own plastic, throw-away container.  </li>
            <li>self-cleaning feature is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>It was nice when they made things in germany.</li>
            <li>I find it gives nice close shaves.</li>
            <li>So now I have a nice charging stand, but no cleaning.</li>
            <li>The system does not initiate its own cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say I will not be returning to a razor blade again.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to give this razor a try after reading so many good reviews of it.</li>
            <li>The shaver comes with a nifty plastic travel case which I found a nice touch - it keeps my shaver from dropping whiskers all over everything in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>It takes atleast 5 or 6 shaves before the hair, kind of, gets used to the shaver.</li>
            <li>My problem is do I let him use my Braun 8585 or do I get him his own?</li>
            <li>Overall, i&#x27;d say great performance and a great buy!</li>
            <li>This spontaneous purchase raised the bar for what I expect from my morning shave.  </li>
            <li>The Braun does a fairly impressive job with quick shaves and can easily power through 3-4 days growth without a problem.</li>
            <li>It does a very respectable job and has many quality features to go with it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased and very glad I didn&#x27;t buy the 8595.</li>
            <li>Despite claims of running out quickly and evaporation here on Amazon.com, my experience has been great.</li>
            <li>but the Braun self-cleaning system is quite nice, using a lightly scented alcohol solution to give the razor a good cleaning between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- the self-cleaning system is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>And the best part, you can clean the blades right in the sink, and you can shave in the shower using shave cream.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this is the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li>So far, it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>But, the most amazing thing....  </li>
            <li>, the best shaving cream is the Nivea Shaving Gel, i get the sensitive skin but any of them will do.</li>
            <li>Buy Braun or Philips, but this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I find the 8585 the best shavers I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>or so this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to wait a year before I reviewed the product because I wanted to make sure I was still loving it, and I am.</li>
            <li>Braun is superior to Remington in all respects except the important one, \\&quot;close shave\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know this for sure, because I would never dream of using my husband&#x27;s shaver, but it seems like it would work just as well for women, since they don&#x27;t make women&#x27;s shavers as nice as this one.  </li>
            <li>Very fine product.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Provides a good, clean &amp; close shave.</li>
            <li>For years I used Norelco shavers and became unsatisfied with them when I could no longer get a good clean shave on my neck.  </li>
            <li>as a side note - the fact that my face is so smooth - it is actually very appealing to the ladies when i give them a kiss.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver 3-4 months ago and would have to say that i am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>The new foil system gives an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li>I get a great shave quickly and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>This shaver cleans very easily, looks nice and keeps your sink clean.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and cuts great every single time.</li>
            <li>Yes, it cleans the razor great, but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It is fast, very comfortable and gives a GREAT shave.</li>
            <li>satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The razor is OK.</li>
            <li>Love all the features but this shaver doesnt cut as close as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I was having more and more irritation resulting in</li>
            <li>I was also spending more time and money with the razor shave.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>there are many things Braun should do better to improve its usability.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic model can use water to rinse it (actually you can use it during bath) and I consider it a superb design over Braun.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun, please pay more attention on the usability and maintainence.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>About a year ago I tried a triple-foil shaver, which hurt my face more than razors do.  </li>
            <li>have the feeling that the shaver was invented and programmed to make Braun more money in-between shaver purchases.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the 8585 after much research, and I am happy to report that after a month of use I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>my most recent setup was a Mach 3, plus the excellent \\&quot;King of Shaves\\</li>
            <li>and i had more razor burn/irritation than i do with a blade.</li>
            <li>The razor did okay on my face but on the jawlines and the neck it didn&#x27;t cut a darn thing.  </li>
            <li>To be sure, it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the Mach3 blade did.  </li>
            <li>To me the self-cleaning stand is just one more bother in my already cluttered world.  </li>
            <li>I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; electric shaver for many years.</li>
            <li>It takes more time every shave, but not cleaning it is a blessing I can&#x27;t fully describe.</li>
            <li>Looked at the top of the line Panasonic, Norelco, and Braun.  </li>
            <li>Works even better.</li>
            <li>But for $50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade.  </li>
            <li>He says it gives him a better, closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Most people probably wouldn&#x27;t notice, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I didn&#x27;t think this razor worked that much better</li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve heard this</li>
            <li>As a side note I also bought one for may dad who has more of a rounder face and he noted this shaver did a better job then his Remington.</li>
            <li>I have tried many razors and no manual razor is safe for me.  </li>
            <li>Electric razor models always seem to come and go over time and nothing is better than this one.  </li>
            <li>but it sure does.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased</li>
            <li>What more could one ask?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more than pleased.</li>
            <li>These Germans sure know how to make the gadgets.  </li>
            <li>i used a cheap electric shaver before and after 3 weeks my head looked like edward james olmos&#x27; face!  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, having gone through several Remington and Norelco models.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t sure how close i&#x27;d get of a shave....</li>
            <li>I like the lemony smell, and the razor does a much better job when it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Save the difference for some more CCR2 refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, the shave you&#x27;ll get is about as close as most electrics will get with virtually zero skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as this shaver, but my skin does much better.  </li>
            <li>I suppose that depends on many factors.</li>
            <li>can only reiterate some excellent tips that have already been given: &lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63, so you can bet I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors over the years.  </li>
            <li>now that I&#x27;ve tried the Braun 8585, I have to say that I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for three weeks now and am 110% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be as close as what I had with a razor but was extremely happy to see that it&#x27;s much closer and easier.</li>
            <li>The Braun 8585 is simply the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The closeness of my shaves have never been better, but this is still not the foremost reason I recommend the Braun 8585.</li>
            <li>I love the way this thing is self cleaning/charging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of the best looking electric razors I&#x27;ve seen, and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with this shaver...</li>
            <li>This razor gives a much better shave than I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would not have taken the time to write this review if I hadn&#x27;t been exceptionally pleased with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li>Braun just better not stop making it.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Let me just say, I LOVE this shaver.</li>
            <li>, I recieved this shaver for X-mas from my girlfriend, and it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic!   </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver the beginning of Dec 2004 and am quite pleased with using the shaver</li>
            <li>so I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I make sure</li>
            <li>how many times I went over the darn things.</li>
            <li>I was more than pleased after receiving this product.</li>
            <li>so it will be interesting to see how this is shaving in June.</li>
            <li>I have used a number of different electric razors and this is the best.</li>
            <li>My answer is, probably yes, for most of us.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it is the best electric shaver I have owned or ever used, in my life.  </li>
            <li>Whats not to love?  </li>
            <li>the fact that it comes with so many parts and maintenance requirements, I wish I hadn&#x27;t made the purchase.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head is great, and I really like the cleaning station.</li>
            <li>After going through 3 Norelco units in as many years, I switched to this foil shaver in 2008.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stuck with them for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t need to recharge the battery more than once a week anyway.</li>
            <li>The funny thing is, I remember getting an excellent shave with the first Braun razor I used 24 years ago.</li>
            <li>My son is just coming into the age where he is needing to shave more often.  </li>
            <li>Thats what i love about this shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a better deal.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t to say I use them until they stop working - I use them until the lure of something better comes along.</li>
            <li>Blades and screens spend more time touching your face than you do, and the \\&quot;blade chamber\\&quot; invariably becomes dusted and choked with stubble, skin and the detritus of electric shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Braun 5428 for many years and decided to upgrade to what all here say is a better shaver, i.e., the 8585.   </li>
            <li>OK, but not recommended.</li>
            <li>Oh, ok, so maybe I tried it out.  </li>
            <li>Using Lectric Shave makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I switched from Mach3 + Edge gel to this beauty and couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice.</li>
            <li>And of course the automatic cleaning function is lovely.</li>
            <li>It has much more power than any of its predecessors.  </li>
            <li>so I probably don&#x27;t put this shaver through the rigors of my more hirsute brothers out there.  </li>
            <li>However, I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>8585 is mechanically very nice and the base/cleaning system works very well.  </li>
            <li>the 8585 shaver is not only one of the best shavers i have ever used, it is so easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Now if I&#x27;m in a hurry, in two to three minutes I can get a pretty good \\&quot;go to work shave\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors.  </li>
            <li>self-cleaning cartridge changeout is very simple, a very good design.</li>
            <li>First of all and most importantly it gives a great, clean, close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>The self cleaning action is great and it saves me time when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Since a close shave irritated my skin with most razers, I would have to wait 2 - 3 days for a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>this shaver does not produce the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver, it is the most comfortable and bloodless</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been comfortable using a blade because I always ended up with more knicks &amp; cuts</li>
            <li>It holds comfortable in your hands, and by virtual of its design, shaves much better than the rotary razors at curvy places around the chin.  </li>
            <li>Most people won&#x27;t notice the sound at all, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver is fantastic, as most of the reviewers agree.  </li>
            <li>Also, even though it has the 3 screens, it took a much longer time to shave and it did not do that good of a job.   </li>
            <li>I get a good shave, though I still have to work it under the chin to get all the  hairs that don&#x27;t grow straight out.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you need to leave home to understand how good you really had it.... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>The shaver is sleek, effective, and powerful.</li>
            <li>He loved it, and wants another one this year.</li>
            <li>Removing the same amount of beard with the Eltron 770 was quick, easy and yielded excellent results.</li>
            <li>I find cleaning every other day is perfect.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor 3 weeks ago, and have had the best shaves of my life each time I use it (every other day).</li>
            <li>I find that I do have to shave every day or every other day to get an excellent, easy shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy on the face and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>The foil is so easy on my skin that I can shave twice a day</li>
            <li>* having to clean my shaver - just let the magic box do it.  </li>
            <li>This shaver makes it easy to touch up an evening shadow without hacking up your skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>5/5 stars and I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable shave!</li>
            <li>My model 6520 Ultra Speed is stiil going strong.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit more care and effort that it probably should, but the irritation is so much lower (sometimes none) that I honestly don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>The self cleaning system is really nice, and it does do a good job of cleaning the razor provided you use it daily.  </li>
            <li>It fits in the hand nicely and it has a good solid feeling to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got pretty sensitive skin and get razor burn very easily (thus my decision to stop shaving with blades), but the Braun Activator 8585 has been great to my skin.  </li>
            <li>When I first bought this product, I liked the shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a perfectly clean, fresh smelling shaver each time.  </li>
            <li>It is especially good at getting hairs that lay down.</li>
            <li>For a comfortable, easy goingelectric shaver, the 8585 is a charmer.comfortable, easy going electric shaver, the 8585 is a charmer.</li>
            <li>and it works as good as new.</li>
            <li>previously had a Braun 6520 for years and was very happy with it until the day it died.  </li>
            <li>The rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water.</li>
            <li>This razor shaves fine.  </li>
            <li>I had owned the previous version of this razor and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Given no irritation anywhere on my face and neck, the 5% differential is just fine.  </li>
            <li>The hair seems to curl more quickly.</li>
            <li>Not true, this is the best.</li>
            <li>I received the new Braun 8585 for Christmas and this one is by far the best one I have used.</li>
            <li>I can shave in less than a minute and the quality of the shave is great and getting better as I get better at using the Braun and my face adjusts.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Smart Logic\\&quot; battery system is also nice, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about when you do and don&#x27;t recharge the battery.  </li>
            <li>- well she wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what i meant - so she just went out and got me the nicest shaver they sold at the store!</li>
            <li>Excellent buy, close shave (with a little work).</li>
            <li>This might be a unique experience for me but this shaver is still going strong after almost 10 years of use.  </li>
            <li>They could claim to be \\&quot;99.5% as close as a blade\\&quot; and be completely accurate.  </li>
            <li>Now, I know that may sound like heresy, but brother, once you try it, you&#x27;ll be amazed.    </li>
            <li>This razor is perfect for anyone looking to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; a few minutes and a lot of hassle out of their morning routine.</li>
            <li>A longtime razor user, he tried the Activator and liked it so much</li>
            <li>Great power does not need come with bigger noise! &lt;</li>
            <li>I believe it to be the finest electric shaver available today.  </li>
            <li>Razors will get you the closest shave available.  </li>
            <li>Overall, its a great shaver.</li>
            <li>And even then, to get a smooth as silk face takes a LOT of time.  </li>
            <li>And it feels absolutly fantastic on my skin</li>
            <li>It picks up the scragglers and leaves everything smooth as silk.   </li>
            <li>Last winter, I stumbled a Remington Titanium razor at a great price and decided to buy it (my Braun needed replaced).  </li>
            <li>Does the price difference sound rational to you?  </li>
            <li>The led is as bright as the razor is loud.  </li>
            <li>You know, its not often I can say something is fantastic</li>
            <li>The cleaner also works great, it needs cleaning only after 3 or 4 uses.</li>
            <li>say - i can not believe how smooth my face was -</li>
            <li>The self cleaning system keeps it working smoothly from shave to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with those, you get what you pay for; a cheap shave.  </li>
            <li>--I have a clear view from the bed into the bathroom, and at night the lights on the shaver are too bright.  </li>
            <li>I get the best results from shaving everyday.</li>
            <li>self cleaning feature is a great extra.</li>
            <li>I experience zero irritation and the shave is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t get another Braun like this if it was free.....</li>
            <li>&quot; (i.e. I&#x27;ll give you the disposable razor or printer for free - you just have to buy replacement blades and ink cartridges forever) but the cost involved in replacement items for the 8585 is not negligible.  </li>
            <li>Gives a close and comfortable shave.   </li>
            <li>Overall a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was a fantastic shift.  </li>
            <li>After the initial \\&quot;getting to know you\\&quot; phase, I had great shaves every morning.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be cheap, upgrade.</li>
            <li>In short, this electric razor is great.  </li>
            <li>find the cleaning solution (which has a light lemon scent) needs to be changed about once a month, and 3 packs cost somewhere between $15 - 20.  </li>
            <li>He said that the razor did not give him a smooth shave on his neck area and it irritated the skin.  </li>
            <li>She now looks fabulous and also heartily endorses the Braun 8585 Activator.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not quite as good as an old fashioned blade</li>
            <li>The Norelco was far superior.</li>
            <li>I had been using one of Norelco&#x27;s better shavers in the 8000 series and it did an all right job.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to clean up fine bits of hair each morning.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>However, I have had a couple of ingrown hairs too, something very rarely had with the Integral.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I&#x27;m getting a lemony fresh clean shave every morning.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works great at getting those hairs that lie flat on my neck.</li>
            <li>Since the first shave it has been very comfortable.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT if you have very good hearing like me, the charger makes a VERY high pitched sound constantly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t charge as quickly as the Norelco and it is not as easy to clean manually as the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>, it gets no better then this, it shaves me closer then a razor, it is simply perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a first, and I have been using the most exspensive electric shavers for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>The shaver did leave me with some irratation at first but most of that has subsided by now.  </li>
            <li>, I get a good clean shave, the machine is easy to clean and maintain, and quiet.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy shaving my head along with my face,it keeps me feeling clean and cool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not provide me with a clean or a close shave.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t clean it in the sink like you can with a Panasonic wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that as it changes its cleaning recommendations, it never goes backwards, even if you clean it by hand.</li>
            <li>I always take the foil off and clean after each shave.</li>
            <li>it cleans itself better than I possibly could, and the lemon scent is nice.    </li>
            <li>To save on the cleaning cartridge, I tend to dock and clean it after every-other shave - it still comes up with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I do like having a clean razor</li>
            <li>It keeps the shaver clean, lubricated, and smelling chemically clean.</li>
            <li>Add $60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor.  </li>
            <li>The shaver holds its charge well and stays clean with the charger/cleaner system.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to just hand clean every day (20 seconds).  </li>
            <li>I tend to have to replace the cleaning solution around every 30 days - I would clean the shaver every day.  </li>
            <li>If you want a completely smooth shave, this may not be good enough.</li>
            <li>He can always keep the shaver clean while not spending a lot of time cleaning it.  </li>
            <li>But with the Clean and charge unit, these issues are moot.  </li>
            <li>I just run a couple strokes of a Gilette Fusion razor to clean up a bit of stubble</li>
            <li>the 8995 have an lcd display that tell you when to clean</li>
            <li>The lockable pivoting head puts the cutter block and foil directly where they need to be for the best shave possible.  </li>
            <li>The 8595 shaver has an LED display which indicates the charge level, but honestly this seemed somewhat superfluous since most guys don&#x27;t shave for hours on end without putting the shaver back into the recharging unit and even if you did go for hours on end you could still use the power cord.  </li>
            <li>thing to note is to NEVER try to clean this razor or inside cleaning stand with WATER.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to worry about taking the shaver apart to clean it.</li>
            <li>The blue charging light isn&#x27;t that bright</li>
            <li>Nice engineering, a clean comfortable shave, not too loud.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes also have to shave twice a day if I want a somewhat clean look in the evening.</li>
            <li>The cleaning doesn&#x27;t clean either of Remington&#x27;s \\&quot;pop-up\\&quot; cutters well.</li>
            <li>I have a knack for somehow managing to half amputate my leg while shaving, so it was a nice easy and effective switch.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver based on the many positive reviews on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Speaking as someone who has been shaving for 20+ years, primarily with blade over electric (Gillette Mach 3 for last few years), I can honestly say the Braun 8585 is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it&#x27;s not as good on the neck hairs and other challenging spots.   </li>
            <li>The major improvement on this model is the head design, that alone, is possibly why it is perfect.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend about 4 years ago, and it still works as if it was new, and it shaves very smoothly and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Even at it&#x27;s best, the appearance is generally that of a second day cut with a Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Self cleaning system is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it would be much different (or maybe even favorable) if you compare it to the price of good quality blades, gel, and aftershave.</li>
            <li>have a full beard.</li>
            <li>have always liked Braun Shavers (I owned about 5 so far).</li>
            <li>The 8585 actually feels good on my face and there&#x27;s no pinching or irritation to speak of.  </li>
            <li>shaver is rather quiet compared to some and has a fair amount of power.</li>
            <li>The Braun is a much closer shave, but takes much more time to shave.  </li>
            <li>The blace does a much better job and much faster.  </li>
            <li>This is a good shaver, but I will only discuss my complaints:</li>
            <li>The cleaning fluid lasts a good amount of time, even with almost every day use.  </li>
            <li>To me that&#x27;s a good enough trade-off to stick with the razor and recommend it.</li>
            <li>The shave I get from this razor is good enough and without the irritation</li>
            <li>I want to thank the person who wrote in his review about being able to use the razor without the docking station, it was realy important to me to be able to use and charge the razor with only the cord</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice the cord can plug directly into the shaver to charge the shaver.</li>
            <li>but this really does a better job</li>
            <li>: this is a fantastic razor well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>really makes me love this shaver, though, is the self-cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The cost of refills is not bad at all considering you don&#x27;t have to spend time poking and brushing out your shaver every morning.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand  the self clean features and recharge stand are great.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver kit in November 2004 (it&#x27;s now August 2005), and while the shaver has always performed quite nicely once I got used to it (I previously shaved with blades), the cleaning unit has always been kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if your traveling and need to shave quickly, but I do not see it replacing the standard razor.</li>
            <li>I run the cleaning cycle after every use, but I make sure to clean out most of the gunk in the shaver by popping the shaver screen and running it for a short time, as per the procedure in the manual.  </li>
            <li>performance is only very marginally better than my Norelco which has languished in my top drawer for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job with the flat hair under my chin.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re well worth the price for a shaver that is clean and causes no</li>
            <li>A loyal Norelco user now using Braun.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think that the Braun cleaning system is more about sellling cleaning cartridges than providing a significantly better shave.  </li>
            <li>I have mild arthritis and the Flex XP</li>
            <li>The &#x27;low battery&#x27; warning light is a nice feature, but I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;two or three shaves\\&quot; that Braun claims after it came on.  </li>
            <li>FORMER blade user is extremely happy and very satsfied with his purchase.</li>
            <li>In terms of comfort, the Norelco Advantage has a bit of an edge because I did like the integrated gel dispenser, in terms of a close, quick shave I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re about even</li>
            <li>Faster shaving and quick clean-up.</li>
            <li>short, I&#x27;m not THAT impressed, and continue to shave with both a Mach 3 regular razor &amp; this one.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, nicks are very rare, and nowhere near as long-bleeding as those from a blade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a blade man since my very first shave over 25 years ago.  </li>
            <li>and I feel that this product is not worth the money, especially in light of their repair policy.  </li>
            <li>(what they say is your average adjustment period), but I feel the shaves have been great since day one.</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning option is wonderful and a big key to the success.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take as long to shave and my face feels as good as a blade.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job with the long side-growing hairs around my adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li>But this is a minor issue given how good a shave I get.    </li>
            <li>I can usually get a good 75 or so days from each cart, and the carts themselves are very cheap.</li>
            <li>AND, best of all, his neck isn&#x27;t raw and he can shave every day if he wants or needs to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to just put down the shaver and be done-</li>
            <li>The mini cutters in the middle of the foils do the job wonderfully on longer hairs, and that alone makes the Braun a better overall design to my old Remington.    </li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the razor and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertising of capturing more, if not all, hairs on the neck.  </li>
            <li>Holds a pretty good charge, needed to charge it twice on a recent three week trip.</li>
            <li>As well the shave is very close and very quick.</li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s motor is very quite and the razor is easy to hold, and manipulate.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this shaver!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just happy to be done with the mess of shaving cream and the cuts on my neck.  </li>
            <li>The shave is more than adequate, but I find it can&#x27;t shave as close around and under the jaw line like my old Remington.  </li>
            <li>Also the cleaning fluid is most denatured alcohol, so if you wanted to buy a bottle of that to refill the cartridge it would probably work fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe just how well this product works, it&#x27;s absolutely incredible.</li>
            <li>The razor is comfortable to use and gives me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the system determines somehow the level of stubble build-up automatically, and yes, sometimes I wonder how accurate it is but the real value is that this monitoring function is just that.  </li>
            <li>so take that for \\&quot;whaddits\\&quot; worth.  </li>
            <li>worth $140.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a &#x27;real&#x27; razor, but it is good enough for a workday.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got curious about how the foil does so much better than the more uniform lower-end Braun models.</li>
            <li>It has required some adjustment, but for my lifestyle right now it&#x27;s a good match, and I would certainly recommend this model to anyone contemplating the same change.    </li>
            <li>self cleaning system is pretty cool</li>
            <li>then it was worth.   </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s the slogan of another company, honestly the 8585 is the only shaver that&#x27;s ever truly been</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using various rotary and micro-screen shavers by Norelco, Braun, and Remington for nearly twenty years, but the Braun 8585 is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The Braun was worth every penny because IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Braun has finally designed an electric shaver with all the features that truly matter and work effectively.</li>
            <li>As far as the cost of the cleaning solution, for the comfort you receive with this product, it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
            <li>And no facial discomfort of any kind.</li>
            <li>or so should be worth it,</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price, even with the cleaning cartridges and replacing the foil and cutter block periodically.</li>
            <li>I should preface the negative sounding title of this review by saying that I have a lot of respect for this Braun product, and I think there are many good things about.</li>
            <li>Do the math and find out whether it is worth it to you.</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice travel case could be bit bigger.  </li>
            <li>I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is worth it considering the quality of the shave and the durability of the product.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything in the shaving world including giving a hot towel press before shave and all sorts of after shave to keep it cool.</li>
            <li>It can go through 2 days worth of stubble without even breaking a sweat.  </li>
            <li>I found other people&#x27;s reviews to be so helpful when I was trying to find the best electric shaver recently.   </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still cheaper than razors, and cream and other things you use with a blade, and it can&#x27;t really be avoided for the great feature it is.</li>
            <li>Have 2 much older (non-cleaning) Braun shavers and both work just fine.</li>
            <li>Gives an excellent, super close shave -- wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>The self-cleaning does work very well initially, but once it fills up with hair/dirt it doesn&#x27;t clean as effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pros for this razor include how fast it shaves, and what a good job it does on flat surfaces on your face.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my husband, a no-nonsense kinda guy, who really likes that clean fresh shave from using the self-cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li>have used my shaver for six months and it still holds a good charge and cuts well due to the cleaner, I think.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard people complain it doesn&#x27;t sit well in the station because they are right handed</li>
            <li>and this shaver mows right through it.</li>
            <li>, the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>I expect I&#x27;ll use three or four of the disposable cleaning cartridge per year, but for about a nickel per day a clean, sterile, and just plain good smelling razor is a bargain.</li>
            <li>It does self clean well and does not cut me as much as a razor.</li>
            <li>I also really like the self clean feature.  </li>
            <li>Norelco is really, really fast, for five shaves after you clean it.  </li>
            <li>I had a full beard and mustache for most of the last 25 years, because I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the corresponding cuts, irritation, and discomfort caused by shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li>The LCD display shows how much power you have and how clean the shaver is.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s certainly as close as my Norelco was, just as fast, just as easy and</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it turns a previously glaring weakness of electrics - the chore of regular maintenance - into a strength.</li>
            <li>Part of the problem is that I have a very fine beard, especially in the neck area.  </li>
            <li>However, when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary.  </li>
            <li>The unique shape of the foil and the cleaning system were the main draws for me while I was comparison shopping.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve decided to create my own cleaning fluid using all natural, organic ingredients and just refill the original cartridge when needed.  </li>
            <li>The shaver&#x27;s self cleaning feature is fabulous and works well; it&#x27;s like having a brand new shaver every time.  </li>
            <li>Good close shave with much less irritation than a razor.</li>
            <li>As someone who has always used a Braun electric shaver I must say that it was an easy choice when it came time to replace my old Flex Control model.  </li>
            <li>the shaver glides smoothly over my face and neck after it has been through a cleaning cycle, it is not so smooth with the next shave.  </li>
            <li>The razor overall is good, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the old Remington TR400.  </li>
            <li>It provides a much closer shave w/ far greater comfort.</li>
            <li>It may work wonderfully for some people with a different beard type and neck angles than mine, but I am not sure it was worth the $145</li>
            <li>However, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I bought the Braun 8585 about 6 months ago and have little good to say.  </li>
            <li>so I was a little worried about whether or not it would be a good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many high end electric shavers over the years, and I&#x27;ve found that none of them work nearly as well as Braun shavers, and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>gives me a completely clean razor---just like new.</li>
            <li>You either use a brush or Braun&#x27;s new clean and charge stand.</li>
            <li>I used to use a mach 3 turbo which gave me a pretty close shave and the bumps to match.</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face (the Syncro did).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve try many different razor, however, this is the razor that doesn&#x27;t give me any pain while shaving.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used an electric razor was about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Shave was pretty close, not as close as my safety razor and cream, but pretty dang close.  </li>
            <li>More than likely it&#x27;s the newfangled foil, but I can shave every day now if I choose and not have irritated skin,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great shave from a foil shaver, and at least in my case NO rash anymore.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver, so I can&#x27;t say how it compares to others.  </li>
            <li>However, I have to say that shaving as an experience is much better with the Braun Activator than with a traditional razor (I was using the Mach3).  </li>
            <li>This is my first Braun.</li>
            <li>but I can do so without any cuts, which is another first.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a higher and lower level of cleaning that it will use depending on how often you dock it.)  </li>
            <li>only thing that is better in the Braun is the battery lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>This 8585 is my most recent and highest end model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Norelco for years, and I must admit I was pretty nervous about switching from the rotatory style blades.</li>
            <li>First, the shave isn&#x27;t exactly as close as others seem to be experiencing.</li>
            <li>This bugged me at first, but I&#x27;ve got used to it.</li>
            <li>I love the built in trimmer blade, the way the cord can be plugged into the shaver itself, and especially the self cleaning system.</li>
            <li>first off i use this machine to shave my head.  </li>
            <li>It is the first electric shaver that I have used.</li>
            <li>I would have gladly gotten the razor with out it and saved some money if it were possible.  </li>
            <li>I only got one more shave.</li>
            <li>Most of the cleaning cycle seems to be drying time, so the unit is quiet.</li>
            <li>And now I shave more often, just because it&#x27;s such a pleasure now.  </li>
            <li>Now I am back using this activator once more</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>Rather than being a simple mesh of circular holes, this foil has holes and slots in a pattern that basically gives a lot more ways for a hair to enter the foil and get cut.  </li>
            <li>Bought the shaver for myself as a Christmas present and love it.  </li>
            <li>One of the reasons I was willing to spend the money was the $50 Amazon coupon that was promised with the unit.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced none of the problems the negative reviews on this product list.  </li>
            <li>Got hot during charging and motor wouldn&#x27;t run at all.</li>
            <li>My first electric razor, 30 years ago, was a Norelco.</li>
            <li>So far it has been well worth it; it&#x27;s doing a much better job in just 2 days than my old, cheaper shaver ever did.  </li>
            <li>I have also recently started using a pre-shave to get a better shave.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d only known sooner what to do to get him to shave more often...</li>
            <li>It does not get as close as a razor, but it does shave pretty close to it, but the difference is, with this shaver as compared to a razor (mach 3) i can shave against the grain under my chin and not get and razor bumps or burns.</li>
            <li>It does take a couple weeks for you and your face to get used to the razor, but that just means that the shave won&#x27;t be as close as it can be the first week or two.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the smaller shaver gives better maneuverability.  </li>
            <li>(if you have a big neck, maybe this electric will perform better).</li>
            <li>Comes with a good travel case although it does not fit the cord which is needed to charge when on the road.</li>
            <li>cordless...simply replace the cartridge every few months and you are good to go...</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this shaver at first, but it caused problems for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The cleaning base is great as it keeps the blades and foil nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would happily spend another $100 to get a razor that does half a job that a Mach 3 hand-held blade and good old shaving cream will do.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never come close to dropping it though, so this may be just a reaction to the better feel of the Integral&#x27;s flat surface with rubber</li>
            <li>This was TOTALLY unexpected - i was excited - but i was concerned - this one did not have 3 pivoting heads that i had used before -</li>
            <li>If your bathroom attaches to your bedroom and you kick off the cleaning process while the spouse is sleeping plan on an early morning fight as you will surely wake up the better half.    </li>
            <li>After 30 years of shaving with a blade, I have finally found an electric razor that works good enough to abandon the blade.  </li>
            <li>Braun actually does provide a very close shave, but it takes more time than the Norelco I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
            <li>The prior Braun&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had were middle of the road models and both worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station is probably too bulky to take on the road but unless you travel for more than 2 weeks, the razor really doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; enough to require any cleaning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor burned my skin after the first use, but I used it straight out of the box, instead of running it through a cleaning cycle first.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am sensitive to smells, but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose.  </li>
            <li>No mess and comes out perfectly clean.  </li>
            <li>First the shaver it self is very sleek.</li>
            <li>I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner, so that keep the fluid clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It shaves more quickly and with less effort that</li>
            <li>The sideburn trimmer, contrary to other reviews, is actually very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I just bought it and the first few shaes I have taken were amazing,</li>
            <li>The razor gets all the parts of his face, quickly and it&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(make sure you shave after the shower when your face is hot and wet)</li>
            <li>I still enjoy a hot shave with my razor every once a while, but this Braun is definitely my default choice now.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be able to use a dry shavor?</li>
            <li>another reviewer astutely points out, if you want to conserve cleaning fluid, you can always charge the 8585 directly with the power cable.</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning feature is pretty loud, but worth it because of the ease and quickness of shaving.  </li>
            <li>- the manual says it is strongly recommended that you shave prior to showering or washing your face.  </li>
            <li>Certainly the closest I&#x27;ve ever had with any electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning fluid is good for a month if cleaning daily, but I only clean 1-2 times per week</li>
            <li>If your significant other demands baby smooth cheeks, you can always bust out the &#x27;real&#x27; razor for date night.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my Braun 6520 (slim and elegant), this new model is a tank (big and unwieldy).     </li>
            <li>It shaves right down to the skin and gets all those pesky off-side ones, too, within a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;You truly get what you pay for many times (not always though) and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to use with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>I had tried electric razors in the past but they never did a good job shaving  (especially my neck) and were always a pain to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>In reality, you get a pretty good shave, but no better than the older Braun I replaced (which didn&#x27;t have these new features).  </li>
            <li>It is not close to a real razor and misses areas on my face.</li>
            <li>It really cleans the shaver well for a no maintenance shaver.</li>
            <li>The razor shaves very well &amp; I like the combination cleaning &amp; charging station.</li>
            <li>shaver itself is really well designed.</li>
            <li>It feels solid and comfortable in your hand without being a brick.  </li>
            <li>Too much plastic.  </li>
            <li>You really do get what you pay for with electric shavers.   </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the 8585! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br</li>
            <li>My Trusty old Norelco was just not cutting it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Braun turned out to be better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Also, the lines between the holes are much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who are thinking of making the jump!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s capable of delivering a very close shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to miss spots than it was with blade shaving, and I find myself having to run my hand ahead of the blade to \\&quot;pick up\\&quot; the hairs</li>
            <li>I can even shave twice in one day- maybe a morning quickie, and a more careful shave before \\&quot;date night\\</li>
            <li>I have a very oily face, so I plan to replace cartridges pretty much according to the normal schedule.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a light sleeper, run it later.    </li>
            <li>I have to keep teasing the beard up with my free hand and keep going over and over the same spot.  </li>
            <li>It does a reasonable job</li>
            <li>After much deliberating and review reading, I went with the Braun.   </li>
            <li>The self cleaning system works very well.  </li>
            <li>but its much closer than the barber clippers, and if you use some sort of after shave and/or pre-shave(electric)</li>
            <li>For a really smooth shave, I have found that I must use the cleaner after every shave, which is not always practical (especially when I&#x27;m out of town).</li>
            <li>Thanks DJ</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to the sound that a TV makes when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li>After much reading, I decided on the Activator 8585.    </li>
            <li>The Braun 8585 shaves much closer.  </li>
            <li>you want a really close shave and almost no iritation</li>
            <li>It shaves much closer than the Norelco, and is very comparable to a blade.  </li>
            <li>However, after two months of gentle use, the cleaning stand stopped working.  </li>
            <li>it is a much faster and cleam way to shave...</li>
            <li>This whole experience shows how much of a hassle you might have if you need to have this Braun razor repaired under warrantee.  </li>
            <li>(as some others have complained...come on, really now...</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this razor.  </li>
            <li>No annoying stubble bits that have been shaved falling out of the head or left on your face.  </li>
            <li>so much so, I picked one up for my father-in-law this Christmas.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my son and he loves it thanks</li>
            <li>That will really depend on frequency of use, coarseness of beard, how often cleaning cycles are used, etc....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this item to any man who wants a close shave without the nicks.</li>
            <li>Is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a couple weeks now and I am ready to give my thoughts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much problem on my face, but the neck can be a problem.</li>
            <li>I really have to work to get everything off the neck.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not hurt to shave after skipping a couple of days, it actually gives my skin a nice tingly feeling.  </li>
            <li>the wall plug is big and sticks out further than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I actually called Braun customer service again and asked them if I could of had better or faster repair service if I mailed the part directly to Braun instead of taking it to the authorized Braun repair shop.</li>
            <li>very much appreciate the opportunity you have provided for me to comment on my new Braun Electric Shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the razor for ten weeks, using the auto clean every day, and the original cleaning cartridge is not empty yet.  </li>
            <li>It also easily trims any long hair by pointing the foil head straight at them.</li>
            <li>I tried an electric shaver for the first time 7 years ago and quickly went back to a blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It came down to this or getting a new Norelco Advantage, which I also liked.  </li>
            <li>This would likely extend the cartridge lifetime significantly-</li>
            <li>Now five months later, it has degraded significantly.  </li>
            <li>For the special occasions where I really want a close shave, I can take the time and get something approaching what a blade could do.  </li>
            <li>Since the Braun doesn&#x27;t require shaving cream, you&#x27;ll have to pay closer attention the first few times you use it to make sure you don&#x27;t miss any spots.  </li>
            <li>As long as I use it everyday, or maybe skip one day once in a while, it works great.  </li>
            <li>I hope he has cleaned house as I clean my beard daily.    </li>
            <li>Of course, there is the extra expense of buying replacement solution for the clean and charge unit.  </li>
            <li>The fluid cartridges have lasted me about six to eight weeks each, and I clean the shaver almost every day.</li>
            <li>I only clean my razor when it needs to be charged</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Pretty clean shave overall &lt;</li>
            <li>It uses special cleaning fluid which has to be replace every several weeks depending on how often you clean it.</li>
            <li>Third, there&#x27;s nothing special about the way it shaves.  </li>
            <li>it cleans itself, the fluid is not expensive, and my head up until right now is shiny.  </li>
            <li>To keep the blade decent, I had to clean it on regular basis and it too was a hassle.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for just over a couple of weeks and trust me, this thing is as good as your gillette minus the nicks and cuts and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is also handy for those of you lazy like me</li>
            <li>This was my first foil razor in years, I basically decided to get it based on the strength of the reviews here, as my old Norelco rotary shaver was giving up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was full of hair clippings and cleaning fluid, and once I wiped it out and tried to restart it, nothing happens.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not going to say the shave is as close as my old Mach 3 is, but it is pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>As far as shaving, it does pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to get a good grip on it -- very few rubber contact pads -- and your hand fatigues more easily.</li>
            <li>I emailed Amazon yesterday, they emailed me today that I would have a brand new replacement shaver delivered tomorrow!</li>
            <li>It really does feel like a brand new shaver every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I drop it in and go!The razor really does seem brand new everytime you use it.</li>
            <li>The thing still works like new thanks to the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The new micro screen&#x27;s shape really does pick-up more hair in less strokes.</li>
            <li>I upgrade to a new one every two or three years, and despite all the marketing and technology hype, this one too doesn&#x27;t make shaving really any better than the previous model.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I get such an amazingly close shave with it with absolutely no skiin irritation.</li>
            <li>I could get a slightly closer shave using a blade though I would also have more irritation to get that closer shave, so there is a trade off.</li>
            <li>In summary- as a recent convert to electric shaving, I&#x27;ve been pleased overall.  </li>
            <li>I also tried a Remington Micro Screen (twin head) as a replacement for my older Remington 700.  </li>
            <li>30 minutes later, it comes out fresh and ready to go again.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it is a decent razor</li>
            <li>They are two main types on the market today, 1.</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t see it being better than the traditional circular hole design in my Remington; I can&#x27;t comment when compared to the Braun Syncro line since I&#x27;ve never used it.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, in summary, nice shaver, but unfortunately flimsy and cheap cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li>I had always heard electric razors burn your face and don&#x27;t give a decent shave no matter the brand or type of electric razor you used.  </li>
            <li>This may or may not be true of past electric razors, but I&#x27;m hear to tell you this Braun Activator 8585 is one fantastic razor.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price.</li>
            <li>in all, a decent buy, but not the performance they would have you believe.</li>
            <li>The basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter, shaves just as well, and cost me about 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li>Noise from the shave is very loud, much louder than Panasonic model.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun promises a much closer, smoother and more efficient shave as a result of the new foil with a \\&quot;revolutionary new pattern\\&quot; resulting in \\&quot;20 different hair capturing opportunities compared to just 1 from a regular</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>but if you every hear a high pitch noise--check the razor.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this model,</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Activator 8585 by Braun.  </li>
            <li>As far as the shaver, it cannot do a good job on the neck if you have a thick new beard every morning.  </li>
            <li>With a little web surfing you can get a top of the line Panasonic shaver for under a $100 bucks.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I am spending a little more time shaving</li>
            <li>advice: buy something without a self-cleaning system and spend a little more money to get something nicer.</li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>
            <li>The self cleaning thing is a little over the top for my taste.  </li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think that was possible without hot wax!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about waking up your significant other, just clean it later.  </li>
            <li>* Comes with a handy hard case - instead of the leather/material of the 7526 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I have developed real issues with the environmental impact of the disposable cleaning solution</li>
            <li>Firstly I&#x27;d like to make a comment about razors in general.  </li>
            <li>I got a MUCH closer shave with the old razor than I did with this OVERPRICED Braun.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try not to be redundant, as most of all the glowing feedback on display I agree with 100%.  </li>
            <li>How many cars last that long without any problems?</li>
            <li>The Braun does dramatically better than that Remington when I get a few days of growth though.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>i bought the more pricey model a few months ago...</li>
            <li>If I wait longer than two days, it&#x27;s a bit more work and takes a few minutes longer, but the results come through.  </li>
            <li>what kind of complaint is that anyway?)  </li>
            <li>I seem to be able to shave in a few fewer swipes than I did before.  </li>
            <li>it really is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra money for that.</li>
            <li>, I find a distinct aroma of the cleaning solution in my bathroom and in the hall outside the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Do you want to clean the thing every single week?  </li>
            <li>This one is even better than the previous! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>As a result, most of the time the shaver uses the \\&quot;eco\\&quot; cleaning mode, which makes the cleaning cartridge last longer (I&#x27;m still on my first one after a month and a half, and it still reads \\&quot;full\\&quot;).      </li>
            <li>Just as a tip, always pop the foil guard off the shaver and use the brush supplied with the shaver to manually clean out loose hairs.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and can use it daily without any irritation.   </li>
            <li>I replaced my last one, and it was still going strong, lasting over a week on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new Braun is doing much better, although the attached papers indicated it might take a few weeks to adapt to the new shaving heads.  </li>
            <li>So it is doing something to figure out the amount of clippings inside, but even if you remove them thoroughly it still tells you that it needs the same level of cleaning as it did right before you cleaned it.</li>
            <li>I could never shave with that razor since it couldn&#x27;t handle the longer growth; the Braun just plows right through several days growth with no problem.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice size, a good heft, and a straight shaving head mounted on a rotating base that gives it just enough flexibility for under-neck shaving.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s akin to buying new blades month after month.</li>
            <li>I do not see any difference in shaving between my $60.- Braun 5520 and this new shaver.</li>
            <li>or so I will have to buy a new cleaning solution cartridge</li>
            <li>I tried gillete&#x27;s new power fusion with 5 blades and it didn&#x27;t even come close to the comfort and closeness of the Mach 3 Power.</li>
            <li>I just bought the new Braun, we&#x27;ll see how that works.</li>
            <li>With the newly designed foil, the time and effort to shave has been reduced by 50%.</li>
            <li>After thirty years, and five Norelco electric razors, I decided to live on the edge and try something new.  </li>
            <li>Also, the cleaning system means every morning I shave with a brand new razor as it cleans it meticulously well.</li>
            <li>and they said the unit could not be repaired and he already order a new cleaning stand unit over a week ago</li>
            <li>Being completely new to electric shaving, I relied upon consumer reviews and product web-sites.  </li>
            <li>Every morning when I pick it up to use it, I feel like I&#x27;m using a new shaver.</li>
            <li>It has never given me any problems and still works like new.</li>
            <li>The stand lets you know when your razor needs a cleaning or a new container of solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I attribute this to the new foil design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>super clean blade shave was great done every other day but sometimes two a day were needed and that was too painful and time consuming.</li>
            <li>Then my wife bought me one 2 years ago and it worked reasonably well for a time, but cleaning was a hassle, and since the hairs on my neck somehow grow at crazy angles I could never seem to do a great job on them.  </li>
            <li>(which is a huge jump from never), and I remove the fluid and re-cap it to make it last longer, seems to work.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re after an electric shaver, this is the one to get, but keep your razor and shaving lotion for times when you need that extra close, extra smooth shave.</li>
            <li>However, for someone like me with very sensitive skin, it works well.</li>
            <li>Titanium self cleaning razor, but its motor is very loud.</li>
            <li>This is the second electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and the first I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>First off, I quite using the self-cleaning system when the included fluid ran out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the funny shaped foil would make such a difference</li>
            <li>While at first I had mixed feelings about the Braun, it&#x27;s grown on me quite a bit</li>
            <li>If I shaved with some growth, I literally had to use the trimmer on my face first, then the regular blades.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>and it does exactly the same job...</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>After using the Braun 8585 for almost two weeks, all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever electric shaving system, and i am totally hooked to it.</li>
            <li>This is my second Activator shaving system; I had one of the original models and it didn&#x27;t survive a 1,000 mile move, so I purchased this one last year.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to shave prior to showering, since the skin tends to swell a bit in hot water.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s triple head design does better on neck areas and small areas</li>
            <li>Therefore, I attest the 8585 is gentle but all business, giving a damn fine close-but-not-too-close shave with very little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does do a good cleaning job, after a half hour of buzzing and stinking (slightly).</li>
            <li>Clean cut, great feel, nifty cleaner/charging base.</li>
            <li>As we all know traditional razor blade replacement prices have been going through the roof for years, and for guys like me with tough beards the blade itself only gives you about a week or two worth of good shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve preferred blades for years, as most electrics give me bad razor burn and don&#x27;t do a good job getting the flat whiskers on the bottom of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a hard face to cut and, as I am getting older, it gets harder to do a good job.</li>
            <li>With the new foil design, it glides over my face and requires far fewer passes to get the job done &lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shape of the razor is rounded slightly and smooth</li>
            <li>Those hard-to-get odd angled hairs aside, the razor works smoothly and almost imperceptably.</li>
            <li>And, the new cleaning and charging system is a significant upgrade from their previous models.</li>
            <li>I understand the majority of reviews are positive and this is my personal experience.  </li>
            <li>It cut close and fast, and everytime I cleaned it, it was like starting with a brand new unit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an excuse to upgrade to one of the new models, but the thing works so well and hasn&#x27;t had any issues, so I really can&#x27;t find one!</li>
            <li>anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor (not even the expensive triple edged ones, just cheap disposables) is dreaming.  </li>
            <li>It is possible also, that in some cases, it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary, but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times I go over them.  </li>
            <li>I also have some concerns with the quality of the cleaning stand because  it broke so quickly and if I will have the same problem with it again in the future.</li>
            <li>I recently upgraded to the new 8585 - mainly to try the new foil design.  </li>
            <li>The flexible screen abandons the \\&quot;lots of little holes in a grid\\&quot; concept for a crazy-cross hatched slot-and-hole screen that does a good - not perfect, but good - job of letting hairs at odd angles meet the blades.</li>
            <li>This really blew me away because I have extremely sensitive skin and could never shave with a dry shaver without intense razor burn.</li>
            <li>but i simply follow with a few strokes of a dry razor after shaving with the braun and all is good...</li>
            <li>I am looking for a good, quick shave in the morning provided by a reliable and low maintenance razor (call me crazy).  </li>
            <li>As mentioned in earlier posts the cleaning system may be a little over the top</li>
            <li>I have the most sensative face and hard to cut/heavy beard of any person I&#x27;ve ever met.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Braun; 2) I have owned various models and thus can compare new models to the older versions.     </li>
            <li>Braun (owned by Gillette) has cleverly gotten you to pay big bucks for an electric shaver, then get you to buy a new cleaning cartridge every month.</li>
            <li>I have found that my face is actually less irritated with the Braun than when shaving with a blade, all with out having to clean up the shaving gel and stubble from the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>They were completely gone after about 2 weeks of using the braun 8585.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this shaver to guys with sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li>I agree with several reviewers that this cleaning unit is really a lot of hype and overengineering.  </li>
            <li>I have never found an electric razor that even got anywhere near as close as a blade</li>
            <li>I could get it pretty damn close on my face by repeatedly jamming the razor against my face, but it would take a long time to do this.  </li>
            <li>As far as the hair on my throat, there was no way at all to cut that anywhere near as close as I would have wanted.  </li>
            <li>sincerely apolgise for these negative comments but trust nevertheless that you will find them helpful.</li>
            <li>Way too loud.</li>
            <li>I saw no material difference between the Activator and my five year old Braun.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle is a bit loud...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add that I have the enviable honor of having sensitive skin, along with bullet proof stubble.  </li>
            <li>I bought this model to replace my old Panasonic triple blade shaver.</li>
            <li>and I am surprised to find this happens.</li>
            <li>By comparison the Remington was much louder especially the sideburn trimmer which made me feel like I should insert earplugs before putting that thing so close to my ear.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning tank seems to last a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very close and for the amount of time you shave, unless you are a mutant lumberjack and grow hair at a fantastically fast rate, who cares how loud it is (not very compared to others), it if gets the job done...</li>
            <li>and i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Running my free hand firmly against the skin, just ahead of the shaver to stand the beard up, produces a shave that is as close as what you would get with a  disposable twin bladed razor.</li>
            <li>As far as performance, it is up to Braun standards.  </li>
            <li>Also, I would not waste money on the LCD display.</li>
            <li>Not only does this shaver give a close shave, the cleaning system works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it got through the Braun QA.      </li>
            <li>The shaver is not as loud as my Remington - I think the blades may move slower.    </li>
            <li>I am planning on buying at least one more in case something happens to the one I have and just in case they stop making them.  </li>
            <li>these two quite valid complaints, the pros far outweigh the cons for me.</li>
            <li>razor is loud, and by that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud when it&#x27;s self cleaning, it&#x27;s louder when it&#x27;s held up to your face.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a magic electric razor that shaves as close as the blades, STOP, because they don&#x27;t exist, at least not yet.    </li>
            <li>I have always been a razor man, except for a short stint with a Phillips 3 blade rotary that I paid way too much for.  </li>
            <li>WOW - leme tell ya - after i decided to use it christmas day</li>
            <li>I started out with the old Remington XLR (the blocky one they made for years), then used a Remington triple foil for 8 years (model TR400).  </li>
            <li>Because my skin is sensitive, shaving with a blade causes a lot of irritation.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning unit is loud at times, but whatever it cleans the shaver.  </li>
            <li>You can plug the cord directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li>I had it 2 weeks when it began to buzz loudly.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying a second one for my vacation home, I like it that much.</li>
            <li>also appreciate that the razor can be plugged in and recharged directly</li>
            <li>Since it was under warrantee, I brought it to one of the Braun authorized repair shops in my area for repair instead of mailing it directly to Braun</li>
            <li>I got this unit from Amazon in early July.</li>
            <li>Shaving before showering completely works for me.  </li>
            <li>If you hae sensitive skin or know someone who does, this is the model for them.  </li>
            <li>His old one was well...old.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner is loud.  </li>
            <li>the cord can plug directly into the razor when on travel</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li>It is not too much, completely bearable.</li>
            <li>My old stand-by Norelco will make a return appearance this week.</li>
            <li>You can even connect the power directly to the shaver and use it.</li>
            <li>My 12 - 15 year old Braun needed to be replaced, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li>It also shaves a lot quicker than a razor, it only takes me 5 minutes to shave my whole face with this, whereas a razor would take me about 10.  </li>
            <li>Next, the cleaning cartridges cost about eight bucks a pop, and if the thought of paying this much for the self-cleaning luxury bugs you, you probably shouldn&#x27;t consider this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>8585 does NOT shave as close as my old Braun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the 8585 for about 2 months now, so I think I&#x27;ve got the hang of it as far as Braun&#x27;s recommendations.</li>
            <li>Not offensive, but noticable and unexpected.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, he actually likes it.  </li>
            <li>Shavers almost all claim to be as close as a blade, but this one nearly delivers on that promise.  </li>
            <li>I was leary about electric razors since i have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It gives by far the closest shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m admittedly only one person, but as a user of a rotary razor, and a recent purchaser of this Braun, I thought my experience may be useful.</li>
            <li>If, like I do, you have thick or abundant hair and sensitive skin and need to shave daily</li>
            <li>After years of using a Norelco triple header, I thought of trying a Braun and found it to be difficult to achieve a good shave.</li>
            <li>be the first one to admit that every beard is different, but this whisker thing and the new foil shape is definitely overrated.</li>
            <li>The new foil system gives me a much closer shave, particularly in those tough spots on my neck and the cleaning system eliminates the need to brush out the whiskers and clean the cutterblock myself as I did before.  </li>
            <li>And, true to Braun&#x27;s claim, the sucker charges quickly and will last quite a while without a re-charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charging/Cleaning station is a bit large and the blue \\&quot;charged\\&quot; light is very bright in the dark and has an annoying flicker once fully charged.</li>
            <li>The Activator foil has some holes that are quite a bit larger, and some smaller than the Integral foil (I think that&#x27;s the one used on most other Brauns).</li>
            <li>a little noisy, so i clean in the morning...</li>
            <li>My first surprise was to find little metal and much plastic in the 8585 construction.</li>
            <li>I first bought this when i realized spending $20 a month an razor blades for my mach3 was a little bit too much.  </li>
            <li>However, there is no mess.  </li>
            <li>saw a couple deals come and go on the Braun 8585 at a \\&quot;hot deals\\&quot; site I frequent, and I finally  bit on the third one.  </li>
            <li>No mess at all.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning can get really loud (much louder than the shaving), but it&#x27;s a minor annoyance to me.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to be done with hot water, soap and shaving cream..and those painful late in the day shaves needed to clean up a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. &lt;</li>
            <li>The user does which means that I don&#x27;t have to clean the razor everyday.  </li>
            <li>It will shave you almost as close as a blade razor, without missing spots, and when done, it will clean itself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a less expensive ($50-range) Braun shaver for more than 15 years, &amp; I think that this model is infinitely better.</li>
            <li>However, it just doesn&#x27;t cut close enough for me, particularly on the throat area.  </li>
            <li>But after my first and second shave with it, the only word I can truly express is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think Braun is building the same high quality shavers of yesteryear.</li>
            <li>One big con is this high pitch noise the razor makes.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer pops up high enough so you can see what your trimming.    </li>
            <li>The cleaning fluid also leaves a slightly lubricating film on the shaver which helps it glide smoothly across the skin.    </li>
            <li>I wait a few seconds to make sure my face is dry after using a towel.</li>
            <li>I also wouldn&#x27;t try to use a different cleaning fluid as other said they did to avoid having to buy the replacement cartridges because it could easily damage this razor and the cleaning stand.</li>
            <li>Altogether a terrific upgrade on my old Braun, and in another universe compared to my (very) old Norelco.</li>
            <li>bought this Braun (last year&#x27;s model) after reading the positive reviews here, and later bought a rotary razor.  </li>
            <li>It has the usual drawback of an electric shaver - the shave just isn&#x27;t as close or smooth as a blade.  </li>
            <li>$165.00 + the cleaner cartridges is very expensive for a device that doesn&#x27;t provide an all-together great shave every time.</li>
            <li>No more burn and a smooth (against the grain) shave with no irritation whatsoever and no water.</li>
            <li>First, the shaver is way too wide.</li>
            <li>and they told me which service center to send it to and gave me the number so that I could call first.  </li>
            <li>and I still need to go back to my normal razor.  </li>
            <li>We just thought that was normal, but after he started using this shaver boy did he look different.  </li>
            <li>It is possible, though, to ignore the stand and use the razor just like you would use a normal model.  </li>
            <li>I am just today purchasing my first foil/blade refill and that is around $30, and I would guess I&#x27;ve spent about $25 on cleaning refills.</li>
            <li>for the cleaning stand, the pump suddenly wouldn&#x27;t pump the cleaning fluid into the unit with enough pressure to clean properly after just 6 months.</li>
            <li>, I expected a little more than I got.</li>
            <li>It started making funnier and funnier noises (different from the normal buzzing noise cycle it goes through) over the last few weeks and finally it just stuck in one particular noise for a long time (more than 20 minutes),</li>
            <li>The only down side I see is that you can&#x27;t rinse the 8585 with water to clean it like you can with the TriControl and Flex shavers.  </li>
            <li>Number one is that the trimmer, while aggresive and able to cut thick hair with ease, has trouble with smaller, fine errant hairs, especially on the neck.</li>
            <li>However, even for a longtime Braun fan such as myself I have been blown away by the quality of the new self-cleaning Activator 8585.  </li>
            <li>I went a while without an electric shaver and finally decided to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>This might be the best of the few electric shavers that I tried, but still disappointing.</li>
            <li>I will send in my razor and go back to a blade until I receive my repaired setup; hopefully it will be back in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I still use this is that I shave frequently enough that busting out shaving cream is too much of a mess/</li>
            <li>The foil and blade are supposed to be replaced at least every 18 months (more frequently, if necessary).</li>
            <li>You have to shave against the grain, and it helps if you pull your skin tight with your free hand, and try and move it and your face so that the surface of the skin your shaving is flat.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a step down from my old shaver at a higher price and with the added monthly cost of the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li>Second, it&#x27;s LOUD!   </li>
            <li>I know Braun makes more expensive units, but I&#x27;m not sure how they could be any better than this one.</li>
            <li>No other shaver has done that.</li>
            <li>but I did have a major problem with the cleaning stand that required a warantee repair/replacement of the cleaning stand just 6 months after my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone from an old hand-me-down Remington to an under-powered little Braun, to an unsuccessful stint with a triple-head that was supposed to dispense soothing goo, to a fantastic Remington Microscreen whose life was cut short by the rigors of life in the desert (California, Kuwait and Iraq), to its similar but not-as-good Remington</li>
            <li>My facial hair growth is pretty sparse (mixed Nordic and English blood)</li>
            <li>If you read the above overview written by Amazon, you will see that cleaning less frequently doesn&#x27;t necessarily help you save cleaning fluid, as more intensive cleaning cycles are just repetitions of the lesser cycles.</li>
            <li>The shaver comes with a plastic case for storage and a small brush to clean.</li>
            <li>I am not a rich man, but the Braun 8585 is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>There are still a few spots that don&#x27;t get cut very close (particularly below/under the jaw)</li>
            <li>the cleaning cycle is a little loud for the first few minutes because the shaver turns itself on in the fluid to clean it out.</li>
            <li>It has a light touch, even if you push it hard into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few rough patches are a fine tradeoff as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and it&#x27;s nothing you can see.    </li>
            <li>Using my old Panasonic, it may take several round to clean such thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s messier and a little more hassle, but cuts way down on cartridge use.  </li>
            <li>Generally it takes some effort and time to get a truly even looking cut.  </li>
            <li>My neck is prone to irritation and nicks, and my stubble is thick, so this has been a huge improvement across the board.  </li>
            <li>Maybe there are foil shavers out there that are equal to rotary shavers, but this one turned me off completely to foil shavers.    </li>
            <li>Granted, no electrical shaver will ever shave as close as a blade, but the difference is barely noticeable (with THIS shaver).</li>
            <li>You probably have to seal the fluid catridge (worrying about leakage), and the whole station is big enough to take some luggage space.</li>
            <li>My second surprise was the modest power of the 8585 compared with the Eltron 770.</li>
            <li>This may be a non issue for some as they have kicked off the cleaning process too early too often and now find themselves shaving in the same place</li>
            <li>The next natural step was to try the foil shavers.  </li>
            <li>The first cleaning cartridge lasted over 5 months, using it every 2 to 3 days on average.  </li>
            <li>My old Remington Microscreen would routinely cause razor burn on my upper lip, neck, and chin, even when I used a shaving powder.  </li>
            <li>Still using this razor nearly a year later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only found 2 CVS&#x27;s near me that sell the cleaning refills, but</li>
            <li>but now I have a barely used shaver in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It still takes me about the same time to shave with this as compared to my old razor.</li>
            <li>Second, the cleaning base is more compact, easier to operate, and (apparently) more efficient in its use of cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li>We have far more unpleasurable waste that we deal with everyday.  </li>
            <li>by using the base unit which holds the razor, the razor is always at peak battery potential which means you get the best power possible out of the razor &lt;br /</li>
            <li>I got a Norelco a few months back, and this was a welcome change for me as shaving got quicker and less messy, but for some reason, my face never got used to it.  </li>
            <li>If I get a new razor at any point in the next 1-3 years, it will definitely be the Pulsonic or another Braun razor that builds upon the strengths of this model.</li>
            <li>Have always had trouble getting a really clean shave with electric razors - especially the neck - especially if I skip shaving for a day or two (which I sometimes do on weekends).  </li>
            <li>If you are lazy and do not care if you have a super close shave</li>
            <li>Make no mistake about it, a blade razor will ALWAYS shave closer than any electric razor, for the simple reason that the blade(s) can get right on your skin to cut the hair, while electric razor&#x27;s blades are always hidden and can never cut as close.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra little bit of work to get everything off the neck.</li>
            <li>I attribute that to me making sure I&#x27;m picking up all the &#x27;loose ends&#x27; that my previous razers always left behind and taking the time to make the shave as smooth as possible.</li>
            <li>the razor and stand is a faint, very high pitched sound that they make when plugged in.  </li>
            <li>Sales Rank on this product is very high, and with good reason.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Braun several months ago and last weekend I packed my old Remington 3 head and went hunting.</li>
            <li>If you have a more round neck area with less angles you probably not have the same problem.</li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised that it was able to cut my difficult neck whiskers,</li>
            <li>I accepted the fact that my facial hair was either just not thick enough or grew to flat to my face for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I prefer German or Japanese products due to their consistent quality and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Meaning a little discomfort at first.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it everyday, have had electric shavers in the past, most notably the Remington, but never experienced a shaver with the power or ability to cut as close as this one.</li>
            <li>I realize that the blue led&#x27;s are new and high tech seeming, but seriously ... when the razor is in the cleaner / charger unit it also functions as a nightlight... a nightlight that bathes half the room in erie blue light. &lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m quite satisfied overall (especially since these spots were tough with the Mach3).</li>
            <li>The Braun 8585 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving System is flat and about the size of the old two-head shavers (you never see those sold anymore, only 3-head ones).  </li>
            <li>If you are not careful enough, you may end up losing it somewhere.</li>
            <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t go nearly that long.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty heavy beard</li>
            <li>I suppose it is worth the few extra bucks each month to purchase the replacement cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li>The first time I shaved, I thought that I&#x27;d wasted money on it.</li>
            <li>I complained, they sent me a new one which is also very loud -- too loud for me!</li>
            <li>Combined with the side-to-side vibration that really does cut down on razor burn.</li>
            <li>I have a very thick beard that grows very quickly</li>
            <li>As a test, I used my very old Norelco rotary on half my face and it blew away the Braun in direct comparison.  </li>
            <li>first time I used it, the skin on my neck got a little irritated and red, but nothing unbearable.  </li>
            <li>But the 8585 can give you a decent shave in a couple of minutes while the other shavers take what seems like forever.      </li>
            <li>bought this razor based on the high acclaim that other users have given it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another random note: if you absolutely cannot live without an LCD display on your razor, for about thirty dollars, Braun will sell you the 8685, which I presume is exactly the same razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll sell mine for for half that used if anyone wants it...</li>
            <li>To add to this perfection scenario it is not made in China or any Asian sweet shop, but in Germany, or at least mine was.</li>
            <li>I have a very heavy beard, so I was looking for something that would be preferable to the pain and mess of a wet shave, but be as close and effective.  </li>
            <li>And the shaver is very powerful so don&#x27;t worry if you have long and hard hair.</li>
            <li>Last year&#x27;s model of this Braun, a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors.</li>
            <li>I do not have a heavy beard, so I clean it every other day.  </li>
            <li>recently ordered a new set of foils &amp; blades, (after about 19-20 months) and while the shave is obviously not nearly as close as it was the day I got it, the shave with dull blades/foils is still better than what I was getting with my past razors.  </li>
            <li>similarly, the cleaning system keeps the razor free of beard stubble which means there is no/little if any beard stubble that falls into the sink that I have to clean up, and the cutting edge remains as sharp as possible &lt;br /</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very noisy (scares the cat every time I use it) and buying the additional cleaning cartridges and head is a little pricy but not unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>So the bottom line is that it&#x27;s a little smoother and much quicker than the lower line Brauns, (although I have not tried the Syncro System).  </li>
            <li>have a tough beard, but I also don&#x27;t mind spending the extra time with the Braun to get my face smooth.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> While I don&#x27;t believe that any electric will come quite as close as a blade, this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li> The auto cleaning works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> And, it still gives an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> That is incredible service!!!</li>
            <li> For my face, Braun has the best blade technology of anyone.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re thinking about a great shaver, this is it! &lt;</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I like best: &lt;br</li>
            <li> Works flawlessly!!  </li>
            <li> The machine works excellently in all regards.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best!</li>
            <li> and he was very happy</li>
            <li> It is excellent to have a shaver that cleans itself, and I hope that it continues working well for years to come.  </li>
            <li> will not deny that this is the best electric razor I have tried.</li>
            <li> The Braun 8585 Activator is one of the best shavers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that Braun makes the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Once you learn how to use it, it works excellently.</li>
            <li> It is, without exaggeration, awesome.</li>
            <li> He has to have the best and finest things in any category, and he hates everything unless it was his decision to purchase.  </li>
            <li> My search for the perfect electric continues.</li>
            <li> It is perfect!</li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product.</li>
            <li> The build quality appears very good, with exception to the plastic travel case.</li>
            <li> You get a very good close shave without harming the skin.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about their products and I must admit that I am quite impressed.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s as good as an electric likly gets, and I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need a \\&quot;perfect shave\\</li>
            <li> and yes I fell for the Fusion which worked beautifully</li>
            <li> shaver seems to have excellent build quality and everything from packaging to touching is very good (as you would expect from high-end shaver).</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> It gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li> Also the self-cleaning mechanism is a great add-on as well.</li>
            <li> I have been happily using Braun shavers for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> My friend had one and the convienence seemed great, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s 60 power Intel Play microscope did a great job answering this question.</li>
            <li> After four months, I&#x27;m still happy with it, and still works as I described.  </li>
            <li> The Mach3 tripple blade razors did a great job giving me a close shave, but sometimes TOO close.   </li>
            <li> Working great.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco is great, but requires lots of maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> The shaver still works great, no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt I am absolultely happy with my shaver.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the self-cleaning system work great.</li>
            <li> this machine is great.  </li>
            <li> Cleans, and shaves great.  </li>
            <li> It is a great shaving system.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First shave out of the box was great.</li>
            <li> But after a week, it is great.</li>
            <li> lol) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li> This is a great unit.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The self cleaning system is great.  </li>
            <li> A great shave, and self cleaning.  </li>
            <li> By the way, the docking/cleaning station works great also.</li>
            <li> if you wanted a great close shave, add up the cost and then you will see that this thing is a steal.  </li>
            <li> cleaner is a great part of it too.  </li>
            <li> The charger cleaner is a great idea but stock up on the refills.</li>
            <li> I was immediately happy with the shaver.</li>
            <li> This Razor is great</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband based on the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> The self cleaning is great.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the Braun 8585, or 8595!!!</li>
            <li> If the shave was amazing or even very good, I would probably indulge these inconveniences, but the shave is nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> I have used a corded Eltron 770 for many years with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this razor but good luck if you need warrantee work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a lot of raves in the reviews here that might lead one to believe this shaver can give you a perfect shave while doing your taxes and improving your love life.  </li>
            <li> Best electric shaver he ever had better than Norelco or Remington has owned both.  </li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying the Braun 8585 EASILY provides the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Excellent machine makes the move from a blade easy.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best electric razor there is.  </li>
            <li> Very Happy with it, feels great, the cleaner is cool.  </li>
            <li> in all though, the 8585 is an excellent product, LOUD but excellent.</li>
            <li> is that its lights are bright</li>
            <li> this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> this is really a good option.</li>
            <li> While it was a good shaver, I still had a problem with shaving rash every morning.   </li>
            <li> The good:  </li>
            <li> But not as good as the premium two to four blade razors like Sensor and Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Have been using a Norelco for about 10 years and it was a good razor, but this shaver gives me alot closer shave.</li>
            <li> The Braun razors are just that good.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the shaver for four months now, so I believe I can give a good overview of its performance.</li>
            <li> all in all, spend the darn money and get a good...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get just as good a shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is a good compromise.  </li>
            <li> It gives him a good shave and the cleaning system</li>
            <li> With this razor, no problems at all, the shave is really superior.  </li>
            <li> razor does a good job getting to all of the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> quite* that good.  </li>
            <li> The stand also eats up a fair amount of space and an electric outlet in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> good at getting hard-to-reach curved surfaces (chin, jaw, adam&#x27;s apple).</li>
            <li> but the quality of the shaver suggests that the cleaner may be just as good.</li>
            <li> I often wonder whether they suggest that waiting period to give you more time to forget what a good shave looks like! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> So if you want the best shaver and the best shave possible, go with the 8585 Braun Activator shaver!</li>
            <li> Super product - does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with his \\&quot;self-cleaning\\&quot; razor, although he didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to keep purchasing the cleaning solution packs.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> He seemed very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> My mom was happy too, so I&#x27;ve said all that to say, he seemed really pleased with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good shaver with an effective cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, the shaving quality is superb.</li>
            <li> clean&amp;charge is very cool - and the smell is GREAT.</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> But after using this razer since Christmas, I have to admit that I LOVE THIS THING!  </li>
            <li> razor is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll tell you first hand that I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li> Number One pick for foil shavers and I am glad I went with their reccomendation!</li>
            <li> Very good quality unit here - definately worth the money</li>
            <li> Braun works really great and is impressively better than my old one which I was very happy with.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing machine.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is amazing and works like a champ.  </li>
            <li> Its just amazing</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave .Very</li>
            <li> I can honestly say the shave is as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> he said that he was going to buy his own when he got home.  </li>
            <li> which is nice.  </li>
            <li> (Kind of like ink in your printer.)</li>
            <li> it would have been nice if Braun had a delay start or an automatic timer -</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is anything I should be blaming on the blade though, and it&#x27;s improved over time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every time because I don&#x27;t think it is nessesary but to each their own.  </li>
            <li> Safe and close but not as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li> got a lower end norelco 3 head shaver a year ago - and i liked it -</li>
            <li> I thought that was the best that an electric razor could do at a reasonable price.    </li>
            <li> Does anyone want a good deal on a top of the line Norelco?    </li>
            <li> The razor is I think one of the best, my boyfriend really really likes it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution is in its own plastic, throw-away container.  </li>
            <li> self-cleaning feature is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> It was nice when they made things in germany.</li>
            <li> I find it gives nice close shaves.</li>
            <li> So now I have a nice charging stand, but no cleaning.</li>
            <li> The system does not initiate its own cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say I will not be returning to a razor blade again.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to give this razor a try after reading so many good reviews of it.</li>
            <li> The shaver comes with a nifty plastic travel case which I found a nice touch - it keeps my shaver from dropping whiskers all over everything in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> It takes atleast 5 or 6 shaves before the hair, kind of, gets used to the shaver.</li>
            <li> My problem is do I let him use my Braun 8585 or do I get him his own?</li>
            <li> Overall, i&#x27;d say great performance and a great buy!</li>
            <li> This spontaneous purchase raised the bar for what I expect from my morning shave.  </li>
            <li> The Braun does a fairly impressive job with quick shaves and can easily power through 3-4 days growth without a problem.</li>
            <li> It does a very respectable job and has many quality features to go with it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased and very glad I didn&#x27;t buy the 8595.</li>
            <li> Despite claims of running out quickly and evaporation here on Amazon.com, my experience has been great.</li>
            <li> but the Braun self-cleaning system is quite nice, using a lightly scented alcohol solution to give the razor a good cleaning between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - the self-cleaning system is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> And the best part, you can clean the blades right in the sink, and you can shave in the shower using shave cream.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li> So far, it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> But, the most amazing thing....  </li>
            <li> , the best shaving cream is the Nivea Shaving Gel, i get the sensitive skin but any of them will do.</li>
            <li> Buy Braun or Philips, but this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I find the 8585 the best shavers I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> or so this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a year before I reviewed the product because I wanted to make sure I was still loving it, and I am.</li>
            <li> Braun is superior to Remington in all respects except the important one, \\&quot;close shave\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know this for sure, because I would never dream of using my husband&#x27;s shaver, but it seems like it would work just as well for women, since they don&#x27;t make women&#x27;s shavers as nice as this one.  </li>
            <li> Very fine product.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Provides a good, clean &amp; close shave.</li>
            <li> For years I used Norelco shavers and became unsatisfied with them when I could no longer get a good clean shave on my neck.  </li>
            <li> as a side note - the fact that my face is so smooth - it is actually very appealing to the ladies when i give them a kiss.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver 3-4 months ago and would have to say that i am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> The new foil system gives an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li> I get a great shave quickly and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> This shaver cleans very easily, looks nice and keeps your sink clean.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and cuts great every single time.</li>
            <li> Yes, it cleans the razor great, but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It is fast, very comfortable and gives a GREAT shave.</li>
            <li> satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The razor is OK.</li>
            <li> Love all the features but this shaver doesnt cut as close as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I was having more and more irritation resulting in</li>
            <li> I was also spending more time and money with the razor shave.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> there are many things Braun should do better to improve its usability.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic model can use water to rinse it (actually you can use it during bath) and I consider it a superb design over Braun.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun, please pay more attention on the usability and maintainence.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I tried a triple-foil shaver, which hurt my face more than razors do.  </li>
            <li> have the feeling that the shaver was invented and programmed to make Braun more money in-between shaver purchases.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the 8585 after much research, and I am happy to report that after a month of use I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> my most recent setup was a Mach 3, plus the excellent \\&quot;King of Shaves\\</li>
            <li> and i had more razor burn/irritation than i do with a blade.</li>
            <li> The razor did okay on my face but on the jawlines and the neck it didn&#x27;t cut a darn thing.  </li>
            <li> To be sure, it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the Mach3 blade did.  </li>
            <li> To me the self-cleaning stand is just one more bother in my already cluttered world.  </li>
            <li> I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; electric shaver for many years.</li>
            <li> It takes more time every shave, but not cleaning it is a blessing I can&#x27;t fully describe.</li>
            <li> Looked at the top of the line Panasonic, Norelco, and Braun.  </li>
            <li> Works even better.</li>
            <li> But for $50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade.  </li>
            <li> He says it gives him a better, closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Most people probably wouldn&#x27;t notice, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I didn&#x27;t think this razor worked that much better</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve heard this</li>
            <li> As a side note I also bought one for may dad who has more of a rounder face and he noted this shaver did a better job then his Remington.</li>
            <li> I have tried many razors and no manual razor is safe for me.  </li>
            <li> Electric razor models always seem to come and go over time and nothing is better than this one.  </li>
            <li> but it sure does.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased</li>
            <li> What more could one ask?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more than pleased.</li>
            <li> These Germans sure know how to make the gadgets.  </li>
            <li> i used a cheap electric shaver before and after 3 weeks my head looked like edward james olmos&#x27; face!  </li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, having gone through several Remington and Norelco models.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t sure how close i&#x27;d get of a shave....</li>
            <li> I like the lemony smell, and the razor does a much better job when it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save the difference for some more CCR2 refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, the shave you&#x27;ll get is about as close as most electrics will get with virtually zero skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as this shaver, but my skin does much better.  </li>
            <li> I suppose that depends on many factors.</li>
            <li> can only reiterate some excellent tips that have already been given: &lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63, so you can bet I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors over the years.  </li>
            <li> now that I&#x27;ve tried the Braun 8585, I have to say that I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for three weeks now and am 110% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be as close as what I had with a razor but was extremely happy to see that it&#x27;s much closer and easier.</li>
            <li> The Braun 8585 is simply the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The closeness of my shaves have never been better, but this is still not the foremost reason I recommend the Braun 8585.</li>
            <li> I love the way this thing is self cleaning/charging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of the best looking electric razors I&#x27;ve seen, and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this shaver...</li>
            <li> This razor gives a much better shave than I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would not have taken the time to write this review if I hadn&#x27;t been exceptionally pleased with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> Braun just better not stop making it.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Let me just say, I LOVE this shaver.</li>
            <li> , I recieved this shaver for X-mas from my girlfriend, and it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic!   </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver the beginning of Dec 2004 and am quite pleased with using the shaver</li>
            <li> so I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I make sure</li>
            <li> how many times I went over the darn things.</li>
            <li> I was more than pleased after receiving this product.</li>
            <li> so it will be interesting to see how this is shaving in June.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of different electric razors and this is the best.</li>
            <li> My answer is, probably yes, for most of us.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it is the best electric shaver I have owned or ever used, in my life.  </li>
            <li> Whats not to love?  </li>
            <li> the fact that it comes with so many parts and maintenance requirements, I wish I hadn&#x27;t made the purchase.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head is great, and I really like the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> After going through 3 Norelco units in as many years, I switched to this foil shaver in 2008.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stuck with them for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t need to recharge the battery more than once a week anyway.</li>
            <li> The funny thing is, I remember getting an excellent shave with the first Braun razor I used 24 years ago.</li>
            <li> My son is just coming into the age where he is needing to shave more often.  </li>
            <li> Thats what i love about this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a better deal.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t to say I use them until they stop working - I use them until the lure of something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Blades and screens spend more time touching your face than you do, and the \\&quot;blade chamber\\&quot; invariably becomes dusted and choked with stubble, skin and the detritus of electric shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun 5428 for many years and decided to upgrade to what all here say is a better shaver, i.e., the 8585.   </li>
            <li> OK, but not recommended.</li>
            <li> Oh, ok, so maybe I tried it out.  </li>
            <li> Using Lectric Shave makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I switched from Mach3 + Edge gel to this beauty and couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice.</li>
            <li> And of course the automatic cleaning function is lovely.</li>
            <li> It has much more power than any of its predecessors.  </li>
            <li> so I probably don&#x27;t put this shaver through the rigors of my more hirsute brothers out there.  </li>
            <li> However, I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> 8585 is mechanically very nice and the base/cleaning system works very well.  </li>
            <li> the 8585 shaver is not only one of the best shavers i have ever used, it is so easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Now if I&#x27;m in a hurry, in two to three minutes I can get a pretty good \\&quot;go to work shave\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors.  </li>
            <li> self-cleaning cartridge changeout is very simple, a very good design.</li>
            <li> First of all and most importantly it gives a great, clean, close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> The self cleaning action is great and it saves me time when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Since a close shave irritated my skin with most razers, I would have to wait 2 - 3 days for a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> this shaver does not produce the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver, it is the most comfortable and bloodless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been comfortable using a blade because I always ended up with more knicks &amp; cuts</li>
            <li> It holds comfortable in your hands, and by virtual of its design, shaves much better than the rotary razors at curvy places around the chin.  </li>
            <li> Most people won&#x27;t notice the sound at all, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver is fantastic, as most of the reviewers agree.  </li>
            <li> Also, even though it has the 3 screens, it took a much longer time to shave and it did not do that good of a job.   </li>
            <li> I get a good shave, though I still have to work it under the chin to get all the  hairs that don&#x27;t grow straight out.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you need to leave home to understand how good you really had it.... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The shaver is sleek, effective, and powerful.</li>
            <li> He loved it, and wants another one this year.</li>
            <li> Removing the same amount of beard with the Eltron 770 was quick, easy and yielded excellent results.</li>
            <li> I find cleaning every other day is perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor 3 weeks ago, and have had the best shaves of my life each time I use it (every other day).</li>
            <li> I find that I do have to shave every day or every other day to get an excellent, easy shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy on the face and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> The foil is so easy on my skin that I can shave twice a day</li>
            <li> * having to clean my shaver - just let the magic box do it.  </li>
            <li> This shaver makes it easy to touch up an evening shadow without hacking up your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> 5/5 stars and I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> My model 6520 Ultra Speed is stiil going strong.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit more care and effort that it probably should, but the irritation is so much lower (sometimes none) that I honestly don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> The self cleaning system is really nice, and it does do a good job of cleaning the razor provided you use it daily.  </li>
            <li> It fits in the hand nicely and it has a good solid feeling to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got pretty sensitive skin and get razor burn very easily (thus my decision to stop shaving with blades), but the Braun Activator 8585 has been great to my skin.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I liked the shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a perfectly clean, fresh smelling shaver each time.  </li>
            <li> It is especially good at getting hairs that lay down.</li>
            <li> For a comfortable, easy goingelectric shaver, the 8585 is a charmer.comfortable, easy going electric shaver, the 8585 is a charmer.</li>
            <li> and it works as good as new.</li>
            <li> previously had a Braun 6520 for years and was very happy with it until the day it died.  </li>
            <li> The rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves fine.  </li>
            <li> I had owned the previous version of this razor and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Given no irritation anywhere on my face and neck, the 5% differential is just fine.  </li>
            <li> The hair seems to curl more quickly.</li>
            <li> Not true, this is the best.</li>
            <li> I received the new Braun 8585 for Christmas and this one is by far the best one I have used.</li>
            <li> I can shave in less than a minute and the quality of the shave is great and getting better as I get better at using the Braun and my face adjusts.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Smart Logic\\&quot; battery system is also nice, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about when you do and don&#x27;t recharge the battery.  </li>
            <li> - well she wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what i meant - so she just went out and got me the nicest shaver they sold at the store!</li>
            <li> Excellent buy, close shave (with a little work).</li>
            <li> This might be a unique experience for me but this shaver is still going strong after almost 10 years of use.  </li>
            <li> They could claim to be \\&quot;99.5% as close as a blade\\&quot; and be completely accurate.  </li>
            <li> Now, I know that may sound like heresy, but brother, once you try it, you&#x27;ll be amazed.    </li>
            <li> This razor is perfect for anyone looking to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; a few minutes and a lot of hassle out of their morning routine.</li>
            <li> A longtime razor user, he tried the Activator and liked it so much</li>
            <li> Great power does not need come with bigger noise! &lt;</li>
            <li> I believe it to be the finest electric shaver available today.  </li>
            <li> Razors will get you the closest shave available.  </li>
            <li> Overall, its a great shaver.</li>
            <li> And even then, to get a smooth as silk face takes a LOT of time.  </li>
            <li> And it feels absolutly fantastic on my skin</li>
            <li> It picks up the scragglers and leaves everything smooth as silk.   </li>
            <li> Last winter, I stumbled a Remington Titanium razor at a great price and decided to buy it (my Braun needed replaced).  </li>
            <li> Does the price difference sound rational to you?  </li>
            <li> The led is as bright as the razor is loud.  </li>
            <li> You know, its not often I can say something is fantastic</li>
            <li> The cleaner also works great, it needs cleaning only after 3 or 4 uses.</li>
            <li> say - i can not believe how smooth my face was -</li>
            <li> The self cleaning system keeps it working smoothly from shave to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with those, you get what you pay for; a cheap shave.  </li>
            <li> --I have a clear view from the bed into the bathroom, and at night the lights on the shaver are too bright.  </li>
            <li> I get the best results from shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> self cleaning feature is a great extra.</li>
            <li> I experience zero irritation and the shave is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t get another Braun like this if it was free.....</li>
            <li> &quot; (i.e. I&#x27;ll give you the disposable razor or printer for free - you just have to buy replacement blades and ink cartridges forever) but the cost involved in replacement items for the 8585 is not negligible.  </li>
            <li> Gives a close and comfortable shave.   </li>
            <li> Overall a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was a fantastic shift.  </li>
            <li> After the initial \\&quot;getting to know you\\&quot; phase, I had great shaves every morning.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be cheap, upgrade.</li>
            <li> In short, this electric razor is great.  </li>
            <li> find the cleaning solution (which has a light lemon scent) needs to be changed about once a month, and 3 packs cost somewhere between $15 - 20.  </li>
            <li> He said that the razor did not give him a smooth shave on his neck area and it irritated the skin.  </li>
            <li> She now looks fabulous and also heartily endorses the Braun 8585 Activator.</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not quite as good as an old fashioned blade</li>
            <li> The Norelco was far superior.</li>
            <li> I had been using one of Norelco&#x27;s better shavers in the 8000 series and it did an all right job.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to clean up fine bits of hair each morning.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> However, I have had a couple of ingrown hairs too, something very rarely had with the Integral.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I&#x27;m getting a lemony fresh clean shave every morning.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works great at getting those hairs that lie flat on my neck.</li>
            <li> Since the first shave it has been very comfortable.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT if you have very good hearing like me, the charger makes a VERY high pitched sound constantly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t charge as quickly as the Norelco and it is not as easy to clean manually as the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> , it gets no better then this, it shaves me closer then a razor, it is simply perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a first, and I have been using the most exspensive electric shavers for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> The shaver did leave me with some irratation at first but most of that has subsided by now.  </li>
            <li> , I get a good clean shave, the machine is easy to clean and maintain, and quiet.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving my head along with my face,it keeps me feeling clean and cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not provide me with a clean or a close shave.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t clean it in the sink like you can with a Panasonic wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that as it changes its cleaning recommendations, it never goes backwards, even if you clean it by hand.</li>
            <li> I always take the foil off and clean after each shave.</li>
            <li> it cleans itself better than I possibly could, and the lemon scent is nice.    </li>
            <li> To save on the cleaning cartridge, I tend to dock and clean it after every-other shave - it still comes up with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I do like having a clean razor</li>
            <li> It keeps the shaver clean, lubricated, and smelling chemically clean.</li>
            <li> Add $60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor.  </li>
            <li> The shaver holds its charge well and stays clean with the charger/cleaner system.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to just hand clean every day (20 seconds).  </li>
            <li> I tend to have to replace the cleaning solution around every 30 days - I would clean the shaver every day.  </li>
            <li> If you want a completely smooth shave, this may not be good enough.</li>
            <li> He can always keep the shaver clean while not spending a lot of time cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> But with the Clean and charge unit, these issues are moot.  </li>
            <li> I just run a couple strokes of a Gilette Fusion razor to clean up a bit of stubble</li>
            <li> the 8995 have an lcd display that tell you when to clean</li>
            <li> The lockable pivoting head puts the cutter block and foil directly where they need to be for the best shave possible.  </li>
            <li> The 8595 shaver has an LED display which indicates the charge level, but honestly this seemed somewhat superfluous since most guys don&#x27;t shave for hours on end without putting the shaver back into the recharging unit and even if you did go for hours on end you could still use the power cord.  </li>
            <li> thing to note is to NEVER try to clean this razor or inside cleaning stand with WATER.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to worry about taking the shaver apart to clean it.</li>
            <li> The blue charging light isn&#x27;t that bright</li>
            <li> Nice engineering, a clean comfortable shave, not too loud.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes also have to shave twice a day if I want a somewhat clean look in the evening.</li>
            <li> The cleaning doesn&#x27;t clean either of Remington&#x27;s \\&quot;pop-up\\&quot; cutters well.</li>
            <li> I have a knack for somehow managing to half amputate my leg while shaving, so it was a nice easy and effective switch.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver based on the many positive reviews on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Speaking as someone who has been shaving for 20+ years, primarily with blade over electric (Gillette Mach 3 for last few years), I can honestly say the Braun 8585 is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it&#x27;s not as good on the neck hairs and other challenging spots.   </li>
            <li> The major improvement on this model is the head design, that alone, is possibly why it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend about 4 years ago, and it still works as if it was new, and it shaves very smoothly and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Even at it&#x27;s best, the appearance is generally that of a second day cut with a Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Self cleaning system is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it would be much different (or maybe even favorable) if you compare it to the price of good quality blades, gel, and aftershave.</li>
            <li> have a full beard.</li>
            <li> have always liked Braun Shavers (I owned about 5 so far).</li>
            <li> The 8585 actually feels good on my face and there&#x27;s no pinching or irritation to speak of.  </li>
            <li> shaver is rather quiet compared to some and has a fair amount of power.</li>
            <li> The Braun is a much closer shave, but takes much more time to shave.  </li>
            <li> The blace does a much better job and much faster.  </li>
            <li> This is a good shaver, but I will only discuss my complaints:</li>
            <li> The cleaning fluid lasts a good amount of time, even with almost every day use.  </li>
            <li> To me that&#x27;s a good enough trade-off to stick with the razor and recommend it.</li>
            <li> The shave I get from this razor is good enough and without the irritation</li>
            <li> I want to thank the person who wrote in his review about being able to use the razor without the docking station, it was realy important to me to be able to use and charge the razor with only the cord</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice the cord can plug directly into the shaver to charge the shaver.</li>
            <li> but this really does a better job</li>
            <li> : this is a fantastic razor well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> really makes me love this shaver, though, is the self-cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The cost of refills is not bad at all considering you don&#x27;t have to spend time poking and brushing out your shaver every morning.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand  the self clean features and recharge stand are great.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver kit in November 2004 (it&#x27;s now August 2005), and while the shaver has always performed quite nicely once I got used to it (I previously shaved with blades), the cleaning unit has always been kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if your traveling and need to shave quickly, but I do not see it replacing the standard razor.</li>
            <li> I run the cleaning cycle after every use, but I make sure to clean out most of the gunk in the shaver by popping the shaver screen and running it for a short time, as per the procedure in the manual.  </li>
            <li> performance is only very marginally better than my Norelco which has languished in my top drawer for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job with the flat hair under my chin.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re well worth the price for a shaver that is clean and causes no</li>
            <li> A loyal Norelco user now using Braun.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think that the Braun cleaning system is more about sellling cleaning cartridges than providing a significantly better shave.  </li>
            <li> I have mild arthritis and the Flex XP</li>
            <li> The &#x27;low battery&#x27; warning light is a nice feature, but I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;two or three shaves\\&quot; that Braun claims after it came on.  </li>
            <li> FORMER blade user is extremely happy and very satsfied with his purchase.</li>
            <li> In terms of comfort, the Norelco Advantage has a bit of an edge because I did like the integrated gel dispenser, in terms of a close, quick shave I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re about even</li>
            <li> Faster shaving and quick clean-up.</li>
            <li> short, I&#x27;m not THAT impressed, and continue to shave with both a Mach 3 regular razor &amp; this one.  </li>
            <li> Better yet, nicks are very rare, and nowhere near as long-bleeding as those from a blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade man since my very first shave over 25 years ago.  </li>
            <li> and I feel that this product is not worth the money, especially in light of their repair policy.  </li>
            <li> (what they say is your average adjustment period), but I feel the shaves have been great since day one.</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning option is wonderful and a big key to the success.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take as long to shave and my face feels as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job with the long side-growing hairs around my adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> But this is a minor issue given how good a shave I get.    </li>
            <li> I can usually get a good 75 or so days from each cart, and the carts themselves are very cheap.</li>
            <li> AND, best of all, his neck isn&#x27;t raw and he can shave every day if he wants or needs to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to just put down the shaver and be done-</li>
            <li> The mini cutters in the middle of the foils do the job wonderfully on longer hairs, and that alone makes the Braun a better overall design to my old Remington.    </li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the razor and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertising of capturing more, if not all, hairs on the neck.  </li>
            <li> Holds a pretty good charge, needed to charge it twice on a recent three week trip.</li>
            <li> As well the shave is very close and very quick.</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s motor is very quite and the razor is easy to hold, and manipulate.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this shaver!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just happy to be done with the mess of shaving cream and the cuts on my neck.  </li>
            <li> The shave is more than adequate, but I find it can&#x27;t shave as close around and under the jaw line like my old Remington.  </li>
            <li> Also the cleaning fluid is most denatured alcohol, so if you wanted to buy a bottle of that to refill the cartridge it would probably work fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe just how well this product works, it&#x27;s absolutely incredible.</li>
            <li> The razor is comfortable to use and gives me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the system determines somehow the level of stubble build-up automatically, and yes, sometimes I wonder how accurate it is but the real value is that this monitoring function is just that.  </li>
            <li> so take that for \\&quot;whaddits\\&quot; worth.  </li>
            <li> worth $140.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a &#x27;real&#x27; razor, but it is good enough for a workday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got curious about how the foil does so much better than the more uniform lower-end Braun models.</li>
            <li> It has required some adjustment, but for my lifestyle right now it&#x27;s a good match, and I would certainly recommend this model to anyone contemplating the same change.    </li>
            <li> self cleaning system is pretty cool</li>
            <li> then it was worth.   </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s the slogan of another company, honestly the 8585 is the only shaver that&#x27;s ever truly been</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various rotary and micro-screen shavers by Norelco, Braun, and Remington for nearly twenty years, but the Braun 8585 is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The Braun was worth every penny because IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun has finally designed an electric shaver with all the features that truly matter and work effectively.</li>
            <li> As far as the cost of the cleaning solution, for the comfort you receive with this product, it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
            <li> And no facial discomfort of any kind.</li>
            <li> or so should be worth it,</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price, even with the cleaning cartridges and replacing the foil and cutter block periodically.</li>
            <li> I should preface the negative sounding title of this review by saying that I have a lot of respect for this Braun product, and I think there are many good things about.</li>
            <li> Do the math and find out whether it is worth it to you.</li>
            <li> Comes with a nice travel case could be bit bigger.  </li>
            <li> I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is worth it considering the quality of the shave and the durability of the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything in the shaving world including giving a hot towel press before shave and all sorts of after shave to keep it cool.</li>
            <li> It can go through 2 days worth of stubble without even breaking a sweat.  </li>
            <li> I found other people&#x27;s reviews to be so helpful when I was trying to find the best electric shaver recently.   </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still cheaper than razors, and cream and other things you use with a blade, and it can&#x27;t really be avoided for the great feature it is.</li>
            <li> Have 2 much older (non-cleaning) Braun shavers and both work just fine.</li>
            <li> Gives an excellent, super close shave -- wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> The self-cleaning does work very well initially, but once it fills up with hair/dirt it doesn&#x27;t clean as effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pros for this razor include how fast it shaves, and what a good job it does on flat surfaces on your face.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my husband, a no-nonsense kinda guy, who really likes that clean fresh shave from using the self-cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li> have used my shaver for six months and it still holds a good charge and cuts well due to the cleaner, I think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people complain it doesn&#x27;t sit well in the station because they are right handed</li>
            <li> and this shaver mows right through it.</li>
            <li> , the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> I expect I&#x27;ll use three or four of the disposable cleaning cartridge per year, but for about a nickel per day a clean, sterile, and just plain good smelling razor is a bargain.</li>
            <li> It does self clean well and does not cut me as much as a razor.</li>
            <li> I also really like the self clean feature.  </li>
            <li> Norelco is really, really fast, for five shaves after you clean it.  </li>
            <li> I had a full beard and mustache for most of the last 25 years, because I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the corresponding cuts, irritation, and discomfort caused by shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> The LCD display shows how much power you have and how clean the shaver is.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s certainly as close as my Norelco was, just as fast, just as easy and</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it turns a previously glaring weakness of electrics - the chore of regular maintenance - into a strength.</li>
            <li> Part of the problem is that I have a very fine beard, especially in the neck area.  </li>
            <li> However, when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary.  </li>
            <li> The unique shape of the foil and the cleaning system were the main draws for me while I was comparison shopping.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve decided to create my own cleaning fluid using all natural, organic ingredients and just refill the original cartridge when needed.  </li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s self cleaning feature is fabulous and works well; it&#x27;s like having a brand new shaver every time.  </li>
            <li> Good close shave with much less irritation than a razor.</li>
            <li> As someone who has always used a Braun electric shaver I must say that it was an easy choice when it came time to replace my old Flex Control model.  </li>
            <li> the shaver glides smoothly over my face and neck after it has been through a cleaning cycle, it is not so smooth with the next shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor overall is good, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the old Remington TR400.  </li>
            <li> It provides a much closer shave w/ far greater comfort.</li>
            <li> It may work wonderfully for some people with a different beard type and neck angles than mine, but I am not sure it was worth the $145</li>
            <li> However, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun 8585 about 6 months ago and have little good to say.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little worried about whether or not it would be a good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many high end electric shavers over the years, and I&#x27;ve found that none of them work nearly as well as Braun shavers, and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> gives me a completely clean razor---just like new.</li>
            <li> You either use a brush or Braun&#x27;s new clean and charge stand.</li>
            <li> I used to use a mach 3 turbo which gave me a pretty close shave and the bumps to match.</li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face (the Syncro did).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve try many different razor, however, this is the razor that doesn&#x27;t give me any pain while shaving.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used an electric razor was about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Shave was pretty close, not as close as my safety razor and cream, but pretty dang close.  </li>
            <li> More than likely it&#x27;s the newfangled foil, but I can shave every day now if I choose and not have irritated skin,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great shave from a foil shaver, and at least in my case NO rash anymore.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver, so I can&#x27;t say how it compares to others.  </li>
            <li> However, I have to say that shaving as an experience is much better with the Braun Activator than with a traditional razor (I was using the Mach3).  </li>
            <li> This is my first Braun.</li>
            <li> but I can do so without any cuts, which is another first.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a higher and lower level of cleaning that it will use depending on how often you dock it.)  </li>
            <li> only thing that is better in the Braun is the battery lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> This 8585 is my most recent and highest end model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco for years, and I must admit I was pretty nervous about switching from the rotatory style blades.</li>
            <li> First, the shave isn&#x27;t exactly as close as others seem to be experiencing.</li>
            <li> This bugged me at first, but I&#x27;ve got used to it.</li>
            <li> I love the built in trimmer blade, the way the cord can be plugged into the shaver itself, and especially the self cleaning system.</li>
            <li> first off i use this machine to shave my head.  </li>
            <li> It is the first electric shaver that I have used.</li>
            <li> I would have gladly gotten the razor with out it and saved some money if it were possible.  </li>
            <li> I only got one more shave.</li>
            <li> Most of the cleaning cycle seems to be drying time, so the unit is quiet.</li>
            <li> And now I shave more often, just because it&#x27;s such a pleasure now.  </li>
            <li> Now I am back using this activator once more</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> Rather than being a simple mesh of circular holes, this foil has holes and slots in a pattern that basically gives a lot more ways for a hair to enter the foil and get cut.  </li>
            <li> Bought the shaver for myself as a Christmas present and love it.  </li>
            <li> One of the reasons I was willing to spend the money was the $50 Amazon coupon that was promised with the unit.  </li>
            <li> I have experienced none of the problems the negative reviews on this product list.  </li>
            <li> Got hot during charging and motor wouldn&#x27;t run at all.</li>
            <li> My first electric razor, 30 years ago, was a Norelco.</li>
            <li> So far it has been well worth it; it&#x27;s doing a much better job in just 2 days than my old, cheaper shaver ever did.  </li>
            <li> I have also recently started using a pre-shave to get a better shave.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d only known sooner what to do to get him to shave more often...</li>
            <li> It does not get as close as a razor, but it does shave pretty close to it, but the difference is, with this shaver as compared to a razor (mach 3) i can shave against the grain under my chin and not get and razor bumps or burns.</li>
            <li> It does take a couple weeks for you and your face to get used to the razor, but that just means that the shave won&#x27;t be as close as it can be the first week or two.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the smaller shaver gives better maneuverability.  </li>
            <li> (if you have a big neck, maybe this electric will perform better).</li>
            <li> Comes with a good travel case although it does not fit the cord which is needed to charge when on the road.</li>
            <li> cordless...simply replace the cartridge every few months and you are good to go...</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this shaver at first, but it caused problems for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base is great as it keeps the blades and foil nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would happily spend another $100 to get a razor that does half a job that a Mach 3 hand-held blade and good old shaving cream will do.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never come close to dropping it though, so this may be just a reaction to the better feel of the Integral&#x27;s flat surface with rubber</li>
            <li> This was TOTALLY unexpected - i was excited - but i was concerned - this one did not have 3 pivoting heads that i had used before -</li>
            <li> If your bathroom attaches to your bedroom and you kick off the cleaning process while the spouse is sleeping plan on an early morning fight as you will surely wake up the better half.    </li>
            <li> After 30 years of shaving with a blade, I have finally found an electric razor that works good enough to abandon the blade.  </li>
            <li> Braun actually does provide a very close shave, but it takes more time than the Norelco I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
            <li> The prior Braun&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had were middle of the road models and both worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is probably too bulky to take on the road but unless you travel for more than 2 weeks, the razor really doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; enough to require any cleaning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor burned my skin after the first use, but I used it straight out of the box, instead of running it through a cleaning cycle first.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am sensitive to smells, but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose.  </li>
            <li> No mess and comes out perfectly clean.  </li>
            <li> First the shaver it self is very sleek.</li>
            <li> I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner, so that keep the fluid clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It shaves more quickly and with less effort that</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer, contrary to other reviews, is actually very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I just bought it and the first few shaes I have taken were amazing,</li>
            <li> The razor gets all the parts of his face, quickly and it&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(make sure you shave after the shower when your face is hot and wet)</li>
            <li> I still enjoy a hot shave with my razor every once a while, but this Braun is definitely my default choice now.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be able to use a dry shavor?</li>
            <li> another reviewer astutely points out, if you want to conserve cleaning fluid, you can always charge the 8585 directly with the power cable.</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning feature is pretty loud, but worth it because of the ease and quickness of shaving.  </li>
            <li> - the manual says it is strongly recommended that you shave prior to showering or washing your face.  </li>
            <li> Certainly the closest I&#x27;ve ever had with any electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning fluid is good for a month if cleaning daily, but I only clean 1-2 times per week</li>
            <li> If your significant other demands baby smooth cheeks, you can always bust out the &#x27;real&#x27; razor for date night.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my Braun 6520 (slim and elegant), this new model is a tank (big and unwieldy).     </li>
            <li> It shaves right down to the skin and gets all those pesky off-side ones, too, within a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;You truly get what you pay for many times (not always though) and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to use with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I had tried electric razors in the past but they never did a good job shaving  (especially my neck) and were always a pain to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> In reality, you get a pretty good shave, but no better than the older Braun I replaced (which didn&#x27;t have these new features).  </li>
            <li> It is not close to a real razor and misses areas on my face.</li>
            <li> It really cleans the shaver well for a no maintenance shaver.</li>
            <li> The razor shaves very well &amp; I like the combination cleaning &amp; charging station.</li>
            <li> shaver itself is really well designed.</li>
            <li> It feels solid and comfortable in your hand without being a brick.  </li>
            <li> Too much plastic.  </li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for with electric shavers.   </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the 8585! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br</li>
            <li> My Trusty old Norelco was just not cutting it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Braun turned out to be better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Also, the lines between the holes are much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who are thinking of making the jump!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s capable of delivering a very close shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to miss spots than it was with blade shaving, and I find myself having to run my hand ahead of the blade to \\&quot;pick up\\&quot; the hairs</li>
            <li> I can even shave twice in one day- maybe a morning quickie, and a more careful shave before \\&quot;date night\\</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face, so I plan to replace cartridges pretty much according to the normal schedule.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a light sleeper, run it later.    </li>
            <li> I have to keep teasing the beard up with my free hand and keep going over and over the same spot.  </li>
            <li> It does a reasonable job</li>
            <li> After much deliberating and review reading, I went with the Braun.   </li>
            <li> The self cleaning system works very well.  </li>
            <li> but its much closer than the barber clippers, and if you use some sort of after shave and/or pre-shave(electric)</li>
            <li> For a really smooth shave, I have found that I must use the cleaner after every shave, which is not always practical (especially when I&#x27;m out of town).</li>
            <li> Thanks DJ</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to the sound that a TV makes when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li> After much reading, I decided on the Activator 8585.    </li>
            <li> The Braun 8585 shaves much closer.  </li>
            <li> you want a really close shave and almost no iritation</li>
            <li> It shaves much closer than the Norelco, and is very comparable to a blade.  </li>
            <li> However, after two months of gentle use, the cleaning stand stopped working.  </li>
            <li> it is a much faster and cleam way to shave...</li>
            <li> This whole experience shows how much of a hassle you might have if you need to have this Braun razor repaired under warrantee.  </li>
            <li> (as some others have complained...come on, really now...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this razor.  </li>
            <li> No annoying stubble bits that have been shaved falling out of the head or left on your face.  </li>
            <li> so much so, I picked one up for my father-in-law this Christmas.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son and he loves it thanks</li>
            <li> That will really depend on frequency of use, coarseness of beard, how often cleaning cycles are used, etc....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this item to any man who wants a close shave without the nicks.</li>
            <li> Is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a couple weeks now and I am ready to give my thoughts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too much problem on my face, but the neck can be a problem.</li>
            <li> I really have to work to get everything off the neck.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not hurt to shave after skipping a couple of days, it actually gives my skin a nice tingly feeling.  </li>
            <li> the wall plug is big and sticks out further than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I actually called Braun customer service again and asked them if I could of had better or faster repair service if I mailed the part directly to Braun instead of taking it to the authorized Braun repair shop.</li>
            <li> very much appreciate the opportunity you have provided for me to comment on my new Braun Electric Shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for ten weeks, using the auto clean every day, and the original cleaning cartridge is not empty yet.  </li>
            <li> It also easily trims any long hair by pointing the foil head straight at them.</li>
            <li> I tried an electric shaver for the first time 7 years ago and quickly went back to a blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It came down to this or getting a new Norelco Advantage, which I also liked.  </li>
            <li> This would likely extend the cartridge lifetime significantly-</li>
            <li> Now five months later, it has degraded significantly.  </li>
            <li> For the special occasions where I really want a close shave, I can take the time and get something approaching what a blade could do.  </li>
            <li> Since the Braun doesn&#x27;t require shaving cream, you&#x27;ll have to pay closer attention the first few times you use it to make sure you don&#x27;t miss any spots.  </li>
            <li> As long as I use it everyday, or maybe skip one day once in a while, it works great.  </li>
            <li> I hope he has cleaned house as I clean my beard daily.    </li>
            <li> Of course, there is the extra expense of buying replacement solution for the clean and charge unit.  </li>
            <li> The fluid cartridges have lasted me about six to eight weeks each, and I clean the shaver almost every day.</li>
            <li> I only clean my razor when it needs to be charged</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Pretty clean shave overall &lt;</li>
            <li> It uses special cleaning fluid which has to be replace every several weeks depending on how often you clean it.</li>
            <li> Third, there&#x27;s nothing special about the way it shaves.  </li>
            <li> it cleans itself, the fluid is not expensive, and my head up until right now is shiny.  </li>
            <li> To keep the blade decent, I had to clean it on regular basis and it too was a hassle.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for just over a couple of weeks and trust me, this thing is as good as your gillette minus the nicks and cuts and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is also handy for those of you lazy like me</li>
            <li> This was my first foil razor in years, I basically decided to get it based on the strength of the reviews here, as my old Norelco rotary shaver was giving up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was full of hair clippings and cleaning fluid, and once I wiped it out and tried to restart it, nothing happens.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not going to say the shave is as close as my old Mach 3 is, but it is pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> As far as shaving, it does pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get a good grip on it -- very few rubber contact pads -- and your hand fatigues more easily.</li>
            <li> I emailed Amazon yesterday, they emailed me today that I would have a brand new replacement shaver delivered tomorrow!</li>
            <li> It really does feel like a brand new shaver every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I drop it in and go!The razor really does seem brand new everytime you use it.</li>
            <li> The thing still works like new thanks to the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The new micro screen&#x27;s shape really does pick-up more hair in less strokes.</li>
            <li> I upgrade to a new one every two or three years, and despite all the marketing and technology hype, this one too doesn&#x27;t make shaving really any better than the previous model.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I get such an amazingly close shave with it with absolutely no skiin irritation.</li>
            <li> I could get a slightly closer shave using a blade though I would also have more irritation to get that closer shave, so there is a trade off.</li>
            <li> In summary- as a recent convert to electric shaving, I&#x27;ve been pleased overall.  </li>
            <li> I also tried a Remington Micro Screen (twin head) as a replacement for my older Remington 700.  </li>
            <li> 30 minutes later, it comes out fresh and ready to go again.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, it is a decent razor</li>
            <li> They are two main types on the market today, 1.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t see it being better than the traditional circular hole design in my Remington; I can&#x27;t comment when compared to the Braun Syncro line since I&#x27;ve never used it.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, in summary, nice shaver, but unfortunately flimsy and cheap cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li> I had always heard electric razors burn your face and don&#x27;t give a decent shave no matter the brand or type of electric razor you used.  </li>
            <li> This may or may not be true of past electric razors, but I&#x27;m hear to tell you this Braun Activator 8585 is one fantastic razor.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price.</li>
            <li> in all, a decent buy, but not the performance they would have you believe.</li>
            <li> The basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter, shaves just as well, and cost me about 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> Noise from the shave is very loud, much louder than Panasonic model.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun promises a much closer, smoother and more efficient shave as a result of the new foil with a \\&quot;revolutionary new pattern\\&quot; resulting in \\&quot;20 different hair capturing opportunities compared to just 1 from a regular</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> but if you every hear a high pitch noise--check the razor.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this model,</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Activator 8585 by Braun.  </li>
            <li> As far as the shaver, it cannot do a good job on the neck if you have a thick new beard every morning.  </li>
            <li> With a little web surfing you can get a top of the line Panasonic shaver for under a $100 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I am spending a little more time shaving</li>
            <li> advice: buy something without a self-cleaning system and spend a little more money to get something nicer.</li>
            <li> Wow!!  </li>
            <li> The self cleaning thing is a little over the top for my taste.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think that was possible without hot wax!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about waking up your significant other, just clean it later.  </li>
            <li> * Comes with a handy hard case - instead of the leather/material of the 7526 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I have developed real issues with the environmental impact of the disposable cleaning solution</li>
            <li> Firstly I&#x27;d like to make a comment about razors in general.  </li>
            <li> I got a MUCH closer shave with the old razor than I did with this OVERPRICED Braun.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try not to be redundant, as most of all the glowing feedback on display I agree with 100%.  </li>
            <li> How many cars last that long without any problems?</li>
            <li> The Braun does dramatically better than that Remington when I get a few days of growth though.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> i bought the more pricey model a few months ago...</li>
            <li> If I wait longer than two days, it&#x27;s a bit more work and takes a few minutes longer, but the results come through.  </li>
            <li> what kind of complaint is that anyway?)  </li>
            <li> I seem to be able to shave in a few fewer swipes than I did before.  </li>
            <li> it really is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra money for that.</li>
            <li> , I find a distinct aroma of the cleaning solution in my bathroom and in the hall outside the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Do you want to clean the thing every single week?  </li>
            <li> This one is even better than the previous! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> As a result, most of the time the shaver uses the \\&quot;eco\\&quot; cleaning mode, which makes the cleaning cartridge last longer (I&#x27;m still on my first one after a month and a half, and it still reads \\&quot;full\\&quot;).      </li>
            <li> Just as a tip, always pop the foil guard off the shaver and use the brush supplied with the shaver to manually clean out loose hairs.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and can use it daily without any irritation.   </li>
            <li> I replaced my last one, and it was still going strong, lasting over a week on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new Braun is doing much better, although the attached papers indicated it might take a few weeks to adapt to the new shaving heads.  </li>
            <li> So it is doing something to figure out the amount of clippings inside, but even if you remove them thoroughly it still tells you that it needs the same level of cleaning as it did right before you cleaned it.</li>
            <li> I could never shave with that razor since it couldn&#x27;t handle the longer growth; the Braun just plows right through several days growth with no problem.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice size, a good heft, and a straight shaving head mounted on a rotating base that gives it just enough flexibility for under-neck shaving.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s akin to buying new blades month after month.</li>
            <li> I do not see any difference in shaving between my $60.- Braun 5520 and this new shaver.</li>
            <li> or so I will have to buy a new cleaning solution cartridge</li>
            <li> I tried gillete&#x27;s new power fusion with 5 blades and it didn&#x27;t even come close to the comfort and closeness of the Mach 3 Power.</li>
            <li> I just bought the new Braun, we&#x27;ll see how that works.</li>
            <li> With the newly designed foil, the time and effort to shave has been reduced by 50%.</li>
            <li> After thirty years, and five Norelco electric razors, I decided to live on the edge and try something new.  </li>
            <li> Also, the cleaning system means every morning I shave with a brand new razor as it cleans it meticulously well.</li>
            <li> and they said the unit could not be repaired and he already order a new cleaning stand unit over a week ago</li>
            <li> Being completely new to electric shaving, I relied upon consumer reviews and product web-sites.  </li>
            <li> Every morning when I pick it up to use it, I feel like I&#x27;m using a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It has never given me any problems and still works like new.</li>
            <li> The stand lets you know when your razor needs a cleaning or a new container of solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I attribute this to the new foil design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> super clean blade shave was great done every other day but sometimes two a day were needed and that was too painful and time consuming.</li>
            <li> Then my wife bought me one 2 years ago and it worked reasonably well for a time, but cleaning was a hassle, and since the hairs on my neck somehow grow at crazy angles I could never seem to do a great job on them.  </li>
            <li> (which is a huge jump from never), and I remove the fluid and re-cap it to make it last longer, seems to work.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re after an electric shaver, this is the one to get, but keep your razor and shaving lotion for times when you need that extra close, extra smooth shave.</li>
            <li> However, for someone like me with very sensitive skin, it works well.</li>
            <li> Titanium self cleaning razor, but its motor is very loud.</li>
            <li> This is the second electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and the first I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> First off, I quite using the self-cleaning system when the included fluid ran out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the funny shaped foil would make such a difference</li>
            <li> While at first I had mixed feelings about the Braun, it&#x27;s grown on me quite a bit</li>
            <li> If I shaved with some growth, I literally had to use the trimmer on my face first, then the regular blades.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> and it does exactly the same job...</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> After using the Braun 8585 for almost two weeks, all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> This is my first ever electric shaving system, and i am totally hooked to it.</li>
            <li> This is my second Activator shaving system; I had one of the original models and it didn&#x27;t survive a 1,000 mile move, so I purchased this one last year.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to shave prior to showering, since the skin tends to swell a bit in hot water.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s triple head design does better on neck areas and small areas</li>
            <li> Therefore, I attest the 8585 is gentle but all business, giving a damn fine close-but-not-too-close shave with very little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does do a good cleaning job, after a half hour of buzzing and stinking (slightly).</li>
            <li> Clean cut, great feel, nifty cleaner/charging base.</li>
            <li> As we all know traditional razor blade replacement prices have been going through the roof for years, and for guys like me with tough beards the blade itself only gives you about a week or two worth of good shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve preferred blades for years, as most electrics give me bad razor burn and don&#x27;t do a good job getting the flat whiskers on the bottom of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a hard face to cut and, as I am getting older, it gets harder to do a good job.</li>
            <li> With the new foil design, it glides over my face and requires far fewer passes to get the job done &lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shape of the razor is rounded slightly and smooth</li>
            <li> Those hard-to-get odd angled hairs aside, the razor works smoothly and almost imperceptably.</li>
            <li> And, the new cleaning and charging system is a significant upgrade from their previous models.</li>
            <li> I understand the majority of reviews are positive and this is my personal experience.  </li>
            <li> It cut close and fast, and everytime I cleaned it, it was like starting with a brand new unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an excuse to upgrade to one of the new models, but the thing works so well and hasn&#x27;t had any issues, so I really can&#x27;t find one!</li>
            <li> anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor (not even the expensive triple edged ones, just cheap disposables) is dreaming.  </li>
            <li> It is possible also, that in some cases, it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary, but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times I go over them.  </li>
            <li> I also have some concerns with the quality of the cleaning stand because  it broke so quickly and if I will have the same problem with it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to the new 8585 - mainly to try the new foil design.  </li>
            <li> The flexible screen abandons the \\&quot;lots of little holes in a grid\\&quot; concept for a crazy-cross hatched slot-and-hole screen that does a good - not perfect, but good - job of letting hairs at odd angles meet the blades.</li>
            <li> This really blew me away because I have extremely sensitive skin and could never shave with a dry shaver without intense razor burn.</li>
            <li> but i simply follow with a few strokes of a dry razor after shaving with the braun and all is good...</li>
            <li> I am looking for a good, quick shave in the morning provided by a reliable and low maintenance razor (call me crazy).  </li>
            <li> As mentioned in earlier posts the cleaning system may be a little over the top</li>
            <li> I have the most sensative face and hard to cut/heavy beard of any person I&#x27;ve ever met.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Braun; 2) I have owned various models and thus can compare new models to the older versions.     </li>
            <li> Braun (owned by Gillette) has cleverly gotten you to pay big bucks for an electric shaver, then get you to buy a new cleaning cartridge every month.</li>
            <li> I have found that my face is actually less irritated with the Braun than when shaving with a blade, all with out having to clean up the shaving gel and stubble from the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> They were completely gone after about 2 weeks of using the braun 8585.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this shaver to guys with sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li> I agree with several reviewers that this cleaning unit is really a lot of hype and overengineering.  </li>
            <li> I have never found an electric razor that even got anywhere near as close as a blade</li>
            <li> I could get it pretty damn close on my face by repeatedly jamming the razor against my face, but it would take a long time to do this.  </li>
            <li> As far as the hair on my throat, there was no way at all to cut that anywhere near as close as I would have wanted.  </li>
            <li> sincerely apolgise for these negative comments but trust nevertheless that you will find them helpful.</li>
            <li> Way too loud.</li>
            <li> I saw no material difference between the Activator and my five year old Braun.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle is a bit loud...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add that I have the enviable honor of having sensitive skin, along with bullet proof stubble.  </li>
            <li> I bought this model to replace my old Panasonic triple blade shaver.</li>
            <li> and I am surprised to find this happens.</li>
            <li> By comparison the Remington was much louder especially the sideburn trimmer which made me feel like I should insert earplugs before putting that thing so close to my ear.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning tank seems to last a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very close and for the amount of time you shave, unless you are a mutant lumberjack and grow hair at a fantastically fast rate, who cares how loud it is (not very compared to others), it if gets the job done...</li>
            <li> and i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Running my free hand firmly against the skin, just ahead of the shaver to stand the beard up, produces a shave that is as close as what you would get with a  disposable twin bladed razor.</li>
            <li> As far as performance, it is up to Braun standards.  </li>
            <li> Also, I would not waste money on the LCD display.</li>
            <li> Not only does this shaver give a close shave, the cleaning system works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it got through the Braun QA.      </li>
            <li> The shaver is not as loud as my Remington - I think the blades may move slower.    </li>
            <li> I am planning on buying at least one more in case something happens to the one I have and just in case they stop making them.  </li>
            <li> these two quite valid complaints, the pros far outweigh the cons for me.</li>
            <li> razor is loud, and by that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud when it&#x27;s self cleaning, it&#x27;s louder when it&#x27;s held up to your face.  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a magic electric razor that shaves as close as the blades, STOP, because they don&#x27;t exist, at least not yet.    </li>
            <li> I have always been a razor man, except for a short stint with a Phillips 3 blade rotary that I paid way too much for.  </li>
            <li> WOW - leme tell ya - after i decided to use it christmas day</li>
            <li> I started out with the old Remington XLR (the blocky one they made for years), then used a Remington triple foil for 8 years (model TR400).  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is sensitive, shaving with a blade causes a lot of irritation.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning unit is loud at times, but whatever it cleans the shaver.  </li>
            <li> You can plug the cord directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li> I had it 2 weeks when it began to buzz loudly.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying a second one for my vacation home, I like it that much.</li>
            <li> also appreciate that the razor can be plugged in and recharged directly</li>
            <li> Since it was under warrantee, I brought it to one of the Braun authorized repair shops in my area for repair instead of mailing it directly to Braun</li>
            <li> I got this unit from Amazon in early July.</li>
            <li> Shaving before showering completely works for me.  </li>
            <li> If you hae sensitive skin or know someone who does, this is the model for them.  </li>
            <li> His old one was well...old.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner is loud.  </li>
            <li> the cord can plug directly into the razor when on travel</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li> It is not too much, completely bearable.</li>
            <li> My old stand-by Norelco will make a return appearance this week.</li>
            <li> You can even connect the power directly to the shaver and use it.</li>
            <li> My 12 - 15 year old Braun needed to be replaced, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li> It also shaves a lot quicker than a razor, it only takes me 5 minutes to shave my whole face with this, whereas a razor would take me about 10.  </li>
            <li> Next, the cleaning cartridges cost about eight bucks a pop, and if the thought of paying this much for the self-cleaning luxury bugs you, you probably shouldn&#x27;t consider this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 8585 does NOT shave as close as my old Braun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 8585 for about 2 months now, so I think I&#x27;ve got the hang of it as far as Braun&#x27;s recommendations.</li>
            <li> Not offensive, but noticable and unexpected.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, he actually likes it.  </li>
            <li> Shavers almost all claim to be as close as a blade, but this one nearly delivers on that promise.  </li>
            <li> I was leary about electric razors since i have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It gives by far the closest shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m admittedly only one person, but as a user of a rotary razor, and a recent purchaser of this Braun, I thought my experience may be useful.</li>
            <li> If, like I do, you have thick or abundant hair and sensitive skin and need to shave daily</li>
            <li> After years of using a Norelco triple header, I thought of trying a Braun and found it to be difficult to achieve a good shave.</li>
            <li> be the first one to admit that every beard is different, but this whisker thing and the new foil shape is definitely overrated.</li>
            <li> The new foil system gives me a much closer shave, particularly in those tough spots on my neck and the cleaning system eliminates the need to brush out the whiskers and clean the cutterblock myself as I did before.  </li>
            <li> And, true to Braun&#x27;s claim, the sucker charges quickly and will last quite a while without a re-charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charging/Cleaning station is a bit large and the blue \\&quot;charged\\&quot; light is very bright in the dark and has an annoying flicker once fully charged.</li>
            <li> The Activator foil has some holes that are quite a bit larger, and some smaller than the Integral foil (I think that&#x27;s the one used on most other Brauns).</li>
            <li> a little noisy, so i clean in the morning...</li>
            <li> My first surprise was to find little metal and much plastic in the 8585 construction.</li>
            <li> I first bought this when i realized spending $20 a month an razor blades for my mach3 was a little bit too much.  </li>
            <li> However, there is no mess.  </li>
            <li> saw a couple deals come and go on the Braun 8585 at a \\&quot;hot deals\\&quot; site I frequent, and I finally  bit on the third one.  </li>
            <li> No mess at all.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning can get really loud (much louder than the shaving), but it&#x27;s a minor annoyance to me.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to be done with hot water, soap and shaving cream..and those painful late in the day shaves needed to clean up a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. &lt;</li>
            <li> The user does which means that I don&#x27;t have to clean the razor everyday.  </li>
            <li> It will shave you almost as close as a blade razor, without missing spots, and when done, it will clean itself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a less expensive ($50-range) Braun shaver for more than 15 years, &amp; I think that this model is infinitely better.</li>
            <li> However, it just doesn&#x27;t cut close enough for me, particularly on the throat area.  </li>
            <li> But after my first and second shave with it, the only word I can truly express is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think Braun is building the same high quality shavers of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> One big con is this high pitch noise the razor makes.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer pops up high enough so you can see what your trimming.    </li>
            <li> The cleaning fluid also leaves a slightly lubricating film on the shaver which helps it glide smoothly across the skin.    </li>
            <li> I wait a few seconds to make sure my face is dry after using a towel.</li>
            <li> I also wouldn&#x27;t try to use a different cleaning fluid as other said they did to avoid having to buy the replacement cartridges because it could easily damage this razor and the cleaning stand.</li>
            <li> Altogether a terrific upgrade on my old Braun, and in another universe compared to my (very) old Norelco.</li>
            <li> bought this Braun (last year&#x27;s model) after reading the positive reviews here, and later bought a rotary razor.  </li>
            <li> It has the usual drawback of an electric shaver - the shave just isn&#x27;t as close or smooth as a blade.  </li>
            <li> $165.00 + the cleaner cartridges is very expensive for a device that doesn&#x27;t provide an all-together great shave every time.</li>
            <li> No more burn and a smooth (against the grain) shave with no irritation whatsoever and no water.</li>
            <li> First, the shaver is way too wide.</li>
            <li> and they told me which service center to send it to and gave me the number so that I could call first.  </li>
            <li> and I still need to go back to my normal razor.  </li>
            <li> We just thought that was normal, but after he started using this shaver boy did he look different.  </li>
            <li> It is possible, though, to ignore the stand and use the razor just like you would use a normal model.  </li>
            <li> I am just today purchasing my first foil/blade refill and that is around $30, and I would guess I&#x27;ve spent about $25 on cleaning refills.</li>
            <li> for the cleaning stand, the pump suddenly wouldn&#x27;t pump the cleaning fluid into the unit with enough pressure to clean properly after just 6 months.</li>
            <li> , I expected a little more than I got.</li>
            <li> It started making funnier and funnier noises (different from the normal buzzing noise cycle it goes through) over the last few weeks and finally it just stuck in one particular noise for a long time (more than 20 minutes),</li>
            <li> The only down side I see is that you can&#x27;t rinse the 8585 with water to clean it like you can with the TriControl and Flex shavers.  </li>
            <li> Number one is that the trimmer, while aggresive and able to cut thick hair with ease, has trouble with smaller, fine errant hairs, especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> However, even for a longtime Braun fan such as myself I have been blown away by the quality of the new self-cleaning Activator 8585.  </li>
            <li> I went a while without an electric shaver and finally decided to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> This might be the best of the few electric shavers that I tried, but still disappointing.</li>
            <li> I will send in my razor and go back to a blade until I receive my repaired setup; hopefully it will be back in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I still use this is that I shave frequently enough that busting out shaving cream is too much of a mess/</li>
            <li> The foil and blade are supposed to be replaced at least every 18 months (more frequently, if necessary).</li>
            <li> You have to shave against the grain, and it helps if you pull your skin tight with your free hand, and try and move it and your face so that the surface of the skin your shaving is flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a step down from my old shaver at a higher price and with the added monthly cost of the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> Second, it&#x27;s LOUD!   </li>
            <li> I know Braun makes more expensive units, but I&#x27;m not sure how they could be any better than this one.</li>
            <li> No other shaver has done that.</li>
            <li> but I did have a major problem with the cleaning stand that required a warantee repair/replacement of the cleaning stand just 6 months after my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from an old hand-me-down Remington to an under-powered little Braun, to an unsuccessful stint with a triple-head that was supposed to dispense soothing goo, to a fantastic Remington Microscreen whose life was cut short by the rigors of life in the desert (California, Kuwait and Iraq), to its similar but not-as-good Remington</li>
            <li> My facial hair growth is pretty sparse (mixed Nordic and English blood)</li>
            <li> If you read the above overview written by Amazon, you will see that cleaning less frequently doesn&#x27;t necessarily help you save cleaning fluid, as more intensive cleaning cycles are just repetitions of the lesser cycles.</li>
            <li> The shaver comes with a plastic case for storage and a small brush to clean.</li>
            <li> I am not a rich man, but the Braun 8585 is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> There are still a few spots that don&#x27;t get cut very close (particularly below/under the jaw)</li>
            <li> the cleaning cycle is a little loud for the first few minutes because the shaver turns itself on in the fluid to clean it out.</li>
            <li> It has a light touch, even if you push it hard into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few rough patches are a fine tradeoff as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and it&#x27;s nothing you can see.    </li>
            <li> Using my old Panasonic, it may take several round to clean such thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messier and a little more hassle, but cuts way down on cartridge use.  </li>
            <li> Generally it takes some effort and time to get a truly even looking cut.  </li>
            <li> My neck is prone to irritation and nicks, and my stubble is thick, so this has been a huge improvement across the board.  </li>
            <li> Maybe there are foil shavers out there that are equal to rotary shavers, but this one turned me off completely to foil shavers.    </li>
            <li> Granted, no electrical shaver will ever shave as close as a blade, but the difference is barely noticeable (with THIS shaver).</li>
            <li> You probably have to seal the fluid catridge (worrying about leakage), and the whole station is big enough to take some luggage space.</li>
            <li> My second surprise was the modest power of the 8585 compared with the Eltron 770.</li>
            <li> This may be a non issue for some as they have kicked off the cleaning process too early too often and now find themselves shaving in the same place</li>
            <li> The next natural step was to try the foil shavers.  </li>
            <li> The first cleaning cartridge lasted over 5 months, using it every 2 to 3 days on average.  </li>
            <li> My old Remington Microscreen would routinely cause razor burn on my upper lip, neck, and chin, even when I used a shaving powder.  </li>
            <li> Still using this razor nearly a year later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only found 2 CVS&#x27;s near me that sell the cleaning refills, but</li>
            <li> but now I have a barely used shaver in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It still takes me about the same time to shave with this as compared to my old razor.</li>
            <li> Second, the cleaning base is more compact, easier to operate, and (apparently) more efficient in its use of cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> We have far more unpleasurable waste that we deal with everyday.  </li>
            <li> by using the base unit which holds the razor, the razor is always at peak battery potential which means you get the best power possible out of the razor &lt;br /</li>
            <li> I got a Norelco a few months back, and this was a welcome change for me as shaving got quicker and less messy, but for some reason, my face never got used to it.  </li>
            <li> If I get a new razor at any point in the next 1-3 years, it will definitely be the Pulsonic or another Braun razor that builds upon the strengths of this model.</li>
            <li> Have always had trouble getting a really clean shave with electric razors - especially the neck - especially if I skip shaving for a day or two (which I sometimes do on weekends).  </li>
            <li> If you are lazy and do not care if you have a super close shave</li>
            <li> Make no mistake about it, a blade razor will ALWAYS shave closer than any electric razor, for the simple reason that the blade(s) can get right on your skin to cut the hair, while electric razor&#x27;s blades are always hidden and can never cut as close.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra little bit of work to get everything off the neck.</li>
            <li> I attribute that to me making sure I&#x27;m picking up all the &#x27;loose ends&#x27; that my previous razers always left behind and taking the time to make the shave as smooth as possible.</li>
            <li> the razor and stand is a faint, very high pitched sound that they make when plugged in.  </li>
            <li> Sales Rank on this product is very high, and with good reason.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun several months ago and last weekend I packed my old Remington 3 head and went hunting.</li>
            <li> If you have a more round neck area with less angles you probably not have the same problem.</li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised that it was able to cut my difficult neck whiskers,</li>
            <li> I accepted the fact that my facial hair was either just not thick enough or grew to flat to my face for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I prefer German or Japanese products due to their consistent quality and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Meaning a little discomfort at first.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it everyday, have had electric shavers in the past, most notably the Remington, but never experienced a shaver with the power or ability to cut as close as this one.</li>
            <li> I realize that the blue led&#x27;s are new and high tech seeming, but seriously ... when the razor is in the cleaner / charger unit it also functions as a nightlight... a nightlight that bathes half the room in erie blue light. &lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m quite satisfied overall (especially since these spots were tough with the Mach3).</li>
            <li> The Braun 8585 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving System is flat and about the size of the old two-head shavers (you never see those sold anymore, only 3-head ones).  </li>
            <li> If you are not careful enough, you may end up losing it somewhere.</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t go nearly that long.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty heavy beard</li>
            <li> I suppose it is worth the few extra bucks each month to purchase the replacement cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> The first time I shaved, I thought that I&#x27;d wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> I complained, they sent me a new one which is also very loud -- too loud for me!</li>
            <li> Combined with the side-to-side vibration that really does cut down on razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard that grows very quickly</li>
            <li> As a test, I used my very old Norelco rotary on half my face and it blew away the Braun in direct comparison.  </li>
            <li> first time I used it, the skin on my neck got a little irritated and red, but nothing unbearable.  </li>
            <li> But the 8585 can give you a decent shave in a couple of minutes while the other shavers take what seems like forever.      </li>
            <li> bought this razor based on the high acclaim that other users have given it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another random note: if you absolutely cannot live without an LCD display on your razor, for about thirty dollars, Braun will sell you the 8685, which I presume is exactly the same razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sell mine for for half that used if anyone wants it...</li>
            <li> To add to this perfection scenario it is not made in China or any Asian sweet shop, but in Germany, or at least mine was.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard, so I was looking for something that would be preferable to the pain and mess of a wet shave, but be as close and effective.  </li>
            <li> And the shaver is very powerful so don&#x27;t worry if you have long and hard hair.</li>
            <li> Last year&#x27;s model of this Braun, a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors.</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard, so I clean it every other day.  </li>
            <li> recently ordered a new set of foils &amp; blades, (after about 19-20 months) and while the shave is obviously not nearly as close as it was the day I got it, the shave with dull blades/foils is still better than what I was getting with my past razors.  </li>
            <li> similarly, the cleaning system keeps the razor free of beard stubble which means there is no/little if any beard stubble that falls into the sink that I have to clean up, and the cutting edge remains as sharp as possible &lt;br /</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very noisy (scares the cat every time I use it) and buying the additional cleaning cartridges and head is a little pricy but not unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> So the bottom line is that it&#x27;s a little smoother and much quicker than the lower line Brauns, (although I have not tried the Syncro System).  </li>
            <li> have a tough beard, but I also don&#x27;t mind spending the extra time with the Braun to get my face smooth.  </li>
            <li> If you only use that feature once a week you can maintain high performance with much less cost.</li>
            <li> A high quality shaver is not only about shaving quality, lots of other minor details count.</li>
            <li> He gets a super-close shave in half the time and the *huge* bonus, no more ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Though I like the ergonomics and shave of the 8585, I will probably not buy any more Braun products due to the poor attention Braun gives to the buyer after the sale.</li>
            <li> I am still a Braun man at heart, but their new models are a step down in my book.</li>
            <li> long hair (sideburn trimmer) is likely the most useless feature of this razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my beard is any thicker than normal, but some of the hairs can curl under a little especially on my neck.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like my first foil shaver (a Remington) because the foil design made it hard to get all the hairs shaved, especially if I went for a couple days without shaving.  </li>
            <li> Due to my skin type, I was only able to shave every other day in order to avoid serious skin irritation.</li>
            <li> there are facial oils too, and I have to think that the fluid itself would get funky if you went too long without replacing it.  </li>
            <li> The first few times that I used it, I felt the shave was not very close.</li>
            <li> So I can live with Braun, I&#x27;ll simply take a little longer to shave.</li>
            <li> The Braun customer service rep. went back and fourth calling the repair shop a few times until the Braun Customer Service Representative finally decided to order another cleaning stand for me and mail it directly to me which they said would take another 7 to 10 business days and not to bother calling the authorized repair shop anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a less imposing stand with a smaller foodprint and more subtle lights, but hey, it works!  </li>
            <li> It takes a few days for your face to get used to any new shaver, and this was no different.</li>
            <li> And as far as closeness goes, the Braun TriControl can actually give me a slightly closer shave</li>
            <li> No more taking apart cutters and using little brushes to clean away the hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in 40 years I have submitted  a written complaint about a product which I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is saving me much time.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is waiting so long to by one.</li>
            <li> of the reviews here have covered the features of the razor, so I thought I&#x27;d give a few tips for &#x27;first time&#x27; electric razor owners like myself as well as a few general comments on the Braun 8585: &lt;br</li>
            <li> Though this shaver does not shave quite as close as my Remington foil shaver (which just died after barely a year), it however does shave with absolutely no razor burn or cuts.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Braun for short whiskers and a Norelco for long whiskers that grew when I did not shave every day.</li>
            <li> Now a days we get flooded with made in china junk that just doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> aspects such as looks and build quality are a consideration but for me they fall a distant second to issues such as the shaving quality.  </li>
            <li> I gradually got irritated by the Norelco but was somewhat reluctant to go back to blades full time as I had gotten too lazy to use them everyday.      </li>
            <li> I will start with all the good aspects of this shaver, then the reasons why I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought it for $129 new so this $699 price tag seems a little steep.  </li>
            <li> The razor might look good, or have too big a base for cleaning, or clean itself but when I&#x27;m at work, I will remember the razor on how poorly it shaved my neck.  </li>
            <li> No more messy fuzz to clean up</li>
            <li> When you first open up the package you can tell you are working with a company that takes it&#x27;s product seriously.</li>
            <li> It is relative hard to take the whole package with you during travel.</li>
            <li> The other two shavers I tried during my recent search failed in so many ways by comparison.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a major issue, but electric shaving is never without its quirks.</li>
            <li> The battery is very long lasting</li>
            <li> my only complaint which can&#x27;t really be helped is that in a month</li>
            <li> Not only can I now shave dry</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re left with a fully clean electric to use for your next shave with the faint scent of lemony gin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was true for me, so don&#x27;t be shocked if you are irrated during the first week.  </li>
            <li> Let alone roughly $60 you need to spend on cleaning fluid, what if Braun stops producing the fluid?</li>
            <li> I always use the back of my hand to feel my chin after shaving and check how close the shave was, and this was almost as good as my Mach-3 blades and in about half the time, with no messy shaving creams and annoying cuts and burns.  </li>
            <li> It is not very loud.  </li>
            <li> However recently blades have been hard on my face as I&#x27;ve gotten older.</li>
            <li> The advertised pull and cut action with the Norelco is a buch of baloney, as I could feel the little stubs on my face no matter how long I shave.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not sure how the system determines how hard to work at cleaning, but it thinks for a bit, and then picks either low (eco) medium (normal) or high (intensive).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am cursed with a perpetual 5 o&#x27;clock shadow so even though my face is smooth to the touch</li>
            <li> only negative would be that the cleaning cycle is a bit loud, but after only 3 days im already used to it.   </li>
            <li> has never really been a big deal.  </li>
            <li> I thought \\&quot;Hey, computer technology has come a long way in 8 years,</li>
            <li> is so buzzy that it&#x27;s tiring to hold for a long time.  </li>
            <li> can now use one shaver to cut long whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Then it begins to stumble over each additional hair, and after two weeks of non-cleaning, it almost can&#x27;t handle it.   </li>
            <li> but they take a long time</li>
            <li> I can still feel a bit of minor stubble there that I couldn&#x27;t feel with the Remington.  </li>
            <li> suppose I wouldn&#x27;t have any credibility here if I didn&#x27;t have a couple minor negatives to report.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun tells you directly that it takes a few weeks for your beard to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; to the razor.</li>
            <li> the Remington is way too loud, it&#x27;s rather heavy, and its pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut well.</li>
            <li> I shaved with blades for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> During cleaning, the fluid is pumped up to the shave head for cleaning, and them runs back down into the container.  </li>
            <li> It just exploded after 2 minutes charging and left a big black mark on the outlet.</li>
            <li> If you gently drop the micro screen an inch or two onto a hard surface like the sink it will jar loose any hairs stuck therein.</li>
            <li> I mean if you spend the time and use it properly it really works well.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my advice: If you&#x27;ve had good luck with other electric razors and can afford the price tag, go ahead and buy it, you probably won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I can use other foil shavers such as remington</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just missed too many little hairs.  </li>
            <li> They share the same micro screen, cutter, and other features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shaver is such an improvement over every other Braun shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I am still on my original tub of cleaning solution, and I am just shy of a month of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My husband has very thick facial hair that likes to grow at unusual angles and up to three (3) hairs per pore.  </li>
            <li> Yes it did give me a very close shave with less strokes and less irritation then other electric shavers I had</li>
            <li> These a very minor complaints.</li>
            <li> Because this is a dry shaver, it takes a bit longer for me to get a close shave</li>
            <li> Its expensive and you have to account for an additional $60 per year in cleaning solution if you clean it as recommended.</li>
            <li> unfortunate thing is that now the cleaning unit has now ceased to clean, although it still charges the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I grow a very thick beard, and this is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve had that I don&#x27;t have to shave twice a day with.  </li>
            <li> I dare you to find a single whisker inside of it.  </li>
            <li> The way the head pivots gets all of the hair usually on the first pass, hard to reach spots on the second.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my old Norelco shaver for the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> It also shaves a lot quicker than his old Braun 5000 series shaver, so he shaves almost everyday now!  </li>
            <li> It does take approximately 1 month of use to achieve the consistent, close shave results.</li>
            <li> A long time electric razor user warned me to be careful with these ultra-thin foil razors.  </li>
            <li> Previously I went through more expensive razors in less than a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with cheaper Braun electric models for years, and when my previous one died, I decided to shell out the extra money to try their nicer model.  </li>
            <li> In the descriptions of other reviews it was never really clear how it could work.</li>
            <li> To save cleaning fluid, always remove the cleaning cartridge from the unit and recap it tightly.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, a couple weeks&#x27; use of the 8585 razor has convinced me that the extra cost over less expensive Braun electric shavers is worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> The charging/cleaning stand removes the effort from those two little tasks, at the cost of needing cleaning fluid refills every so often.  </li>
            <li> I found that by merely turning the shaver to angle it, I was able to shave the base of the neck area just fine.  </li>
            <li> Cutting head tilts to fit your face.</li>
            <li> My last saver the Panasonic ES8152NC met with my plaster wall in a fit of anger.</li>
            <li> At this price, however, you may want to consider purchasing a less expensive model and clean the shaver yourself.  </li>
            <li> second complaint is that to get thorough shave on the neck, it will take several passes.</li>
            <li> The process, as far as I can tell, is it soaks the razor head in the solution, the shaving scum is washed away, and the alcohol evaporates.</li>
            <li> Well...weeks became months with no word from Braun or the service center.  </li>
            <li> and they told me to contact the service center.</li>
            <li> I have been a lifelong blade shaver-</li>
            <li> wife managed to get it to hold still for a cleaning cycle with the careful use of a Q-tip to jam the razor against the wall of the case.  </li>
            <li> I initially used the \\&quot;self-cleaning\\&quot; method but after awhile it seemed like a waste</li>
            <li> It also causes absolutely no rash on my neck.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive but well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> There are enough lights to communicate with you on this model, so don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re missing anything by choosing the 8585.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent.  </li>
            <li> few years back I tried a screen shaver (don&#x27;t remember the brand), and found that it missed a bunch of hairs, so I stuck with a rotary.</li>
            <li> but I always had to work harder with that area with any shaver I used.</li>
            <li> That means I will only need six cleaning cartridges per year, not 12 if you cleaned everyday.  </li>
            <li> The Braun 8585, after extensive shaver research, was one of the few items I listed on my Christmas wish list.  </li>
            <li> Repair person said this might have something to do with the wet cleaning used for this shaver....</li>
            <li> So, in a year, I&#x27;ve spent about $55 on maintenance of the thing.</li>
            <li> In fact, there is really no comparison between the 5000 series and the 8000 series.</li>
            <li> I had before, the whiskers are harder to find.</li>
            <li> If they were to stand behind their products, I would be fine with this failure, but, as it stands, I regret buying this shaver</li>
            <li> As my facial hair became whiter and whiter, I did a little research on electric razors and decided to try the Braun 8585 because of its features and feedback from other users.</li>
            <li> I mean LOUD.  </li>
            <li> other than that absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> but my experience is not a positive one.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of paying the high price for Mach 3 blades</li>
            <li> I still have a few left hairs and slight roughness on my neck but for my beard</li>
            <li> While shaving, use your other hand to &#x27;stretch&#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps the ultimate compliment for this product came this past weekend on a trip with my dad.  </li>
            <li> If you are prone to those, I would go with other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words, it is reused, and the shaved beard hairs settle to the bottom of the container and are disposed of when you replace it.  </li>
            <li> the other Mach 3&#x27;s will do but</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ve ever gotten from any other electric razer (and I&#x27;ve tried cheaper Brauns, Norelco&#x27;s, Panasonic, etc).  </li>
            <li> Looking back, I&#x27;m not sure which to pick.  </li>
            <li> He thinks this was money well spent!</li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;ve had it about 3 years now (1 foil/cutter change and another change due).</li>
            <li> With my infrequent shaving, the carts last me well past the 60 days suggested in the instruction manual.</li>
            <li> It catches hairs other electrics miss.  </li>
            <li> , there are other electric shavers that are cheaper but</li>
            <li> I have had a number of different shavers over the past 25 years.  </li>
            <li> though its not exactly as close as you can get with a blade.</li>
            <li> and they told me the replacement cleaning stand is now on BACKORDER with no estimated time of delivery and nothing could be done to expedite it and they could not offer me any other assistance.  </li>
            <li> The other aspect of this product that sends it soaring is the the self-cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> My spouse has had a braun in the past and had looked for a replacement when his finally didn&#x27;t  work anymore.  </li>
            <li> But, for me, it&#x27;s pretty useless and</li>
            <li> I think because it has a big flat retangular head, it does poorly on neck area because the entire head can&#x27;t be firmly placed again your skin.  </li>
            <li> The shave is just as close as a razor, none of that shaving twice a day like other cheaper electrics.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m very careful, and pass over each spot a dozen times, I can get a shave that comes close to my blade.  </li>
            <li> No  longer does it take numerous strokes to shave, this shaves so close and with very few strokes.  </li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;ve had trouble with other electrics missing individual hairs, then you may want to stick with a blade.</li>
            <li> However, i expected it to be quicker/easier with less irritation.</li>
            <li> : The clean and charge refills are very expensive.</li>
            <li> The process took over 30 minutes in the shower (wasted water) and left his neck looking raw every time.  </li>
            <li> In other words there should be no strain on the shaver and the area that I shave is probably 1/5 of a typically shave.</li>
            <li> I typically run the cleaning step every other day, shaking out the shavings on the off days.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The cartridges and replacement blades/screens are still expensive, but the Activator gives me a much closer shave than my Norelco, and it no longer irritates my face like the Syncro did.</li>
            <li> I pay, on average, 40c or so for a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> Listen to the warnings other people give on the other razors or you will waste money like I did.  </li>
            <li> Took it to a recommended Braun repair person and he said the motor was burned out and not worth repairing.</li>
            <li> This shaver was a gift for my husband who is very picky and therefore rather difficult to shop for.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i really do like this shaver.</li>
            <li> I always do this and the cleaning cycle is always on the eco setting (the setting that uses the least amount of fluid).</li>
            <li> I initially tried to use it to cut the thick hairs on my neck that the razor didn&#x27;t catch, but it couldn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the 8585 comes with the razor, base, charger, one cartridge of cleaning solution, a sweet hard-shell case for travel, a screen guard and a brush for taking care of external stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I feel the grip is not very secure.</li>
            <li> It does occasionally miss a hair on my neck, but it&#x27;s much less common an occurance than what I went through with the Remington.   </li>
            <li> Way down.</li>
            <li> The 8585 slows down when it contacts whiskers, something that never happens using the corded Eltron 770.</li>
            <li> You manually have to press the button down to get it to start cleaning itself.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint i have - is that its a little hard to find replacement clean&amp;charge cartridges locally -</li>
            <li> I did as instructed and they told me that the base was fine and that maybe there was a problem with the razor or the charging adaptor and that I would have to send them in at my expense even though I was originally asked to send in only the base.  </li>
            <li> was a little skeptical on the whole cleaning/charging station.  </li>
            <li> First, the cleaning/charging base is a bit larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> He uses much less water, and we don&#x27;t need to replace his blades once a week.  </li>
            <li> less close shaves towards the end of the week.</li>
            <li> my previous Braun Integral.</li>
            <li> It also makes the bathroom smell slightly of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have a slender face and average to heavy beard growth and for me the shaver did an average job.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning unit takes up a lot of space on the counter and the plug for the unit is oddly shaped and sticks out about 6 inches for the wall.  </li>
            <li> , I hate to shave more than a few times a week</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I opted to pass on the LCD display screen of 8595 and went for the cheaper but otherwise identical 8585 model instead.  </li>
            <li> The foil is incredibly slick and glides across your face like Teflon and it usually takes me about 3 to 4 passes on the same area to get a satisfactory shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver shaves closer than the Norelco I had previously, but there is still room for improvement.  </li>
            <li> At this point it&#x27;s like I have been using a premium blade but get a closer shave with less</li>
            <li> My guess is Braun assumes 4-5 minutes per shave; I typically take 7-8 minutes to get the closeness I want.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if I did it would help get a closer shave in less time.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a rotary electric shaver since I started shaving half a life-time ago.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it gives a closer shave than the rotary, and in half the time, and it misses no hairs.</li>
            <li> less irritation...</li>
            <li> The foil irritates my skin less than my previous razors did.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I still have to pick the whiskers away, albeit it less often.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll spend less on this unit and any replacement cleaners than I would replacement blades in a year.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used electric shavers as long as I have you know that after about a year the battery wears down, there are parts of the shaver that you can&#x27;t get clean, and the cutting power is decreased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps the blades sharp, the screen unclogged, and just plain</li>
            <li> I get a shave almost as close as my Mach 3 with no cuts or nicks and none of the mess, and my skin never feels irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must have been pressing harder then usual as I would never get 18 months of screen use...more like a year.      </li>
            <li> This is totally not true whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Then turn the shaver on for a few seconds upside down to get rid of some ofthe hairs.</li>
            <li> the system is not sealed tightly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been difficult to shave every day because of my beard being pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> but it is less messy</li>
            <li> No to mention how it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close, I was getting worse razor burns from the Norelco than my usual blades.   </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first by all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> i do not clean every time i use it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for little over a month.    </li>
            <li> But maybe all electric shavers are a little noisy.</li>
            <li> both leave a little hair on the neck</li>
            <li> It leaves little hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver less then 3 years ago and it just plain quit on me.</li>
            <li> but I got tired of the hassle of shaving with it every morning (especially the shaving cream mess).</li>
            <li> with the Braun he still takes 30 minutes to shave, but only  about 10 minutes in the shower for the really tough spots and the areas close to his gotee.  </li>
            <li> I think that unless you have a very thick, fast-growing beard, you can get by just cleaning weekly, and removing and recapping the cleaning fluid container between cleanings.  </li>
            <li> It handles awkward neck hairs very well.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a heavy plastic that will be around for millenia, and are not recyclable.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not nearly as comfortable.         </li>
            <li> After a few months with it I have come to like it.  </li>
            <li> I have knocked it out a few times.  </li>
            <li> do, however, have a few issues with the Braun.</li>
            <li> So I can shave everyday without discomfort.</li>
            <li> I bought this 8585 for my husband one month ago and he uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It whirs and buzzes a few times then dries itself.  </li>
            <li> two weeks and have shaved almost everyday with it, no pain or blood.</li>
            <li> He hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn.</li>
            <li> not because they were broken or anything) and still use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and have owned Braun&#x27;s 4000 and 7000 series shavers.  </li>
            <li> Though this razor performs admirably on the face (I wear a goatee, so I can&#x27;t comment on upper lip and chin performance), it does quite poorly on my neck.</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs on my neck are either too thick to pass through the foil, or grows at any angle that the \\&quot;smart\\&quot; foil doesn&#x27;t catch, and I have to make several (several!) passes to get a mediocre shave on my neck.</li>
            <li> This shaver is bulky and does not fit well on my sink counter</li>
            <li> (I have a double sink counter) and I especially have to manipulate the base unit and power cord constantly.  </li>
            <li> and I do not have a heavy beard).  </li>
            <li> I now shave everyday, weekends included.  </li>
            <li> The included electric cord does not stretch much (maybe 4&#x27;) and has to be plugged in to the back of the base stand.  </li>
            <li> At first it may seem impossible, but once you get used to the shaver both growth and usage, it&#x27;ll get easier.</li>
            <li> This has been hard for me in the past because I have thick facial hair and electric shavers tend to have a problem with that.</li>
            <li> So, depending on your bathroom electrical outlet arrangement, you may need to get a short extension cord so that the big, ugly black cord of the razor isn&#x27;t stretching all over the place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I can still charge the razor using the electrical cable, the major feature, the self cleaning functionality, is completely useless.</li>
            <li> I tried one of the less expensive models and it only worked well on portions of his face.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco wasn&#x27;t capable of cutting a few days growth without pulling hard.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Mach 3 razor for the past few years</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little skeptical that the cleaning system is necessary,</li>
            <li> It is much better than the 5614 for getting tough areas along the sides of the neck and base of the jaw.</li>
            <li> You need to keep the skin very tight to get a close shave and do it every day.  </li>
            <li> If I use the straight to socket method (rather than charging in the base unit), I get perhaps one or two days longer out of it, but never more than nine days and certainly not \\&quot;up to 14\\&quot; as the manual indicates.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco and Remington shavers in the past as well as the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo.  </li>
            <li> Run your hand over your face and you can usually tell if you&#x27;ve missed anything.</li>
            <li> ; no more gunk in the sink.</li>
            <li> A small price for convenience.  </li>
            <li> with all the electric shavers I have used in the past, this one struggles with neck hair.</li>
            <li> No more hassling with brushes and periodic cleaning.  </li>
            <li> He usually got a lot of irritation with the rotary, but not with this one.  </li>
            <li> Over the past 15-20 years I&#x27;ve had three Braun razors.</li>
            <li> You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it</li>
            <li> but I am not sure that is within warrantee, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college kid - i usually like to have the nicer stuff</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> The 8585 has a number of small improvements that make it even better--thing like a hardsided travel case, easier to read pedestal stand, etc.</li>
            <li> No more shaving cream</li>
            <li> The cleaning system was not able to do a thorough job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it provides a closer shave than the Remingtons I have owned in the past (not as close as you would get with a blade, however).      </li>
            <li> After a few days he was hooked!  </li>
            <li> I find that I spend another five minutes shaving in the morning by using this razor than I did with a wet shave to get a worse result.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why it works for some people and not others</li>
            <li> He was not pleased with the shave the product gave.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to understand the logic behind the cleaning system (other than having to pay a monthly maintenance fee).</li>
            <li> in regard to some of the negatives I&#x27;ve read in the other reviews, I have not experienced any of those problems.  </li>
            <li> The second reason, and this might just be me being picky, is the blue led at the base of the razor.  </li>
            <li> Cleans and recharges at the same time, in the same base.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending this much for a shaver, but I have been sufficiently unhappy with previous cheaper shavers that I took the plunge.</li>
            <li> Plus, and I am surprised that this isn&#x27;t mentioned in the other reviews that I read before getting the razor, the cleaning solution (which is an expensive, printer-ink type of gimmick) stinks like metal solvent.  </li>
            <li> maybe the cutters are dull or something</li>
            <li> When he shaves he looks like he is shaving off skin because he has to press so hard.  </li>
            <li> I have to use the razor blade to get the hard spots.</li>
            <li> I have a slim/thin neck area with a lot of steep angles that&#x27;s hard to shave.</li>
            <li> No more disgusting stubble clean ups.</li>
            <li> Reviewers have complained about the price of the cleaning solution</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to have to go out in public afraid to have a gnat land on my skin.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s inconceivable with a blade, at least with my skin.    </li>
            <li> I have used various electric shavers from Panasonic, Norelco, and Remington with mostly disappointing results.</li>
            <li> So, a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The foil head can crack sooner than you&#x27;d expect and you end up cutting your face, so inspect your foil head regularly.</li>
            <li> (...on any Braun purchase of at least $129, I believe...)   </li>
            <li> Even when my skin is inflamed for another reason (sunburn, winter dryness), shaving with the Braun is nowhere near as painful as it was with the Remington.      </li>
            <li> The area in the hollow of my neck that I could never shave with the cheaper Braun electrics still can&#x27;t be shaved with the expensive Braun electric; I still need to break out a blade to finish up.  </li>
            <li> common issue dogged these razors - wear and tear.</li>
            <li> -- Remington has much larger cutting blades</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the dismal job it does under your jaws and on the neck.  </li>
            <li> I always had to go at least 3-4 days in between shaving if I could to avoid getting torn to shreds on my neck.</li>
            <li> On my thick one day beard the 8585 is substantialy quicker and smoother than the others.  </li>
            <li> When I put the razor in the base, I have to jiggle it for several minutes to get the \\&quot;Charge\\&quot; light to come on or to get the base to determine a cleaning cycle to use.</li>
            <li> and my hair grows thick.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my thick hair, but even after a thorough shave I still have a bit of a shadow on the face.</li>
            <li> So I was forced to go with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Afta pre-shave to help with my thick beard.</li>
            <li> VERY LITTLE RAZOR BURN!  </li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers claimed that this shaver automatically begins the cleaning process when you put the shaver back on the base.</li>
            <li> I mean if you have to take the cleaning stuff.</li>
            <li> I mean)</li>
            <li> (and I mean no) irritation.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like every other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried, this is not it.  </li>
            <li> main problem I have is with the cleaning / charging base.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system emits only a very faint (i.e., you have to literally put your nose to the system in order to detect a smell) odor of alcohol when the shaver is being cleaned.  </li>
            <li> something that all my previous electrics failed to do.    </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t returned this yet, but I&#x27;m seriously considering it.  </li>
            <li> With my Norelco, if I shaved daily it left horrible razor burn.</li>
            <li> The shape of the head also allows me to shave under my chin, which was next to impossible with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> am wondering whether the liquid cleaning \\&quot;device\\&quot; of the Braun is not just a gimmick--- messy, cumbersome and quite expensive to use.  </li>
            <li> Sent the entirely wrong product, could not send correct product so now I have wasted over two weeks for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is no good at all</li>
            <li> But with a day or two of extra growth, it was always painful to shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is extremely heavy - it is difficult to manipulate and use during shaving.  </li>
            <li> I would hate to go back to cleaning as usual.</li>
            <li> The foils became difficult to find and the razor&#x27;s battery was going bad, so I figured it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> Its quite awkward to remove from its base if you are right handed.</li>
            <li> the end, I&#x27;m disappointed in the razor, and have no intention of purchasing a Braun razor in the future.</li>
            <li> It was pointless and too expensive to buy refills.</li>
            <li> No more cuts, no more expensive blades!</li>
            <li> The charger/cleaner base is half the size of the previous &lt;br</li>
            <li> Whatever information is on the LCD is unnecessary -- save yourself $30 and get the 8585. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> My hair is blond and thin.</li>
            <li> I bought a Braun Activator shaver because I was tired of nicks, cuts, and irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> , the Norelco was especially slow and harsh.</li>
            <li> I do get the base to start cleaning the razor, the razor always shakes lose during the same stage of the cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The Norelcos constantly gave me &#x27;shaver burns&#x27; at the base of my neck and the Remington was never &#x27;as close as a blade&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It rests in its cleaning base pointing to the left and away from the user.  </li>
            <li> no, great electric shaver like this one.</li>
            <li> Well I remembered the discomfort of my Norelco and thought what could be worse than that.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is a little noisy, but in no way irritating (step out of the bathroom and close the door!!).  </li>
            <li> I am even disappointed with Costco for carrying this product in their limited selection.</li>
            <li> A minor annoying detail:</li>
            <li> I called the service center, described the symptoms and was instructed to send in the base at my expense.  </li>
            <li> It also turns on and off randomly, so it is a bit irritating.  </li>
            <li> I read of some reviewers complaint of not able to get a close shave around the base of the neck area.  </li>
            <li> I hated the product and amazon doesn&#x27;t take it back as they say it contains alcohol</li>
            <li> So, I was thoroughly expecting him to say he hated the shaver and to send it back.  </li>
            <li> I activiate the cleaning cycle via the push button on the base once every other day.  </li>
            <li> When this button is pressed down, the base detects the cleaning cycle and then executes it.</li>
            <li> However, when this button isn&#x27;t pressed down, the base determines the cleaing cycle but does not beging the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> razor might be faster and would definitely be less annoying.</li>
            <li> This is careless design.</li>
            <li> cleaner I think is fairly useless.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness you can use the razor without this silly cleaning</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Dad who is unable to shave himself.  </li>
            <li> Even using expensive products (the Art of Shaving, Aramis Lab Series and Anthony Sport), I have problems with my skin when using a blade.  </li>
            <li> This is an art I&#x27;ve been unable to master.</li>
            <li> you are looking for an electric, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> But I found the shaver itself rather mediocre.</li>
            <li> needless to say</li>
            <li> The shaver is expensive but the system does work.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive.</li>
            <li> He swore nothing would compare to his infamous Schick Quattro Disposable Razor.</li>
            <li> So if you want to scare someone silly don&#x27;t tell them about it and watch them jump out of their skin.</li>
            <li> In addition, to get even a mediocre shave with this razor, I have to pull and stretch skin on my face throughout the shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather messy pouring the bottle of alcohol into an opening in the Remington base, plus replacing a separate filter element.</li>
            <li> After approximately six months, the lights on the charging/cleaning base would not come on and the base would not clean the razor.  </li>
            <li> Still cutting as close as it did a year ago.</li>
            <li> battery performance is also disappointing.</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the self-cleaning aspect and, in fact, it is the reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5.  </li>
            <li> This results in a lot of &#x27;scragglers&#x27; that were almost impossible to get with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I had NEVER had razor burn that bad before.  </li>
            <li> The bad:  </li>
            <li> Since my beard is really bad</li>
            <li> But I have gone a couple of days and my beard still doesn&#x27;t look to bad.</li>
            <li> The razor isn&#x27;t bad, but the cleaning system is a joke.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad</li>
            <li> must say , however, that I am keenly disappointed with my Braun 8585.  </li>
            <li> I am frustrated that they have had my base for months and have not contacted me to tell me their conclusion.  </li>
            <li> Well, given the price I paid (compared to $20 I paid for the panasonic model), I am a bit disappointed by Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun razors for 15 years now and have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> lotion/solution, you wont be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You are out of option and may have to rely on stupid manual cleaning.</li>
            <li> When I hurried a blade shave, I would end up with a bloody face.  </li>
            <li> I HATE that.</li>
            <li> the use of the included cleaning / charging base, two screws under the foil screen are rusting.  </li>
            <li> The end result is a razor that refuses to charge in the base and isn&#x27;t being cleaned.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;every 8 minute\\&quot; beep, which is probably doing a battery check, is quite annoying.</li>
            <li> Just pop it in to the base, press one button and all the cleaning is done for you.  </li>
            <li> so if I take a trip, I don&#x27;t have to take the base and cleaning stuff with me, just the razor and the cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the razor can be charged without the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> I hate to shave.  </li>
            <li> Its self-cleaning base isn&#x27;t as well designed as Braun&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> They complain this annoying because sometimes they would like to avoid the self-clean function.</li>
            <li> The shaver base does not automatically begin the cycle.</li>
            <li> The cleaner base still works, the shaver still works and holds a charge (though I just leave it on the base) and the beard trimmer works.  </li>
            <li> I tried an electric shaver once and hated the results, so I stuck with blades despite their rising costs.</li>
            <li> I always hated shaving, which I why I sometimes skip a day or two.  </li>
            <li> was very disappointed with the results or lack there of.</li>
            <li> And razors would bring rise to rather nasty skin problems even with using aftershave and sterilizing the blades.  </li>
            <li> I have tried not washing with soap and hand towel and my shave was awful.  </li>
            <li> The downside, terrible in-grown hairs every week, ugh and 15 minutes to shave.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Easy on the face and easy to maintain. Self cleaning system is a dream come true. No more taking apart cutters and using little brushes to clean away the hair. Gives a nice close shave .Very satisfied with this purchase. A loyal Norelco user now using Braun. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. It gives a great close shave. It&#x27;s the tool to use if your like me and suffer from razor bumps. I used to use a mach 3 turbo which gave me a pretty close shave and the bumps to match. They were completely gone after about 2 weeks of using the braun 8585. My only regret is waiting so long to by one.</li>
            <li> The razor is OK. It is not close to a real razor and misses areas on my face. It does self clean well and does not cut me as much as a razor. If you are lazy and do not care if you have a super close shave this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun Syncro for almost 4 years (as well as a Norelco), and I decided to try the Activator when Amazon offered a $50 credit for buying Braun products over $130.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Activator improves on the Syncro in 3 ways. First, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face (the Syncro did). Second, the cleaning base is more compact, easier to operate, and (apparently) more efficient in its use of cleaning cartridges. Third, the travel case is much smaller (it now follows the form of the shaver). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any reason to pay extra for the 8595. Whatever information is on the LCD is unnecessary -- save yourself $30 and get the 8585. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cartridges and replacement blades/screens are still expensive, but the Activator gives me a much closer shave than my Norelco, and it no longer irritates my face like the Syncro did. As far as I can tell, this is the best electric razor on the market. Keep up the research, Braun, and pray that Apple doesn&#x27;t come out with an iShave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve try many different razor, however, this is the razor that doesn&#x27;t give me any pain while shaving.  I will recommend this shaver to guys with sensitive skins.  Also the self-cleaning mechanism is a great add-on as well.</li>
            <li> I agree with several reviewers that this cleaning unit is really a lot of hype and overengineering.  At the time, I did not realize I would be buying replacement cartridges every 1-2 months.  Cleaning shaver stubble from my rotary shavers for &gt;10 years has never really been a big deal.  We have far more unpleasurable waste that we deal with everyday.  Hey, we&#x27;re human!    As far as the shaver, it cannot do a good job on the neck if you have a thick new beard every morning.  I am of Italian descent so take that for \\&quot;whaddits\\&quot; worth.  As a test, I used my very old Norelco rotary on half my face and it blew away the Braun in direct comparison.  Maybe there are foil shavers out there that are equal to rotary shavers, but this one turned me off completely to foil shavers.    P.S.- I personally felt this product needed to be bashed.  I am even disappointed with Costco for carrying this product in their limited selection.</li>
            <li> Love all the features but this shaver doesnt cut as close as I thought it would. I donot get a close shave. maybe the cutters are dull or something but my experience is not a positive one. On the other hand  the self clean features and recharge stand are great. It really cleans the shaver well for a no maintenance shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver cleans very easily, looks nice and keeps your sink clean.  However, it just doesn&#x27;t cut close enough for me, particularly on the throat area.  I have never found an electric razor that even got anywhere near as close as a blade and this is no exception.  I could get it pretty damn close on my face by repeatedly jamming the razor against my face, but it would take a long time to do this.  As far as the hair on my throat, there was no way at all to cut that anywhere near as close as I would have wanted.  This might be the best of the few electric shavers that I tried, but still disappointing.</li>
            <li> My husband has very thick facial hair that likes to grow at unusual angles and up to three (3) hairs per pore.  When he shaves he looks like he is shaving off skin because he has to press so hard.  He had to wait three (3) days between shaves just so he could let his skin heal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I read rave reviews of the Braun 8585, so I decided to order it for my husband for Christmas.  So far, it has been wonderful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before the Braun, he had a 3-razor shaving process:  Sensor Excel, Mach3 Power, and Schick Quatro.  Each of the blades could only be used at most 3 times before the dulled blades needed to be replaced (expensive replacements).  The process took over 30 minutes in the shower (wasted water) and left his neck looking raw every time.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now with the Braun he still takes 30 minutes to shave, but only  about 10 minutes in the shower for the really tough spots and the areas close to his gotee.  He uses much less water, and we don&#x27;t need to replace his blades once a week.  AND, best of all, his neck isn&#x27;t raw and he can shave every day if he wants or needs to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth $140. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is an excellent device. Truly the closest electric I&#x27;ve used. It does take approximately 1 month of use to achieve the consistent, close shave results.</li>
            <li> The razor shaves very well &amp; I like the combination cleaning &amp; charging station.</li>
            <li> Very powerful. Cutting head tilts to fit your face. &lt;br /&gt;Every time I use it the automatic cleaner gives me a completely clean razor---just like new.</li>
            <li> Good close shave with much less irritation than a razor. If, like I do, you have thick or abundant hair and sensitive skin and need to shave daily this is really a good option. Granted, no electrical shaver will ever shave as close as a blade, but the difference is barely noticeable (with THIS shaver). I have also noticed that to achieve that closeness I was having more and more irritation resulting in less close shaves towards the end of the week. I was also spending more time and money with the razor shave. Reviewers have complained about the price of the cleaning solution but I don&#x27;t think it would be much different (or maybe even favorable) if you compare it to the price of good quality blades, gel, and aftershave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is really well designed. It feels solid and comfortable in your hand without being a brick.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Dear Sirs, &lt;br /&gt;I very much appreciate the opportunity you have provided for me to comment on my new Braun Electric Shaver. &lt;br /&gt;I am not a perpetual complainer. This is the first time in 40 years I have submitted  a written complaint about a product which I have purchased. &lt;br /&gt;I must say , however, that I am keenly disappointed with my Braun 8585.  &lt;br /&gt;It does not provide me with a clean or a close shave. &lt;br /&gt;Its performance is only very marginally better than my Norelco which has languished in my top drawer for more than 20 years. &lt;br /&gt;I am wondering whether the liquid cleaning \\&quot;device\\&quot; of the Braun is not just a gimmick--- messy, cumbersome and quite expensive to use.  &lt;br /&gt;I sincerely apolgise for these negative comments but trust nevertheless that you will find them helpful. &lt;br /&gt;Respectfully submitted, Eric Sorensen, Minneapolis.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with his \\&quot;self-cleaning\\&quot; razor, although he didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to keep purchasing the cleaning solution packs. It&#x27;s an excellant appliance.</li>
            <li> I have been happily using Braun shavers for over 20 years. My model 6520 Ultra Speed is stiil going strong. I mention this for a couple of reasons:  1) I am a fan of Braun; 2) I have owned various models and thus can compare new models to the older versions.     Here&#x27;s my take on the 8585 Activator:         JUNK!    First, the shaver is way too wide. It&#x27;s difficult to get a good grip on it -- very few rubber contact pads -- and your hand fatigues more easily. Compared to my Braun 6520 (slim and elegant), this new model is a tank (big and unwieldy).     Second, it&#x27;s LOUD!   Way too loud. No way to start the day.    Third, there&#x27;s nothing special about the way it shaves.  I saw no material difference between the Activator and my five year old Braun. Granted, every man&#x27;s beard is different, so your results may be different.    Finally, build quality and features. I don&#x27;t think Braun is building the same high quality shavers of yesteryear. Too much plastic.  The locking feature (designed to prevent your shaver from turning on while in your suitcase) is nowhere in the same league as prior models.  I wouldn&#x27;t trust it.  Then there&#x27;s the cleaning program.  You either use a brush or Braun&#x27;s new clean and charge stand. You can&#x27;t clean it in the sink like you can with a Panasonic wet/dry shaver. Personally, I think that the Braun cleaning system is more about sellling cleaning cartridges than providing a significantly better shave.  Braun (owned by Gillette) has cleverly gotten you to pay big bucks for an electric shaver, then get you to buy a new cleaning cartridge every month. That&#x27;s akin to buying new blades month after month. I&#x27;ve used a brush for years and never had a problem.    I returned this Activator and have since picked up a Panasonic Linear shaver. I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Gives an excellent, super close shave -- wet or dry.  It&#x27;s compact and easy to grip. And the best part, you can clean the blades right in the sink, and you can shave in the shower using shave cream. Now, I know that may sound like heresy, but brother, once you try it, you&#x27;ll be amazed.    So to sum up. I am still a Braun man at heart, but their new models are a step down in my book. Way down. With a little web surfing you can get a top of the line Panasonic shaver for under a $100 bucks. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> This razor works as advertised.Previously I went through more expensive razors in less than a year. Provides a good, clean &amp; close shave. The self cleaning action is great and it saves me time when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The razor gives a close shave, but I have had problems with Braun&#x27;s customer service.  I have owned the razor for almost a year.  After approximately six months, the lights on the charging/cleaning base would not come on and the base would not clean the razor.  I called Braun and they told me which service center to send it to and gave me the number so that I could call first.  I called the service center, described the symptoms and was instructed to send in the base at my expense.  Well...weeks became months with no word from Braun or the service center.  I called Braun and they told me to contact the service center. I did as instructed and they told me that the base was fine and that maybe there was a problem with the razor or the charging adaptor and that I would have to send them in at my expense even though I was originally asked to send in only the base.  Interestingly enough, I have been using the razor and charger without incident.   I am frustrated that they have had my base for months and have not contacted me to tell me their conclusion.  I will send in my razor and go back to a blade until I receive my repaired setup; hopefully it will be back in a reasonable amount of time.  Though I like the ergonomics and shave of the 8585, I will probably not buy any more Braun products due to the poor attention Braun gives to the buyer after the sale.</li>
            <li> Sent the entirely wrong product, could not send correct product so now I have wasted over two weeks for a refund.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a couple of weeks now.  I have used Norelco and Remington shavers in the past as well as the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo.  I can honestly say the shave is as close as a blade.  However, there is no mess.  Also the self cleaning feature works wonderful as well.  No more disgusting stubble clean ups. You can get the refill for $9.95 for 2 month supply.  You can&#x27;t beat it.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the second electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and the first I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The first time I used an electric razor was about 8 years ago.  My friend had one and the convienence seemed great, so I gave it a try.  I thought the skin had been peeled from my face!  The shave wasn&#x27;t close at all and every whisker that was left on my face seemed to have a direct line to my pain center.  I had NEVER had razor burn that bad before.  I swore off any and all electric razors at that point. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here recently, I was given this razor as a gift.  I thought \\&quot;Hey, computer technology has come a long way in 8 years, why not razors?\\&quot; so I decided to give it a try.  I followed the directions for setting it up and letting it charge.  I decided to give it a try on a weekend evening... I was expecting MASSIVE razor burn again and I didn&#x27;t want to have to go out in public afraid to have a gnat land on my skin.  I used the razor.  Shave was pretty close, not as close as my safety razor and cream, but pretty dang close.  But, the most amazing thing....  VERY LITTLE RAZOR BURN!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.. first time I used it, the skin on my neck got a little irritated and red, but nothing unbearable.  The redness was gone in 15 minutes.  Now, after a week of using it, there&#x27;s no irritation at all!  I&#x27;m amazed! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews here have covered the features of the razor, so I thought I&#x27;d give a few tips for &#x27;first time&#x27; electric razor owners like myself as well as a few general comments on the Braun 8585: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  Shaving before showering to improve the closeness of the shave. &lt;br /&gt;2.  While shaving, use your other hand to &#x27;stretch&#x27; the area you are shaving... this will help raise the hairs and make your shave closer. &lt;br /&gt;3.  I never realized this, but shaving cream has two purposes.  I always thought it was just there to lubricate your skin... turns out it also does a great job of telling you where you have and have not shaved as well!  Since the Braun doesn&#x27;t require shaving cream, you&#x27;ll have to pay closer attention the first few times you use it to make sure you don&#x27;t miss any spots.  Run your hand over your face and you can usually tell if you&#x27;ve missed anything. &lt;br /&gt;4.  The cleaning cycle is a bit loud... basically, it makes the razor run while flowing cleaning fluid through the head.  So, it&#x27;s just as load as the razor itself.  It also turns on and off randomly, so it is a bit irritating.  The moral of the story?  Don&#x27;t press the cleaning button if someone nearby is still trying to sleep. &lt;br /&gt;5.  The included electric cord does not stretch much (maybe 4&#x27;) and has to be plugged in to the back of the base stand.  So, depending on your bathroom electrical outlet arrangement, you may need to get a short extension cord so that the big, ugly black cord of the razor isn&#x27;t stretching all over the place. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I can&#x27;t recommend this shaver enough.  I never thought there would be an electric razor that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but it seems I&#x27;ve found one.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a &#x27;real&#x27; razor, but it is good enough for a workday.  If your significant other demands baby smooth cheeks, you can always bust out the &#x27;real&#x27; razor for date night.  This razor is perfect for anyone looking to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; a few minutes and a lot of hassle out of their morning routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Brauan 8585 for over a week now, and I&#x27;m very impressed. It comes as close to a blade shave as you can get. &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is a winner. No more messy fuzz to clean up; no more gunk in the sink. You just put the shaver in the holder, and it cleans itself.</li>
            <li> As someone who has always used a Braun electric shaver I must say that it was an easy choice when it came time to replace my old Flex Control model.  However, even for a longtime Braun fan such as myself I have been blown away by the quality of the new self-cleaning Activator 8585.  The new foil system gives me a much closer shave, particularly in those tough spots on my neck and the cleaning system eliminates the need to brush out the whiskers and clean the cutterblock myself as I did before.  The cleaning fluid is good for a month if cleaning daily, but I only clean 1-2 times per week so it will last even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the ultimate compliment for this product came this past weekend on a trip with my dad.  A longtime razor user, he tried the Activator and liked it so much he said that he was going to buy his own when he got home.  Anyone who says an electric shaver can&#x27;t compare to a traditional razor for closeness has not tried this product.  5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try not to be redundant, as most of all the glowing feedback on display I agree with 100%.  I&#x27;ll add that I have the enviable honor of having sensitive skin, along with bullet proof stubble.  It&#x27;s always been difficult to shave every day because of my beard being pretty thick.  Since a close shave irritated my skin with most razers, I would have to wait 2 - 3 days for a close and comfortable shave.  More than likely it&#x27;s the newfangled foil, but I can shave every day now if I choose and not have irritated skin, and/or a 12 o&#x27;clock shadow.  The cleaning system is also handy for those of you lazy like me</li>
            <li> I bought this model to replace my old Panasonic triple blade shaver. Well, given the price I paid (compared to $20 I paid for the panasonic model), I am a bit disappointed by Braun. I will start with all the good aspects of this shaver, then the reasons why I am disappointed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver seems to have excellent build quality and everything from packaging to touching is very good (as you would expect from high-end shaver). More importantly, the shaving quality is superb. It shaves closer than the panasonic model, and probably is the closest an electronic shaver can get (shaving result is almost equivalent to razor). And the shaver is very powerful so don&#x27;t worry if you have long and hard hair. It runs over them and eliminates them without problem. Using my old Panasonic, it may take several round to clean such thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there are many things Braun should do better to improve its usability. Here are some of what I discovered: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. It uses special cleaning fluid which has to be replace every several weeks depending on how often you clean it. This is a constant money drain and maintainence nightmare. Let alone roughly $60 you need to spend on cleaning fluid, what if Braun stops producing the fluid? You are out of option and may have to rely on stupid manual cleaning. This is no good at all and I am surprised to find this happens. The Panasonic model can use water to rinse it (actually you can use it during bath) and I consider it a superb design over Braun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. It is relative hard to take the whole package with you during travel. I mean if you have to take the cleaning stuff. You probably have to seal the fluid catridge (worrying about leakage), and the whole station is big enough to take some luggage space. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. A minor annoying detail: when the shaver is put in the cleaning station, you have to take off the protection cap and put it somewhere. If you are not careful enough, you may end up losing it somewhere.This is careless design. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4. Noise from the shave is very loud, much louder than Panasonic model. Now I have to close bathroom&#x27;s door to avoid waking up others in the home. Great power does not need come with bigger noise! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun, please pay more attention on the usability and maintainence. A high quality shaver is not only about shaving quality, lots of other minor details count. I&#x27;d refrain from recommending such shaver to others because of these drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to share my opinion of this shaver.  I found other people&#x27;s reviews to be so helpful when I was trying to find the best electric shaver recently.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I previously had a Braun 6520 for years and was very happy with it until the day it died.  I went a while without an electric shaver and finally decided to get a new one.  I am not a rich man, but the Braun 8585 is worth every penny.  I am extremely happy with it.  I believe it to be the finest electric shaver available today.  The other two shavers I tried during my recent search failed in so many ways by comparison.  You really do get what you pay for with electric shavers.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of the shavers I tried was the Remington MS3-1700 Titanium 3 MicroScreen Ultra.  By comparison the Remington was much louder especially the sideburn trimmer which made me feel like I should insert earplugs before putting that thing so close to my ear.  Also, even though it has the 3 screens, it took a much longer time to shave and it did not do that good of a job.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Braun works really great and is impressively better than my old one which I was very happy with.  I highly recommend the 8585! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver based on the many positive reviews on amazon.  My Trusty old Norelco was just not cutting it anymore.  Yes, pun intended.  While it was a good shaver, I still had a problem with shaving rash every morning.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun turned out to be better than I expected.  I get a good shave, though I still have to work it under the chin to get all the  hairs that don&#x27;t grow straight out.  I think everyone has that problem, and even a blade can be cumbersome there.  All in all it&#x27;s a great shave from a foil shaver, and at least in my case NO rash anymore.  I love it!  I also really like the self clean feature.  I do not have a heavy beard, so I clean it every other day.  It&#x27;s nice to have a perfectly clean, fresh smelling shaver each time.  The cleaning tank seems to last a reasonable amount of time and I have no complaints.  The noise it makes while cleaning does not bother me at all.  Do some people keep these next to the bed???  The cost of refills is not bad at all considering you don&#x27;t have to spend time poking and brushing out your shaver every morning.  A small price for convenience.  I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Razors will get you the closest shave available.  But they constantly cut and make my face break out. . .plus the cost of replacing the blades is up there.  About a year ago I tried a triple-foil shaver, which hurt my face more than razors do.  So I returned that on the quality guarantee and purchsed a Braun 7526.  This was the best electric shaver I&#x27;d ever used.  It cut close and fast, and everytime I cleaned it, it was like starting with a brand new unit.  I recently upgraded to the new 8585 - mainly to try the new foil design.  This one is even better than the previous! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the differences are: &lt;br /&gt;* Feels lighter &lt;br /&gt;* With the new foil design, it glides over my face and requires far fewer passes to get the job done &lt;br /&gt;* The charger/cleaner base is half the size of the previous &lt;br /&gt;* Comes with a handy hard case - instead of the leather/material of the 7526 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun 8585 for several weeks now &amp; I like overall. It shaves more quickly and with less effort that my previous Braun Integral. It is especially good at getting hairs that lay down. I used to have to use the trimmer for those, but not with this one. It also easily trims any long hair by pointing the foil head straight at them. However, I have had a couple of ingrown hairs too, something very rarely had with the Integral. If you are prone to those, I would go with other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the razor is rounded slightly and smooth so I feel the grip is not very secure. I&#x27;ve never come close to dropping it though, so this may be just a reaction to the better feel of the Integral&#x27;s flat surface with rubber bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner I think is fairly useless. It takes up space &amp; since it&#x27;s plugged in all the time, what is the point of having a battery powered shaver? It also makes the bathroom smell slightly of alcohol. It does do a good cleaning job, after a half hour of buzzing and stinking (slightly). However, you could do the same with a brush in seconds. I&#x27;ve noticed that as it changes its cleaning recommendations, it never goes backwards, even if you clean it by hand. So it is doing something to figure out the amount of clippings inside, but even if you remove them thoroughly it still tells you that it needs the same level of cleaning as it did right before you cleaned it. Thank goodness you can use the razor without this silly cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got curious about how the foil does so much better than the more uniform lower-end Braun models. My son&#x27;s 60 power Intel Play microscope did a great job answering this question. The Activator foil has some holes that are quite a bit larger, and some smaller than the Integral foil (I think that&#x27;s the one used on most other Brauns). Also, the lines between the holes are much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say if you do not have a problem with ingrown hairs, buy an Activator but save your money if they have a model out that does not include the cleaner. If you have a problem with ingrown hairs, buy a Braun without the Activator foil.ator but save your money if they have a model out that does not include the cleaner. If you have a problem with ingrown hairs, buy a Braun without the Activator foil.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Braun Activator 8585 about 1 month ago. I am trying to understand the logic behind the cleaning system (other than having to pay a monthly maintenance fee). The box mentioned something about a computer chip. I believe that the programmer must have been sleeping when he programmed the chip in my charger. &lt;br /&gt;I have the following problem with the cleaner. &lt;br /&gt;I have a full beard. This means I only shave the neck (about 1 min per shave). My hair is blond and thin. I always take the foil off and clean after each shave. In other words there should be no strain on the shaver and the area that I shave is probably 1/5 of a typically shave. On Thursday after a shave the unit went thru an \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot; cleaning cycle. I shaved again on Friday. On Friday night the unit showed \\&quot;ECO\\&quot;. I did not shave on Saturday and the unit showed \\&quot;Normal\\&quot;. I woke up on Sunday and the unit showed \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot;. Just to recap, I shaved my neck ones after an \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot; cleaning cycle and the unit went from \\&quot;ECO\\&quot; to \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; to \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot; all by itself. Braun should let the user select the cleaning cycle. &lt;br /&gt;I have the feeling that the shaver was invented and programmed to make Braun more money in-between shaver purchases. How can one justify $10 for 10 oz of cleaning solution when the production cost is probably pennies per oz? How can you make a customer believe that the shaver needs an intensive cleaning after 1 min off shaving? Where is the logic (lack of logic)? &lt;br /&gt;BTW I do not see any difference in shaving between my $60.- Braun 5520 and this new shaver. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: &lt;br /&gt;I have always liked Braun Shavers (I owned about 5 so far). I give the shaver 4 stars (still some stray hair that it doesn&#x27;t shave); the cleaning unit 2 stars (lack of logic) then deduct 1 star for the price of the shaver and deduct one star for the price of the cleaning solution.  &lt;br /&gt;I would suggest buying a Braun XP Flex for $50 with a yearly cost (cutter head every 18-24 month) ofabout $15 vs the 8585 for $140 and a yearly cost (cutter head plus solutions) of about $80.</li>
            <li> I grow a very thick beard, and this is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve had that I don&#x27;t have to shave twice a day with.  The closest thing I&#x27;ve found to a blade--without the razor burn!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Dad who is unable to shave himself.  I tried one of the less expensive models and it only worked well on portions of his face.  Took the plunge and bought this one, and it was the best thing I could do.  The razor gets all the parts of his face, quickly and it&#x27;s not too loud.  The self-cleaning feature is pretty loud, but worth it because of the ease and quickness of shaving.  I recommend for anyone who has to help others shave.</li>
            <li> I just bought it and the first few shaes I have taken were amazing, so close I&#x27;d never use a blade again because of the convenience, closeness, and self cleaning.    It&#x27;s very close and for the amount of time you shave, unless you are a mutant lumberjack and grow hair at a fantastically fast rate, who cares how loud it is (not very compared to others), it if gets the job done...and it does.    I&#x27;ve heard people complain it doesn&#x27;t sit well in the station because they are right handed...well I am too, and I manage well enough to pick it up with my left hand too.    my only complaint which can&#x27;t really be helped is that in a month or so I will have to buy a new cleaning solution cartridge but it&#x27;s still cheaper than razors, and cream and other things you use with a blade, and it can&#x27;t really be avoided for the great feature it is. (the cleaning solution I mean)</li>
            <li> I have been using a Mach 3 razor for the past few years but I got tired of the hassle of shaving with it every morning (especially the shaving cream mess). I decided to try the 8585 after much research, and I am happy to report that after a month of use I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I get a shave almost as close as my Mach 3 with no cuts or nicks and none of the mess, and my skin never feels irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week to adjust to the difference of using an electric, but now I am getting close shaves every morning. Highly recommended for those who are thinking of making the jump!</li>
            <li> the 8585 shaver is not only one of the best shavers i have ever used, it is so easy to maintain. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver, so I can&#x27;t say how it compares to others.  However, I have to say that shaving as an experience is much better with the Braun Activator than with a traditional razor (I was using the Mach3).  I&#x27;m just happy to be done with the mess of shaving cream and the cuts on my neck.  There are still a few spots that don&#x27;t get cut very close (particularly below/under the jaw) but I&#x27;m quite satisfied overall (especially since these spots were tough with the Mach3).</li>
            <li> I have been a lifelong blade shaver- my most recent setup was a Mach 3, plus the excellent \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; shave gel.  But the hassle of blade shaving started to bug me after the birth of our second child as I started looking for ways to streamline my morning routine, and I decided to give an electric a try.  After reading a lot of different reviews, I chose this Braun.  I&#x27;ve been using it for little over a month.    The good:  It&#x27;s capable of delivering a very close shave (if you take the time... see below).  Better yet, nicks are very rare, and nowhere near as long-bleeding as those from a blade.  It&#x27;s great to just put down the shaver and be done- no rinsing, no wiping up all the water that ends up splashing on the sink, etc...  There&#x27;s no shaving cream to run out of!  The cleaning feature is superlative- it cleans itself better than I possibly could, and the lemon scent is nice.    The bad:  I&#x27;m not sure it is saving me much time.  If I&#x27;m very careful, and pass over each spot a dozen times, I can get a shave that comes close to my blade.  It&#x27;s much easier to miss spots than it was with blade shaving, and I find myself having to run my hand ahead of the blade to \\&quot;pick up\\&quot; the hairs so they&#x27;ll be shaved.      However, I&#x27;m keeping it- I think it&#x27;s as good as an electric likly gets, and I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need a \\&quot;perfect shave\\&quot; every day.  When I hurried a blade shave, I would end up with a bloody face.  A few rough patches are a fine tradeoff as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and it&#x27;s nothing you can see.    For the special occasions where I really want a close shave, I can take the time and get something approaching what a blade could do.  I can even shave twice in one day- maybe a morning quickie, and a more careful shave before \\&quot;date night\\&quot; when I can take the time.  That&#x27;s inconceivable with a blade, at least with my skin.    I know some folks are bugged by the cleaning solution thing.  I&#x27;m convinced that the bulk of the cleaning fluid loss occurs not during cleaning, but through evaporation during periods of non-use... the system is not sealed tightly.  I think that unless you have a very thick, fast-growing beard, you can get by just cleaning weekly, and removing and recapping the cleaning fluid container between cleanings.  This would likely extend the cartridge lifetime significantly- I&#x27;ve read reports of people using them for a year.    But I wouldn&#x27;t go nearly that long.  During cleaning, the fluid is pumped up to the shave head for cleaning, and them runs back down into the container.  In other words, it is reused, and the shaved beard hairs settle to the bottom of the container and are disposed of when you replace it.  But hair isn&#x27;t the only thing that comes off your face- there are facial oils too, and I have to think that the fluid itself would get funky if you went too long without replacing it.  I have a very oily face, so I plan to replace cartridges pretty much according to the normal schedule.    In summary- as a recent convert to electric shaving, I&#x27;ve been pleased overall.  It has required some adjustment, but for my lifestyle right now it&#x27;s a good match, and I would certainly recommend this model to anyone contemplating the same change.    *UPDATE*: After four months, I&#x27;m still happy with it, and still works as I described.  However, I have developed real issues with the environmental impact of the disposable cleaning solution containers- they&#x27;re a heavy plastic that will be around for millenia, and are not recyclable.  I&#x27;ve gone to cleaning the blades manually weekly with the included brush, installing and using the cleaning solution once every 3 weeks to keep it lubricated (storing it capped the rest of the time).  It&#x27;s messier and a little more hassle, but cuts way down on cartridge use.  I&#x27;ve noticed no difference in shave quality.    -R</li>
            <li> I have used a blade my entire life and i bought this razor expecting that it wouldn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade. However, i expected it to be quicker/easier with less irritation. I have a pretty heavy beard and i have sensitive skin so i thought i would try this product to get away from some of the irritation of a blade. I WAS WRONG! It took me longer to shave with this and i had more razor burn/irritation than i do with a blade. The razor did okay on my face but on the jawlines and the neck it didn&#x27;t cut a darn thing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now after experimenting with almost everything i feel like i can tell you what the best shave is. If you want the best/quickest/least irriative/closest shave, this is what you need to do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;first, the best blade is the Mach 3 Power, the other Mach 3&#x27;s will do but the Mach 3 Power is the best. I tried gillete&#x27;s new power fusion with 5 blades and it didn&#x27;t even come close to the comfort and closeness of the Mach 3 Power. &lt;br /&gt;second, the best shaving cream is the Nivea Shaving Gel, i get the sensitive skin but any of them will do. Nivea is the thickest /creamiest lather you&#x27;ll find. &lt;br /&gt;(make sure you shave after the shower when your face is hot and wet)</li>
            <li> The Braun 8585 is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used - including the Braun shaver I had in college.  It has the usual drawback of an electric shaver - the shave just isn&#x27;t as close or smooth as a blade.  However, for someone like me with very sensitive skin, it works well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between electric shavers and razors since I started shaving.  Even using expensive products (the Art of Shaving, Aramis Lab Series and Anthony Sport), I have problems with my skin when using a blade.  With the Braun 8585, I have had none of those problems.  Timewise, I think it is about the same as a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning system is pretty cool but it&#x27;s very noisy (scares the cat every time I use it) and buying the additional cleaning cartridges and head is a little pricy but not unmanageable.  The shaver holds a charge and travels well.  If you&#x27;re after an electric shaver, this is the one to get, but keep your razor and shaving lotion for times when you need that extra close, extra smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I bought a Braun Activator shaver because I was tired of nicks, cuts, and irritated skin.  I had tried electric razors in the past but they never did a good job shaving  (especially my neck) and were always a pain to keep clean.  The Mach3 tripple blade razors did a great job giving me a close shave, but sometimes TOO close.   So on a whim I decided to try this shaver.  I figured it might be a $100 gamble.    The results were pleasing.  To be sure, it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the Mach3 blade did.  But it did shave close enough to last through the day.  I was also pleasantly surprised that it was able to cut my difficult neck whiskers, something that all my previous electrics failed to do.    I typically run the cleaning step every other day, shaking out the shavings on the off days.  This helps the cleaning fluid last a wee bit longer.  The cleaning fluid also leaves a slightly lubricating film on the shaver which helps it glide smoothly across the skin.    One warning about the self cleaning part:  It buzzs and whirs off and on for about 10-15 minutes (depending on the cleaning cycle).  If you&#x27;re a light sleeper, run it later.    Why only 4 stars out of 5?  If it gave just a wee closer shave I would have given it 5 stars.  Overall, its a great shaver.</li>
            <li> After 30 years of shaving with a blade, I have finally found an electric razor that works good enough to abandon the blade.  I have been using this for over two years now and I am very pleased with the results (so is my wife!)  As long as I use it everyday, or maybe skip one day once in a while, it works great.  After a vacation from shaving, I need to get out the blade again or go to a barbershop.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job with the flat hair under my chin. It always leaves crumbs around my neck. I HATE that. I have to use the razor blade to get the hard spots. What a pain. I just bought the new Braun, we&#x27;ll see how that works.</li>
            <li> This was an upgrade from the Braun TriControl, the Braun Flex XP 2 and the Norelco Reflex Plus 6. I also tried a Remington Micro Screen (twin head) as a replacement for my older Remington 700.  On my thick one day beard the 8585 is substantialy quicker and smoother than the others.  The 8585 actually feels good on my face and there&#x27;s no pinching or irritation to speak of.  Running my free hand firmly against the skin, just ahead of the shaver to stand the beard up, produces a shave that is as close as what you would get with a  disposable twin bladed razor. But not as good as the premium two to four blade razors like Sensor and Mach 3.  And even then, to get a smooth as silk face takes a LOT of time.  I have to keep teasing the beard up with my free hand and keep going over and over the same spot.  Eight to nine minutes later I will have a close as a blade shave.  That is a lot of time and effort. Now if I&#x27;m in a hurry, in two to three minutes I can get a pretty good \\&quot;go to work shave\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s on that type of shave that the 8585 excels.  And as far as closeness goes, the Braun TriControl can actually give me a slightly closer shave but it takes a lot of time to do so and it&#x27;s not nearly as comfortable.         I like the way they isolated the vibration from the users hand.  I have mild arthritis and the Flex XP is so buzzy that it&#x27;s tiring to hold for a long time.  The only down side I see is that you can&#x27;t rinse the 8585 with water to clean it like you can with the TriControl and Flex shavers.  To me the self-cleaning stand is just one more bother in my already cluttered world.  So the bottom line is that it&#x27;s a little smoother and much quicker than the lower line Brauns, (although I have not tried the Syncro System).  And it feels absolutly fantastic on my skin, the Norelco was especially slow and harsh. But if you give the TriControl enough passes it cuts just as close and for a third of the money. But the 8585 can give you a decent shave in a couple of minutes while the other shavers take what seems like forever.      All in all I like it but I would have prefered a cheaper version without the cleaning stand.</li>
            <li> Just got this razor for Christmas. Have been using a Norelco for about 10 years and it was a good razor, but this shaver gives me alot closer shave. Doesn&#x27;t take as long to shave and my face feels as good as a blade. As mentioned in earlier posts the cleaning system may be a little over the top but it wouldn&#x27;t keep me from owning this razor.</li>
            <li> I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; electric shaver for many years. After hearing my constant complaints about various brands and models, my wife bought me this shaver for Christmas. I have used various electric shavers from Panasonic, Norelco, and Remington with mostly disappointing results. This is my first Braun. I have heard great things about their products and I must admit that I am quite impressed. Though this shaver does not shave quite as close as my Remington foil shaver (which just died after barely a year), it however does shave with absolutely no razor burn or cuts. This really blew me away because I have extremely sensitive skin and could never shave with a dry shaver without intense razor burn. I always bought wet/dry models so I could continue shaving with cream as a means to reduce razor burn. Not only can I now shave dry but I can do so without any cuts, which is another first. The foil is so easy on my skin that I can shave twice a day and I don&#x27;t need to use cooling aftershave lotion anymore. &lt;br /&gt;As with all the electric shavers I have used in the past, this one struggles with neck hair. It does a reasonable job but I still have to follow up with a blade to get the hairs it can&#x27;t cut. Because this is a dry shaver, it takes a bit longer for me to get a close shave but it is less messy which is nice.  &lt;br /&gt;This shaver is rather quiet compared to some and has a fair amount of power. I have a very thick beard that grows very quickly and this shaver mows right through it. Unfortunately I am cursed with a perpetual 5 o&#x27;clock shadow so even though my face is smooth to the touch it still looks as if it needs shaving.  &lt;br /&gt;Though this shaver does not produce the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver, it is the most comfortable and bloodless I&#x27;ve ever had. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because its not \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; but then again there might not be such a thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers all my life.  I&#x27;ve never been comfortable using a blade because I always ended up with more knicks &amp; cuts then it was worth.   Part of the problem is that I have a very fine beard, especially in the neck area.  This results in a lot of &#x27;scragglers&#x27; that were almost impossible to get with an electric razor.  But after using this razer since Christmas, I have to admit that I LOVE THIS THING!  It&#x27;s given me a closer shave then I&#x27;ve ever gotten from any other electric razer (and I&#x27;ve tried cheaper Brauns, Norelco&#x27;s, Panasonic, etc).  It picks up the scragglers and leaves everything smooth as silk.   The automatic cleaning system also kick @ss.  Just put it into the dock and let it do it&#x27;s thing.  30 minutes later, it comes out fresh and ready to go again.  No more hassling with brushes and periodic cleaning.  (Hint:  To save on the cleaning cartridge, I tend to dock and clean it after every-other shave - it still comes up with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleaning.  There&#x27;s a higher and lower level of cleaning that it will use depending on how often you dock it.)  I have to admit I am spending a little more time shaving then I used to, but I attribute that to me making sure I&#x27;m picking up all the &#x27;loose ends&#x27; that my previous razers always left behind and taking the time to make the shave as smooth as possible.</li>
            <li> I have used a corded Eltron 770 for many years with excellent results. After reading the reviews of the Braun 8585 I decided to buy one. My first surprise was to find little metal and much plastic in the 8585 construction. My second surprise was the modest power of the 8585 compared with the Eltron 770. The 8585 slows down when it contacts whiskers, something that never happens using the corded Eltron 770. Removing a three-day growth of beard with the 8585 was a time-consuming chore with mixed results. Removing the same amount of beard with the Eltron 770 was quick, easy and yielded excellent results. On a scale of one to ten I&#x27;d give the Eltron 770 a nine. I&#x27;d give the Braun 8585 a five.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun 8585 for four months now.  The device does not age well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite the use of the included cleaning / charging base, two screws under the foil screen are rusting.  I&#x27;m considering this a cosmetic problem until something actually falls apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The main problem I have is with the cleaning / charging base.  When I put the razor in the base, I have to jiggle it for several minutes to get the \\&quot;Charge\\&quot; light to come on or to get the base to determine a cleaning cycle to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I do get the base to start cleaning the razor, the razor always shakes lose during the same stage of the cleaning.  At one point the razor turns on and begins running, and it&#x27;s at this stage that the razor shakes itself lose and disconnects.  The end result is a razor that refuses to charge in the base and isn&#x27;t being cleaned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My wife managed to get it to hold still for a cleaning cycle with the careful use of a Q-tip to jam the razor against the wall of the case.  This is an art I&#x27;ve been unable to master. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I can still charge the razor using the electrical cable, the major feature, the self cleaning functionality, is completely useless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m disappointed in the razor, and have no intention of purchasing a Braun razor in the future.</li>
            <li> The machine and the cleaner sistem is perfect, i&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Last winter, I stumbled a Remington Titanium razor at a great price and decided to buy it (my Braun needed replaced).  What a mistake!  Sometimes you need to leave home to understand how good you really had it.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My wife realized my frustration with the Remington and bought me this Braun for Fathers Day.  What a relief!  The Braun razors are just that good.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical on the whole cleaning/charging station.  After a few months with it I have come to like it.  I do like having a clean razor (mmmmm the smell of alcohol!) for each shave - something I had never thought about before.  As far as performance, it is up to Braun standards.  It does occasionally miss a hair on my neck, but it&#x27;s much less common an occurance than what I went through with the Remington.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an electric, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  I&#x27;ve been using Braun razors for 15 years now and have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had Braun shavers all my life and this is the best they have ever made. The new foil system gives an incredibly close shave. And, the new cleaning and charging system is a significant upgrade from their previous models. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> My last saver the Panasonic ES8152NC met with my plaster wall in a fit of anger. So as a total perfectionist I tried this one because it came with a \\&quot;Brawn\\&quot; money back grantee for the fist 30 days. I have found this one is the ticket, it gets no better then this, it shaves me closer then a razor, it is simply perfect. The major improvement on this model is the head design, that alone, is possibly why it is perfect. To add to this perfection scenario it is not made in China or any Asian sweet shop, but in Germany, or at least mine was.</li>
            <li> Pros: &lt;br /&gt;I can now use one shaver to cut long whiskers.  I used to use a Braun for short whiskers and a Norelco for long whiskers that grew when I did not shave every day. &lt;br /&gt;The shaver does not pull the whiskers as they are cut, regardless of the length. &lt;br /&gt;I have used my shaver for six months and it still holds a good charge and cuts well due to the cleaner, I think. &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Cost of cleaner -- I use about one per month but it does seem to do what it claims.  It keeps the shaver clean, lubricated, and smelling chemically clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.  Also, I would not waste money on the LCD display.</li>
            <li> Bought this four years ago, and used it every day.  Working great.  Had no problem at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m admittedly only one person, but as a user of a rotary razor, and a recent purchaser of this Braun, I thought my experience may be useful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun actually does provide a very close shave, but it takes more time than the Norelco I&#x27;d been using.  Additionally, it&#x27;s not as good on the neck hairs and other challenging spots.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is really, really fast, for five shaves after you clean it.  Then it begins to stumble over each additional hair, and after two weeks of non-cleaning, it almost can&#x27;t handle it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And this was the part I couldn&#x27;t stand, cleaning the Norelco every two weeks.  Looking back, I&#x27;m not sure which to pick.  The Norelco is great, but requires lots of maintenance.  The Braun is a much closer shave, but takes much more time to shave.  It&#x27;s a question of balancing your laziness.  Do you want to clean the thing every single week?  If so, go with a rotary.  If not, and I think I&#x27;m leaning towards this camp, I&#x27;d stick with the Braun.  It takes more time every shave, but not cleaning it is a blessing I can&#x27;t fully describe.</li>
            <li> Used a blade all my life, so I thought I would try an electric shaver in hopes of saving time in the mornings. Looked at the top of the line Panasonic, Norelco, and Braun.  After much deliberating and review reading, I went with the Braun.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8585 is mechanically very nice and the base/cleaning system works very well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This said, after 2.5 weeks of use with the shaver (the recommended &#x27;break-in time&#x27;), I feel that results are spotty.  Generally it takes some effort and time to get a truly even looking cut.  Even at it&#x27;s best, the appearance is generally that of a second day cut with a Mach 3.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t returned this yet, but I&#x27;m seriously considering it.  $165.00 + the cleaner cartridges is very expensive for a device that doesn&#x27;t provide an all-together great shave every time.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this every day!  He thinks this was money well spent! Would recommend!!!</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning feature is a bit of overkill but it works well. This unit is replacing an earlier Braun shaver that I have had for over eight years. Works even better. Charging/Cleaning station is a bit large and the blue \\&quot;charged\\&quot; light is very bright in the dark and has an annoying flicker once fully charged. Comes with a good travel case although it does not fit the cord which is needed to charge when on the road. Holds a pretty good charge, needed to charge it twice on a recent three week trip. Best electric shaver that I have used.</li>
            <li> Not only does this shaver give a close shave, the cleaning system works really well. I no longer have to clean up fine bits of hair each morning.</li>
            <li> I use three razors. Last year&#x27;s model of this Braun, a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;OK, now, let&#x27;s do some math.  I get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor.  I pay, on average, 40c or so for a disposable razor.  That is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream.  At a nickel a shave, it would take 3000 shaves before I would spend $150.  Would take me over 8 years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor (not even the expensive triple edged ones, just cheap disposables) is dreaming.  The blace does a much better job and much faster.  But, sometimes, they can irritate the skin, but electrics can too.  I can get irritated by both, sooooo, I rotate between them, and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought this Braun (last year&#x27;s model) after reading the positive reviews here, and later bought a rotary razor.  The basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter, shaves just as well, and cost me about 1/3 the price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is better in the Braun is the battery lasts longer.  It is possible also, that in some cases, it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary, but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times I go over them.  The Braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer, like when I have two to three days growth.  The rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning machine/charger that comes with the Braun is a joke.  Yes, it cleans the razor great, but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom.  Even then, say you have that larger space, you can pay between $5.00 and $8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges.  I have found they last about a month before drying out.  Add $60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor.  The rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade.  So I am constantly locking the blade position by accident.  Inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  This razor shaves fine.  It works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors.  But for $50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade.  Does the price difference sound rational to you?  If it does, click \\&quot;Proceed to Order\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My husband switched to this after a Norelco rotary shaver.  He says it gives him a better, closer shave.  He usually got a lot of irritation with the rotary, but not with this one.  The shaver holds its charge well and stays clean with the charger/cleaner system.  He&#x27;s had it almost two years and has had to replace the foil once.  We buy cleaner liquid refills here on Amazon.    -----Update 5/19/11  The shaver still works great, no problems at all.  EXCEPT if you have very good hearing like me, the charger makes a VERY high pitched sound constantly.  It is not very loud.  My husband can&#x27;t hear it.  However, I have to close the door to the bathroom so I can fall asleep at night.  Most people probably wouldn&#x27;t notice, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it.</li>
            <li> Over the past 15-20 years I&#x27;ve had three Braun razors. This 8585 is my most recent and highest end model. I suppose I&#x27;ve had it about 3 years now (1 foil/cutter change and another change due). The prior Braun&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had were middle of the road models and both worked fairly well. In fact, I didn&#x27;t think this razor worked that much better and it had the \\&quot;new\\&quot; foil design which was one of the reasons I purchased it. I initially used the \\&quot;self-cleaning\\&quot; method but after awhile it seemed like a waste so I decided to just hand clean every day (20 seconds).  The self-cleaning does work very well initially, but once it fills up with hair/dirt it doesn&#x27;t clean as effective. Another thing to watch out for is if you don&#x27;t use the self cleaning it will just evaporate. (Kind of like ink in your printer.) So, if you think you can get 3 months out of it doing it every 3-4 days, think again. It won&#x27;t last. The alcohol evaporates.    One big con is this high pitch noise the razor makes. It makes it when charging and it also makes it about every 8 minutes (beep-beep). The \\&quot;every 8 minute\\&quot; beep, which is probably doing a battery check, is quite annoying. Every once in awhile while in my bathroom I would hear a beep-beep. For many years I&#x27;ve heard this and it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I discovered it is the razor. So, a big disappointment. I&#x27;m surprised it got through the Braun QA.      Anyway, it is a decent razor but if you every hear a high pitch noise--check the razor. Every 8 minutes it will make it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend about 4 years ago, and it still works as if it was new, and it shaves very smoothly and comfortably.  People should know, though, that it&#x27;s an ongoing investment.  He replaces the fluid cartridge about 5 times per year.</li>
            <li> First off, I quite using the self-cleaning system when the included fluid ran out. It was pointless and too expensive to buy refills. But I found the shaver itself rather mediocre. It requires running over a patch of skin several times from different angles in order to get all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A razor might be faster and would definitely be less annoying. The only reason I still use this is that I shave frequently enough that busting out shaving cream is too much of a mess/hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: buy something without a self-cleaning system and spend a little more money to get something nicer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over two years.  My interest was in *not* having to clean my shaver - just let the magic box do it.  I tend to have to replace the cleaning solution around every 30 days - I would clean the shaver every day.  I have a slender face and average to heavy beard growth and for me the shaver did an average job.  I noticed I had to go back over some areas and I must have been pressing harder then usual as I would never get 18 months of screen use...more like a year.      The cleaning process is noisy it would have been nice if Braun had a delay start or an automatic timer - but since my Braun coffee maker can&#x27;t keep time on a power loss maybe just a delay start.  If your bathroom attaches to your bedroom and you kick off the cleaning process while the spouse is sleeping plan on an early morning fight as you will surely wake up the better half.    The cleaning unit takes up a lot of space on the counter and the plug for the unit is oddly shaped and sticks out about 6 inches for the wall.  I have knocked it out a few times.  This may be a non issue for some as they have kicked off the cleaning process too early too often and now find themselves shaving in the same place you keep the power tools.    The shaver is not as loud as my Remington - I think the blades may move slower.    The battery seems to have keep it&#x27;s charging power even after two years.      The beard trimmer pops up high enough so you can see what your trimming.    As a side note I also bought one for may dad who has more of a rounder face and he noted this shaver did a better job then his Remington.</li>
            <li> I have used razors as well as the Remington Microscreen, three Norelco rotary shavers (incl. the Quadra) and now the Braun.  And without a doubt the Braun gives me the cleanest, closest shave with the exception of the razor and with NO irritation.  The Norelcos constantly gave me &#x27;shaver burns&#x27; at the base of my neck and the Remington was never &#x27;as close as a blade&#x27;.  And razors would bring rise to rather nasty skin problems even with using aftershave and sterilizing the blades.  Without a doubt I am absolultely happy with my shaver.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried many razors and no manual razor is safe for me.  No electrics have worked without problems.  The norelco razors severly burn and even cut my skin.  I can use other foil shavers such as remington but they take a long time and I can&#x27;t skip one shave or I have to use a blade.  The braun activator actually shaves closer than my razor blade and can handle a skipped shave or two.  It also causes absolutely no rash on my neck.  Nothing else is like this.  I am truly amazed at this one.  I am planning on buying at least one more in case something happens to the one I have and just in case they stop making them.  Electric razor models always seem to come and go over time and nothing is better than this one.  Listen to the warnings other people give on the other razors or you will waste money like I did.  I don&#x27;t know why the funny shaped foil would make such a difference but it sure does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco for years, and I must admit I was pretty nervous about switching from the rotatory style blades. While at first I had mixed feelings about the Braun, it&#x27;s grown on me quite a bit and I&#x27;m quite satisfied. I&#x27;ve had the shaver for four months now, so I believe I can give a good overview of its performance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First off, I hate to shave more than a few times a week and my hair grows thick. With my Norelco, if I shaved daily it left horrible razor burn. If I shaved with some growth, I literally had to use the trimmer on my face first, then the regular blades. The Norelco wasn&#x27;t capable of cutting a few days growth without pulling hard. Neither of these are a problem with the Braun. The Braun does a fairly impressive job with quick shaves and can easily power through 3-4 days growth without a problem. It&#x27;s very comfortable to use with minimal irritation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do, however, have a few issues with the Braun. First, the shave isn&#x27;t exactly as close as others seem to be experiencing. Perhaps it&#x27;s my thick hair, but even after a thorough shave I still have a bit of a shadow on the face. This bugged me at first, but I&#x27;ve got used to it. If you want a completely smooth shave, this may not be good enough. I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is anything I should be blaming on the blade though, and it&#x27;s improved over time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My second complaint is that to get thorough shave on the neck, it will take several passes. At first it may seem impossible, but once you get used to the shaver both growth and usage, it&#x27;ll get easier. It takes a bit more care and effort that it probably should, but the irritation is so much lower (sometimes none) that I honestly don&#x27;t mind. It will get the job done, if given a chance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite these two quite valid complaints, the pros far outweigh the cons for me. The shaver is sleek, effective, and powerful. I love the built in trimmer blade, the way the cord can be plugged into the shaver itself, and especially the self cleaning system. Despite claims of running out quickly and evaporation here on Amazon.com, my experience has been great. With my infrequent shaving, the carts last me well past the 60 days suggested in the instruction manual. I can usually get a good 75 or so days from each cart, and the carts themselves are very cheap.</li>
            <li> For years I used Norelco shavers and became unsatisfied with them when I could no longer get a good clean shave on my neck.  The new Braun is doing much better, although the attached papers indicated it might take a few weeks to adapt to the new shaving heads.  I&#x27;m quite pleased, I get a good clean shave, the machine is easy to clean and maintain, and quiet.  What more could one ask?</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying the Braun 8585 EASILY provides the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  Though it&#x27;s the slogan of another company, honestly the 8585 is the only shaver that&#x27;s ever truly been \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now for the reason(s) I&#x27;ve given it 4 stars rather than 5:   &lt;br /&gt;The razor is loud, and by that I mean LOUD.  It&#x27;s loud when it&#x27;s self cleaning, it&#x27;s louder when it&#x27;s held up to your face.  The second reason, and this might just be me being picky, is the blue led at the base of the razor.  The led is as bright as the razor is loud.  I realize that the blue led&#x27;s are new and high tech seeming, but seriously ... when the razor is in the cleaner / charger unit it also functions as a nightlight... a nightlight that bathes half the room in erie blue light. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all though, the 8585 is an excellent product, LOUD but excellent.</li>
            <li> You know, its not often I can say something is fantastic and I&#x27;m more than pleased. I&#x27;ve had Brauns &amp; Philips only because they&#x27;re made in Europe (for obvious reasons). I prefer German or Japanese products due to their consistent quality and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is phenomenal! It shaves right down to the skin and gets all those pesky off-side ones, too, within a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;You truly get what you pay for many times (not always though) and this razor I got what I paid for. I was considering a Remington Titanium before but something about the concentration on the \\&quot;titanium\\&quot; threw me off. Then the reviews on it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shazer is made in Germany. Not by slave labour workers in some no-name factory, i.e. German quality &amp; precision. It cleans itself perfectly and is self-maintaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, my last Braun lasted for 10 years and was made in Germany. What does that tell you? How many cars last that long without any problems? My 16+ nephew is now using it, maybe it&#x27;ll last another 10 years. Buy Braun or Philips, but this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve had. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Firstly I&#x27;d like to make a comment about razors in general.  They are two main types on the market today, 1. multiple blades (Gillette is well known for that, I think they are up to 5 blades now); and 2. Electric razors, which can be rotary (e.g. Norelco) or foil (e.g. Braun).  Make no mistake about it, a blade razor will ALWAYS shave closer than any electric razor, for the simple reason that the blade(s) can get right on your skin to cut the hair, while electric razor&#x27;s blades are always hidden and can never cut as close.  So if you are looking for a magic electric razor that shaves as close as the blades, STOP, because they don&#x27;t exist, at least not yet.    I got a Norelco a few months back, and this was a welcome change for me as shaving got quicker and less messy, but for some reason, my face never got used to it.  No to mention how it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close, I was getting worse razor burns from the Norelco than my usual blades.   And this was while I used the Nivea lotion that came with the Norelco.  The advertised pull and cut action with the Norelco is a buch of baloney, as I could feel the little stubs on my face no matter how long I shave.  I gradually got irritated by the Norelco but was somewhat reluctant to go back to blades full time as I had gotten too lazy to use them everyday.      The next natural step was to try the foil shavers.  Like a previous reviewer, I opted to pass on the LCD display screen of 8595 and went for the cheaper but otherwise identical 8585 model instead.  It was expensive but well worth the money.  These Germans sure know how to make the gadgets.  I always use the back of my hand to feel my chin after shaving and check how close the shave was, and this was almost as good as my Mach-3 blades and in about half the time, with no messy shaving creams and annoying cuts and burns.  The foil is incredibly slick and glides across your face like Teflon and it usually takes me about 3 to 4 passes on the same area to get a satisfactory shave.  It holds comfortable in your hands, and by virtual of its design, shaves much better than the rotary razors at curvy places around the chin.  It also self-cleans and from the smell of the cleaning solution, I presume it self-disinfects.  The cleaning station is probably too bulky to take on the road but unless you travel for more than 2 weeks, the razor really doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; enough to require any cleaning.  The cleaning can get really loud (much louder than the shaving), but it&#x27;s a minor annoyance to me.    I still enjoy a hot shave with my razor every once a while, but this Braun is definitely my default choice now.  If you can spare the money to buy one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves closer than the Norelco I had previously, but there is still room for improvement.  This is a good shaver, but I will only discuss my complaints: &lt;br /&gt;1) Its noisy. I hesitate to use it or the cleaning feature in the morning when I get up before my wife is awake. &lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t do a good job with the long side-growing hairs around my adam&#x27;s apple. (I have yet to find an electric that does) &lt;br /&gt;3) It rests in its cleaning base pointing to the left and away from the user.  Its quite awkward to remove from its base if you are right handed. &lt;br /&gt;4)  Its expensive and you have to account for an additional $60 per year in cleaning solution if you clean it as recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various rotary and micro-screen shavers by Norelco, Braun, and Remington for nearly twenty years, but the Braun 8585 is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t believe I get such an amazingly close shave with it with absolutely no skiin irritation. Plus, the self-cleaning system work great. It really does feel like a brand new shaver every time I use it. I hope this thing lasts forever, because I cannot imagine ever wanting to use a different shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  It is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Recently I was talking with a friend who has the Braun Syncro 7526.  He seemed very satisfied with it and it sparked my interest in buying one.  I have always been a razor man, except for a short stint with a Phillips 3 blade rotary that I paid way too much for.  I used the Phillips maybe 5 or 6 times and it has been collecting dust for the last 5 years.  I accepted the fact that my facial hair was either just not thick enough or grew to flat to my face for an electric shaver.  I read all the reviews on Amazon prior to buying the Activator and took the plunge.  I opted for the one without the lcd screen as suggested.  Wow!!  This thing works, I mean if you spend the time and use it properly it really works well.  Like some others have said, an electric shaver will never be as perfect as a razor and cream but I&#x27;ll tell you first hand that I am very impressed.  After shaving there&#x27;s a spot just above my adam&#x27;s apple that feels like it would about 5 hour&#x27;s after shaving with a razor but that&#x27;s about it.  The self cleaning system works very well.  I don&#x27;t use it every time because I don&#x27;t think it is nessesary but to each their own.  The fluid it uses is basically the same stuff the barber uses to sanitize his scissors and blades.  Hope it works for you as well as it does for me.</li>
            <li> first off i use this machine to shave my head.  i used a cheap electric shaver before and after 3 weeks my head looked like edward james olmos&#x27; face!  needless to say, i needed a more expensive type.  this machine is great.  it cleans itself, the fluid is not expensive, and my head up until right now is shiny.  it wont get every speck of hair like a disposable.  but its much closer than the barber clippers, and if you use some sort of after shave and/or pre-shave(electric) lotion/solution, you wont be disappointed.  all in all, spend the darn money and get a good...no, great electric shaver like this one.</li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving my head along with my face,it keeps me feeling clean and cool. My standard shaver would sometimes leave my scalp feeling irritated, but the Braun 8585 gives almost as close a shave as a standard razor without the irritation. So I can shave everyday without discomfort. Couldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Cleans, and shaves great.  It travel&#x27;s well. It is a great shaving system.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Given the price of this shaver, I expected a little more than I got. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun promises a much closer, smoother and more efficient shave as a result of the new foil with a \\&quot;revolutionary new pattern\\&quot; resulting in \\&quot;20 different hair capturing opportunities compared to just 1 from a regular foil,\\&quot; and the \\&quot;oscillating movement\\&quot; of the shaver head.  In reality, you get a pretty good shave, but no better than the older Braun I replaced (which didn&#x27;t have these new features).  It also doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertising of capturing more, if not all, hairs on the neck.  I still find myself finishing off these hairs with a razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although the shaver glides smoothly over my face and neck after it has been through a cleaning cycle, it is not so smooth with the next shave.  For a really smooth shave, I have found that I must use the cleaner after every shave, which is not always practical (especially when I&#x27;m out of town). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaner works well.  Just pop the shaver in the cleaner and it goes to work.  I suppose it is worth the few extra bucks each month to purchase the replacement cleaning fluid.  The \\&quot;Smart Logic\\&quot; battery system is also nice, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about when you do and don&#x27;t recharge the battery.  As for the battery life, you will definitely want to recharge it well before 50 minutes or 2 to 3 weeks of cordless shaving (according to Braun&#x27;s claim).  However, the battery life is sufficient and a cord is included for travel, etc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good shaver with an effective cleaning system.  At this price, however, you may want to consider purchasing a less expensive model and clean the shaver yourself.  You&#x27;ll get just as good a shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver is expensive but the system does work.  The first cleaning cartridge lasted over 5 months, using it every 2 to 3 days on average.  No evaporation loss that I could tell.  You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it but I am not sure that is within warrantee, etc.  I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner, so that keep the fluid clean and fresh.  However, when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary.  One thing to note is that you cannot take this on a plane - even if you check luggage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to smells, but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose.  I have a hard face to cut and, as I am getting older, it gets harder to do a good job. This razor is a good compromise.  Safe and close but not as good as a blade.  It does have a problem with longer hairs on my neck.  You need to keep the skin very tight to get a close shave and do it every day.  The battery is very long lasting and I don&#x27;t need to travel with the cord for a 4 or 5 day trip.</li>
            <li> The product works well but the service from the \\&quot;jungle\\&quot; and the owner are second to none.  I hope he has cleaned house as I clean my beard daily.    Thanks DJ</li>
            <li> I bought this 8585 for my husband one month ago and he uses it everyday.  It gives him a good shave and the cleaning system is convenient.  He can always keep the shaver clean while not spending a lot of time cleaning it.  Also Amazon emailed me the $50 certificate on time as promised.   Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun several months ago and last weekend I packed my old Remington 3 head and went hunting. I got a MUCH closer shave with the old razor than I did with this OVERPRICED Braun.    Buying the braun was a BIG MISTAKE!!!     Save your money and buy something else. I wish I knew how to return this overrated piece of junk.    Jack</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, having gone through several Remington and Norelco models. I know Braun makes more expensive units, but I&#x27;m not sure how they could be any better than this one. Clean cut, great feel, nifty cleaner/charging base. Great product!</li>
            <li> Have always had trouble getting a really clean shave with electric razors - especially the neck - especially if I skip shaving for a day or two (which I sometimes do on weekends).  With this razor, no problems at all, the shave is really superior.  It catches hairs other electrics miss.  The self cleaning thing is a little over the top for my taste.  I&#x27;d prefer a less imposing stand with a smaller foodprint and more subtle lights, but hey, it works!  Altogether a terrific upgrade on my old Braun, and in another universe compared to my (very) old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Excellent machine makes the move from a blade easy. I&#x27;m happy to be done with hot water, soap and shaving cream..and those painful late in the day shaves needed to clean up a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A super clean blade shave was great done every other day but sometimes two a day were needed and that was too painful and time consuming. This shaver makes it easy to touch up an evening shadow without hacking up your skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First shave out of the box was great.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver as a gift. It is the first electric shaver that I have used. The first few times that I used it, I felt the shave was not very close. But after a week, it is great. It seems to shave closer than with a razor. Also no cuts. The cleaner also works great, it needs cleaning only after 3 or 4 uses. The only problem I have is the noise. But maybe all electric shavers are a little noisy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college kid - i usually like to have the nicer stuff (hah - talk about conflicts of finance there - college AND big spender - yeah - i work my tail off to afford both! lol) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got a lower end norelco 3 head shaver a year ago - and i liked it - but i saw some newer norelco&#x27;s that had the moisturizer in them - so i told my mom to get that for christmas - well she wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what i meant - so she just went out and got me the nicest shaver they sold at the store! This was TOTALLY unexpected - i was excited - but i was concerned - this one did not have 3 pivoting heads that i had used before - i wasn&#x27;t sure how close i&#x27;d get of a shave.... WOW - leme tell ya - after i decided to use it christmas day - i gota say - i can not believe how smooth my face was - i didn&#x27;t think that was possible without hot wax! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The clean&amp;charge is very cool - and the smell is GREAT. Only complaint i have - is that its a little hard to find replacement clean&amp;charge cartridges locally - i&#x27;ve gone to several stores - and still nothing - i hope to find them at my local kmart - but i&#x27;m not sure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And as a side note - the fact that my face is so smooth - it is actually very appealing to the ladies when i give them a kiss. Very good quality unit here - definately worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve preferred blades for years, as most electrics give me bad razor burn and don&#x27;t do a good job getting the flat whiskers on the bottom of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does a good job getting to all of the whiskers.  It gives me a blade close shave, and after a few weeks of persistant razor burn my face doesn&#x27;t suffer much discomfort.  Williams &#x27;Lectric Shave did help a lot.  At this point it&#x27;s like I have been using a premium blade but get a closer shave with less mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning idea is wonderful.  The cleaning fluid lasts a good amount of time, even with almost every day use.  I like the lemony smell, and the razor does a much better job when it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An earlier reviewer mentioned they picked this razor over the 8985 because it doesn&#x27;t have the nagging LCD.  There are enough lights to communicate with you on this model, so don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re missing anything by choosing the 8585.  Save the difference for some more CCR2 refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One quirk that I picked up on w/ the razor and stand is a faint, very high pitched sound that they make when plugged in.  It&#x27;s similar to the sound that a TV makes when you turn it on.  I could imagine that if somebody had a quiet, \\&quot;echo-y\\&quot; bathroom and sensative ears to these types of noises it might become an annoyance.  Most people won&#x27;t notice the sound at all, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sales Rank on this product is very high, and with good reason.  It does a very respectable job and has many quality features to go with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for over 20 years now.  I started out with the old Remington XLR (the blocky one they made for years), then used a Remington triple foil for 8 years (model TR400).  The foils became difficult to find and the razor&#x27;s battery was going bad, so I figured it was time for a new one.  After much reading, I decided on the Activator 8585.    The razor overall is good, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the old Remington TR400.  The shave is more than adequate, but I find it can&#x27;t shave as close around and under the jaw line like my old Remington.  I can still feel a bit of minor stubble there that I couldn&#x27;t feel with the Remington.  The Braun does dramatically better than that Remington when I get a few days of growth though.  I could never shave with that razor since it couldn&#x27;t handle the longer growth; the Braun just plows right through several days growth with no problem.  The mini cutters in the middle of the foils do the job wonderfully on longer hairs, and that alone makes the Braun a better overall design to my old Remington.    The Braun doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the way the Remington did either.  I never could shave 2 days in a row with the Remington without my face hurting a bit, but it&#x27;s not an issue with the Braun.  Does the trick foil design help?  Personally, I don&#x27;t see it being better than the traditional circular hole design in my Remington; I can&#x27;t comment when compared to the Braun Syncro line since I&#x27;ve never used it.    The battery life is impressive with this razor.  Braun claims 50 minutes run time, and I&#x27;m getting that on my 3rd charge, if not a bit longer.  The cleaning station is also nifty but personally not really necessary.  I would have gladly gotten the razor with out it and saved some money if it were possible.  The &#x27;low battery&#x27; warning light is a nice feature, but I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;two or three shaves\\&quot; that Braun claims after it came on.  I only got one more shave. My guess is Braun assumes 4-5 minutes per shave; I typically take 7-8 minutes to get the closeness I want.  I don&#x27;t use any pre-shave lotions nor powders.  Perhaps if I did it would help get a closer shave in less time.    Will this razor shave as close as a blade, especially the Mach3? I don&#x27;t think so.  But, the shave you&#x27;ll get is about as close as most electrics will get with virtually zero skin irritation.  To me that&#x27;s a good enough trade-off to stick with the razor and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Because my skin is sensitive, shaving with a blade causes a lot of irritation.  So I was forced to go with an electric shaver.  I had been using one of Norelco&#x27;s better shavers in the 8000 series and it did an all right job.  I thought that was the best that an electric razor could do at a reasonable price.    I was wrong.  The Braun 8585 shaves much closer.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, as close as a blade.  I am simply amazed.  It doesn&#x27;t charge as quickly as the Norelco and it is not as easy to clean manually as the Norelco.  But with the Clean and charge unit, these issues are moot.  Of course, there is the extra expense of buying replacement solution for the clean and charge unit.  But this is a minor issue given how good a shave I get.    Money well spent.  Does anyone want a good deal on a top of the line Norelco?    POSTSCRIPT:  As I said above, I am prone to skin irritation if I shave with a blade.  This electric razor does give one a shave comparable to that of a blade, but after a couple of weeks, it began to irritate my skin like a blade.  I got the Norelco 8894 XL when it came out.  It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as this shaver, but my skin does much better.  I just run a couple strokes of a Gilette Fusion razor to clean up a bit of stubble and I&#x27;m good to go.  (See my review of the 8894 XL)  I was really excited about this shaver at first, but it caused problems for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade man since my very first shave over 25 years ago.  I tried an electric shaver once and hated the results, so I stuck with blades despite their rising costs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I saw a couple deals come and go on the Braun 8585 at a \\&quot;hot deals\\&quot; site I frequent, and I finally  bit on the third one.  Wow!  Very impressive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor burned my skin after the first use, but I used it straight out of the box, instead of running it through a cleaning cycle first.  Since the first shave it has been very comfortable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are those who say it shaves as close as a blade and those who say it doesn&#x27;t.  I suppose that depends on many factors. &lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard, but I also don&#x27;t mind spending the extra time with the Braun to get my face smooth.  For me it shaves as close as a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can only reiterate some excellent tips that have already been given: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. To save cleaning fluid, always remove the cleaning cartridge from the unit and recap it tightly.  Also the cleaning fluid is most denatured alcohol, so if you wanted to buy a bottle of that to refill the cartridge it would probably work fine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. Pop the head of the razor off and shake it over your garbage can before you stick it into the cleaner. This will \\&quot;trick\\&quot; the cleaner into Eco mode 99% of the time.  Saves fluid and noise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. The noise is only for a couple of seconds two or three times per 30 minute cleaning cycle, and only in the beginning.  Most of the cleaning cycle seems to be drying time, so the unit is quiet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4. A long time electric razor user warned me to be careful with these ultra-thin foil razors.  The foil head can crack sooner than you&#x27;d expect and you end up cutting your face, so inspect your foil head regularly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5.  Enjoy the Braun 8585, or 8595!!! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is easily the best electric razor there is.  I have super sensitive skin and can use it daily without any irritation.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only negative would be that the cleaning cycle is a bit loud, but after only 3 days im already used to it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you want a really close shave and almost no iritation this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first by all the negative reviews.  I bought it anyways, and this shaver is the best thing I have every gotten.  No  longer does it take numerous strokes to shave, this shaves so close and with very few strokes.  The cleaning unit is loud at times, but whatever it cleans the shaver.  This is a great unit.</li>
            <li> The razor is I think one of the best, my boyfriend really really likes it. I would recommend this product for the men in your life.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great at getting those hairs that lie flat on my neck. No other shaver has done that. You also don&#x27;t need to use the cleaning thing which always runs out of fluid. Just another scam to get to to keep their cash flow coming in. You can plug the cord directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63, so you can bet I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors over the years.  The razor is comfortable to use and gives me a very close shave.  Certainly the closest I&#x27;ve ever had with any electric razor.  Clean-up is neat.  Plop the razor in its holder and a micro-processor determines the level of cleaning.  It whirs and buzzes a few times then dries itself.  The cleaning solution is in its own plastic, throw-away container.  No mess at all.  I would hate to go back to cleaning as usual. &lt;br /&gt;I have no reservations recommending this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric shavers thought the years and none have given me a close shave because my facial hair grows in all different directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought brand after brand of blade and shave cream but no matter what brand I bought, I cut my face several times a month just to get that close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the Braun 8585 WORKS! Not quite as close as a blade but 98% as close.  No more cuts, no more expensive blades! The self cleaning system keeps it working smoothly from shave to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, there are other electric shavers that are cheaper but with those, you get what you pay for; a cheap shave.  The Braun was worth every penny because IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This FORMER blade user is extremely happy and very satsfied with his purchase. You will be too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a rotary electric shaver since I started shaving half a life-time ago.  I always hated shaving, which I why I sometimes skip a day or two.  But with a day or two of extra growth, it was always painful to shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A few years back I tried a screen shaver (don&#x27;t remember the brand), and found that it missed a bunch of hairs, so I stuck with a rotary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But now that I&#x27;ve tried the Braun 8585, I have to say that I love it.  Not only does it not hurt to shave after skipping a couple of days, it actually gives my skin a nice tingly feeling.  And now I shave more often, just because it&#x27;s such a pleasure now.  Plus, it gives a closer shave than the rotary, and in half the time, and it misses no hairs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning feature is a nice bonus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I can think of is that its lights are bright--I have a clear view from the bed into the bathroom, and at night the lights on the shaver are too bright.  The solution is simple, though--I keep it facing toward the wall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace my Norelco.  It shaves much closer than the Norelco, and is very comparable to a blade.  The shape of the head also allows me to shave under my chin, which was next to impossible with the Norelco.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The shaver is fantastic, as most of the reviewers agree.  However, after two months of gentle use, the cleaning stand stopped working.  Braun is telling me to send it to a repair shop but, as luck would have it, I can&#x27;t find my receipt so I can&#x27;t get it repaired under warrantee.  Even if I could find the receipt, I would have to send the stand in at my expense. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver because I felt I would be buying quality.  I am a product designer by profession and I feel that this product is not worth the money, especially in light of their repair policy.  If they were to stand behind their products, I would be fine with this failure, but, as it stands, I regret buying this shaver and I doubt I will purchase anything else from Braun.</li>
            <li> I got mine in 2004 for around $200 and for a year went back to the blade. Now I am back using this activator once more and it works as good as new. It was nice when they made things in germany. Things lasted. Now a days we get flooded with made in china junk that just doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for three weeks now and am 110% satisfied. I was hoping it would be as close as what I had with a razor but was extremely happy to see that it&#x27;s much closer and easier. No fooling around with shaving cream. No fooling around with opening the head and manually cleaning it. It couldn&#x27;t be easier and closer.</li>
            <li> The Braun 8585 is simply the best electric shaver I have ever used. With the newly designed foil, the time and effort to shave has been reduced by 50%. The closeness of my shaves have never been better, but this is still not the foremost reason I recommend the Braun 8585. The razor burn on my neck is nonexistent. This is a first, and I have been using the most exspensive electric shavers for over 10 years. Braun has finally designed an electric shaver with all the features that truly matter and work effectively.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensative face and hard to cut/heavy beard of any person I&#x27;ve ever met. For me to shave every day means tons of blood and a face that feels like a gun shot wound. With that said this shavor is great! I have had it for apx. two weeks and have shaved almost everyday with it, no pain or blood. It took several shaves to get my face use to it but now I&#x27;m getting a almost perfect shave.I still have a few left hairs and slight roughness on my neck but for my beard I think that&#x27;s great.I love the way this thing is self cleaning/charging.I drop it in and go!The razor really does seem brand new everytime you use it.I&#x27;ve used the Norelco with the \\&quot;GOOO\\&quot; before and had to go back to the blade, lousey shave.I never thought I&#x27;d be able to use a dry shavor? read the reviews on here and thought what the heck,glad I did.I can&#x27;t imagine a face that this thing couldn&#x27;t shave?? Since my beard is really bad I get the best results from shaving everyday.But I have gone a couple of days and my beard still doesn&#x27;t look to bad.I also use the Afta pre-shave to help with my thick beard.I know you&#x27;ll like this razor!!!</li>
            <li> Speaking as someone who has been shaving for 20+ years, primarily with blade over electric (Gillette Mach 3 for last few years), I can honestly say the Braun 8585 is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. As we all know traditional razor blade replacement prices have been going through the roof for years, and for guys like me with tough beards the blade itself only gives you about a week or two worth of good shaves. Due to my skin type, I was only able to shave every other day in order to avoid serious skin irritation. Now, with the Braun 8585, I shave every day, no irritation, and as close as I ever got with traditional razors. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about three weeks (what they say is your average adjustment period), but I feel the shaves have been great since day one. It&#x27;s definitely one of the best looking electric razors I&#x27;ve seen, and it&#x27;s self cleaning feature is a great extra. Cleans and recharges at the same time, in the same base. Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the money and I&#x27;ll never go back to blades.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this shaver...i bought the more pricey model a few months ago...i think it is the Braun 8595...no reason to spend the extra money...i bought the 8585 for my weekend home and it does exactly the same job...the 8995 have an lcd display that tell you when to clean but i ignore it anyways...both leave a little hair on the neck but i simply follow with a few strokes of a dry razor after shaving with the braun and all is good...it is a much faster and cleam way to shave...no hair on the countertop...no running out of shaving cream and razors...less irritation...cordless...simply replace the cartridge every few months and you are good to go...i do not clean every time i use it...a little noisy, so i clean in the morning...the cleaning cycle takes about 30 minutes...buy it...you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> After thirty years, and five Norelco electric razors, I decided to live on the edge and try something new.  This razor gives a much better shave than I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver.  While I don&#x27;t believe that any electric will come quite as close as a blade, this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now in regard to some of the negatives I&#x27;ve read in the other reviews, I have not experienced any of those problems.  The razor is no louder than my last Norelco.  The build quality appears very good, with exception to the plastic travel case. The auto cleaning works wonderfully.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for ten weeks, using the auto clean every day, and the original cleaning cartridge is not empty yet.  I expect I&#x27;ll use three or four of the disposable cleaning cartridge per year, but for about a nickel per day a clean, sterile, and just plain good smelling razor is a bargain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suppose I wouldn&#x27;t have any credibility here if I didn&#x27;t have a couple minor negatives to report.  First, the cleaning/charging base is a bit larger than I expected.  Next the wall plug is big and sticks out further than I would have liked. And finally, the cleaning cycle does make a bit of noise as the razor cleans and flushes itself. These a very minor complaints. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not have taken the time to write this review if I hadn&#x27;t been exceptionally pleased with the performance of this product.  Thanks for reading! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It is expensive. However, I like it very much. I find it gives nice close shaves. I like the self-cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> I had owned the previous version of this razor and was very happy with it. The 8585 has a number of small improvements that make it even better--thing like a hardsided travel case, easier to read pedestal stand, etc. And, it still gives an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> It seems to be everything I hoped for in a shaving instrument.</li>
            <li> I gave up on electric shavers years ago. Then, after reading a review of the Braun Activator, I decided to chance it. WOW! Glad I did. I had it 2 weeks when it began to buzz loudly. I emailed Amazon yesterday, they emailed me today that I would have a brand new replacement shaver delivered tomorrow! That is incredible service!!! The only reason I did not give the razor a 5 Star rating is because I have had to have it replaced. But performance alone, for me, definitely a 5 Star. Also, the cleaning system means every morning I shave with a brand new razor as it cleans it meticulously well. I LOVE this razor. Braun just better not stop making it.</li>
            <li> The last time I used an electric razor was 20 years ago. It was a Philishave Triple Head and it left ingrown whiskers, burned my face and the batteries just didn&#x27;t last. I was getting tired of paying the high price for Mach 3 blades and yes I fell for the Fusion which worked beautifully but the blades require a finance plan.I decided to try an electric again. After reading all the ratings I decided to go for the Braun. When you first open up the package you can tell you are working with a company that takes it&#x27;s product seriously.All the parts are well made and the shaver is a work of art.As well the shave is very close and very quick. I am converted.No more shaving cream and I think I will by another cheaper Braun  for travelling as I don&#x27;t want to damage this jewel.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my scoop.  I have had a number of different shavers over the past 25 years.  I used to prefer Norelco rotary shavers until I found this Braun 8585 shaver.  First of all and most importantly it gives a great, clean, close and comfortable shave.  Second it&#x27;s easy to maintain.  Just pop it in to the base, press one button and all the cleaning is done for you.  Replacement cleaning cartridges are needed every two months or so but they&#x27;re well worth the price for a shaver that is clean and causes no (and I mean no) irritation.  Third it can be used either with the cord or without the power cord.  The sideburn trimmer, contrary to other reviews, is actually very easy to use.  The lockable pivoting head puts the cutter block and foil directly where they need to be for the best shave possible.  The 8595 shaver has an LED display which indicates the charge level, but honestly this seemed somewhat superfluous since most guys don&#x27;t shave for hours on end without putting the shaver back into the recharging unit and even if you did go for hours on end you could still use the power cord.  So if you want the best shaver and the best shave possible, go with the 8585 Braun Activator shaver!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband. He hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn. It is even as close a shave as if he used a razor! I saw it on the Consumers Number One pick for foil shavers and I am glad I went with their reccomendation!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  I get a great shave quickly and comfortably.  For my face, Braun has the best blade technology of anyone.  I was very skeptical about the self-cleaning aspect and, in fact, it is the reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5.  I like the idea but I don&#x27;t like the cleaning fluid they provide.  I have no idea what it is made of (smells like a petroleum product) and I&#x27;m not keen on the idea of putting anything on my skin that I wouldn&#x27;t put inside my body.  After all, our skin is our largest organ and it does absorb.  I also don&#x27;t like the idea of throwing those cleaning cartridges in a landfill over and over again.  So, I&#x27;ve decided to create my own cleaning fluid using all natural, organic ingredients and just refill the original cartridge when needed.  Overall, I am happy with the razor and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending this much for a shaver, but I have been sufficiently unhappy with previous cheaper shavers that I took the plunge. Let me just say, I LOVE this shaver. It is fast, very comfortable and gives a GREAT shave. I plan on buying a second one for my vacation home, I like it that much.</li>
            <li> Hey folks, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got to tell you, I recieved this shaver for X-mas from my girlfriend, and it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it everyday, have had electric shavers in the past, most notably the Remington, but never experienced a shaver with the power or ability to cut as close as this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about a great shaver, this is it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This was my first foil razor in years, I basically decided to get it based on the strength of the reviews here, as my old Norelco rotary shaver was giving up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like my first foil shaver (a Remington) because the foil design made it hard to get all the hairs shaved, especially if I went for a couple days without shaving.  All the extra passes it took trying to get everything into the foil holes would also cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver, however, has a more complicated foil design.  Rather than being a simple mesh of circular holes, this foil has holes and slots in a pattern that basically gives a lot more ways for a hair to enter the foil and get cut.  I still wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; but in my experience, no electric is.  However, it&#x27;s certainly as close as my Norelco was, just as fast, just as easy and the cleaning/charging system is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that the razor can be plugged in and recharged directly so if I take a trip, I don&#x27;t have to take the base and cleaning stuff with me, just the razor and the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came down to this or getting a new Norelco Advantage, which I also liked.  In terms of comfort, the Norelco Advantage has a bit of an edge because I did like the integrated gel dispenser, in terms of a close, quick shave I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re about even but the Braun self-cleaning system is quite nice, using a lightly scented alcohol solution to give the razor a good cleaning between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;2 year update -- I still use it and like it.  No problems either with the shaver or the cleaner.  I&#x27;ve replaced the head and the blades once (seemed like the thing to do, not because they were broken or anything) and still use it daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver the beginning of Dec 2004 and am quite pleased with using the shaver but I did have a major problem with the cleaning stand that required a warantee repair/replacement of the cleaning stand just 6 months after my purchase. Yes it did give me a very close shave with less strokes and less irritation then other electric shavers I had though its not exactly as close as you can get with a blade. I do have problems in the neck area getting a close shave as others mentioned but I always had to work harder with that area with any shaver I used. I have a slim/thin neck area with a lot of steep angles that&#x27;s hard to shave. If you have a more round neck area with less angles you probably not have the same problem. I could get a slightly closer shave using a blade though I would also have more irritation to get that closer shave, so there is a trade off. The shave I get from this razor is good enough and without the irritation so I am satisfied.  &lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is to NEVER try to clean this razor or inside cleaning stand with WATER.  Only use the cleaning brush they provide or a towel because it could damage the razor.  I also wouldn&#x27;t try to use a different cleaning fluid as other said they did to avoid having to buy the replacement cartridges because it could easily damage this razor and the cleaning stand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the cleaning stand, the pump suddenly wouldn&#x27;t pump the cleaning fluid into the unit with enough pressure to clean properly after just 6 months. Since it was under warrantee, I brought it to one of the Braun authorized repair shops in my area for repair instead of mailing it directly to Braun and I had a horror story trying to get it repaired! The repair shop said it could take about 2 weeks or so to get repaired. Well after 3 weeks I called the repair shop and they said the unit could not be repaired and he already order a new cleaning stand unit over a week ago and he was still waiting for it to come in. I called up Braun customer service and they said they have to give the repair shop 30 days to fix the item before they will even look into it further.  Well after 30 days the repair shop still didn&#x27;t get the replacement unit and I called Braun customer service again. The Braun customer service rep. went back and fourth calling the repair shop a few times until the Braun Customer Service Representative finally decided to order another cleaning stand for me and mail it directly to me which they said would take another 7 to 10 business days and not to bother calling the authorized repair shop anymore.  10 business days later I called Braun customer service to check on the status and they told me the replacement cleaning stand is now on BACKORDER with no estimated time of delivery and nothing could be done to expedite it and they could not offer me any other assistance.  Well 2 days later the replacement cleaning stand finally arrived which goes to show the Braun customer service rep had no clue what was going on with my replacement order.  This whole experience shows how much of a hassle you might have if you need to have this Braun razor repaired under warrantee.  I actually called Braun customer service again and asked them if I could of had better or faster repair service if I mailed the part directly to Braun instead of taking it to the authorized Braun repair shop. They told me it would of taken at least a week longer if I mailed it directly to Braun because after they receive the item in the mail they automatically mail it to another location to get it repaired which takes at least week or more.  I am happy with this razor but good luck if you need warrantee work. I also have some concerns with the quality of the cleaning stand because  it broke so quickly and if I will have the same problem with it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my old Norelco shaver for the past 5 years.  I didn&#x27;t like it because my skin on my face would get irritated after every shave that I literally would go on for several days in between each shave.  It also did not shave as close as I would like.  To keep the blade decent, I had to clean it on regular basis and it too was a hassle.  My wife just bought me the 8585 shaver for a Father&#x27;s day gift.  I was skeptical at first and the price was a bit higher than what I would like to spend.  But after my first and second shave with it, the only word I can truly express is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;.  This shaver is excellent.  It shaved as close as a blade with no irritation.  I read of some reviewers complaint of not able to get a close shave around the base of the neck area.  I found that by merely turning the shaver to angle it, I was able to shave the base of the neck area just fine.  The self cleaning system is great.  I no longer have to worry about taking the shaver apart to clean it.</li>
            <li> I got this unit from Amazon in early July. I opened the box, connected the charger to a regular outlet. It just exploded after 2 minutes charging and left a big black mark on the outlet. I am returning it and don&#x27;t expect any problem from Amazon. Anybody else had the same problem?</li>
            <li> A great shave, and self cleaning.  Just what I wanted in an electric razor.  I&#x27;ve had Braun&#x27;s before, so I know they&#x27;re reliable, too.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver kit in November 2004 (it&#x27;s now August 2005), and while the shaver has always performed quite nicely once I got used to it (I previously shaved with blades), the cleaning unit has always been kind of a pain.  It&#x27;s rather noisy to begin with, although that may be almost inevitable.  Second, the &#x27;three cleaning programs&#x27; that are advertised are all automatic--it chooses which one it thinks needs to be done, and the &#x27;intensive&#x27; cleaning uses up a *lot* of fluid.  The fluid cartridges have lasted me about six to eight weeks each, and I clean the shaver almost every day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The unfortunate thing is that now the cleaning unit has now ceased to clean, although it still charges the shaver.  It started making funnier and funnier noises (different from the normal buzzing noise cycle it goes through) over the last few weeks and finally it just stuck in one particular noise for a long time (more than 20 minutes), and I finally shut it off.  It was full of hair clippings and cleaning fluid, and once I wiped it out and tried to restart it, nothing happens.  Nothing.  So now I have a nice charging stand, but no cleaning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, nice shaver, but unfortunately flimsy and cheap cleaning unit.  Therefore... three stars from me.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I have used the 8585 for over a month now.  I have a heavy beard and have owned Braun&#x27;s 4000 and 7000 series shavers.  I find the 8585 the best shavers I have used so far.  The shave is closer and requires relatively fewer strokes across my face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver is lighter than the 7000 series and a bit narrower.  It is easy to hold and maneuver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I like best: &lt;br /&gt;     - by using the base unit which holds the razor, the razor is always at peak battery potential which means you get the best power possible out of the razor &lt;br /&gt;     - similarly, the cleaning system keeps the razor free of beard stubble which means there is no/little if any beard stubble that falls into the sink that I have to clean up, and the cutting edge remains as sharp as possible &lt;br /&gt;     - the self-cleaning system is very easy to use.  In the descriptions of other reviews it was never really clear how it could work. Yes, the system determines somehow the level of stubble build-up automatically, and yes, sometimes I wonder how accurate it is but the real value is that this monitoring function is just that.  The system does not initiate its own cleaning.  The user does which means that I don&#x27;t have to clean the razor everyday.  I activiate the cleaning cycle via the push button on the base once every other day.  That means I will only need six cleaning cartridges per year, not 12 if you cleaned everyday.  I find cleaning every other day is perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I do not like: &lt;br /&gt;     - Just as the manual states, the cleaning function does not work efficiently if you use a preshave.  I had been using a preshave.  The cleaning system was not able to do a thorough job cleaning.  Of course, I did not understand why until I read the manual.  So I stopped using a preshave and it took a week or so for me to get used to not using a preshave and now I am content without. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I disagree with: &lt;br /&gt;     - the manual says it is strongly recommended that you shave prior to showering or washing your face.  I totally disagree.  I have tried not washing with soap and hand towel and my shave was awful.  I shower and wash my face prior to shaving.  I make sure I wait a few seconds to make sure my face is dry after using a towel.</li>
            <li> I have been using a blade razor since I started shaving at 16 some 25 years ago. I had always heard electric razors burn your face and don&#x27;t give a decent shave no matter the brand or type of electric razor you used.  This may or may not be true of past electric razors, but I&#x27;m hear to tell you this Braun Activator 8585 is one fantastic razor. Now I&#x27;m not going to say the shave is as close as my old Mach 3 is, but it is pretty darn close.  I have found that my face is actually less irritated with the Braun than when shaving with a blade, all with out having to clean up the shaving gel and stubble from the bathroom sink.  I can honestly say I will not be returning to a razor blade again.  I am officially a Braun 8585 Activator man!</li>
            <li> Bought the shaver for myself as a Christmas present and love it.  One of the reasons I was willing to spend the money was the $50 Amazon coupon that was promised with the unit.  (...on any Braun purchase of at least $129, I believe...)   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With all the holiday rush, I may have missed something, but it didn&#x27;t come in the box, and is no longer on the site.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does anyone have any additional info on this offer? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The Braun 8585, after extensive shaver research, was one of the few items I listed on my Christmas wish list.  Being completely new to electric shaving, I relied upon consumer reviews and product web-sites.  After using the Braun 8585 for almost two weeks, all I can say is WOW!  This is an amazing machine.  It took me two or so days to figure out how to manuver the shaver over my face to get my optimal shave. I experience zero irritation and the shave is fantastic.  It is not 100% as close as a blade, but it is 95% as close.  Given no irritation anywhere on my face and neck, the 5% differential is just fine.  I find that I do have to shave every day or every other day to get an excellent, easy shave.  If I wait longer than two days, it&#x27;s a bit more work and takes a few minutes longer, but the results come through.  NOTE:  I do shave before taking a shower as Braun recommends.  Taking a shower before shaving may soften the facial hair, but it also causes the skin to swell a bit.  Shaving before showering completely works for me.  The other aspect of this product that sends it soaring is the the self-cleaning system.  Works flawlessly!!  No mess and comes out perfectly clean.  I have zero complaints about the Braun 8585.  The cleaning system is a little noisy, but in no way irritating (step out of the bathroom and close the door!!).  The blue charging light isn&#x27;t that bright (as some others have complained...come on, really now...what kind of complaint is that anyway?)  The cleaning system emits only a very faint (i.e., you have to literally put your nose to the system in order to detect a smell) odor of alcohol when the shaver is being cleaned.  I have experienced none of the problems the negative reviews on this product list.  The machine works excellently in all regards.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this razor.  Nice engineering, a clean comfortable shave, not too loud.  Unfortunately, it just missed too many little hairs.  I don&#x27;t think my beard is any thicker than normal, but some of the hairs can curl under a little especially on my neck.  Despite the nifty screen design, the razor just couldn&#x27;t pick them all up no matter how many times I went over the darn things. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my advice: If you&#x27;ve had good luck with other electric razors and can afford the price tag, go ahead and buy it, you probably won&#x27;t be disappointed.  However, if you&#x27;ve had trouble with other electrics missing individual hairs, then you may want to stick with a blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got pretty sensitive skin and get razor burn very easily (thus my decision to stop shaving with blades), but the Braun Activator 8585 has been great to my skin.  My old Remington Microscreen would routinely cause razor burn on my upper lip, neck, and chin, even when I used a shaving powder.  The Braun Activator 8585 has yet to do so.  Even when my skin is inflamed for another reason (sunburn, winter dryness), shaving with the Braun is nowhere near as painful as it was with the Remington.      In addition, it provides a closer shave than the Remingtons I have owned in the past (not as close as you would get with a blade, however).      One tip--I run the cleaning cycle after every use, but I make sure to clean out most of the gunk in the shaver by popping the shaver screen and running it for a short time, as per the procedure in the manual.  As a result, most of the time the shaver uses the \\&quot;eco\\&quot; cleaning mode, which makes the cleaning cartridge last longer (I&#x27;m still on my first one after a month and a half, and it still reads \\&quot;full\\&quot;).      I&#x27;ve only had the Braun since Christmas, so I can&#x27;t speak to its long-term durability.  Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was more than pleased after receiving this product. I have never used a razor that worked as well as this one. It&#x27;s hard to believe just how well this product works, it&#x27;s absolutely incredible. I want to thank the person who wrote in his review about being able to use the razor without the docking station, it was realy important to me to be able to use and charge the razor with only the cord yet this was never mentioned in all the literature advertising the product from the company. After reading the customer review on Amazon.com I decided to buy. If I hadn&#x27;t found this out I may never have bought this product. By the way, the docking/cleaning station works great also.</li>
            <li> I hated the product and amazon doesn&#x27;t take it back as they say it contains alcohol and so it can&#x27;t be shipped back to them. They had asked me to call the manufacturer for a refund.  &lt;br /&gt;My question to Amazon is \\&quot;Why/How did sell if it was dangerous.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had a full beard and mustache for most of the last 25 years, because I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the corresponding cuts, irritation, and discomfort caused by shaving with a blade. As my facial hair became whiter and whiter, I did a little research on electric razors and decided to try the Braun 8585 because of its features and feedback from other users. No doubt about it, I get just as close a shave with the 8585 as with a blade, with zero irritation. Also, suprisingly, it didn&#x27;t take my skin any time to adjust to an electric razor. As far as the cost of the cleaning solution, for the comfort you receive with this product, it&#x27;s more than worth it. I wish I had found this shaving system years ago; Friends tell me I look much younger now without the facial hair.</li>
            <li> Of all the electric shaver I have used over the last 20 years or so this is by far the best one.  The way the head pivots gets all of the hair usually on the first pass, hard to reach spots on the second.  No annoying stubble bits that have been shaved falling out of the head or left on your face.  The cleaning system is amazing and works like a champ.  Do the math, look at all the razors you would buy if you wanted a great close shave, add up the cost and then you will see that this thing is a steal.  Without a doubt the best!</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about a month now and I still need to go back to my normal razor.  It just does not shave close enough.  It&#x27;s good if your traveling and need to shave quickly, but I do not see it replacing the standard razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my husband last year for Christmas.  He swore nothing would compare to his infamous Schick Quattro Disposable Razor. The downside, terrible in-grown hairs every week, ugh and 15 minutes to shave.  Although he fought with me every step of the way,  he finaly caved and tried it.  After a few days he was hooked!  He gets a super-close shave in half the time and the *huge* bonus, no more ingrown hairs.  If you hae sensitive skin or know someone who does, this is the model for them.  The self-cleaning option is wonderful and a big key to the success.  I highly recommend this model, so much so, I picked one up for my father-in-law this Christmas.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver less then 3 years ago and it just plain quit on me. Got hot during charging and motor wouldn&#x27;t run at all. Took it to a recommended Braun repair person and he said the motor was burned out and not worth repairing. I paid over $150.00 for this junker and Braun gives no way to contact them on their WEB site. Have 2 much older (non-cleaning) Braun shavers and both work just fine. Repair person said this might have something to do with the wet cleaning used for this shaver....I wouldn&#x27;t get another Braun like this if it was free.....</li>
            <li> I brought this shaver as a gift for my father.  His old one was well...old.  It didn&#x27;t shave closely and he looked kinda unshaven even when he did.  We just thought that was normal, but after he started using this shaver boy did he look different.  His cheeks were softer too.  My mom was happy too, so I&#x27;ve said all that to say, he seemed really pleased with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner is a great part of it too.  Just don&#x27;t go yanking the thing around, it doesn&#x27;t work the way you would think it does.  Think of the cleaner like a dishwasher, you wouldn&#x27;t open the dishwasher while it was on so don&#x27;t take the shaver out of the cleaner while it&#x27;s cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing:  The cleaner is loud.  So if you want to scare someone silly don&#x27;t tell them about it and watch them jump out of their skin.</li>
            <li> The razor isn&#x27;t bad, but the cleaning system is a joke.  Mine wouldn&#x27;t release the razor &amp; kept recleaning it.  Plus, and I am surprised that this isn&#x27;t mentioned in the other reviews that I read before getting the razor, the cleaning solution (which is an expensive, printer-ink type of gimmick) stinks like metal solvent.  Bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price.</li>
            <li> My spouse has had a braun in the past and had looked for a replacement when his finally didn&#x27;t  work anymore.  He was trying to find a  self cleaning one and was unsuccesful.  I went  on-line  and found what he wanted and he was very happy</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son and he loves it thanks it was every thing  he wanted</li>
            <li> My first electric razor, 30 years ago, was a Norelco. It always left my neck red and irritated. So I used a blade all these years. However recently blades have been hard on my face as I&#x27;ve gotten older. So I decided to give this razor a try after reading so many good reviews of it. I have to say I was a bit concerned that in the literature it says your face may have to \\&quot;Get used to the razor\\&quot;. Meaning a little discomfort at first. Well I remembered the discomfort of my Norelco and thought what could be worse than that. Anyway, I have had no discomfort at all using this razor. I&#x27;v been using it since Christmas day 2004. Every day. My face loves it and it&#x27;s every bit as close as any blade razor I&#x27;ve used. And no facial discomfort of any kind. The cleaning base is great as it keeps the blades and foil nice and clean. It came with a brush and carrying case for when I travel and the cord can plug directly into the razor when on travel so the razor can be charged without the cleaning base.  I completely recommend this razor.  Update 12/8/05: Still using this razor nearly a year later. Still cutting as close as it did a year ago. I&#x27;ve travelled with it and it&#x27;s nice the cord can plug directly into the shaver to charge the shaver. Braun recommends changing the cutter head and foil every 18 months so it will be interesting to see how this is shaving in June. Stand by.  Update: 3/20/06. Well I finally replaced the cutter head and foil this month. So I got about 15 months out of mine. Not too bad I think. Not the 18 months suggested, but close enough. That will really depend on frequency of use, coarseness of beard, how often cleaning cycles are used, etc....</li>
            <li> I have used a number of different electric razors and this is the best. The charger cleaner is a great idea but stock up on the refills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with cheaper Braun electric models for years, and when my previous one died, I decided to shell out the extra money to try their nicer model.  After all, I shave every day, so an extra $100 to improve that experience for the next 5 years or so should be worth it, right?  My answer is, probably yes, for most of us. &lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of raves in the reviews here that might lead one to believe this shaver can give you a perfect shave while doing your taxes and improving your love life.  I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s not *quite* that good.  The area in the hollow of my neck that I could never shave with the cheaper Braun electrics still can&#x27;t be shaved with the expensive Braun electric; I still need to break out a blade to finish up.  Nevertheless, a couple weeks&#x27; use of the 8585 razor has convinced me that the extra cost over less expensive Braun electric shavers is worth it to me.  The foil irritates my skin less than my previous razors did.  I seem to be able to shave in a few fewer swipes than I did before.  The charging/cleaning stand removes the effort from those two little tasks, at the cost of needing cleaning fluid refills every so often.  The stand also eats up a fair amount of space and an electric outlet in the bathroom.  It is possible, though, to ignore the stand and use the razor just like you would use a normal model.  The shaver comes with a nifty plastic travel case which I found a nice touch - it keeps my shaver from dropping whiskers all over everything in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it is the best electric shaver I have owned or ever used, in my life.  It will shave you almost as close as a blade razor, without missing spots, and when done, it will clean itself.  Whats not to love?  Very fine product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never considered using an electric shaving machine like this b/c of my need to have a close shave. The Braun 8585 nailed it! I&#x27;d recommend this item to any man who wants a close shave without the nicks.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this product are numerous and thorough, so I&#x27;ll try not to repeat what has already been said well.  I tried an electric shaver for the first time 7 years ago and quickly went back to a blade.  Then my wife bought me one 2 years ago and it worked reasonably well for a time, but cleaning was a hassle, and since the hairs on my neck somehow grow at crazy angles I could never seem to do a great job on them.  Also, I started having a problem with ingrown hairs on my face.  I searched Amazon and found the  Braun 8585 and decided to invest in it.  So far it has been well worth it; it&#x27;s doing a much better job in just 2 days than my old, cheaper shaver ever did.  It is excellent to have a shaver that cleans itself, and I hope that it continues working well for years to come.  To me, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price, even with the cleaning cartridges and replacing the foil and cutter block periodically.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard, so I was looking for something that would be preferable to the pain and mess of a wet shave, but be as close and effective.  Unfortunately, like every other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried, this is not it.  It does an admirable job, I suppose on \\&quot;average\\&quot; beards, or for midday touch ups.  But, for me, it&#x27;s pretty useless and the fact that it comes with so many parts and maintenance requirements, I wish I hadn&#x27;t made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I should preface the negative sounding title of this review by saying that I have a lot of respect for this Braun product, and I think there are many good things about. The pivoting head is great, and I really like the cleaning station. Here are some things I think people should consider before buying this product: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor requires some replacement parts in addition to your outright purchase cost. The foil and blade are supposed to be replaced at least every 18 months (more frequently, if necessary). That will set you back around $35. The cleaning fluid sells for around $10 for a replacement (I found a three-pack on Amazon for around $13), and one cartridge will only last you between 1-2 months. If you read the above overview written by Amazon, you will see that cleaning less frequently doesn&#x27;t necessarily help you save cleaning fluid, as more intensive cleaning cycles are just repetitions of the lesser cycles. I should also mention that I had to buy the cleaning fluid online because I could not find it stocked in ANY store...and I tried several (including two Walgreens stores which advertise that they carry the replacement products!). Do the math and find out whether it is worth it to you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I, too, bought this razor to streamline my morning routine. It hasn&#x27;t. Though this razor performs admirably on the face (I wear a goatee, so I can&#x27;t comment on upper lip and chin performance), it does quite poorly on my neck. Some of the hairs on my neck are either too thick to pass through the foil, or grows at any angle that the \\&quot;smart\\&quot; foil doesn&#x27;t catch, and I have to make several (several!) passes to get a mediocre shave on my neck. I have also recently started using a pre-shave to get a better shave. It helps, but it is one additional step to my routine. I find that I spend another five minutes shaving in the morning by using this razor than I did with a wet shave to get a worse result. I sometimes also have to shave twice a day if I want a somewhat clean look in the evening. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The long hair (sideburn trimmer) is likely the most useless feature of this razor. I initially tried to use it to cut the thick hairs on my neck that the razor didn&#x27;t catch, but it couldn&#x27;t do that. The blade simple doesn&#x27;t get close enough to the skin. It also doesn&#x27;t do the job I demand on my sideburns, so I still continue to use a Remington beard trimmer to groom my goatee and sideburns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun tells you directly that it takes a few weeks for your beard to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; to the razor. I found that it took longer than that (in some ways, it never has). I often wonder whether they suggest that waiting period to give you more time to forget what a good shave looks like! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will not deny that this is the best electric razor I have tried. It may work wonderfully for some people with a different beard type and neck angles than mine, but I am not sure it was worth the $145 I paid last November.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever electric shaving system, and i am totally hooked to it. I have been using it for just over a couple of weeks and trust me, this thing is as good as your gillette minus the nicks and cuts and dry skin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Couple of things though. It takes atleast 5 or 6 shaves before the hair, kind of, gets used to the shaver. The first time I shaved, I thought that I&#x27;d wasted money on it. Not true, this is the best. Another thing about the noise that it makes when cleaning, and people seem to complain about it. It is not too much, completely bearable. Buy it, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my 2 cents (take it or leave it):  I am looking for a good, quick shave in the morning provided by a reliable and low maintenance razor (call me crazy).  I bought the Braun 8585 about 6 months ago and have little good to say.  I understand the majority of reviews are positive and this is my personal experience.  This shaver is extremely heavy - it is difficult to manipulate and use during shaving.  This shaver is bulky and does not fit well on my sink counter (I have a double sink counter) and I especially have to manipulate the base unit and power cord constantly.  This shaver also requires regular replacement of the cleaning cartridges and cutter and foil unit (mine lasted only 6 or 7 months and I do not have a heavy beard).  I understand that companies make their money by selling consumers \\&quot;solutions\\&quot; (i.e. I&#x27;ll give you the disposable razor or printer for free - you just have to buy replacement blades and ink cartridges forever) but the cost involved in replacement items for the 8585 is not negligible.  In addition, to get even a mediocre shave with this razor, I have to pull and stretch skin on my face throughout the shave.  For me, this razor is not what I am looking for in regards to this activity in my life.  If the shave was amazing or even very good, I would probably indulge these inconveniences, but the shave is nothing to write home about.  My old stand-by Norelco will make a return appearance this week.</li>
            <li> The Braun 8585 Activator is one of the best shavers I have ever used. It has a self cleaning system where you just place the shaver on the stand and connect that to the power outlet. After that, hit the cleaning button and self cleaning has BEGUN for about 45 minutes. Never EVER worry about cleaning this shaver yourself b/c it does it all for you. The LCD display shows how much power you have and how clean the shaver is. You can even connect the power directly to the shaver and use it. The shaver comes with a plastic case for storage and a small brush to clean. 5/5 stars and I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> Super product - does an excellent job.  Is very convenient.  Have been a blade shaver for years - but this really does a better job</li>
            <li> Braun 8585 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving System  Bought this Shaver for a Christmas Gift.  My husband says:  Best electric shaver he ever had better than Norelco or Remington has owned both.  Comes with a nice travel case could be bit bigger.  Gives a close and comfortable shave.   Overall a great shaver.  [[ASIN:B0002MQ9GA Braun 8585 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving System]]  I would recommend this shaver as a self purchase or gift.</li>
            <li> After going through 3 Norelco units in as many years, I switched to this foil shaver in 2008.  It was a fantastic shift.  The shaver is just now wearing out (as opposed the 6 months I got from Norelco and a pack of excuses from the factory).  Just purchased a Series 7 790 today and can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> My dad bought this for me for college graduation.  That was 9 years ago.  The thing still works like new thanks to the cleaning station.  I&#x27;ve only found 2 CVS&#x27;s near me that sell the cleaning refills, but other than that absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is my second Activator shaving system; I had one of the original models and it didn&#x27;t survive a 1,000 mile move, so I purchased this one last year.  I&#x27;ve tried many high end electric shavers over the years, and I&#x27;ve found that none of them work nearly as well as Braun shavers, and this one is no exception.  The self cleaning system is really nice, and it does do a good job of cleaning the razor provided you use it daily.  A refill lasts about a month for me, with daily use.  You can buy 12-packs of the refills here on Amazon, so I only worry about it once a year.  I find that I have to replace the foil and blade yearly as well... so in January I buy it all in one shot and forget about it until next year.  I&#x27;ve been looking for an excuse to upgrade to one of the new models, but the thing works so well and hasn&#x27;t had any issues, so I really can&#x27;t find one!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver over a year ago from Amazon. It was the most expensive shaver I&#x27;ve ever purchased so I was a little worried about whether or not it would be a good buy. I was immediately happy with the shaver. It takes a few days for your face to get used to any new shaver, and this was no different. After the initial \\&quot;getting to know you\\&quot; phase, I had great shaves every morning. This has been hard for me in the past because I have thick facial hair and electric shavers tend to have a problem with that. Not this one. Every morning when I pick it up to use it, I feel like I&#x27;m using a new shaver. It smells great and cuts great every single time. I wanted to wait a year before I reviewed the product because I wanted to make sure I was still loving it, and I am. The only downside is that you have to buy those replacement cleaning cartridges. I have gone through probably 5 or 6 refills this last year. I use the cleaning feature every morning, and when I leave town for a week I don&#x27;t cover the cartridge back up (which I read that you can do). I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle. I am just today purchasing my first foil/blade refill and that is around $30, and I would guess I&#x27;ve spent about $25 on cleaning refills. So, in a year, I&#x27;ve spent about $55 on maintenance of the thing. I feel like this is worth it considering the quality of the shave and the durability of the product. If you&#x27;ve used electric shavers as long as I have you know that after about a year the battery wears down, there are parts of the shaver that you can&#x27;t get clean, and the cutting power is decreased. I have not noticed any of those issues after year one with this shaver. I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that Braun makes the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve stuck with them for more than 15 years. When the battery on my 5614 stopped holding a charge I decided to upgrade to the 8585. It is much better than the 5614 for getting tough areas along the sides of the neck and base of the jaw. In fact, there is really no comparison between the 5000 series and the 8000 series. The 8585 blows everything else away... it really is worth the extra money. Don&#x27;t be cheap, upgrade. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new micro screen&#x27;s shape really does pick-up more hair in less strokes. Combined with the side-to-side vibration that really does cut down on razor burn. While it&#x27;s not quite as good as an old fashioned blade it&#x27;s much better than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used. The only difference between the 8595 and this one is the battery indicator display. It shows the power status and tells you when it needs cleaning. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra money for that. They share the same micro screen, cutter, and other features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple hints for maximum performance: The clean and charge refills are very expensive. If you only use that feature once a week you can maintain high performance with much less cost. In between, simply remove the micro screen and blow the hairs off the blades each time. Just takes a second. If you gently drop the micro screen an inch or two onto a hard surface like the sink it will jar loose any hairs stuck therein. You shouldn&#x27;t need to recharge the battery more than once a week anyway.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband, a no-nonsense kinda guy, who really likes that clean fresh shave from using the self-cleaning unit.  It also shaves a lot quicker than his old Braun 5000 series shaver, so he shaves almost everyday now!  If I&#x27;d only known sooner what to do to get him to shave more often...</li>
            <li> The funny thing is, I remember getting an excellent shave with the first Braun razor I used 24 years ago. I upgrade to a new one every two or three years, and despite all the marketing and technology hype, this one too doesn&#x27;t make shaving really any better than the previous model. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be the first one to admit that every beard is different, but this whisker thing and the new foil shape is definitely overrated. In fact, I still have to pick the whiskers away, albeit it less often. The downside is, compared to shaving with the 7505 I had before, the whiskers are harder to find. The hair seems to curl more quickly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The battery performance is also disappointing. If I use the straight to socket method (rather than charging in the base unit), I get perhaps one or two days longer out of it, but never more than nine days and certainly not \\&quot;up to 14\\&quot; as the manual indicates. I just hope I&#x27;ll never spend two weeks in a beach hut with no electricity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, a decent buy, but not the performance they would have you believe.</li>
            <li> I hate to shave.  I usually only shave twice a week because of the discomfort and extra time that came with using a razor and shaving cream.  This Braun is the third electric razor I have bought and tried and the only one that I used for longer than a week.  In short, this electric razor is great.  I can shave in less than a minute and the quality of the shave is great and getting better as I get better at using the Braun and my face adjusts.  I now shave everyday, weekends included.  My son is just coming into the age where he is needing to shave more often.  My problem is do I let him use my Braun 8585 or do I get him his own?</li>
            <li> My 12 - 15 year old Braun needed to be replaced, so I tried this one.  Very Happy with it, feels great, the cleaner is cool.  Some have expressed concern about the cleaner fluid evaporating.  I only clean my razor when it needs to be charged (which is a huge jump from never), and I remove the fluid and re-cap it to make it last longer, seems to work.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver 3-4 months ago and would have to say that i am pretty happy with it. It does not get as close as a razor, but it does shave pretty close to it, but the difference is, with this shaver as compared to a razor (mach 3) i can shave against the grain under my chin and not get and razor bumps or burns. Thats what i love about this shaver. Some people complain about having to buy the cleaning solution every two months and for such and such a price, but if you do things correctly it will last longer, and the price is about the same as if you were to buy replacement razor cartidges, so i don&#x27;t see why they complain. It does take a couple weeks for you and your face to get used to the razor, but that just means that the shave won&#x27;t be as close as it can be the first week or two. Once you learn how to use it, it works excellently. You have to shave against the grain, and it helps if you pull your skin tight with your free hand, and try and move it and your face so that the surface of the skin your shaving is flat. It also shaves a lot quicker than a razor, it only takes me 5 minutes to shave my whole face with this, whereas a razor would take me about 10.  Overall, i&#x27;d say great performance and a great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun since I was in the service in Germany 35 years ago. I received the new Braun 8585 for Christmas and this one is by far the best one I have used. Faster shaving and quick clean-up.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Remington Microscreen 2 and my Gilette Mach III. Excellent buy, close shave (with a little work). I am pleased and very glad I didn&#x27;t buy the 8595. This is a better deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about seven years, and have gone through five. This isn&#x27;t to say I use them until they stop working - I use them until the lure of something better comes along. I&#x27;ve gone from an old hand-me-down Remington to an under-powered little Braun, to an unsuccessful stint with a triple-head that was supposed to dispense soothing goo, to a fantastic Remington Microscreen whose life was cut short by the rigors of life in the desert (California, Kuwait and Iraq), to its similar but not-as-good Remington replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A common issue dogged these razors - wear and tear. Blades and screens spend more time touching your face than you do, and the \\&quot;blade chamber\\&quot; invariably becomes dusted and choked with stubble, skin and the detritus of electric shaving. The chaps at Braun, perhaps sensing a chance to set themselves apart from the electric shaving pack, came up with the Self-Cleaning Shaving System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I must say I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the razor itself is keen. It has a nice size, a good heft, and a straight shaving head mounted on a rotating base that gives it just enough flexibility for under-neck shaving. The flexible screen abandons the \\&quot;lots of little holes in a grid\\&quot; concept for a crazy-cross hatched slot-and-hole screen that does a good - not perfect, but good - job of letting hairs at odd angles meet the blades. The shave itself is a dream. Those hard-to-get odd angled hairs aside, the razor works smoothly and almost imperceptably. It has a light touch, even if you push it hard into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My observation in support of this is that I had no \\&quot;adjustment period\\&quot; switching from the Remington to the 8585. None. Therefore, I attest the 8585 is gentle but all business, giving a damn fine close-but-not-too-close shave with very little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, back to the innovation here - the self-cleaning system. It is, without exaggeration, awesome. Using an alcohol-mixture cartridge, you simply place the 8585 in the charging stand after a shave. Now, I&#x27;m not sure how the system determines how hard to work at cleaning, but it thinks for a bit, and then picks either low (eco) medium (normal) or high (intensive). The process, as far as I can tell, is it soaks the razor head in the solution, the shaving scum is washed away, and the alcohol evaporates. You&#x27;re left with a fully clean electric to use for your next shave with the faint scent of lemony gin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps the blades sharp, the screen unclogged, and just plain works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer astutely points out, if you want to conserve cleaning fluid, you can always charge the 8585 directly with the power cable. And, true to Braun&#x27;s claim, the sucker charges quickly and will last quite a while without a re-charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the 8585 comes with the razor, base, charger, one cartridge of cleaning solution, a sweet hard-shell case for travel, a screen guard and a brush for taking care of external stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m giving this puppy five stars, I do have two complaints/observations. Number one is that the trimmer, while aggresive and able to cut thick hair with ease, has trouble with smaller, fine errant hairs, especially on the neck. It&#x27;s not a major issue, but electric shaving is never without its quirks. Next, the cleaning cartridges cost about eight bucks a pop, and if the thought of paying this much for the self-cleaning luxury bugs you, you probably shouldn&#x27;t consider this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another random note: if you absolutely cannot live without an LCD display on your razor, for about thirty dollars, Braun will sell you the 8685, which I presume is exactly the same razor. Save the thirty bucks, people. Razors do not need LCD displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: this is a fantastic razor well worth the cost. It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it turns a previously glaring weakness of electrics - the chore of regular maintenance - into a strength. For a comfortable, easy goingelectric shaver, the 8585 is a charmer.comfortable, easy going electric shaver, the 8585 is a charmer.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I liked the shave.  Now five months later, it has degraded significantly.  The blades are supposed to be replaced every 18 months, not every five.  Turning the blades around helped some. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t like the fact that the cleaning fluid smells like artifical lemons.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas as a luxury item because he hates shaving but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job. I am not sure why it works for some people and not others but now I have a barely used shaver in my bathroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with the results or lack there of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using top-of-the-line Remington MS5700 Titanium self cleaning razor, but its motor is very loud. I complained, they sent me a new one which is also very loud -- too loud for me! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I then bought this Braun 8585 to try. Braun is superior to Remington in all respects except the important one, \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; -- Remington has much larger cutting blades so it shaves closer and faster, no matter what Braun claims. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the Remington is way too loud, it&#x27;s rather heavy, and its pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut well. Its self-cleaning base isn&#x27;t as well designed as Braun&#x27;s. It&#x27;s rather messy pouring the bottle of alcohol into an opening in the Remington base, plus replacing a separate filter element. The cleaning doesn&#x27;t clean either of Remington&#x27;s \\&quot;pop-up\\&quot; cutters well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s self-cleaning cartridge changeout is very simple, a very good design. So I can live with Braun, I&#x27;ll simply take a little longer to shave. Braun&#x27;s motor is very quite and the razor is easy to hold, and manipulate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I might vote for Remington if it weren&#x27;t so damn noisy! I tried two of them, I can&#x27;t believe Remington would produce such a product.</li>
            <li> This Razor is great and I don&#x27;t even use the cleaning system (I bought it on Amazon without it). It has never given me any problems and still works like new. I think I still have 8 years left of use for this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 8585 for just under 2 years now and I continue to swear by it.  This spontaneous purchase raised the bar for what I expect from my morning shave.  The unique shape of the foil and the cleaning system were the main draws for me while I was comparison shopping.  I decided to spend the extra money and I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the cleaning solution (which has a light lemon scent) needs to be changed about once a month, and 3 packs cost somewhere between $15 - 20.  The cleaning process is a breeze and takes about 15 - 20 minutes.  I just pop it in the stand, push the button, and walk away.  The stand lets you know when your razor needs a cleaning or a new container of solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ordered a new set of foils &amp; blades, (after about 19-20 months) and while the shave is obviously not nearly as close as it was the day I got it, the shave with dull blades/foils is still better than what I was getting with my past razors.  My neck is prone to irritation and nicks, and my stubble is thick, so this has been a huge improvement across the board.  If I get a new razor at any point in the next 1-3 years, it will definitely be the Pulsonic or another Braun razor that builds upon the strengths of this model.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband based on the great reviews.  He was not pleased with the shave the product gave.  He said that the razor did not give him a smooth shave on his neck area and it irritated the skin.  I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my father in 2004 and it worked like a charm for 6 years without any problems at all!  He loved it, and wants another one this year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun 5428 for many years and decided to upgrade to what all here say is a better shaver, i.e., the 8585.   I wish I hadn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8585 does NOT shave as close as my old Braun.  It also takes noticably longer.  I&#x27;ve followed all the instructional suggestions. I&#x27;ve been using the 8585 for about 2 months now, so I think I&#x27;ve got the hang of it as far as Braun&#x27;s recommendations. Shaving shouldn&#x27;t be rocket science. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I find a distinct aroma of the cleaning solution in my bathroom and in the hall outside the bathroom.  No leaks, just the evaporation of the cleaning fluid. Not offensive, but noticable and unexpected. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a step down from my old shaver at a higher price and with the added monthly cost of the cleaning solution.  OK, but not recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a less expensive ($50-range) Braun shaver for more than 15 years, &amp; I think that this model is infinitely better. It provides a much closer shave w/ far greater comfort. It&#x27;s esp. good at getting hard-to-reach curved surfaces (chin, jaw, adam&#x27;s apple). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little skeptical that the cleaning system is necessary, but the quality of the shaver suggests that the cleaner may be just as good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model of shaver after doing probably a dozen hours of research on the pros and cons of different brands models, and after reading tons of reviews.  This shaver was a gift for my husband who is very picky and therefore rather difficult to shop for.  He has to have the best and finest things in any category, and he hates everything unless it was his decision to purchase.  I swear I am not making this up.  So, I was thoroughly expecting him to say he hated the shaver and to send it back.  Much to my surprise, he actually likes it.  The Braun 8585 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving System is flat and about the size of the old two-head shavers (you never see those sold anymore, only 3-head ones).  In my opinion the smaller shaver gives better maneuverability.  Shavers almost all claim to be as close as a blade, but this one nearly delivers on that promise.  They could claim to be \\&quot;99.5% as close as a blade\\&quot; and be completely accurate.  You&#x27;ll want to shave prior to showering, since the skin tends to swell a bit in hot water.  The shaver&#x27;s self cleaning feature is fabulous and works well; it&#x27;s like having a brand new shaver every time.  I don&#x27;t know this for sure, because I would never dream of using my husband&#x27;s shaver, but it seems like it would work just as well for women, since they don&#x27;t make women&#x27;s shavers as nice as this one.  Oh, ok, so maybe I tried it out.  I have a knack for somehow managing to half amputate my leg while shaving, so it was a nice easy and effective switch.  I even groomed the dog with the mustache trimmer part.  The shaver is fairly quiet and didn&#x27;t cause her any undue alarm or stress.  She now looks fabulous and also heartily endorses the Braun 8585 Activator.</li>
            <li> I am a regular buyer on Amazon, with a pattern of buying 25 items a year for the last 5 years (yikes!) and I have never written a review about anything I bought.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor based on the high acclaim that other users have given it.  I have been using Mach 3 blades for the last several years, and decided that I might try to save a bit by buying an upper-end electric. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, I&#x27;m not THAT impressed, and continue to shave with both a Mach 3 regular razor &amp; this one.  My biggest complaint is the dismal job it does under your jaws and on the neck.  I know you&#x27;re suppossed to give an electric razor 3-4 weeks, but this has not helped.  My search for the perfect electric continues. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pros for this razor include how fast it shaves, and what a good job it does on flat surfaces on your face.  I think because it has a big flat retangular head, it does poorly on neck area because the entire head can&#x27;t be firmly placed again your skin.  That&#x27;s probably why a Norelco with it&#x27;s triple head design does better on neck areas and small areas (if you have a big neck, maybe this electric will perform better). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other aspects such as looks and build quality are a consideration but for me they fall a distant second to issues such as the shaving quality.  The razor might look good, or have too big a base for cleaning, or clean itself but when I&#x27;m at work, I will remember the razor on how poorly it shaved my neck.  Overall, I would happily spend another $100 to get a razor that does half a job that a Mach 3 hand-held blade and good old shaving cream will do.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I shaved with blades for as long as I can remember. I always had to go at least 3-4 days in between shaving if I could to avoid getting torn to shreds on my neck. I bought this razor 3 weeks ago, and have had the best shaves of my life each time I use it (every other day). It is perfect! Using Lectric Shave makes it even better. And I&#x27;ll spend less on this unit and any replacement cleaners than I would replacement blades in a year. Get this!</li>
            <li> I switched from Mach3 + Edge gel to this beauty and couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice. My skin started getting razor burn and bumps in the neck area from the Mach 3, so I decided to buy this after reading the reviews. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made. No more burn and a smooth (against the grain) shave with no irritation whatsoever and no water. Not going back..</li>
            <li> I have tried everything in the shaving world including giving a hot towel press before shave and all sorts of after shave to keep it cool. But this one has defeated all. This is the best product that I have ever had in my life. You get a very good close shave without harming the skin. Its just amazing</li>
            <li> Do not have a case or pouch for the shaver and the cord. Shaver has a case but not for the ord.</li>
            <li> I first bought this when i realized spending $20 a month an razor blades for my mach3 was a little bit too much.  I was leary about electric razors since i have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  I would recomend this product to anyone.  The shave is just as close as a razor, none of that shaving twice a day like other cheaper electrics.  The only caution i would give is that Braun says that it may take two weeks for your skin to get used to the razor.  This was true for me, so don&#x27;t be shocked if you are irrated during the first week.  For me, that went away after about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a couple weeks now and I am ready to give my thoughts. First the shaver it self is very sleek. It fits in the hand nicely and it has a good solid feeling to it. As far as shaving, it does pretty well. I don&#x27;t have too much problem on my face, but the neck can be a problem. I really have to work to get everything off the neck. It leaves little hairs here and there.  I feel like i have to jab at it sometimes to get everything. It still takes me about the same time to shave with this as compared to my old razor. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i really do like this shaver. I just wish it was easier to manuver around the neck area. The shaver did leave me with some irratation at first but most of that has subsided by now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros:  &lt;br /&gt;-No shaving cream &lt;br /&gt;-No razor cuts or burns &lt;br /&gt;-Pretty clean shave overall &lt;br /&gt;-Nice sideburn attachment &lt;br /&gt;-Easy cleanup &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;-Hard to manuver around the neck &lt;br /&gt;-Expensive &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wanted to address something. Some of the other reviewers claimed that this shaver automatically begins the cleaning process when you put the shaver back on the base. They complain this annoying because sometimes they would like to avoid the self-clean function. This is totally not true whatsoever. The shaver base does not automatically begin the cycle. There is a button on the front of the shaver. Think of this as an on and off button for the automatic cleaning function. When this button is pressed down, the base detects the cleaning cycle and then executes it. However, when this button isn&#x27;t pressed down, the base determines the cleaing cycle but does not beging the cleaning process. You manually have to press the button down to get it to start cleaning itself.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;P.S. Just as a tip, always pop the foil guard off the shaver and use the brush supplied with the shaver to manually clean out loose hairs. Then turn the shaver on for a few seconds upside down to get rid of some ofthe hairs. I always do this and the cleaning cycle is always on the eco setting (the setting that uses the least amount of fluid). the cleaning cycle is a little loud for the first few minutes because the shaver turns itself on in the fluid to clean it out. If you&#x27;re worried about waking up your significant other, just clean it later.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this shaver. It&#x27;s worth the extra little bit of work to get everything off the neck. And of course the automatic cleaning function is lovely. Enjoy</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Braun electric shavers since I was about 19.  I believe the 8585 is only my 4th Braun shaver in almost 18 years.  I replaced my last one, and it was still going strong, lasting over a week on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is such an improvement over every other Braun shaver I have ever used.  It gives by far the closest shave.  It has much more power than any of its predecessors.  It can go through 2 days worth of stubble without even breaking a sweat.  It handles awkward neck hairs very well.  I attribute this to the new foil design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really makes me love this shaver, though, is the self-cleaning.  I love the fact that I&#x27;m getting a lemony fresh clean shave every morning.  I have even checked out the shaver after its done cleaning.  I dare you to find a single whisker inside of it.  I am still on my original tub of cleaning solution, and I am just shy of a month of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Activator 8585 by Braun.  At these prices it&#x27;s a no-brainer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The cleaning solution tubs are lasting 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I found the shaver to be overated. After years of using a Norelco triple header, I thought of trying a Braun and found it to be difficult to achieve a good shave. The Norelco was far superior. I returned it to Braun, Amazon would not take it back because of the head cleaning fluid. Which is another expense, the cleaning fluid only lasts for about a month and needs to be replaced, even if not used, it evaporates. I would not recomend.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs and can be used when ever where ever. The self cleaning is great. I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> This might be a unique experience for me but this shaver is still going strong after almost 10 years of use.  The cleaner base still works, the shaver still works and holds a charge (though I just leave it on the base) and the beard trimmer works.  My facial hair growth is pretty sparse (mixed Nordic and English blood) so I probably don&#x27;t put this shaver through the rigors of my more hirsute brothers out there.  However, I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.  I bought it for $129 new so this $699 price tag seems a little steep.  Hell...I&#x27;ll sell mine for for half that used if anyone wants it...but that is kinda like selling a used toothbrush.</li>
