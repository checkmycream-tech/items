            <li>and It got here really quickly too</li>
            <li>I have used several cuticle oils over the years, but I love this one the most.  </li>
            <li>I got my Cuticle Oil in the mail very early and I am overly pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>will not lift my polish or gels if I use it everyday, which I do, smells great too.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that I rarely have cracks and no chipping whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really something you absolutely need and there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>

            <li>Keeps cuticle soft and supple around nail, easily applied</li>
            <li>but I like it very much.  </li>

            <li>This product truly healed my dry, cracked, split cuticles making them very strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper than Sally&#x27;s &amp; super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it did help with my dry cuticles in the winter</li>

            <li>a lot of their stuff is really pricey</li>
            <li>I havn&#x27;t really tried a lot od bands of cuticle oils though</li>
            <li>The price for the oil is also a steal with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I used it and it worked very well and wasn&#x27;t very oily.</li>
            <li>but I much prefer this one.</li>
            <li>Keep the cuticles nice and moist and I try to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other oils</li>
            <li>I dropped it and more than half of the oil fell out, and the bottle is chipped.</li>
            <li>I have used everyday for a week now and experienced some improvement to my overly thick and jagged cuticles.</li>
            <li>and she is ready for the next order!!!</li>
            <li>am sensitive and wanted to use the product.</li>
            <li>It keeps my cuticles soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>IT IS VERY MOISTIZING FOR MY CUTICLES WHICH GET DRY FREQUENTLY.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with dry cuticles and this product combats this condition very well.</li>

            <li> so I am not sure if its better or worse than other brands or anything</li>
            <li> I use it after my mani n pedi, I usually wait about 30 minutes or so after I&#x27;m done before adding this, to give my mani time to completely set n seal before adding.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> It not only mousturizes my cuticles, but helps loosen any polish that spilled past my nail area.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hydrating as other nail oils.</li>

            <li> Hands down.</li>

            <li> It also has a slight lemon smell to it.</li>

            <li> Too expensive to send back</li>
            <li> I try to use it at least 3 times a week to keep my cuticle softand it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken in package what a waste.</li>

            <li> It does the job like any other expensive cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> so I take cuticle oil seriously.  </li>

            <li> It is okay, but I think there are better products that work more quickly on the market.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and it smells so good. My nail tech advised to apply it once in the morning and once it night to help my nails strengthen and grow. This totally works I have noticed that I rarely have cracks and no chipping whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I got my item on time. No day later! There was no leakage, no nasty smell. I put the cuticle on right after I finish my acrylic nails. There work perfectly! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it after I do my gel manicure and it seems to help keep my cuticles from drying out.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an artist who&#x27;s been painting her nails&lt;br /&gt;for quite some time, though. If this happens to&lt;br /&gt;be the case for someone buying the Gelish set,&lt;br /&gt;it takes a lot of practice to get used to this&lt;br /&gt;procedure, especially for a French.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to save money and do it myself. I bought the:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Foundation&lt;br /&gt;2. Ph Bond&lt;br /&gt;3. Sleek White&lt;br /&gt;4. Top It Off&lt;br /&gt;5. Nourish - which smells AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my moms UV light which was great&lt;br /&gt;that I didn&#x27;t have to buy. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so&lt;br /&gt;old that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br /&gt;There are just a cople French Gelish Manicure videos&lt;br /&gt;on YouTube but I wish there were more. I am having such&lt;br /&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself. I even&lt;br /&gt;recently bought self-adhesive reinforcement circles&lt;br /&gt;to help make the line more perfect. We&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
            <li> I have used everyday for a week now and experienced some improvement to my overly thick and jagged cuticles. During this same time, I have increased my usage of lotion on the area to moisturize (applied several hours before or after using this product.) I&#x27;m eager to see if by next week I see better results.</li>
            <li> great quality... scent really attractive and decent like citrus peel. Almost of my clients love this scent from this nourish oil</li>
            <li> Keeps cuticle soft and supple around nail, easily applied and I feel with continued application every couple of days my cuticles will be in great shape and then will probably only need to use it post DIY manicures.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Absorbs super fast, and absolutely love the light, citrusy scent.  I keep one at home, one at work, and a mini in my purse.  No more hangnails!</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and it really does moisturize the cuticles! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she couldnt believe the price I got it for and she is ready for the next order!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I love the smell and it did help with my dry cuticles in the winter but it doesn&#x27;t do miracles. I had to apply daily, twice a day, in order to improve the dryness.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was expecting, arrived quickly, and seems to work well. I have not had it long so if my opinion changes I will update this review. I think this product was worth the small price I paid.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry cuticles and this product combats this condition very well. I would recommend it as an inexpensive way to repair cuticles.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, and very useful in winter season. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!! The best nourishment for cuticles I have ever used by far. Hands down. Would recommend to everyone. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This oil works well. Keeps my cuticles and nails looking great and extends my manicures!  You can not beat the price and super quick shipping!!</li>
            <li> Great cuticle oil smell good use it every time i do my own gel manicure i recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Work fine I use it all the time</li>
            <li> This product truly healed my dry, cracked, split cuticles making them very strong. This product smells very good, and requires frequent use for best results.</li>
            <li> The oil is good for nail areas that have damage because of overuse of polish and other nail products. There is a large amount in each bottle. Lasts a long time. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This cuticle oil works okay but it was not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Does what i need it to do.</li>
            <li> This oil has helped my nails look so much better and healthier.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> I love doing my own nails and this cuticle oil is the best I&#x27;ve tried in a long time. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My nails are getting stronger and healthier.  My cuticles are much softer.  No more hang nails.  It has helped my toenails too.</li>
            <li> Smells of Citrus, &amp; Very Hydrating! Used with Harmony Gelish, &amp; UV Gel Nails... for the cost, i would definitely reccomend!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CUTICLE OIL. IT IS VERY MOISTIZING FOR MY CUTICLES WHICH GET DRY FREQUENTLY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Loveeee this oil. Soaks in very quickly. I use it after my mani n pedi, I usually wait about 30 minutes or so after I&#x27;m done before adding this, to give my mani time to completely set n seal before adding. I also use nutra nail naturals nail growth serum every night at bed time. I love that it&#x27;s not oily n will not lift my polish or gels if I use it everyday, which I do, smells great too. I only use harmony oil about 3 times a week if that, and it also smells great. I love it! It&#x27;s wayyyy better than CND  solar oil and that oil has a not so good smell. Harmony cuticle oil n nutra nail naturals nail growth serum is the way to go in keeping your nail/cuticles moisturized n healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Love this product...  my cuticles get so dry during the winter months.  Wonderful stuff!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.  It does the job like any other expensive cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken in package what a waste.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really something you absolutely need and there are better products out there. However it does work just fine.</li>
            <li> Feel and look great on you&#x27;re nails to see it for you&#x27;re self pay it! I love this safe and easy to apply on you&#x27;re nails.</li>
            <li> Directions said apply daily so I did. But noticed It burned when I applied it. I then started applying it once a week.  It still burned so, I added some of my own oils to it i.e.EVOO, Castor oil, Canola oil,Coconut oil,etc. etc.&lt;br /&gt;WILL THIS WORK??? I have no clue.&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive and wanted to use the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many cuticle oils in the past but this one is by far the best ever.  I would easily recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It had a smell that was offensive to me but may not for others.  Would not recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I just used this product &amp; it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. It&#x27;s so much cheaper than Sally&#x27;s &amp; super fast shipping. I so recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my cuticles feel. It also has like a lemony scent which is awesome</li>
            <li> A must have when doing gel manicures.  Keep the cuticles nice and moist and I try to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This cuticle oil is great for use after the Gelish manicure and in between as well. It not only mousturizes my cuticles, but helps loosen any polish that spilled past my nail area.  This stuff works great!1</li>
            <li> This cuticle oil smells good, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. It is worth the money. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This helps my hands and feet. Have not used it enough to see how long it stays on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> After seardhing for a nail oil this company Gellish delivered .I I try to use it at least 3 times a week to keep my cuticle softand it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I got my Cuticle Oil in the mail very early and I am overly pleased with this item. Smell is amazing. Bottle it cute and it works like a charm. I cant wait to see how much my nails improve. I will update thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with his stuff.  I really like a lot of Gelish brand things but a lot of their stuff is really pricey so I was surprised that this stuff didn&#x27;t cost more than what it did.  It works pretty good I think. I havn&#x27;t really tried a lot od bands of cuticle oils though so I am not sure if its better or worse than other brands or anything but I like it very much.  I do my own acrylics and silk wraps and gel and everything and a lot of that stuff along with the acetone will dry you out but this seems to do a good job a restoring my cuticles after I do a manicure on myself or my friends or family so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it... it does the job and It got here really quickly too I was really happy with the delivery time as well. .. Definatly recommend!  :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used several cuticle oils over the years, but I love this one the most.  Yes, it is made to use with the gelish nails, but I keep an extra one on my desk at work to use even when I&#x27;m not wearing the gelish polish.  It keeps my cuticles soft and moisturized.  And an added bonus is that is smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hydrating as other nail oils.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle oil. easy to put on and easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every other day and keeps my nail hydrated.</li>
            <li> This oil smells wonderful and makes my cuticles look great!</li>
            <li> Keeps my cuticle nourish and moist..... I use it every time i get my nails done. Great product I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the moisture it gives my nails and the revived look it gives. It also has a slight lemon smell to it. The price for the oil is also a steal with fast shipping. My only complaint is the glass bottle. I dropped it and more than half of the oil fell out, and the bottle is chipped. I will be ordering again though!</li>
            <li> Would like to review cuticle oil, but I received a ph bond instead.  Too expensive to send back so I guess will have to find a use for it.</li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with cracking cuticles so I take cuticle oil seriously.  I love the smell of this and it feels great on!</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle oil, dissolves into cuticles quickly and not greasy at all....makes my cuticles look nourished and clean. Love.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It smells great and it leaves my cuticles feeling so moisturized. Its very inexpensive and worth it.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and shipped in earlier then it was expected!! I used it and it worked very well and wasn&#x27;t very oily.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before expected. Smells nice and work wonders my cuticles. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I am using it a lot!! It is perfect..The cuticles are healthier, looks better, in general nails look nice. I definately recommend it</li>
            <li> Why wouldn&#x27;t everyone love this product? It penetrates well and once it is absorbed into the cuticle it leaves the cuticle feeling nourished and looking good. I&#x27;ve used many other oils but I much prefer this one.</li>
            <li> Very good and works great</li>
            <li> It works well. No problems</li>
            <li> Lovely and helped my nails so much!</li>
