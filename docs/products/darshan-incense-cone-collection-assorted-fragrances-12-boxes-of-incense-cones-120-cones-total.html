            <li>Nice assortment and even burn.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the variety and quality of the scents.</li>
            <li>Now when I light up an incense cone, I get all relaxed and snuggle into bed for a good nights sleep.  </li>
            <li>But, I decided that was ok, since I will not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li>Would order again:)</li>
            <li>But the duds among them just refuse to burn has just gone over the top.  </li>
            <li>If you have a favorite, it&#x27;s probably in here.</li>
            <li>If you have to use your favorite all the time, then this is not the collection for you.</li>

            <li>many scents up after I take one out.  </li>

            <li>Satisfied</li>
            <li>LOve</li>
            <li>the Smells and the assortment is Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Cones mostly in pieces when arrived.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Probably a better idea to smell these types of things in person before you order offline.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Large variety of scents but none of them much good.</li>
            <li>A good bargain on quality aromatic cones that I highly recommend.. : )</li>
            <li>So far everything smells great.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the jasmine, lavender, musk and sandal the most.</li>
            <li>For years I used to buy Hem incense that is easy to find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Beware of how STRONG this stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;I can burn Nippon Koddo Morning Star ALL DAY and not get dizzy or naseus or anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And the aroma is very nice with the different scents being most distinguishable in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Works and smells very nice as I expected.. Will purchase again if still available.&lt;br /&gt;The container is nice also.</li>
            <li>helps me fine the ones I like</li>
            <li>This incense had a noticealby cheap metallic smell.  </li>
            <li>I would not burn this incense again even if it were provided to me for free.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>We liked them so much that I have ordered another box of assorted fragrances.</li>
            <li>They do take a while to light and would recommend using a lighter rather than matches.</li>
            <li>The quality of these cones is far superior to the cheap brands.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own metal burner, which came in handy both for burning multiple cones in my home &amp; for sharing with friends.</li>
            <li>Many of the fragrances also strongly remind me of the incense I burned back in the 1970&#x27;s, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>e4ver bought.&lt;br /&gt;It is made by one of the top incense companies in the world &amp; when you light a cone for the first time</li>
            <li>The problem was, I ran out of incense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the first batch of incense I got was a gift, I wasn&#x27;t sure where to buy them, or even what to look for.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, and burns for a long time.</li>
            <li>Each fragrance is unique.</li>
            <li>each unique.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think the price is good for what you are getting.  </li>
            <li>I love these so much</li>
            <li>Some of the scents are bit too sweet smelling, but the sandalwood seems spot on.  </li>
            <li>It is a very crisp fragrance and true to its name.  </li>
            <li>These were ok they need to have more of a variety of them instead of the basic ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now well into my 3rd box of this Darshan brand variety pack and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I loved the Darshan incense cone collection, it&#x27;s very high quality compared to most of the other kinds I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>, we have all grown to know and love, in new age shops.  </li>
            <li>I felt the fragrance was too strong and there wasn&#x27;t much difference between the varieties.</li>
            <li>The first box came with many of them broken--the second box came in better condition.</li>
            <li>I love  the scents of assorted fragrances and it burns nice and clean,without making a mess.</li>
            <li>Each fragrance is distinct.  </li>
            <li>I have a 1BR apt and it definitely fills up the place without being too overbearing.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Still worth the price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent if you like variety.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for incense cones for a number of years and was unable to find them; they used to be in the import stores but most don&#x27;t sell them any more; thank you Amazon for selling them; the various kinds are wonderful and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I personally found Opium and Money drawing to be the best, and Strawberry and Tangerine to smell like someone was burning down a smoothie shop.</li>
            <li>Harder to light than most cone incense and too smoky for my tastes.</li>
            <li>Half of the incense smells good...</li>
            <li>but they light easily and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The smell is overpowering at first, and the quality of the cones are descent..  </li>
            <li>I love this incense, especially the strawberry.  </li>
            <li>but many of the scents are quite similar.</li>
            <li>You will get better data with the multiple choice questions.</li>
            <li>Give this a try &amp; you will be back to purchase more.</li>
            <li>As I stated before, I still prefer the strong fragrance of Hem incense, but they really have gone the way of trash and a rip off now as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li>They burn very steady and evenly.  </li>
            <li>instead all of the cones smell exactly the same, like cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li>Really strong scent, last about 30-45 minutes each.</li>
            <li>We have a large house &amp; can smell this stuff in all rooms.</li>
            <li>This brand is ok, but these incense seem to burn very fast as opposed to other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>I enjoy HEM incense and various Tibetan varieties.  </li>
            <li>The smoke is very aromatic and soothing.</li>
            <li>can burn Nag Champa Incense for about two hours straight before I get dizzy or get a headache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>its only when you light</li>
            <li>and I feel compelled to say that they really missed the mark with ALL of their so called fragrances.......</li>
            <li>Fast service.  </li>
            <li>packaging for these incense is on the cheap side, and though there are 12 different fragrances, they pretty much all smell the same.  </li>
            <li>The cones burn slowly &amp; I also liked that each package contained</li>
            <li>They last pretty well too.</li>
            <li>When you first get them they all smell the same</li>
            <li>A few scents are really strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say 1/2 of the cones are lopsided, and I was worried about this when burning them, but so far, have had no troubles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i know that they are cheap, but don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li>This Darhsan brand does what incense actually should, and the price of it is very reasonable compared to what I can buy incense here for locally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little addition, but they are just little tin coins.  </li>
            <li>Should have expected as much for the price.</li>
            <li>Not a single dud yet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scents provided vary in quality, but it will be a matter of taste which ones are good and which are bad.</li>

            <li> The rating needs to be a drop down only and not require someone to write an additional response.</li>
            <li> The other half smells the same and like soap.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t burn it was like they had been wet before</li>
            <li> Its the whole pavlov&#x27;s theory,  When I am tired, I lit up a cone and smelled it.  </li>
            <li> The incense was not what I expected</li>
            <li> I find HEM incense to have one base note and different top notes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say lifetime supply, but we&#x27;ve already gone through half the box in the last few months.  </li>
            <li> The 12 fragrances come in individual little boxes and a small burning tray is included with each.  </li>
            <li> On average 2 out of every 3 cones just don&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> can only burn this stuff for less than an hour before negative effects kick</li>
            <li> so they last quite some time and leave a big sent behind!</li>
            <li> We ended up throwing away half the boxes and calling it a wash.  </li>
            <li> Only a few tips of the cones were broken but it&#x27;s to be expected during shipping.  </li>
            <li> A few lit but went out before half way though.</li>
            <li> half of the cones are either broken or just lopsided or don&#x27;t stand up properly.  </li>
            <li> a purchase I repeat every few months</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding cones that don&#x27;t smell like a gas station.</li>
            <li> The only variety that I found very unpleasant was the tangerine, and despite its smelling like a very astringent and acrid disinfectant, I could still read the tangerines.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because the original incense I had was purchased from Walmart and was absolutely horrible (not really surprised).</li>
            <li> Even came with little metal discs to burn them on in each bag!</li>
            <li> And its really too bad for Hem incense in my opinion</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find cones in the stores.  </li>
            <li> These are slow burning</li>
            <li> I mean, they are incense..</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even get through an entire cone.  </li>
            <li> Poorly made (they lean and some had the tops cracked</li>
            <li> But somewhere along the line the manufacturers of their incenses quality control has gotten very sloppy.  </li>
            <li> disappointing.....</li>
            <li> Some scents are rather over powering but not too bad</li>
            <li> do burn well, almost to the base, and fill the room with that incensey smell</li>

            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t burn it was like they had been wet before</li>
            <li> This brand is ok, but these incense seem to burn very fast as opposed to other brands I have used. I had only received 11 boxes not 12. But, I decided that was ok, since I will not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> a purchase I repeat every few months, I am always happy with them.</li>
            <li> I enjoy HEM incense and various Tibetan varieties.  I thought that I would try something different when I ordered this Darshan sampler.  This incense had a noticealby cheap metallic smell.  It was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even get through an entire cone.  I would not burn this incense again even if it were provided to me for free.</li>
            <li> Great! Would order again:)</li>
            <li> This is a nice collection of incense cones. I like the fact that there are 12 different kinds and you get to choose what you in the mood for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann~</li>
            <li> I started burning incense to help me fall asleep at night.  Its the whole pavlov&#x27;s theory,  When I am tired, I lit up a cone and smelled it.  Then after a while, I associated the smell with sleep.  Now when I light up an incense cone, I get all relaxed and snuggle into bed for a good nights sleep.  The problem was, I ran out of incense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the first batch of incense I got was a gift, I wasn&#x27;t sure where to buy them, or even what to look for.  I found these on amazon, and decided to buy them. When I got them in, I knew instantly what they were, as there was a pungent smell coming from the smiley amazon box.  I opened it up and pulled out the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging for these incense is on the cheap side, and though there are 12 different fragrances, they pretty much all smell the same.  The 12 fragrances come in individual little boxes and a small burning tray is included with each.  It&#x27;s a nice little addition, but they are just little tin coins.  The smell is overpowering at first, and the quality of the cones are descent..  I&#x27;d say 1/2 of the cones are lopsided, and I was worried about this when burning them, but so far, have had no troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do burn well, almost to the base, and fill the room with that incensey smell, we have all grown to know and love, in new age shops.  Overall, I think the price is good for what you are getting.  I mean, they are incense.. so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would but these again, but I would probably look at the competition first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap&lt;br /&gt;- Come with Burning trays/disc&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Poorly made (they lean and some had the tops cracked off)&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrances all smell the same.</li>
            <li> Just received them and they are great! I&#x27;ve been looking for incense cones for a number of years and was unable to find them; they used to be in the import stores but most don&#x27;t sell them any more; thank you Amazon for selling them; the various kinds are wonderful and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love these so much I ordered another box !!!!</li>
            <li> Should have expected as much for the price. Large variety of scents but none of them much good. They were all soapy or purfumy smelling. Not relaxing at all.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and burns for a long time. The smoke is very aromatic and soothing. The Price is great too!</li>
            <li> I felt the fragrance was too strong and there wasn&#x27;t much difference between the varieties.</li>
            <li> I love  the scents of assorted fragrances and it burns nice and clean,without making a mess.It adds a very pleasant auroma to living quarters.</li>
            <li> The quality of these cones is far superior to the cheap brands.  They smell like the odors they are meant to be,  They last pretty well too.</li>
            <li> For years I used to buy Hem incense that is easy to find on Amazon.  But somewhere along the line the manufacturers of their incenses quality control has gotten very sloppy.  On average 2 out of every 3 cones just don&#x27;t burn.  You can relight them all you want but they just go out again.  And its really too bad for Hem incense in my opinion provides the richest aroma of any incense I have tried.  But the duds among them just refuse to burn has just gone over the top.  In fact the last batch I had of them simply got tossed because I couldn&#x27;t get any of them to work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now well into my 3rd box of this Darshan brand variety pack and am very pleased with it.  Not a single dud yet.  They burn very steady and evenly.  And the aroma is very nice with the different scents being most distinguishable in my opinion. (Something reviewers of Hem incense used to complain about).  As I stated before, I still prefer the strong fragrance of Hem incense, but they really have gone the way of trash and a rip off now as far as I am concerned.  This Darhsan brand does what incense actually should, and the price of it is very reasonable compared to what I can buy incense here for locally.  A good bargain on quality aromatic cones that I highly recommend.. : )</li>
            <li> There is a very good selection of &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; in this collection. I have tried them all and will probably replace the collection when I&#x27;ve used them up. If you have a favorite, it&#x27;s probably in here. If you have to use your favorite all the time, then this is not the collection for you. If you like variety, you&#x27;ll probably love this collection.</li>
            <li> I love this incense, especially the strawberry.  It is a very crisp fragrance and true to its name.  Each fragrance is unique. I find HEM incense to have one base note and different top notes.  No so with this incense.  Each fragrance is distinct.  The only variety that I found very unpleasant was the tangerine, and despite its smelling like a very astringent and acrid disinfectant, I could still read the tangerines.  Many of the fragrances also strongly remind me of the incense I burned back in the 1970&#x27;s, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I burn incense for religious reasons.  I could not find why burning tangerine or strawberry would do anything of ir OM was simply for meditating.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find cones in the stores.  This box is perfect...I can seal each of&lt;br /&gt;the many scents up after I take one out.  I know for sure I am going to order&lt;br /&gt;another box. I have tried one out of each scent and have my favorites, but they&lt;br /&gt;are each unique.  (none of them are obnoxious)</li>
            <li> I bought this because the original incense I had was purchased from Walmart and was absolutely horrible (not really surprised). Anyways there is a very big variety to choose from. These are slow burning so they last quite some time and leave a big sent behind! I have a 1BR apt and it definitely fills up the place without being too overbearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say lifetime supply, but we&#x27;ve already gone through half the box in the last few months.  Very nice diversity.  We will buy again.  Would make a really great gift!!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the scents and the burn rate but many of the scents are quite similar.</li>
            <li> Love the varity of scents and the price was good. When we use them up, we&#x60;ll get more. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Darshan cone incense burn well and smell oh so nice. We liked them so much that I have ordered another box of assorted fragrances.</li>
            <li> helps me fine the ones I like so I can order more</li>
            <li> Beware of how STRONG this stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;I can burn Nippon Koddo Morning Star ALL DAY and not get dizzy or naseus or anything.&lt;br /&gt;I can burn Nag Champa Incense for about two hours straight before I get dizzy or get a headache.&lt;br /&gt;I can only burn this stuff for less than an hour before negative effects kick in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good if you just want a short burst of incense, not recommended for long term all day use or for meditation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents provided vary in quality, but it will be a matter of taste which ones are good and which are bad. I personally found Opium and Money drawing to be the best, and Strawberry and Tangerine to smell like someone was burning down a smoothie shop.</li>
            <li> These are really nice. They do take a while to light and would recommend using a lighter rather than matches. this is the second box and like the fact there not all the same ones as before. The first box came with many of them broken--the second box came in better condition. When you first get them they all smell the same its only when you light/burn them do they have their own scent. I would keep buying them. Wished they sold them separately instead of in a multi pack box. Still worth the price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Really strong scent, last about 30-45 minutes each. Some scents are rather over powering but not too bad</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.  The scents are very nice and my son loves them!</li>
            <li> Rating based on my opinion and product use. The rating needs to be a drop down only and not require someone to write an additional response. You will get better data with the multiple choice questions.</li>
            <li> Works and smells very nice as I expected.. Will purchase again if still available.&lt;br /&gt;The container is nice also. Satisfied</li>
            <li> I loved the Darshan incense cone collection, it&#x27;s very high quality compared to most of the other kinds I&#x27;ve tried. The variety of scents included were delightfully individual, unlike some which all seem to smell the same. The cones burn slowly &amp; I also liked that each package contained it&#x27;s own metal burner, which came in handy both for burning multiple cones in my home &amp; for sharing with friends. Purchase this product w/o worry!</li>
            <li> i love to burn incense, and these cones are wonderful!  i&#x27;ll definitely be back to buy, when these are gone.</li>
            <li> So far everything smells great. Only a few tips of the cones were broken but it&#x27;s to be expected during shipping.  Even came with little metal discs to burn them on in each bag!</li>
            <li> i got 12 boxes that were supposed to be in 8 different scents.  instead all of the cones smell exactly the same, like cheap perfume.  the &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34; smells just like the &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34;.  half of the cones are either broken or just lopsided or don&#x27;t stand up properly.  i know that they are cheap, but don&#x27;t waste your money.  definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the scents I have tried. They can be a bit over powering but they light easily and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> disappointing.....I burn allot of incense and I feel compelled to say that they really missed the mark with ALL of their so called fragrances.......</li>
            <li> Nice assortment and even burn.  Worth every cent if you like variety.</li>
            <li> LOve the Smells and the assortment is Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Some of the scents are bit too sweet smelling, but the sandalwood seems spot on.  I have trouble finding cones that don&#x27;t smell like a gas station.</li>
            <li> Although package was not damaged, the contents were brokern Some did notlight. Try several matches and it did not take.  A few lit but went out before half way though.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Fast service.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> WOW,is the best word to use when you smell this incense. We have been using incense since the sixties &amp; this is some of the best incense that we have e4ver bought.&lt;br /&gt;It is made by one of the top incense companies in the world &amp; when you light a cone for the first time,you know why this company is one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;Quality incense for the price.Each cone burns for an unexpectedly long time. We have a large house &amp; can smell this stuff in all rooms. Give this a try &amp; you will be back to purchase more.</li>
            <li> The incense was not what I expected</li>
            <li> Cones mostly in pieces when arrived.</li>
            <li> These were ok they need to have more of a variety of them instead of the basic ones. But I would purchase them again if I had to.</li>
            <li> Took over 6 weeks to get but they smell great so maybe the wait is ok</li>
            <li> I really liked the variety and quality of the scents.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrances.  Harder to light than most cone incense and too smoky for my tastes.</li>
            <li> Half of the incense smells good... The other half smells the same and like soap.  We ended up throwing away half the boxes and calling it a wash.  Probably a better idea to smell these types of things in person before you order offline.</li>
            <li> Smell good, burn nicely. A few scents are really strong. I enjoy the jasmine, lavender, musk and sandal the most. Om smells like men&#x27;s cologne.. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and selection. Will buy again.</li>
