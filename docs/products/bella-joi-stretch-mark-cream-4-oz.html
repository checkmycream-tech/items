            <li>Just make sure you get into a habit of putting it on daily to see results</li>
            <li>I am excited about the mix of all natural ingredients,  I will come back and write more as my daughters pregnancy advances.  </li>
            <li>&gt; a few more weeks of using this cream might actually make me feel like it&#x27;s okay to show my belly again!</li>
            <li>This is a really small size, but i like it, smell good, thank you</li>
            <li>Rose Hip Seed Oil - helps reduce the redness around stretch marks and make them less visible</li>
            <li>I had my children very close together, my son was born June 9th</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like how it smells</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using it for 3 weeks or so and really likes it.</li>
            <li>I do not like so much</li>
            <li>The cream itself is not greasy, soaks up relatively fast after application.</li>
            <li>The skin stays smooth till next morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant and so not minimal stretch marks, I hope this will prevent them from coming.</li>
            <li>I use it on my new strech marks and leaves them feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>but I will continue using it as it is better than other stretch marks products that I have tried .Though</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to verify effectiveness, but so far seems to be a good lotion.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever have anything positive to say when it comes to miracle stretch mark creams, but this one is different.</li>
            <li>Olive Oil - since ancient times has been noted for its incredible benefits, contains the essential fatty acids that dry skin needs</li>
            <li>I really like this so far.</li>
            <li>As a teenager she started developing stretch marks with just normal growth.  </li>
            <li>It almost brings back the youthful healthy glow (but it doesn&#x27;t turn back time that far).</li>
            <li>i really like this product it was easy to use not smelly or messy to use</li>
            <li>it dries very fast when she applies it and that actually knows the ingredients that are in this cream.</li>
            <li>So far 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ll return to be as prominent as before once this bottle is gone.  </li>
            <li>It has Rejuvenating Antioxidants with Organic and Natural Ingredients.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are not gone completely but they have improved in appearance.</li>
            <li>After letting it set in, my skin feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>and it dries out the skin and mildly irritates it, and leaves a slight sticky residue, but for guaranteed results the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got huge stretch marks on my belly from the back to back pregnancy, so big that I would never show my stomach and public for any reason.</li>
            <li>So far, it has diminished their appearance and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>, there is very minimal odor, and my face/skin feel very refreshed.</li>

            <li> My stretch marks are not gone completely but they have improved in appearance.</li>
            <li> After letting it set in, my skin feels incredibly soft.</li>

            <li> So far, it has diminished their appearance and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> , there is very minimal odor, and my face/skin feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li> I was scared i would hate the smell like so many others I&#x27;ve tried but to my surprise I really like it!</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and see how long the results last.</li>
            <li> and I see little to no change on my old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> The smaller lines I had are barely noticeable anymore and the thicker ones are starting to slowly shrink and stay.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> They were long and thick and appearance, definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell I see some improvement.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like other creams.</li>
            <li> so it makes it harder for me to use it everyday,</li>
            <li> She recommends Bella Joi stretch mark cream to anyone who is pregnant and is worried about those ugly stretch marks.</li>
            <li> so I will update after I use it a little longer.</li>
            <li> I think it is a little pricey .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now and my stretch marks are not as noticeable as they were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few days</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have had 3 children and have quite a few I have been using this product for a week and can already see a difference .</li>
            <li> Will give it a few weeks to help with stretch marks and update</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy when applying (unless you overdo it and apply it by the glob)</li>
            <li> I just had a baby a few months ago</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works yet but will give it 4 stars until I update in a few wks with results.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I would reorder it.</li>
            <li> I opted in to receive this cream hoping for a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;  after using this cream at least twice a day for about two weeks</li>
            <li> but they are improving slowly, you can&#x27;t expect miracles like I did, give it time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its slow</li>
            <li> Her stretch marks are slowly fading away</li>
            <li> It is also very thick &amp; moisturizing!</li>
            <li> If you have stretch marks that you want rid of, throw away that useless cocoa butter and pick up a bottle of Bella Joi stretch mark</li>
            <li> I have visible stretch marks on my arms and chest area that are very unappealing to me.</li>
            <li> We all know these marks look terrible and we try to hide them , well with this cream you can help make them appear less maybe even gone .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so crazy about the smell, like at all.</li>

            <li> I bought this stretchmark cream for my daughter.  As a teenager she started developing stretch marks with just normal growth.  She is now pregnant and concerned about how easily her skin gets these unattractive marks.  This cream has some great reviews and claims to be one  of the best on the market.  It was formulated by a Naturopath Doctor, made in the USA and contains some great all natural ingredients!  I copied them here in case you missed them.&lt;br /&gt;* Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride - moisturizes the skin without giving it a greasy feel&lt;br /&gt;* Aloe - a powerful antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties&lt;br /&gt;* Shea Butter - an amazing antioxidant that quickly improves dry, damaged skin&lt;br /&gt;* Olive Oil - since ancient times has been noted for its incredible benefits, contains the essential fatty acids that dry skin needs&lt;br /&gt;* Cocoa Butter - helps improve skin elasticity and promote healthy collagen production&lt;br /&gt;* Jojoba Oil - helps the skin heal from damage&lt;br /&gt;* Mango Butter - rich with anti-inflammatory properties&lt;br /&gt;* Rose Hip Seed Oil - helps reduce the redness around stretch marks and make them less visible&lt;br /&gt;This cream comes with a money back guarantee, so you can feel confident buying.  I do want to share that I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.  At this point I can share that it goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t sticky or smelly.  I am excited about the mix of all natural ingredients,  I will come back and write more as my daughters pregnancy advances.  So far 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> I rarely ever have anything positive to say when it comes to miracle stretch mark creams, but this one is different. Since the first use I&#x27;ve been seeing drastic results not just on me, but on my spouse as well. The only down fall is that I have sensitive skin and it dries out the skin and mildly irritates it, and leaves a slight sticky residue, but for guaranteed results the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> I will update the results in a couple of weeks, but so far I love it because the consistency isn&#x27;t sticky and it&#x27;s easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of your time in order to apply it because it absorbs quick. Just make sure you get into a habit of putting it on daily to see results</li>
            <li> This smells yummy! It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky, greasy, or oily feeling residue. It has 2 butters, Cocoa, Shea, &amp; Mango and they mesh well together. I have visible stretch marks on my arms and chest area that are very unappealing to me. That is the reason that I purchased this product. So far, it has diminished their appearance and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks! I will continue to use this and see how long the results last. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ll return to be as prominent as before once this bottle is gone.  I love that they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you try it for 60 days and are not satisfied, they&#x27;ll refund your purchase price, no matter how much you&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I got this product 3 days ago and it works great so far! I can tell a difference in my stretch marks. You do not have to apply a lot that I have noticed cause I have used small amounts and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more. No stretchmarks at all!!!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Bella Joi&amp;#34; Stretch Mark Cream has a pleasant scent and makes my skin very soft after applying. I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now and my stretch marks are not as noticeable as they were.</li>
            <li> I have always had stretch marks and was looking for a product that work. This product is light with a great smell. I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or leave an oily residue, as it is absorb into the skin immediately.</li>
            <li> i really like this product it was easy to use not smelly or messy to use is the best product i have gotten for strech marks well worth the price in my opinion i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Smells really nice. Easy to apply feels light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few days and I think I can actually see some changes to stretch marks on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of the cream is nice too.</li>
            <li> I received as a gift and it smells great, very light scent.  It is non greasy and absorbs well.  I am not itchy throughout the day like when I was using the coco butter.  I am 7 months pregnant and so not minimal stretch marks, I hope this will prevent them from coming.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all and the bottle was gone before I knew it.  if you have the money to buy a million bottles of it maybe you see results but I wasn&#x27;t spending a fortune for something that wasn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li> thanlk you for this product...my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for removing stretch marks whether they are from growing or being pregnant . We all know these marks look terrible and we try to hide them , well with this cream you can help make them appear less maybe even gone .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had 3 children and have quite a few I have been using this product for a week and can already see a difference . If I can see a difference already I would say this is quite a product . It has Rejuvenating Antioxidants with Organic and Natural Ingredients. It is Excellent for Abdominals, Hips, Thighs, Arms, Breasts &amp; Gluts. Hydrates and absorbs quickly helping to increase the elasticity and strength of the skin.</li>
            <li> After about using this for a week or so, I started to notice my marks disappearing and I love it! This is my second time purchasing this and I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent proven ingredients to promote scar healing.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great!</li>
            <li> Love this have been using for a while and I already see results (:</li>
            <li> Wonderful product works great. Love this, need more ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream from Bella joi to help me with post pregnancy stretch marks. I had my children very close together, my son was born June 9th and my daughter July 20th of the next year. I&#x27;ve got huge stretch marks on my belly from the back to back pregnancy, so big that I would never show my stomach and public for any reason. They were long and thick and appearance, definitely noticeable. I opted in to receive this cream hoping for a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;  after using this cream at least twice a day for about two weeks I&#x27;m not getting miracles, but I am getting results! I can&#x27;t believe my eyes, there actually fading. The smaller lines I had are barely noticeable anymore and the thicker ones are starting to slowly shrink and stay. They&#x27;re still there and still stick out like a sore thumb but they are improving slowly, you can&#x27;t expect miracles like I did, give it time.&lt;br /&gt; a few more weeks of using this cream might actually make me feel like it&#x27;s okay to show my belly again! Its slow but he said to have given proper time for work, has a pleasant orange sent to wait and if you&#x27;re comfortable. If you have stretch marks that you want rid of, throw away that useless cocoa butter and pick up a bottle of Bella Joi stretch mark cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review and opinion.</li>
            <li> So far love this product</li>
            <li> Nice smell and moisturizer. Will give it a few weeks to help with stretch marks and update</li>
            <li> I really like this so far. It has a nice consistency and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I have only been using it for a couple of days so I will update after I use it a little longer. It&#x27;s a nice size bottle and I anticipate it will last. I am glad I was given a code to review this item.</li>
            <li> This product is super moisturizing to your skin. I use it on my new strech marks and leaves them feeling super soft. It has gotten rid off the redness and they seem to be smoothing out. I&#x27;m not so crazy about the smell, like at all. I really don&#x27;t like how it smells so it makes it harder for me to use it everyday, Other than the smell I see some improvement. My stretch marks are not gone completely but they have improved in appearance.</li>
            <li> I gave this cream to my friend who is pregnant she&#x27;s getting some red stretch marks. She&#x27;s been using it for 3 weeks or so and really likes it. Her stretch marks are slowly fading away she loves that this cream isn&#x27;t greasy it dries very fast when she applies it and that actually knows the ingredients that are in this cream. The bottle is&#x27;t big but the cream will last you over a month depending on how often you use it she applies it once or twice a day. She recommends Bella Joi stretch mark cream to anyone who is pregnant and is worried about those ugly stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about 3 weeks and really is helping a lot!! They are definitely starting to fade!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Super fast shipping!  The smell is pleasant and the texture is nice.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time but I will update when I see results.</li>
            <li> I do not like so much</li>
            <li> M pregnant and I was using bio oil for stretch marks and itchy skin. Bio oil didn&#x27;t do anything . I came across this cream on Amazon and I ordered it . I m on second bottle of this cream . This cream provided me relief from itchy skin . Though I can&#x27;t say It helped me with my stretch marks but I will continue using it as it is better than other stretch marks products that I have tried .Though I think it is a little pricey .</li>
            <li> I like the product but I&#x27;m not sure if I would reorder it. The cream itself is not greasy, soaks up relatively fast after application. However, I have been using it 2 weeks now and I see little to no change on my old stretch marks. It does make skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> This is some great creme! I have very dry skin and this just put some life back into me. It does not feel heavy when applying (unless you overdo it and apply it by the glob), there is very minimal odor, and my face/skin feel very refreshed. After letting it set in, my skin feels incredibly soft. It almost brings back the youthful healthy glow (but it doesn&#x27;t turn back time that far). This is definitely a great creme and worth it!</li>
            <li> It smells like an orange which would bother me a lot if I still have morning sickness. I don&#x27;t like the smell even now...&lt;br /&gt;I use this cream after taking a shower at night. The skin stays smooth till next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it untill the end of my pregnancy. I hope I won&#x27;t get strech marks.</li>
            <li> love it and smell is awesome</li>
            <li> This truly did help reduce the looks of my stretch marks. It also helped with itching. It&#x27;s not greasy and has a light pleasant scent. The texture is nice. Left my skin feeling smooth. Great product. Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I was so overjoyed when Bella Joi allowed me to try this product in return for a review! I just had a baby a few months ago so if course I have those pesky stretch marks. I just love this product! I can tell they are beginning to fade a little which is great because I just started using this product! It is so easy to apply and the consistency is great!</li>
            <li> Wife liked it.  Smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells great and some older stretch marks are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I helped lighten my stretch marks</li>
            <li> Just received this product and was eager to get it on! I must say it smells great!! I was scared i would hate the smell like so many others I&#x27;ve tried but to my surprise I really like it! It&#x27;s almost like a light fruity smell. It is also very thick &amp; moisturizing! I don&#x27;t know how it works yet but will give it 4 stars until I update in a few wks with results.</li>
            <li> The scent is over powering, I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> This is a really small size, but i like it, smell good, thank you</li>
            <li> I received a discount for my review: I decided to try this product because of the great reviews. First off it arrived extremely quick and in excellent condition. It didn&#x27;t smell like other creams. it went on easy. looking forward to the results and will update when I see them!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to verify effectiveness, but so far seems to be a good lotion. Has a nice scent and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Bought this cream for my pregnant best friend and she loves how soft it Is and how good it smells. Still awaiting results , can&#x27;t wait !</li>
