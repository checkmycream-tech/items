            <li> I have always liked the clean fresh scent of cotton and this product is one of the most refreshing clean smelling products&lt;br /&gt;Came very quickly in the mail ...!</li>
            <li> I had ordered the B&amp;BW Cotton Blossom Splash but ended up receiving the shower gel.. a disappointment because I really use body mists or splash ALL the time, and generally don&#x27;t buy shower gels.  I went ahead and kept it anyway and it is a nice scent, leaves your skin silky BUT dang I wanted that splash :(  Afraid to order the splash again because I sure don&#x27;t want TWO gels LOL.</li>
            <li> I purchased several of the Cotton Blossom Splash for my sister&#x27;s birthday. I like the scent but she loves it. When I heard that B&amp;BW was eliminating this from their line, I went searching for a vendor where I could buy her enough to last for awhile.  The scent is wonderfully fresh and long-lasting. I purchased it from Creative Notions since their pricing was incredibly reasonable. For a super bargain I was able to buy numerous Cotton Blossom items, received amazingly fast shipping, some of the best customer service I&#x27;ve encountered, and my sister was absolutely thrilled!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various high end scents, but this, rather cheap one, is my wife&#x27;s favorite. She loves the soap clean smell. I ordered four more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent from Bath and Body Works and is difficult to find. I was very happy with my purchase and will continue to order whenever products are available.</li>
            <li> This is one of the freshest scents ever.  it smells great all day long</li>
            <li> The scent had been discontinued for several years, but now I have found a way to get it - EBay.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! Smells like a fresh summer&#x27;s morning with clean wash blowing in the wind. Everybody tells me how good I smell and I dont use a lot. I layer it with the body cream and viola! Im good for the whole day. Try it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, not available in stores. It is soft , fresh and clean smelling. I hope i will always be able to get it.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place where I find the cotton blossom, I love the scent and so all my friends. It&#x27;s a great gift as well</li>
            <li> This body spray has a great scent and is very hard to find as it is no longer made.  I don&#x27;t understand why Bath and Body Works would discontinue such a great scent and popular product.</li>
            <li> This smells okay, but I have gotten some negative feedback from people after I spray it on myself. They say is smells like alcohol. Oh, well, Cotton Blosson orginial has always been a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I was so happy that someone had back stock of this spray. It&#x27;s such a great sent, like clean laundry and soap. Can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> Over time this has become my favorite everyday scent.  It is light and fresh and I always feel great wearing it.  I was really disappointed that Bath and Body Works stopped carrying it, but delighted to find it in the secondary market for what I thought was still a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the scent</li>
            <li> Got this as a christmas present. My mom likes it too and we seldom like the same things.people complemented me all day about how good I smelled . after my bath It made the bathroom smell wonderful instead of like butt.I work at a pizza place and a warehouse, so me being told I smell great almost never happens.It reminds me of being at the beach all day or being in a tropical flower garden. Must buy more</li>
            <li> Love it. The perfect light, fresh &amp;#34;just out of the shower&amp;#34; scent. Not heavy. Just makes you smell clean. The size is big enough to last quite a while, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> I said in a review about the body lotion.  I really like the soft and clean scent and I really love to wear it in spring and summer because it reminds me of summer and last all day.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and have no idea why bath and body works discontinued it! I am very happy, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
