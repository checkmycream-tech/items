    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful keep in mind</li>
            <li>Arrived in timely manner in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>Perfect!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Conair illuminated mirror for years that I was very happy with, but I can&#x27;t replace the burned-out bulb.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift and recipient loved it!</li>
            <li>adorable!!</li>
            <li>I would rather spend more money on a good quality mirror with good lighting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as bright as a night light!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a nightlite than a bright light.  </li>
            <li>It looks so much better in person</li>
            <li>It works just doesn&#x27;t have a huge viewing window.</li>
            <li>The light is a joke-</li>
            <li>My bathroom light is brighter than the mirror.  </li>
            <li>It looks nice and I would love it if it were bigger.</li>
            <li>Not bad...</li>
            <li>The mirror arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Since my eyes are themselves dimming with age and impairments, I need a much brighter light.  </li>
            <li>The magnification is nice for tweezing brows, but your face literally has to be about 2&amp;#34; from the mirror for it to focus enough.</li>
            <li>You would have to use this mirror in bright light--just like you would any other mirror, so the lighted part makes no sense.  </li>
            <li>Bought this at a local retailer and the light is so dim on this product, it&#x27;s not even worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off looking into the back of a CD.</li>
            <li>The light in this mirror is so dim</li>
            <li>The light is dim too.  </li>
            <li>Can not see my whole face to put on make up.</li>
            <li>- I opened this out of a brand new box - and the finished was already very scratched up.</li>
            <li>Also, it gets very, very hot in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a hard person to please, but this mirror is just so</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;light\\&quot; is completely dim.</li>
            <li>This item went straight back to the store.     </li>
            <li>It was extremely dim.</li>
            <li>Overall it was decent looking, just didn&#x27;t serve the purpose well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in hearing whether other people with aging eyes have found a lighted mirror that they can recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice looking but totally useless for my needs.</li>
            <li>Also the light is not bright enough.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this mirror from a local box store and, like other reviewers said, it&#x27;s very small and the light on it is a joke.</li>
            <li> Mirror is too small even if it is high magnification.</li>
            <li> The light in my opinion gives my skin a weird time to it and causes my makeup to look off.</li>
            <li> Its much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I think from edge to edge it was only 5 inches wide (including the lighted space).</li>
            <li> Another issue is that it was a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> the mirror is ok, very small, but the light is a joke, my wife was so mad she refuses to use it!</li>
            <li> Too small and wayyyyyy too dim.</li>
            <li> The bulb blew out in the first week, leaving a big burn mark in the paint behind the mirror (right at the center too), that is impossible to repair.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this too be so small, only 4.5 inches.  </li>
            <li> I will return this product back to Walmart, express my complaint to Revlon and I will contact Federal Trade Commission to investigate.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll bet I can find a 10x in a non-lighted mirror for much less.  </li>
            <li> found it odd that Revlon Spa website omits the specs for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t imagine why i would need this mirror, black heads??</li>
            <li> The light is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 5 inches round by 8 inches tall.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> So my opinion don&#x27;t waste your time on this mirror.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>

            <li> it is small</li>
            <li> The 10x doesn&#x27;t allow you to focus on your face since it&#x27;s so small.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t see anything the mirror is so small.</li>
            <li> The mirror is too small.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even focus on the 10X because it is so small.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is ridiculously small, and the light is horrible.</li>
            <li> The mirror is very small and the 10x magnification is a joke.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the mirror as I have a very small bathroom without a place to place to keep it out.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s useless.</li>

            <li> I bought this mirror from zulily. The bulb blew out in the first week, leaving a big burn mark in the paint behind the mirror (right at the center too), that is impossible to repair. Also the mirror was much smaller than the description led me to believe. Overall it was decent looking, just didn&#x27;t serve the purpose well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful keep in mind it is small</li>
            <li> I did not expect this too be so small, only 4.5 inches.  It looks nice and I would love it if it were bigger. Can not see my whole face to put on make up.</li>
            <li> Its much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Spend your money elsewhere. The mirror is very small and the 10x magnification is a joke. The 10x doesn&#x27;t allow you to focus on your face since it&#x27;s so small. Another thing that should be noted - I opened this out of a brand new box - and the finished was already very scratched up. I&#x27;ll be returning tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror today at Walmart and it&#x27;s going back on my next trip.  The lighted halo isn&#x27;t aimed into the mirror so it does nothing except provide an annoying glare.  You would have to use this mirror in bright light--just like you would any other mirror, so the lighted part makes no sense.  Also, it gets very, very hot in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the 10X part but I&#x27;ll bet I can find a 10x in a non-lighted mirror for much less.  I&#x27;m really disappointed in this mirror.  It&#x27;s nice looking but totally useless for my needs.</li>
            <li> I thought it was bigger..</li>
            <li> Last month I purchased a Revlon Lighted Swivel Mirror from Walmart.  When I brought the mirror home I noticed that it was too small.  Measurements stated or appearing on advertisement of Amazon site (as well as Walmart&#x27;s website) &amp; on the Revlon box appears to be deceptive.  When I brought the mirror home I learned that the measurements were smaller than what was advertised.  Actual mirror itself is only 4 inches.  However, the Revlon box indicates that its 6 inches but it seems to indicate this in Spanish; &amp; on Amazon site (also Walmart) gives measurements for the product that seems to be closer to measurement of the box (packaging).  Packaging &amp; product are two separate things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it odd that Revlon Spa website omits the specs for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; related advertisement is deliberately deceptive, targeting women. I will return this product back to Walmart, express my complaint to Revlon and I will contact Federal Trade Commission to investigate.</li>
            <li> Bought this at a local retailer and the light is so dim on this product, it&#x27;s not even worthwhile.  It&#x27;s more like a nightlite than a bright light.  Taking it back.</li>
            <li> Arrived in timely manner in perfect condition! Bought this as a gift and recipient loved it!</li>
            <li> The 10x magnification is so distorted and blurry it&#x27;s useless. The light is a joke- it just illuminates the ring- doesn&#x27;t make anything easier to see. I&#x27;m not a hard person to please, but this mirror is just so terrible- you&#x27;re better off looking into the back of a CD.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use in her dorm..Perfect!!  It looks so much better in person &amp; I didn&#x27;t even realize it has a wheel shut off/on on the cord.  adorable!!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;light\\&quot; is completely dim. Since my eyes are themselves dimming with age and impairments, I need a much brighter light.  This item went straight back to the store.     I&#x27;ve used a Conair illuminated mirror for years that I was very happy with, but I can&#x27;t replace the burned-out bulb. I&#x27;m interested in hearing whether other people with aging eyes have found a lighted mirror that they can recommend.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived quickly.  I like the size of the mirror as I have a very small bathroom without a place to place to keep it out.  The light is very disappointing.  My bathroom light is brighter than the mirror.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the mirror is ok, very small, but the light is a joke, my wife was so mad she refuses to use it!</li>
            <li> Not bad...if you only need it for a nightlight. Too small and wayyyyyy too dim.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror from a local box store and, like other reviewers said, it&#x27;s very small and the light on it is a joke. It&#x27;s about as bright as a night light! The magnification is nice for tweezing brows, but your face literally has to be about 2&amp;#34; from the mirror for it to focus enough. Returned it the same day.</li>
            <li> not a good mirror for doing makeup. or even eyebrows, my face it so big i can&#x27;t imagine why i would need this mirror, black heads??</li>
            <li> Everything works as it&#x27;s suppose to for this item,however, the mirror is a little small.  It&#x27;s about 5 inches round by 8 inches tall.  Also the light is not bright enough.  I would probably not order this item again.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I expected. I think from edge to edge it was only 5 inches wide (including the lighted space). It works just doesn&#x27;t have a huge viewing window.</li>
            <li> You might as well buy an unlighted mirror. The light in this mirror is so dim it is basically unusable without supplemental lighting. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I can&#x27;t see anything the mirror is so small. Mad and wish I knew how to return it.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this from Amazon but I thought I would put my opinion of it out there. I was VERY unhappy with this purchase! The mirror is ridiculously small, and the light is horrible. The light in my opinion gives my skin a weird time to it and causes my makeup to look off. I would rather spend more money on a good quality mirror with good lighting. So my opinion don&#x27;t waste your time on this mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror is too small.  I can&#x27;t even focus on the 10X because it is so small.  The light is dim too.  It is built well but basically useless.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Mirror is too small even if it is high magnification. Impossible to use. Should have returned it.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this mirror was the lighting. It was extremely dim. Another issue is that it was a lot smaller than I expected. Then the one tiny bulb inside decided to blow out. If you&#x27;re considering this mirror, look elsewhere.</li>
