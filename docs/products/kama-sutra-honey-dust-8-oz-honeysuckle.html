            <li>And of course it tastes very clean and sweet for those in contact!</li>
            <li>Its just as described and has a subtly sweet taste!</li>
            <li>so sweet try it, you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and finally found it again and makes me super happy.</li>
            <li>This item was perfect and so much less than in the stores!</li>
            <li>The consistency of talcum, but definitely a sweet taste that you can use to dust your partner with.</li>
            <li>but I have always been happy with all the other scents.</li>
            <li>It is applied with a feather to keep things dry when necessary and it tastes wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic...light and airy with a lovely natural smell.</li>
            <li>Just exactly how I remembered it to taste and smell.</li>
            <li>A feather duster and a can of Febreeze is more romantic...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t really too worried about that,</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>All I could think of when I smelled this stuff is of some old lady perfume and bug spray, YUK!!!</li>
            <li>So...I just transfer the satin bag to the old can and use my old feather brush (with a smooth wooden knob handle vs. a sharp-edged plastic one and about thrice the feathers).  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel sexy even just for everyday stuff.</li>
            <li>In the Navy we used it when we had inspections outside in the hot sun in Hawaii...  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells like old lady perfume and baby powder mixed and doesn&#x27;t really have any taste to speak of.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>As a side benefit, honey is naturally antibacterial and if you have any issues with skin issues such as yeast infections during hot weather (from skin in constant contact with no air circulation, this is not a cleanliness issue) this will clear it up in a day.</li>
            <li>the scent is a little strong but other</li>

            <li> My wife has used this product for years and loves it. It is so smooth and silky for every day use and tastes good too.</li>
            <li> This dusting piwder is made from honeyb ut is not sticky. It is applied with a feather to keep things dry when necessary and it tastes wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s so yummy</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like old lady perfume and baby powder mixed and doesn&#x27;t really have any taste to speak of. It smells DISCUSTING! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff!</li>
            <li> Just exactly how I remembered it to taste and smell. Very happy</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and finally found it again and makes me super happy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like it used to. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Most horrible smelling stuff around!!! All I could think of when I smelled this stuff is of some old lady perfume and bug spray, YUK!!! A feather duster and a can of Febreeze is more romantic...</li>
            <li> Great Stuff - Makes my wife happy!</li>
            <li> Great powder for hot days.  In the Navy we used it when we had inspections outside in the hot sun in Hawaii...  We didn&#x27;t sweat at all.</li>
            <li> The can came a little dented but I wasn&#x27;t really too worried about that, I just like using this powder to help with oil build up. I have oily skin so using this powder helps to control it. I have never ordered this scent before, I wanted to try something different. I am still not sure if I like the smell of this one but I have always been happy with all the other scents.</li>
            <li> I am hoping I love it..lol .. we will soon see. but it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> so sweet try it, you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a couple of decades and I love it.  Smells good, tastes good, feels good.  I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; can (in quotation marks because it&#x27;s been the same the last two times I ordered and the can lasts me a year or more) and the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; feather brush (same remark) is AWFUL compared to the one from two or more cans ago.  (The satin bag is the same.)  So...I just transfer the satin bag to the old can and use my old feather brush (with a smooth wooden knob handle vs. a sharp-edged plastic one and about thrice the feathers).  (I checked and the formulation is the same.)  :)</li>
            <li> Fragrance nice but overpowering</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> lasts forever. smells great.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and how soft it makes my skin. It also tastes good. ;)</li>
            <li> We love this stuff! Its just as described and has a subtly sweet taste! Just perfect.</li>
            <li> A must have! Superb shipping.</li>
            <li> I  love it, I use it for body powder get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 25 years. It is fantastic...light and airy with a lovely natural smell. As a side benefit, honey is naturally antibacterial and if you have any issues with skin issues such as yeast infections during hot weather (from skin in constant contact with no air circulation, this is not a cleanliness issue) this will clear it up in a day. And of course it tastes very clean and sweet for those in contact!</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and taste just as good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gritty. Not a lot of comments.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Received faser than expected</li>
            <li> Received the product and love it</li>
            <li> the scent is a little strong but other than that it&#x27;s fine. love the duster :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stronger scent than I remember but I still like it. Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Great powder but watch out for the dented can. If you want to give this for a gift or look nice on your counter forget about it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I wear is everyday and get compliments on the smell. I can&#x27;t wear perfumes because of the chemicals but this stuff is great. It makes me feel sexy even just for everyday stuff.</li>
            <li> This item was perfect and so much less than in the stores!</li>
