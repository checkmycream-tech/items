            <li> Reviewing Jen -Juli cellulite cream. I got this in the mail a couple of days ago. Ive been using it on my legs and do see a small change in the area. Remember its going to make your skin tingle a bit. But thank goodness that it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Works great my wife said.</li>
            <li> A great cream that even smells nice!</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream really does work well. I have always had the bumpy, pucker-like dimples on my inner thighs, no matter how much I watch what I eat or workout, so I know that part of it is genetics. I liked the combination of ingredients in this cellulite cream and the fact that it is paraben free. This cream goes on very easy and smoothly. It has a very nice minty smell that is not overpowering. The great part about it, is that it dries very quickly. I have tried a few other cellulite creams and it seemed like I had to wait quite awhile before I could get dressed. I was able to get dressed in a couple minutes after applying this cream. It absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. I have only been using it for a week, but I can see the dimples in my thighs becoming less pronounced. I am very excited to see the results, the longer that I use it. I enjoyed trying this cream for my honest review.</li>

Plus, with a 100% Unconditional, Risk-Free, Money Back Guarantee, I have nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: It comes very nicely packaged just like the picture.  I loved the pink colors of the package and how the whole thing was presented and how fast it arrived. I especially loved the jar liner that came inside the package to prevent the product from getting on the lid and making a mess while trying to re-close it.  That is a very nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:  I found the product very easy to apply with a non-greasy feel.  It has a pleasant eucalyptus/mint like scent and absorbs quickly into my skin.  A little does goes a long way which means I won’t have to use a lot see results and the product will last.  I use it twice a day and so far it has hydrated my skin very well and made my skin softer, smoother, and I have seen some stretch marks lighten in color and depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I am very pleased with this product.  Based on what I have seen so far, I have no doubt that the product will deliver as promised.  I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
