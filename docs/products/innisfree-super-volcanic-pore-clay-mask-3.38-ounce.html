            <li>Will be exploring more Korean Beauty products after my success with this!</li>
            <li>No strong smell, just a really great product!!! :)</li>
            <li>But after combining it with my Vitamin C facemask, I can see my face absorbed more from the facemask.</li>
            <li>it is pretty good~really cute bottle and good-looking</li>
            <li>Product makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>I love this Clay Mask, I felt my skin clean and fresh after the first time use it.</li>
            <li>If you have very oily skin this will be something you love.</li>
            <li>I got the Innisfree super volcanic pore scrub by accident initally</li>
            <li>The product goes on smoothly and dries fast.</li>
            <li>The mask I bought from South Korea was fresh as I bought it in October as the mask was produced in that October.</li>
            <li>I only used it once, but I liked the way my skin felt after using it.</li>
            <li>I bet with the right routine this could remove almost all blackheads.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at first.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pinpoint it exactly</li>
            <li>This though is by far my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I use this pretty much every day of the week.</li>
            <li>The shipping was pretty fast considering that it shipped from Korea.</li>
            <li>My face feels very cool down and clean</li>
            <li>My 13 year old uses this for her mild acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of masks in general, and own a TON.</li>
            <li>This mask really works.</li>
            <li>It seems very helpful to restore smoothness.</li>
            <li>√ùour Skin is really softed and smoothed</li>
            <li>I really really really like this mask.</li>
            <li>The acne I did have is shrinking fast and my pores look clearer.  </li>
            <li>Minor breakouts at first, but everything cleared up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It removes dead skin, clean my face and leaves it smooth like baby.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s calming and cool on sensitive skin plus leaves it soft and cleansed.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s mostly used for &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin for people with acne/blemishes and black heads..and oily skin/combo skin.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about buying it, but after the FIRST use, I saw that the blackheads vanished-I had to look pretty closely to see the ones left.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>little goes a long way, for sure!</li>
            <li>It got rid of a lot of my blackheads after first use, but I still see some blackheads left.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for first time mask users, like me.</li>
            <li>Any more past 10 minutes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cooling mask and I can actually feel it.</li>
            <li>and I use it on my 50 year old combination skin</li>
            <li>Its so brightening and my face is soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this mask in August, so the clay mask would be about 4 months old and the clay was semi-dry and patching.</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin feel suuuuper soft afterwards</li>
            <li>and my blemishes instantly look a lot better and a lot less red.</li>
            <li>, you can still feel that it has moisture after 15min of been applied, once you rinsed out your skin feels REALLY soft and moisturized, and the big change you noticed is the size of your pores.</li>
            <li>I wish it actually tightened my pores but so far, after 3 weeks of usage, i have not found any results.</li>
            <li>As someone mentioned in the reviews, a little goes a long way and this is definately true.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare to other ones or guarantee that is one of the bests in the market, but definitely I noticed a big change on the sides of my pores the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>but idk if that&#x27;s just my sensitive skin or because I left it on for an extra ten minutes by accident).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this pore clay mask. When I don&#x27;t have an acne spot corrector, I slap this cream on my face and leave it on overnight and my blemishes instantly look a lot better and a lot less red. I notice when using this mask my pores are tighter and my skin looks a lot brighter when I wipe it off. It&#x27;s a very cooling mask and I can actually feel it. I recommend it to anyone. I would say it&#x27;s mostly used for &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin for people with acne/blemishes and black heads..and oily skin/combo skin.</li>
            <li> it is pretty good~really cute bottle and good-looking</li>
            <li> Great Clay mask which I use about once or twice a week.  Sometimes the clay gets stuck in my larger pores and I have to use my Clairisonic to get it out.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old uses this for her mild acne prone skin and I use it on my 50 year old combination skin and we both love how this works. Will def buy again</li>
            <li> definitely a staple product if you have oily/acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> Korean beauty product must-have! A simple product that does justice in soothing your face of oils and impurities. It helps to control my acne and reduces my pores. I use this pretty much every day of the week.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about buying it, but after the FIRST use, I saw that the blackheads vanished-I had to look pretty closely to see the ones left. Its so brightening and my face is soft. It took be quite a lot of time to wash it off and it was kinda harsh (but idk if that&#x27;s just my sensitive skin or because I left it on for an extra ten minutes by accident). I recommend putting moisturizer on afterwards, but that&#x27;s my preference. No strong smell, just a really great product!!! :)</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> This mask really works. It removes dead skin, clean my face and leaves it smooth like baby.</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty fast considering that it shipped from Korea. The product was above my expectations. It got rid of a lot of my blackheads after first use, but I still see some blackheads left. I would definitely recommend this product for first time mask users, like me. By the way, I got this product because it was promoted by one of my favorite actors, Lee Minho (teehee).</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and will def continue to repurchase.. I got the Innisfree super volcanic pore scrub by accident initally and i do not like that at all and will not repurchase but i will DEFINITLEY continue to repurchse the pore clay mask!! check out my youtube channel  meloneyn10</li>
            <li> Its ok, but I used better clay masks before.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing and works great</li>
            <li> I love it. My daughter loves it, too. It eliminated blackhead of her nose and I used it for my skin. It seems very helpful to restore smoothness.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I&#x27;ve never tried before a clay mask so I can&#x27;t compare to other ones or guarantee that is one of the bests in the market, but definitely I noticed a big change on the sides of my pores the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, for sure! It distributes really good and it never fully &#x27;&#x27;dries&#x27;&#x27;, you can still feel that it has moisture after 15min of been applied, once you rinsed out your skin feels REALLY soft and moisturized, and the big change you noticed is the size of your pores.</li>
            <li> on par with the more expensive masks. Would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Its perfect to carry out a soft exfolation in home. √ùour Skin is really softed and smoothed</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use this every week and think it has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> Product makes my face feel clean. I wish it actually tightened my pores but so far, after 3 weeks of usage, i have not found any results. I will keep on using it b/c it takes off sebum and leaves my face feeling refreshed/cleaned.</li>
            <li> waste of money. it didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> If u have a dry skin, i dont recommend this to you..&lt;br /&gt;I have a dry skin, and im using this mask twice and the result my face become soft but very dry and itchy :( and after that pimples coming out..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at first. But after combining it with my Vitamin C facemask, I can see my face absorbed more from the facemask. And this really helps even your skintone after a few use</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pinpoint it exactly but it dies good. My skin feels very nice and clean after using it. It also leaves my skin looking better. It doesn&#x27;t quite make your blackheads disappear. It just makes your skin feel nice. I would repurchase if it was on sale or cheaper or if I went to Korea.</li>
            <li> Is the dates under the bottle the expiry date or manufacturing date? If it is the expiry date then mine says it expired 17 March 2014. Quite a disappointment.</li>
            <li> If you have very oily skin this will be something you love. I have some oil some dry and I have to be careful how long I wear the mask. Any more past 10 minutes and I will have some zones irritated. Feels good on skin and takes off top layer of blackheads. I bet with the right routine this could remove almost all blackheads.</li>
            <li> Nice mask, easy to use and feel so good.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial mask that money can buy, yet, it is not costly! I LOVE Innisfree products,&lt;br /&gt;and intend to try each one, as well as, replenishing supplies of products that I already have.</li>
            <li> Great mask! My face feels very cool down and clean</li>
            <li> leaves the face so refreshing</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! It&#x27;s calming and cool on sensitive skin plus leaves it soft and cleansed.</li>
            <li> Gr8 product. loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying this from American seller, but instead buying it from South Korea seller because the bottle of clay is at its freshest and the shipment came in a timely manner (10-15 days). The date at the bottom of the container represents the date it was manufactured, thus you can tell the freshness of the clay. The clay tends to dry out in about 9 months and the Innisfree clay mask I got was made in March 2014. I bought this mask in August, so the clay mask would be about 4 months old and the clay was semi-dry and patching. The mask I bought from South Korea was fresh as I bought it in October as the mask was produced in that October. KNOW that the clay should be CREAMY! not patchy! It would work so much better for your skin.</li>
            <li> This is another great product by Innisfree. I only used it once, but I liked the way my skin felt after using it. The product goes on smoothly and dries fast. It felt like it tightened my pores while invigorating my skin.</li>
            <li> Effective. Minor breakouts at first, but everything cleared up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I really really really like this mask. I&#x27;m a big fan of masks in general, and own a TON. This though is by far my new favorite. After one use, my skin looks brighter and less irritated/blotchy. The acne I did have is shrinking fast and my pores look clearer.  As someone mentioned in the reviews, a little goes a long way and this is definately true. Will be exploring more Korean Beauty products after my success with this!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but it just wasn&#x27;t amazing like all of the reviews says it is. Maybe I am just judging it too harshly because of all of the hype that it got but that&#x27;s just how I feel. I still like it, it makes my skin feel suuuuper soft afterwards and it does tighten my pores slightly but that&#x27;s about all it does.</li>
            <li> I love this Clay Mask, I felt my skin clean and fresh after the first time use it.</li>
            <li> This volcanic pore clay mask is definitely a favorite of mine. It is affordable and it works. My skin is so smooth, and many people ask me what I use on my face. I suggest using this mask once or twice a week. I also use this mask after &amp;#34;clubbing nights&amp;#34;, when I wear heavy makeup. A little goes a long way.</li>
