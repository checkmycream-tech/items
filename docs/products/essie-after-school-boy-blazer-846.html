            <li>True to the Essie brand form, I&#x27;ve had it on for a week now</li>
            <li>It came fairly quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>As always they still look fresh and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color but a much darker indigo (almost looks black in some lights) than it looks on line.  </li>

            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel that much closer to actual royalty.</li>
            <li>but the truth is its pretty much black.</li>
            <li>blue is more on the dusty side of the color</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s dark but doesn&#x27;t black like some dark colors, and has a cool indigo look.</li>
            <li> lasts very long</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a single chip.</li>
            <li> This is a Navy Blue, but on the dark side of navy.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit darker on than I had expected from the picture, but I used this with the First Base Base Coat and the Fast Dry High Gloss Top coat</li>
            <li> Looks black with a hint of that dark blue.</li>
            <li> Too dark.  </li>
            <li> Was not expecting this to be as dark as it is.  </li>
            <li> Everyone thinks its black and few have guessed its a dark purple.  </li>

            <li> I was looking for a color to dupe the Revlon moon candies in shade 210 Galactic.&lt;br /&gt;This blue is more on the dusty side of the color I was looking for. Non-the-less, I love the color. It came on time and it applies very well.&lt;br /&gt;Five out of five.</li>
