    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Its a perfect product for me.</li>
            <li>it does magic!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide a flawless finish</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>but I think that this cream is awesome!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m impressed to get something like this so inexpensively.</li>
            <li>I use it, I feel like my skin looks absolutely flawless, and I often get compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin that is combination (oily t-zone/normal everywhere else).</li>
            <li>for a great product.</li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>Great product and price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The appearance was great, but if it makes your skin break out</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>but it did a great job at evening out my skin</li>
            <li>I got this after reading the great reviews on here.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with it and hope they never get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great BB cream</li>
            <li>It honestly doesn&#x27;t have the best coverage, I use a spot concealer along with this BB cream and that seems to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>i love it!!</li>
            <li>Very handy.</li>
            <li>Very  happy with this purchase! :)</li>
            <li>I have fair, combination skin, and am prone to rosacea.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>so I feel like it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>And the light is perfect.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to wear in lieu of foundation that would provide good sun protection.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>but it still does a good job.</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you don&#x27;t have blemishes, but just want to even out your skin.</li>
            <li>It had good coverage, though.</li>
            <li>I also like the way it mattified my face which kept my face from looking oily for a good couple hours</li>
            <li>the L&#x27;oreal was the best fit</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and flawless with out looking cakey like some foundations do.</li>
            <li>I looked up all of the ingredients listed for this product and they all are good, recommended ingredients according to Paula Begoun, \\&quot;the Cosmetics Cop\\&quot; whose sensible and well-researched advice I trust.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;m good to go with just this and some mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this cream feels good on my skin, it does a nice, natural-looking job of evening out my skin tone, providing non-irritating sun protection, and functioning as a great all-in-one tinted SPF moisturizer with some beneficial ingredients for skin.</li>
            <li>I subscribe to this item, and sometimes I get one that is as good as what I get in the store, but once I got one where the makeup was kind of separated and watery but still usable.  </li>
            <li>I am throughly pleased with it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>The color matches my fair skin wonderfully and the coverage is light and dewy (but not so light as a tinted moisturizer) without being sparkly.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>and I totally love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This is outstanding!  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>She felt like she was putting on make-up, and it went on so smooth and translucent that even her dad was happy with how it looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beblesh Balm by Skin79, which has amazing reviews everywhere.</li>
            <li>so I use makeup over it, but it has made my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li>I immediately liked that you can&#x27;t see it after application.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice lite cover</li>
            <li>It feels good to wear something that is healthy for my skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really all that impressed.</li>
            <li>I liked the color and having sunscreen in one product.  </li>
            <li>I wear it every day and makes my skin look nice.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s got a nice feel to it and has a good amount of SPF in it, but if you need more coverage (as I do), then I&#x27;d suggest trying another brand.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job at concealing too :)</li>
            <li>Perfect combination of sheer color that covers well, and is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to give a BB Cream a try.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream 100 Light is the perfect shade for me.  </li>
            <li>It provides a nice light coverage and is good if you just have some redness to cover up.</li>
            <li>The silicone in it gives your skin a really nice texture--not oily, but very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a great product and worth it to purchase from Amazon for the discount and convenience of subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>I love this make up amazing and way better for my skin.</li>
            <li>For a product that&#x27;s supposed to do great things for your skin, perfume is one of the first ingredients you should avoid.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the hot summer when you don&#x27;t feel like putting too much stuff on your face!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m super impressed.  </li>
            <li>I heard about BB creams with skin \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; effect so picked up this inexpensive product (most of my make-up is Lancome).</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to use sun screen every day.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>One of my top foundation products for a college budget.</li>
            <li>It is more like tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>i thought for seven bucks i woould get a lttle more.</li>
            <li>buy more than one...</li>
            <li>For me, this wears better than most BB creams.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin and makes it look healthy.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen is simply zinc in a foundation that is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my face feel and look.</li>
            <li>(Some products make my oily zones break out)I love</li>
            <li>They cover somewhat and for many, I&#x27;m sure they work.  </li>
            <li>product went on very shear and we were both happy with the effect.  </li>
            <li>feel\\&quot; however I am beginning to need more than powder.</li>
            <li>I was still pleased with the way my face looked.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because it could conceal a bit more</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and my shade is always sold out in the store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard some magical things about BB Creams, so when I saw this I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love how the L&#x27;oreal cream changes to match your skin tone.</li>
            <li>It had more perfume than I care for</li>
            <li>I love the Revlon cream foundation.  </li>
            <li>I love the mascara</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has SPF</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I tried it.</li>
            <li>I have been through Avon, Clinique, M.A.C., Shisedo, all of the drug store brands and I have NOT been able to find anything that works for me.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have finally found the perfect foundation/moisturizer etc.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff for a summer day.</li>
            <li>It also goes on nice and smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is caked</li>
            <li>[If they do, my next best thing (even though it&#x27;s not a BB Cream) is elf Tinted Moisturizer in Porcelain.]</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, bought this to use instead of powder foundation on days</li>
            <li>like I was able to.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re darker skinned this might work okay for you, but prepare to look a bit sweaty.</li>
            <li>With the BB cream, it is much better and my skin looks more hydrated.</li>
            <li>This product does go on very easily, fragrance free, feels very light on the skin, and has some tints to provide some evening of skin tone.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I heard Maybelline decided to release a BB cream in the States.</li>
            <li>light coverage and light feel love it!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty fair.)</li>
            <li>but i guess it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got light coverage which is perfect for me as I only have redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It is light, not greasy at all, and yet gives nice coverage with a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I bought the L&#x27;oreal BB cream and the Maybelline BB cream at the same time to find the best fit for my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the light coverage and skin tone color</li>
            <li>I keep this for weekends spent on the lake, when I want a bit of coverage that&#x27;ll mix well with sunscreen but am not so concerned about looking perfect.</li>
            <li>I had liked the cream right when I bought it</li>
            <li>I use the light sheer tint and you would not believe how many comments I get about how beautiful my skin looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on, non greasy and doesn&#x27;t clump up.</li>
            <li>No caking up or settling into fine lines and blends easily.</li>
            <li>This BB does the job better than department store products (think Laura Mercier and her breakthrough tinted moisturizers, et al) in terms of skin texture, UV protection (SPF 30, full spectrum), and moisture.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice color.</li>
            <li>they label BB Beauty Balm that huge on the tube.</li>
            <li>Like a light foundation with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a light makeup not made to cover up acnea or blemishes.</li>
            <li>perfect, i use it everyday...</li>
            <li>No primer needed and all I use is a light brushing of baby powder it create a matte look.</li>
            <li>This goes on smooth and absorbs in well.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look so smooth and it even gives it a glowing look (not oily)</li>
            <li>I wanted to get something light for summer that would not leave my face too oily despite having sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>But perfect for everyday color.</li>
            <li>It is a tinted face cream she says it light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li>and I have been wanting to find a great simple makeup/skincare combo solution for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It meets all my needs as it moisturizes, gives me SPF, and smooth coverage all day.</li>
            <li>: I liked the consistency, and it felt very moisturizing on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Makes getting ready simple and feels and looks great on my skin!</li>
            <li>It is light and coverage is perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line -- western BB creams aren&#x27;t as good as the ones made in Korea, which are more full-coverage.  </li>
            <li>First impression: I love how light it is.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m willing to spend more on a quality BB cream.</li>
            <li>note: if you are very very pale, this light/sheer tint may not be a perfect blend for your skin tone.</li>
            <li>A special bonus is the non-chemical sun block.</li>
            <li>now that I&#x27;m closer to 50 than 40, I need a little help looking my best - and still recognizable.</li>
            <li>As far as the product&#x27;s blurring, smoothing and enhancing capabilites, I wouldn&#x27;t say it does an amazing job at that...</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product because I had heard such good things about BB creams, but this wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Despite the good color/coverage, the smell is enough to make me not use this product again and I will be seeking return/refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Its more like a tinted sunscreen to gently fix your skin tone when you wear it.</li>
            <li>that the SPF is 30 which is what most derms recommend be used on the face and this really simplifies my routine.</li>
            <li>In short, good moisturizer and skin evening--bad coverage.</li>
            <li>I am blonde with fair skin</li>
            <li>No irritating, unrecommended ingredients at all, although none of them what are considered super beneficial or potent antioxidants either, therefore I don&#x27;t think product can claim to do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li>Every other drugstore brand BB cream I have tried has been better than this one - better at blending and better staying power.</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>This is something I&#x27;ll go ahead and use on days when I&#x27;m just making a quick trip to the store for the sake of not wasting it.</li>
            <li>its light and has a really nice sheer tint to it.</li>
            <li>I was worried because it was too light when I first sampled some, but then it blended in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good if you have dry patches.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth, glides on very nicely, and it&#x27;s not to heavy!</li>
            <li>Only caveat - the product dries quickly, so be sure to smooth it on quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural-looking option for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin are probably better off using a tinted moisturizer, or adding in moisturizer to their liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I saw the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream in a department store and bought it on a whim since it was inexpensive</li>
            <li>This Dream Fresh BB was heaven sent.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use something tinted on my face instead of straight sunscreen, so I was excited about the fact that it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I had to use a blotting sheet right away.</li>
            <li>Love maybelline in general</li>
            <li>I tried the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream first.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth buying if you&#x27;re looking for a great gentle everyday tinted sunscreen moisturizer that makes your morning routine super easy and simple!</li>
            <li>have previously purchased one of the most raved about, original Korean BB creams, Super+</li>
            <li>This was the first BB cream I tried after hearing all the hype, and I just didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying BB Cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s a moisturizer - my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any different after using this.</li>
            <li>Before you apply the BB cream I would applyto just one part of your face to make sure you don&#x27;t have the same allergy.</li>
            <li>I like that it is light weight, not heavy at all and does cover my redness and acne marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve almost used up my first tube and have already ordered another.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s become interested in MAKEUP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and natural.  </li>
            <li>Many of the BB creams from Korea (where it originated) were having issues where consumers felt like they were getting fakes etc, so I thought I would give an American BB cream a try</li>
            <li>and after much research I settled on Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream</li>
            <li>I tried this out for overall better skin.</li>
            <li>Really good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Maybelline Dream Fresh in Light is the only BB cream that I have found that lights my darker checks and chin while smoothing my pores.</li>
            <li>It is barely noticeable on my skin, if at all, which is great for a very natural look, yet it does even out my skin and helps cover minor blemishes.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this stuff and it in no way resembles the higher end versions.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you can get the right tint</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is it makes my face feel refreshed, and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was also looking for a quick, natural looking alternative to my cover girl 3 in 1</li>
            <li>a certain age.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>And it certainly doesn&#x27;t help my pores any.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Perricone No Foundation Foundation, which gives 30 SPF and very light coverage with minimal color, which I use under foundation.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be coming back for more!</li>
            <li>This BB cream is awesome and so much less expensive than most of them out there.</li>
            <li>LOVE this wear it every single day - even my husband wears sometimes!</li>
            <li>SPF 30 is pretty high for a tinted product, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to love the Super+ cream but had to admit I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan due to its thick consistency which settled into my fine lines and wrinkles, and also couldn&#x27;t stand that it was perfumed.</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>That said, staying out of the sun and using sunscreen has been very helpful (for both health and aesthetics).&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really adapted to my skin&#x27;s color and looked very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>the only brand i found that matches my really really light skin</li>
            <li>but it blends in and matches your skin tone really well.</li>
            <li>About an hour after that, my face became very shiny.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with oily skin or anyone who wants a bit of coverage.  </li>
            <li>So much for BB creams.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much the spf 30 works.</li>
            <li>It was really sunny that day.</li>
            <li>In its defense, it does say \\&quot;light sheer tint\\&quot; but it just doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; quality I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>I still have to use the whole steps within using this one for ... sunscreen function...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really tricky</li>
            <li>Plus the color was very yellowy on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily complexion</li>
            <li>requested per granddaughter as gift and she really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li>believe there are only 5 tint choices available for this cream but the product is supposed to blend with your skin</li>
            <li>so I went with the Light Sheer Tint.</li>
            <li>It does indeed blend very well with my skintone.</li>
            <li>I have never found a foundation that I really like</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like doing the whole liquid foundation/brush/concealer/etc thing.</li>
            <li>but it really does everything it claims it will do.</li>
            <li>Feels nice, definitely needs to be set though, otherwise it will be gone in a second</li>
            <li>It gives me a healthy, moist look, rather than the dry, brittle look I see on so many women half my age.</li>
            <li>My original intention was to use this in lieu of foundation on days I planned to spend outside -- for the beach, etc.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes well and corrects what needs to be blended out, and is a reasonable price for decent color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pores do appear less obvious, but not to the extent that a good makeup primer would achieve.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product at full price though, just because for me, I&#x27;m really only using it for spf and there are other spf/moisturizers I like better for a high price.</li>
            <li>I used to live for M.A.C and now it just looked cakey!</li>
            <li>The active ingredient for sun protection is titanium dioxide which is non-irritating, causing minimal stinging in the eye area, and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So just be realistic with your expectation on that.</li>
            <li>When I first tried the bb cream I liked it until evening time when I started getting little tiny balls rolling off my face when I touched it</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to prevent this from happening and I&#x27;ve tried all brands of makeup high end and drugstore.</li>
            <li>Perhaps some of the high end BB&#x27;s would have what I&#x27;m looking for, but this one isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>had high hopes for the L&#x27;oreal BB cream</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>the smell was a bit weird for me, but all in all in matches with my face and the foundation settles in great once you rub it around.</li>
            <li>It took five days for my skin to approach normal again.</li>
            <li>Also, most foundations feel too heavy to me.  </li>
            <li>I splash it on when we&#x27;re going out and it looks natural but just a little bit better than normal.</li>
            <li>but if you have normal to dry skin I would think the Maybelline would probably be a good choice as long as your skin&#x27;s undertone doesn&#x27;t lean too much towards pink.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is that it does rub off when face brushes on something, but that is like many other makeup.</li>
            <li>I applied it the first day before going to the park with my kids and when I got back</li>
            <li>--I find that they are either too light or too dark, with no in between.  </li>
            <li>light looked like it might be too dark or orange for me</li>
            <li>The Skin 79 version in the pink bottle seems to work well for me; while it leaves a grey tone at first, it soon blends in and offers smooth coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loathe to use standard sun screens because they really irritate my eyes if I perspire.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but have used Maybellne before</li>
            <li>so I was surprised that I had a reaction.  </li>
            <li>Really evens out my skin tone and replaces dozens of different makeup products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often like to buy makeup online as the color can be perceived different than it really is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely sheer which is what I like, since I don&#x27;t really need any type of coverage.</li>
            <li>anywho this is much cheaper at your local drug store</li>
            <li>and I have semi sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing something heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li>Since most of us don&#x27;t have access to Asian skin care (except the few products that are on Amazon)  </li>
            <li>She has gorgeous porcelain skin (which unfortunately she didn&#x27;t get from me)</li>
            <li>Bold enough to reduce the appearance of minor imperfections</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel just very slightly sticky and shiny which means I do want to finish the look with a light dusting of powder instead of just running out the door with nothing but this on.</li>
            <li>I actually think it looks better than my regular foundation, even though it does cover a bit less.</li>
            <li>and my shirt was full of little balls of powder.  </li>
            <li>I make a point of mixing products - some high end, some low end.</li>
            <li>Not worth my money, especially now that I&#x27;ve tried some ACTUAL Asian BB creams and realized that there is so much better out there.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, really, but if you are only going out for a short time, and didn&#x27;t want to use nicer stuff, I guess this could be an option.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this BB cream, but to my dismay, it did very little for me.</li>
            <li>I wear 110 in Maybelline&#x27;s Fit Me liquid foundation, which is very pale and yellow/olive, so I don&#x27;t think it should cause any problems for anyone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and I look better than when I used my other foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a light enough color that looks natural.</li>
            <li>I was trying different bb creams, and so far this one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;light foundation + sunscreen protection &#x3D;</li>
            <li>also it takes alot to cover your face :O</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I just bought the Maybelline BB cream yesterday, I can only state my experience so far after one day of use.</li>
            <li>I am 58, with very dry skin and freckles and don&#x27;t use foundation because it looks heavy and settles in the fine lines.</li>
            <li>Several reviewers (on other sites) have complained that the American BB and CC creams are nothing like their Asian counterparts (the original creators of BB and CC creams) and I think that&#x27;s probably true.  </li>
            <li>only problem is that the price is a little expensive, but a great value for a natural go-to look.</li>
            <li>Finally something that works for my white sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Once the oil was gone my skin did look very pretty and even but within an hour I was back to an oily gross mess.</li>
            <li>My skin is fair and it is difficult to find a product that does not look natural but rather dark and a line around my jaw.</li>
            <li>have very, very dry pale skin, and I got the light shade.</li>
            <li>I even did a few layers on my cheeks for a bit more coverage (rosacea) and still didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the color.</li>
            <li>I bought the Light/Medium shade and was a little nervous when I first put it on because it was lighter than my skin color.</li>
            <li>The color is slightly too dark for my light skin tone, however.  </li>
            <li>first tested on my wrist, I was scared to see a very dark, orange color.</li>
            <li>There are other creams that have twice as much product for the same price.</li>
            <li>But after a few minuets it didn&#x27;t even look like I had make up on because it really does adjusts to your skin tone!</li>
            <li>Not sure why everything on TV is shouting about BB cream right now,</li>
            <li>I usually prefer foundations that feel light on the skin and have tried a few other brands of BB creams before, but this Maybelline one is so light that it didn&#x27;t cover up my redness or dark spots at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well just a little troublesome getting coverage on red bumps</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Its a perfect product for me.</li>
            <li> it does magic!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a flawless finish</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> but I think that this cream is awesome!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m impressed to get something like this so inexpensively.</li>
            <li> I use it, I feel like my skin looks absolutely flawless, and I often get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin that is combination (oily t-zone/normal everywhere else).</li>
            <li> for a great product.</li>
            <li> lol...</li>
            <li> Great product and price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The appearance was great, but if it makes your skin break out</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> but it did a great job at evening out my skin</li>
            <li> I got this after reading the great reviews on here.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with it and hope they never get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great BB cream</li>
            <li> It honestly doesn&#x27;t have the best coverage, I use a spot concealer along with this BB cream and that seems to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> i love it!!</li>
            <li> Very handy.</li>
            <li> Very  happy with this purchase! :)</li>
            <li> I have fair, combination skin, and am prone to rosacea.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> so I feel like it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> And the light is perfect.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to wear in lieu of foundation that would provide good sun protection.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before and loved it.  </li>
            <li> but it still does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you don&#x27;t have blemishes, but just want to even out your skin.</li>
            <li> It had good coverage, though.</li>
            <li> I also like the way it mattified my face which kept my face from looking oily for a good couple hours</li>
            <li> the L&#x27;oreal was the best fit</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth and flawless with out looking cakey like some foundations do.</li>
            <li> I looked up all of the ingredients listed for this product and they all are good, recommended ingredients according to Paula Begoun, \\&quot;the Cosmetics Cop\\&quot; whose sensible and well-researched advice I trust.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m good to go with just this and some mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this cream feels good on my skin, it does a nice, natural-looking job of evening out my skin tone, providing non-irritating sun protection, and functioning as a great all-in-one tinted SPF moisturizer with some beneficial ingredients for skin.</li>
            <li> I subscribe to this item, and sometimes I get one that is as good as what I get in the store, but once I got one where the makeup was kind of separated and watery but still usable.  </li>
            <li> I am throughly pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> The color matches my fair skin wonderfully and the coverage is light and dewy (but not so light as a tinted moisturizer) without being sparkly.</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> and I totally love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> This is outstanding!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> She felt like she was putting on make-up, and it went on so smooth and translucent that even her dad was happy with how it looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beblesh Balm by Skin79, which has amazing reviews everywhere.</li>
            <li> so I use makeup over it, but it has made my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> I immediately liked that you can&#x27;t see it after application.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice lite cover</li>
            <li> It feels good to wear something that is healthy for my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really all that impressed.</li>
            <li> I liked the color and having sunscreen in one product.  </li>
            <li> I wear it every day and makes my skin look nice.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s got a nice feel to it and has a good amount of SPF in it, but if you need more coverage (as I do), then I&#x27;d suggest trying another brand.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job at concealing too :)</li>
            <li> Perfect combination of sheer color that covers well, and is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to give a BB Cream a try.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream 100 Light is the perfect shade for me.  </li>
            <li> It provides a nice light coverage and is good if you just have some redness to cover up.</li>
            <li> The silicone in it gives your skin a really nice texture--not oily, but very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a great product and worth it to purchase from Amazon for the discount and convenience of subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I love this make up amazing and way better for my skin.</li>
            <li> For a product that&#x27;s supposed to do great things for your skin, perfume is one of the first ingredients you should avoid.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the hot summer when you don&#x27;t feel like putting too much stuff on your face!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m super impressed.  </li>
            <li> I heard about BB creams with skin \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; effect so picked up this inexpensive product (most of my make-up is Lancome).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to use sun screen every day.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> One of my top foundation products for a college budget.</li>
            <li> It is more like tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> i thought for seven bucks i woould get a lttle more.</li>
            <li> buy more than one...</li>
            <li> For me, this wears better than most BB creams.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin and makes it look healthy.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is simply zinc in a foundation that is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my face feel and look.</li>
            <li> (Some products make my oily zones break out)I love</li>
            <li> They cover somewhat and for many, I&#x27;m sure they work.  </li>
            <li> product went on very shear and we were both happy with the effect.  </li>
            <li> feel\\&quot; however I am beginning to need more than powder.</li>
            <li> I was still pleased with the way my face looked.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because it could conceal a bit more</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and my shade is always sold out in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some magical things about BB Creams, so when I saw this I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love how the L&#x27;oreal cream changes to match your skin tone.</li>
            <li> It had more perfume than I care for</li>
            <li> I love the Revlon cream foundation.  </li>
            <li> I love the mascara</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has SPF</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have been through Avon, Clinique, M.A.C., Shisedo, all of the drug store brands and I have NOT been able to find anything that works for me.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have finally found the perfect foundation/moisturizer etc.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff for a summer day.</li>
            <li> It also goes on nice and smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is caked</li>
            <li> [If they do, my next best thing (even though it&#x27;s not a BB Cream) is elf Tinted Moisturizer in Porcelain.]</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, bought this to use instead of powder foundation on days</li>
            <li> like I was able to.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re darker skinned this might work okay for you, but prepare to look a bit sweaty.</li>
            <li> With the BB cream, it is much better and my skin looks more hydrated.</li>
            <li> This product does go on very easily, fragrance free, feels very light on the skin, and has some tints to provide some evening of skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I heard Maybelline decided to release a BB cream in the States.</li>
            <li> light coverage and light feel love it!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pretty fair.)</li>
            <li> but i guess it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got light coverage which is perfect for me as I only have redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It is light, not greasy at all, and yet gives nice coverage with a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I bought the L&#x27;oreal BB cream and the Maybelline BB cream at the same time to find the best fit for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the light coverage and skin tone color</li>
            <li> I keep this for weekends spent on the lake, when I want a bit of coverage that&#x27;ll mix well with sunscreen but am not so concerned about looking perfect.</li>
            <li> I had liked the cream right when I bought it</li>
            <li> I use the light sheer tint and you would not believe how many comments I get about how beautiful my skin looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on, non greasy and doesn&#x27;t clump up.</li>
            <li> No caking up or settling into fine lines and blends easily.</li>
            <li> This BB does the job better than department store products (think Laura Mercier and her breakthrough tinted moisturizers, et al) in terms of skin texture, UV protection (SPF 30, full spectrum), and moisture.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice color.</li>
            <li> they label BB Beauty Balm that huge on the tube.</li>
            <li> Like a light foundation with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a light makeup not made to cover up acnea or blemishes.</li>
            <li> perfect, i use it everyday...</li>
            <li> No primer needed and all I use is a light brushing of baby powder it create a matte look.</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth and absorbs in well.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look so smooth and it even gives it a glowing look (not oily)</li>
            <li> I wanted to get something light for summer that would not leave my face too oily despite having sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> But perfect for everyday color.</li>
            <li> It is a tinted face cream she says it light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> and I have been wanting to find a great simple makeup/skincare combo solution for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It meets all my needs as it moisturizes, gives me SPF, and smooth coverage all day.</li>
            <li> : I liked the consistency, and it felt very moisturizing on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes getting ready simple and feels and looks great on my skin!</li>
            <li> It is light and coverage is perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line -- western BB creams aren&#x27;t as good as the ones made in Korea, which are more full-coverage.  </li>
            <li> First impression: I love how light it is.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m willing to spend more on a quality BB cream.</li>
            <li> note: if you are very very pale, this light/sheer tint may not be a perfect blend for your skin tone.</li>
            <li> A special bonus is the non-chemical sun block.</li>
            <li> now that I&#x27;m closer to 50 than 40, I need a little help looking my best - and still recognizable.</li>
            <li> As far as the product&#x27;s blurring, smoothing and enhancing capabilites, I wouldn&#x27;t say it does an amazing job at that...</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because I had heard such good things about BB creams, but this wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Despite the good color/coverage, the smell is enough to make me not use this product again and I will be seeking return/refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Its more like a tinted sunscreen to gently fix your skin tone when you wear it.</li>
            <li> that the SPF is 30 which is what most derms recommend be used on the face and this really simplifies my routine.</li>
            <li> In short, good moisturizer and skin evening--bad coverage.</li>
            <li> I am blonde with fair skin</li>
            <li> No irritating, unrecommended ingredients at all, although none of them what are considered super beneficial or potent antioxidants either, therefore I don&#x27;t think product can claim to do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> Every other drugstore brand BB cream I have tried has been better than this one - better at blending and better staying power.</li>
            <li> Super product.</li>
            <li> This is something I&#x27;ll go ahead and use on days when I&#x27;m just making a quick trip to the store for the sake of not wasting it.</li>
            <li> its light and has a really nice sheer tint to it.</li>
            <li> I was worried because it was too light when I first sampled some, but then it blended in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good if you have dry patches.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth, glides on very nicely, and it&#x27;s not to heavy!</li>
            <li> Only caveat - the product dries quickly, so be sure to smooth it on quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural-looking option for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> People with sensitive skin are probably better off using a tinted moisturizer, or adding in moisturizer to their liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I saw the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream in a department store and bought it on a whim since it was inexpensive</li>
            <li> This Dream Fresh BB was heaven sent.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use something tinted on my face instead of straight sunscreen, so I was excited about the fact that it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I had to use a blotting sheet right away.</li>
            <li> Love maybelline in general</li>
            <li> I tried the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream first.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s definitely worth buying if you&#x27;re looking for a great gentle everyday tinted sunscreen moisturizer that makes your morning routine super easy and simple!</li>
            <li> have previously purchased one of the most raved about, original Korean BB creams, Super+</li>
            <li> This was the first BB cream I tried after hearing all the hype, and I just didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying BB Cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s a moisturizer - my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any different after using this.</li>
            <li> Before you apply the BB cream I would applyto just one part of your face to make sure you don&#x27;t have the same allergy.</li>
            <li> I like that it is light weight, not heavy at all and does cover my redness and acne marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost used up my first tube and have already ordered another.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s become interested in MAKEUP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and natural.  </li>
            <li> Many of the BB creams from Korea (where it originated) were having issues where consumers felt like they were getting fakes etc, so I thought I would give an American BB cream a try</li>
            <li> and after much research I settled on Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream</li>
            <li> I tried this out for overall better skin.</li>
            <li> Really good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Dream Fresh in Light is the only BB cream that I have found that lights my darker checks and chin while smoothing my pores.</li>
            <li> It is barely noticeable on my skin, if at all, which is great for a very natural look, yet it does even out my skin and helps cover minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff and it in no way resembles the higher end versions.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you can get the right tint</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is it makes my face feel refreshed, and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was also looking for a quick, natural looking alternative to my cover girl 3 in 1</li>
            <li> a certain age.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> And it certainly doesn&#x27;t help my pores any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Perricone No Foundation Foundation, which gives 30 SPF and very light coverage with minimal color, which I use under foundation.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be coming back for more!</li>
            <li> This BB cream is awesome and so much less expensive than most of them out there.</li>
            <li> LOVE this wear it every single day - even my husband wears sometimes!</li>
            <li> SPF 30 is pretty high for a tinted product, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to love the Super+ cream but had to admit I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan due to its thick consistency which settled into my fine lines and wrinkles, and also couldn&#x27;t stand that it was perfumed.</li>
            <li> and it really works</li>
            <li> That said, staying out of the sun and using sunscreen has been very helpful (for both health and aesthetics).&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really adapted to my skin&#x27;s color and looked very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> the only brand i found that matches my really really light skin</li>
            <li> but it blends in and matches your skin tone really well.</li>
            <li> About an hour after that, my face became very shiny.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with oily skin or anyone who wants a bit of coverage.  </li>
            <li> So much for BB creams.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much the spf 30 works.</li>
            <li> It was really sunny that day.</li>
            <li> In its defense, it does say \\&quot;light sheer tint\\&quot; but it just doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; quality I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I still have to use the whole steps within using this one for ... sunscreen function...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really tricky</li>
            <li> Plus the color was very yellowy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily complexion</li>
            <li> requested per granddaughter as gift and she really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li> believe there are only 5 tint choices available for this cream but the product is supposed to blend with your skin</li>
            <li> so I went with the Light Sheer Tint.</li>
            <li> It does indeed blend very well with my skintone.</li>
            <li> I have never found a foundation that I really like</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like doing the whole liquid foundation/brush/concealer/etc thing.</li>
            <li> but it really does everything it claims it will do.</li>
            <li> Feels nice, definitely needs to be set though, otherwise it will be gone in a second</li>
            <li> It gives me a healthy, moist look, rather than the dry, brittle look I see on so many women half my age.</li>
            <li> My original intention was to use this in lieu of foundation on days I planned to spend outside -- for the beach, etc.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and corrects what needs to be blended out, and is a reasonable price for decent color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pores do appear less obvious, but not to the extent that a good makeup primer would achieve.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product at full price though, just because for me, I&#x27;m really only using it for spf and there are other spf/moisturizers I like better for a high price.</li>
            <li> I used to live for M.A.C and now it just looked cakey!</li>
            <li> The active ingredient for sun protection is titanium dioxide which is non-irritating, causing minimal stinging in the eye area, and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So just be realistic with your expectation on that.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the bb cream I liked it until evening time when I started getting little tiny balls rolling off my face when I touched it</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to prevent this from happening and I&#x27;ve tried all brands of makeup high end and drugstore.</li>
            <li> Perhaps some of the high end BB&#x27;s would have what I&#x27;m looking for, but this one isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> had high hopes for the L&#x27;oreal BB cream</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> the smell was a bit weird for me, but all in all in matches with my face and the foundation settles in great once you rub it around.</li>
            <li> It took five days for my skin to approach normal again.</li>
            <li> Also, most foundations feel too heavy to me.  </li>
            <li> I splash it on when we&#x27;re going out and it looks natural but just a little bit better than normal.</li>
            <li> but if you have normal to dry skin I would think the Maybelline would probably be a good choice as long as your skin&#x27;s undertone doesn&#x27;t lean too much towards pink.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is that it does rub off when face brushes on something, but that is like many other makeup.</li>
            <li> I applied it the first day before going to the park with my kids and when I got back</li>
            <li> --I find that they are either too light or too dark, with no in between.  </li>
            <li> light looked like it might be too dark or orange for me</li>
            <li> The Skin 79 version in the pink bottle seems to work well for me; while it leaves a grey tone at first, it soon blends in and offers smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loathe to use standard sun screens because they really irritate my eyes if I perspire.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but have used Maybellne before</li>
            <li> so I was surprised that I had a reaction.  </li>
            <li> Really evens out my skin tone and replaces dozens of different makeup products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often like to buy makeup online as the color can be perceived different than it really is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely sheer which is what I like, since I don&#x27;t really need any type of coverage.</li>
            <li> anywho this is much cheaper at your local drug store</li>
            <li> and I have semi sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing something heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> Since most of us don&#x27;t have access to Asian skin care (except the few products that are on Amazon)  </li>
            <li> She has gorgeous porcelain skin (which unfortunately she didn&#x27;t get from me)</li>
            <li> Bold enough to reduce the appearance of minor imperfections</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel just very slightly sticky and shiny which means I do want to finish the look with a light dusting of powder instead of just running out the door with nothing but this on.</li>
            <li> I actually think it looks better than my regular foundation, even though it does cover a bit less.</li>
            <li> and my shirt was full of little balls of powder.  </li>
            <li> I make a point of mixing products - some high end, some low end.</li>
            <li> Not worth my money, especially now that I&#x27;ve tried some ACTUAL Asian BB creams and realized that there is so much better out there.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, really, but if you are only going out for a short time, and didn&#x27;t want to use nicer stuff, I guess this could be an option.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this BB cream, but to my dismay, it did very little for me.</li>
            <li> I wear 110 in Maybelline&#x27;s Fit Me liquid foundation, which is very pale and yellow/olive, so I don&#x27;t think it should cause any problems for anyone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and I look better than when I used my other foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a light enough color that looks natural.</li>
            <li> I was trying different bb creams, and so far this one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;light foundation + sunscreen protection &#x3D;</li>
            <li> also it takes alot to cover your face :O</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I just bought the Maybelline BB cream yesterday, I can only state my experience so far after one day of use.</li>
            <li> I am 58, with very dry skin and freckles and don&#x27;t use foundation because it looks heavy and settles in the fine lines.</li>
            <li> Several reviewers (on other sites) have complained that the American BB and CC creams are nothing like their Asian counterparts (the original creators of BB and CC creams) and I think that&#x27;s probably true.  </li>
            <li> only problem is that the price is a little expensive, but a great value for a natural go-to look.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works for my white sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Once the oil was gone my skin did look very pretty and even but within an hour I was back to an oily gross mess.</li>
            <li> My skin is fair and it is difficult to find a product that does not look natural but rather dark and a line around my jaw.</li>
            <li> have very, very dry pale skin, and I got the light shade.</li>
            <li> I even did a few layers on my cheeks for a bit more coverage (rosacea) and still didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the color.</li>
            <li> I bought the Light/Medium shade and was a little nervous when I first put it on because it was lighter than my skin color.</li>
            <li> The color is slightly too dark for my light skin tone, however.  </li>
            <li> first tested on my wrist, I was scared to see a very dark, orange color.</li>
            <li> There are other creams that have twice as much product for the same price.</li>
            <li> But after a few minuets it didn&#x27;t even look like I had make up on because it really does adjusts to your skin tone!</li>
            <li> Not sure why everything on TV is shouting about BB cream right now,</li>
            <li> I usually prefer foundations that feel light on the skin and have tried a few other brands of BB creams before, but this Maybelline one is so light that it didn&#x27;t cover up my redness or dark spots at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works really well just a little troublesome getting coverage on red bumps</li>
            <li> I am surprised how other reviews mentioned the coverage part ...</li>
            <li> Normally covering a pimple only makes it worse but Dream Fresh doesn&#x27;t cake it down.</li>
            <li> I put it on after the moisturizer/sunscreen and leave it to dry, and a short while later I apply the powder</li>
            <li> The coverage is really not great, which I expected (considering it&#x27;s not intended to be as full-coverage as foundation) but this really doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot -- basically nothing, in fact.  </li>
            <li> This is the only liquid makeup that doesn&#x27;t cake up on my dry spots.</li>
            <li> My nose is somehow oily and dry at the same time, so it worked well to fix that.</li>
            <li> Put it on over moisturizer (it feels like it would be a bit dry by itself) and about an hour later I dusted on some translucent setting powder.</li>
            <li> I use Pond&#x27;s facial cream (although I am switching to clinique lotion soon-less greasy) to help with my flaky dry skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> Also, it settles into my fine lines which is SO irritating!</li>
            <li> I purchased this before the oil free version came out, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> It was smaller packaging than expected and also lighter color.</li>
            <li> Once I applied it to my face I could see that it did even out my skin tone, which can be extra pink in some ares.</li>
            <li> undertones fall somewhere between pink and yellow.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later, I saw a very shiny, greasy face with pores that look so much larger than usual.</li>
            <li> The only thing that they could improve is selling it in a bigger bottle because I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;s going to last.</li>
            <li> Then the texture was very strange.</li>
            <li> and it was so dry, nothing moisturizing about it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and it seems to even out my oily and dry spots.</li>
            <li> try this is you have HORRIBLY dry skin.</li>
            <li> Maybelline had some decent BB creams released in Asia, so I thought this would at least be on par.</li>
            <li> This BB cream was her first &amp;#34;foundation,&amp;#34; and allowed her a little coverage without being opaque and heavy (unnecessary and unattractive on fresh-faced young girls!).</li>
            <li> Sort of a rashy, rough skin break</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need a wide array.</li>
            <li> It does not really cover well</li>
            <li> I not huge on make up and despite being in my mid 30&#x27;s I refuse to use liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is extremely strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It also made my face look extremely dewy...borderline sweaty, which meant I needed to set it with some powder for it to look passable</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin (all year around) and usually makeup cakes clings to the dry spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very pale skin, and the &amp;#34;light sheer tint&amp;#34; shade still had a rather orange undertone that looked a bit too dark on me.  </li>
            <li> only complaint with this product is that it can give you a slightly oily look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to storing it upside down in a cup to prevent product loss.</li>
            <li> I mean this is a totally sunscreen sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel oily or dry or heavy, it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything at all!</li>
            <li> also its half the price it is on here at walgreens.</li>
            <li> It has a slight tint, so it evens my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I just feel like my skin looks pale, dull, and slightly red without it.  </li>
            <li> It looks a little dark when it comes out</li>
            <li> It made my skin look very odd, and came off in little balls if I ran a finger down my cheek.</li>
            <li> this little container was like a trial container.</li>
            <li> However, I just dust a little bit of shine control powder on my face and it looks fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just dust a little transluscent powder over my nose and boom</li>
            <li> I have very dry patches on my nose and forehead and am oily everywhere else, plus I am in my late 30s and my skin has changed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my bottle is missing a little stem inside the cap to prevent it from doing this, but I keep opening it to find a glob in the bottom.</li>
            <li> However, age is creeping up on me and uneven reddish skin tone.</li>
            <li> The trouble is a few hours after applying this concoction, my face looked like it was bathed in olive oil.  </li>
            <li> Just got this about a week ago at rite aid for a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> I also would not recommend this to someone with oily skin as it will only make it worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product almost everyday for a year</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago when I was on a weekend trip and forgot my foundation.  </li>
            <li> It was a sticky shiny mess!</li>
            <li> I recommend this one over the expensive brands, such as Laura Mercier.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel tacky and gave my skin an oil slick sheen.</li>
            <li> This made my usually non-sensitive skin rashy, bumpy, and flakey.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time matching my skin tone because it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was really hoping the BB trend would work for me. :(</li>
            <li> It hardly covers at all</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hardly the sort of product you can recommend to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is that if you store it vertically, like what&#x27;s shown in the picture, a bit of the product will leak out of the tube into the cap.</li>
            <li> It was a little thick and definitely not a very good quality.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look even and dewy, and the subtle light-reflecting (brightening)effect promotes a youthful look.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look awful, but for the lightest shade in the range, I was really hoping it would be designed for truly pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little bit expensive when its quality is considered.</li>
            <li> had heard about BB cream from my perusing beauty blogs looking for something that would even out my skin tone, cover where I need coverage, wouldn&#x27;t dry me out and would LAST all day without looking nasty.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t broken out</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews about products that I&#x27;ve tried but felt I needed to write one about Maybeline&#x27;s BB Cream after reading some bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s and am still plagued with oiliness that at the very least, has kept me from wrinkling!  </li>
            <li> Finally a BB cream that doesn&#x27;t make my oily, acne prone skin breakout or look horribly greasy.</li>
            <li> I hate the heavy and \\&quot;fake</li>
            <li> Weird thing is, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily with this on, but it looks greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when putting that on, my makeup still looked terrible and showed my dry patches.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think you will be sorry!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews scare you like they almost did for me.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible - the oily sunscreen seems to separate a lot from the pigment, leaving a weird texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every drugstore brand BB cream and was disappointed by every one of them until I found this.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use as a base.</li>
            <li> broke me out really bad after 1 days use!</li>
            <li> It was all bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am throughly pleased with it! Makes getting ready simple and feels and looks great on my skin! Will definitely be coming back for more!</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s very sheer tinted UVA protection.  What is not to like?</li>
            <li> I am 58, with very dry skin and freckles and don&#x27;t use foundation because it looks heavy and settles in the fine lines. I heard about BB creams with skin \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; effect so picked up this inexpensive product (most of my make-up is Lancome). I immediately liked that you can&#x27;t see it after application. It makes my skin look even and dewy, and the subtle light-reflecting (brightening)effect promotes a youthful look. A special bonus is the non-chemical sun block. I&#x27;m loathe to use standard sun screens because they really irritate my eyes if I perspire. This product&#x27;s sun block is totally non-irritating so I&#x27;m able to use sun screen every day. I&#x27;m recommending this product to friends and family \\&quot;of a certain age.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Just the same as its intro!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin. It&#x27;s hard to find a light enough color that looks natural. I love this make up amazing and way better for my skin.</li>
            <li> I got two when I ordered one? I&#x27;m not complaining. I love this and it really works</li>
            <li> it covers the imperfections entere</li>
            <li> light coverage and light feel love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been the type to wear foundation, don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t need it. However, age is creeping up on me and uneven reddish skin tone. So I wanted to try this b/c it is lightweight AND has SPF protection. So far, I really like it. No caking up or settling into fine lines and blends easily.</li>
            <li> This was the first BB cream I tried after hearing all the hype, and I just didn&#x27;t get it. This product is terrible - the oily sunscreen seems to separate a lot from the pigment, leaving a weird texture. People with sensitive skin are probably better off using a tinted moisturizer, or adding in moisturizer to their liquid foundation. Every other drugstore brand BB cream I have tried has been better than this one - better at blending and better staying power.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It gives me a healthy, moist look, rather than the dry, brittle look I see on so many women half my age. And it protects me from the sun. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying BB Cream and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it! This is &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; to my face. Love the light coverage and skin tone color it gives me. Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because I had heard such good things about BB creams, but this wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It hardly covers at all (I missed the \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; part of the description, I guess) and it actually highlights my spots! Also, it settles into my fine lines which is SO irritating! And it certainly doesn&#x27;t help my pores any. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s a moisturizer - my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any different after using this. Not worth my money, especially now that I&#x27;ve tried some ACTUAL Asian BB creams and realized that there is so much better out there.</li>
            <li> Like a light foundation with sunscreen.  Smooths and brightens.  Very handy.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in a magazine, and I just tried it and I love it. It covers pimples well. My favorite thing about it is it makes my face feel refreshed, and I have dry skin. Next time I go to the store I&#x27;m going to get some of this.</li>
            <li> I make a point of mixing products - some high end, some low end. I have fair, combination skin, and am prone to rosacea. That said, staying out of the sun and using sunscreen has been very helpful (for both health and aesthetics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now that I&#x27;m closer to 50 than 40, I need a little help looking my best - and still recognizable. This BB does the job better than department store products (think Laura Mercier and her breakthrough tinted moisturizers, et al) in terms of skin texture, UV protection (SPF 30, full spectrum), and moisture. I use this daily, and am regularly told I look 10 years younger. Only caveat - the product dries quickly, so be sure to smooth it on quickly.</li>
            <li> I had liked the cream right when I bought it but then the next day I had the hugest rash that made my skin raised and patchy in the spots I put it. Before you apply the BB cream I would applyto just one part of your face to make sure you don&#x27;t have the same allergy.</li>
            <li> It was smaller packaging than expected and also lighter color. Very sheer. I couldn&#x27;t use as a base.</li>
            <li> Love maybelline in general the smell was a bit weird for me, but all in all in matches with my face and the foundation settles in great once you rub it around. i love it!! One of my top foundation products for a college budget.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old and I both like this.  It is more like tinted moisturizer but it&#x27;s a nice lite cover</li>
            <li> I broke out in a rash. I have sensitive skin but have used Maybellne before so I was surprised that I had a reaction.  So can&#x27;t say how well the product works</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is extremely strong and unpleasant. I would rate it one-star, but the color matches well and covers well. Despite the good color/coverage, the smell is enough to make me not use this product again and I will be seeking return/refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Yep. it&#x27;s good. blends effortlessly.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is awesome and so much less expensive than most of them out there. It totally works as expected and I completely forget that I have it on. Really evens out my skin tone and replaces dozens of different makeup products. I hate wearing makeup so this is just great for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on, non greasy and doesn&#x27;t clump up. The only thing I would change is that it does rub off when face brushes on something, but that is like many other makeup. I like that it is light weight, not heavy at all and does cover my redness and acne marks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a light makeup not made to cover up acnea or blemishes. Its more like a tinted sunscreen to gently fix your skin tone when you wear it. I like it (: Its a perfect product for me.</li>
            <li> this little container was like a trial container. i thought for seven bucks i woould get a lttle more. and it was so dry, nothing moisturizing about it.</li>
            <li> I was trying different bb creams, and so far this one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;light foundation + sunscreen protection &#x3D; what  I need.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> perfect, i use it everyday... it does magic!!!!!!!!! buy more than one... i didn&#x27;t, so now i have to buy another... lol...</li>
            <li> Maybelline Dream Fresh in Light is the only BB cream that I have found that lights my darker checks and chin while smoothing my pores. I don&#x27;t look like a zombie when I put it on either (bonus). No primer needed and all I use is a light brushing of baby powder it create a matte look. Did I mention it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts? Normally covering a pimple only makes it worse but Dream Fresh doesn&#x27;t cake it down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often like to buy makeup online as the color can be perceived different than it really is. I heard that this BB Cream changes to your skin tone and wanted to try it. I was also looking for a quick, natural looking alternative to my cover girl 3 in 1 foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product on time packaged in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that sunscreen smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first tested on my wrist, I was scared to see a very dark, orange color. I blended it anyway, and to my surprise it really adapted to my skin&#x27;s color and looked very natural.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that the price is a little expensive, but a great value for a natural go-to look.</li>
            <li> For me, this wears better than most BB creams. It evens out my skin and makes it look healthy. I recommend this one over the expensive brands, such as Laura Mercier.</li>
            <li> I do not have problematic skin, nor any blemishes/dark spots. I don&#x27;t have the need to wear foundation on a daily basis, I bought this solely for the use of having something with an spf in it to wear on my face daily along with the benefits a bb cream is suppose to provide for skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, I bought it in medium, I think next time I purchase I will go up one shade. It&#x27;s extremely sheer which is what I like, since I don&#x27;t really need any type of coverage. I always wait until this product is 40% off at Ulta so I feel like it&#x27;s a good product for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product at full price though, just because for me, I&#x27;m really only using it for spf and there are other spf/moisturizers I like better for a high price. But when it&#x27;s on sale, I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I subscribe to this item, and sometimes I get one that is as good as what I get in the store, but once I got one where the makeup was kind of separated and watery but still usable.  It&#x27;s still a great product and worth it to purchase from Amazon for the discount and convenience of subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works for my white sensitive skin! The sunscreen is simply zinc in a foundation that is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> WOW!! Super product. Gives a bit of a &#x27;glow&#x27; without a &#x27;make-up&#x27; look.  Bold enough to reduce the appearance of minor imperfections</li>
            <li> Perfect combination of sheer color that covers well, and is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It feels good to wear something that is healthy for my skin. Great product and price on Amazon. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews. I have very dry skin (all year around) and usually makeup cakes clings to the dry spots on my face. I have tried everything to prevent this from happening and I&#x27;ve tried all brands of makeup high end and drugstore. This is the only liquid makeup that doesn&#x27;t cake up on my dry spots. It&#x27;s got light coverage which is perfect for me as I only have redness on my cheeks. It is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth and absorbs in well. Finish with a powder and it blends perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Its the only brand i found that matches my really really light skin&lt;br /&gt;~Mary Johnson</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every drugstore brand BB cream and was disappointed by every one of them until I found this. Finally a BB cream that doesn&#x27;t make my oily, acne prone skin breakout or look horribly greasy. The color matches my fair skin wonderfully and the coverage is light and dewy (but not so light as a tinted moisturizer) without being sparkly. I&#x27;ve almost used up my first tube and have already ordered another. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my face feel and look. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and I look better than when I used my other foundation. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream after trying and returning the Garnier BB cream. I love this! It is light, not greasy at all, and yet gives nice coverage with a smooth finish. I have combination skin and it seems to even out my oily and dry spots. (Some products make my oily zones break out)I love that the SPF is 30 which is what most derms recommend be used on the face and this really simplifies my routine. Really good for everyday wear. And the light is perfect. It looks a little dark when it comes out but it blends in and matches your skin tone really well. (I&#x27;m pretty fair.) The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because it&#x27;s only a 1oz bottle. There are other creams that have twice as much product for the same price. But I&#x27;m willing to spend more on a quality BB cream.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I heard Maybelline decided to release a BB cream in the States. Maybelline had some decent BB creams released in Asia, so I thought this would at least be on par. This product does go on very easily, fragrance free, feels very light on the skin, and has some tints to provide some evening of skin tone. However, after about three hours, I can see whatever coverage it had was gone. About an hour after that, my face became very shiny. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, really, but if you are only going out for a short time, and didn&#x27;t want to use nicer stuff, I guess this could be an option.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is not for those of us with oily skin.  I&#x27;m in my 50s and am still plagued with oiliness that at the very least, has kept me from wrinkling!  I wanted something to wear in lieu of foundation that would provide good sun protection.  The trouble is a few hours after applying this concoction, my face looked like it was bathed in olive oil.  I purchased this before the oil free version came out, unfortunately.  The color is slightly too dark for my light skin tone, however.  I really wanted to like this stuff and it in no way resembles the higher end versions.  Several reviewers (on other sites) have complained that the American BB and CC creams are nothing like their Asian counterparts (the original creators of BB and CC creams) and I think that&#x27;s probably true.  Since most of us don&#x27;t have access to Asian skin care (except the few products that are on Amazon)  we are left with these counterfeit products that are simply disguised tinted moisturizers.  Oh well.  They cover somewhat and for many, I&#x27;m sure they work.  Just not for me.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with oily skin or anyone who wants a bit of coverage.  I&#x27;ll stick with Perricone No Foundation Foundation, which gives 30 SPF and very light coverage with minimal color, which I use under foundation.  So much for BB creams.  What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use. Pretty nice color. It makes me look good.&lt;br /&gt;But a little bit expensive when its quality is considered.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 12 year-old daughter.  She has gorgeous porcelain skin (which unfortunately she didn&#x27;t get from me) but since she&#x27;s in middle-school she&#x27;s become interested in MAKEUP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product went on very shear and we were both happy with the effect.  She felt like she was putting on make-up, and it went on so smooth and translucent that even her dad was happy with how it looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it made her breakout.  Sort of a rashy, rough skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So one-star from us.  The appearance was great, but if it makes your skin break out it&#x27;s hardly the sort of product you can recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~&lt;br /&gt;mom and fur-mom</li>
            <li> When my daughter started wearing makeup, I wanted her to use a sheer facial product with moisturizing and sunscreen elements. This BB cream was her first &amp;#34;foundation,&amp;#34; and allowed her a little coverage without being opaque and heavy (unnecessary and unattractive on fresh-faced young girls!). This is a great natural-looking option for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: if you are very very pale, this light/sheer tint may not be a perfect blend for your skin tone. My daughter loves this BB cream in summer when she has some color, but in winter it seems to look just a bit orange.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and loved it.  It gives enough coverage for my blemishes and does not have an oily feel.</li>
            <li> I not huge on make up and despite being in my mid 30&#x27;s I refuse to use liquid makeup. I hate the heavy and \\&quot;fake feel\\&quot; however I am beginning to need more than powder. I decided to try this and I totally love it! It is light and coverage is perfect for everyday. It makes my skin look so smooth and it even gives it a glowing look (not oily) anywho this is much cheaper at your local drug store buy it it&#x27;s awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Just got this about a week ago at rite aid for a few dollars cheaper. I used it with a primer and blending brush. I wanted to get something light for summer that would not leave my face too oily despite having sunscreen in it. I applied it the first day before going to the park with my kids and when I got back I was still pleased with the way my face looked. It helped with redness that comes from heat. I gave it four stars because it could conceal a bit more but it still does a good job. I will say though that I did still get a bit of sun burn so I don&#x27;t know how much the spf 30 works. It was really sunny that day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and my shade is always sold out in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some magical things about BB Creams, so when I saw this I wanted to give it a try. Once I applied it to my face I could see that it did even out my skin tone, which can be extra pink in some ares. However, it doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes at all. In its defense, it does say \\&quot;light sheer tint\\&quot; but it just doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; quality I had hoped for. This is a good product if you don&#x27;t have blemishes, but just want to even out your skin. It&#x27;s also good if you have dry patches. My nose is somehow oily and dry at the same time, so it worked well to fix that. This is something I&#x27;ll go ahead and use on days when I&#x27;m just making a quick trip to the store for the sake of not wasting it. Perhaps some of the high end BB&#x27;s would have what I&#x27;m looking for, but this one isn&#x27;t for me. In short, good moisturizer and skin evening--bad coverage. I also would not recommend this to someone with oily skin as it will only make it worse.</li>
            <li> This is a Sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gals and guys, I&#x27;m not saying it has SPF. I mean this is a totally sunscreen sunscreen. I simply don&#x27;t understand how this stuff has things to do with BB cream after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my understanding, BB cream is supposed to give you the function, by using which you can just skip moisturizer, primer, foundation,etc. I still have to use the whole steps within using this one for ... sunscreen function...LOL. It does not cover. I am surprised how other reviews mentioned the coverage part ... Go and try tell by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really tricky they label BB Beauty Balm that huge on the tube.</li>
            <li> It was a little thick and definitely not a very good quality. It made my skin look very odd, and came off in little balls if I ran a finger down my cheek. I wasn&#x27;t really all that impressed. It had good coverage, though.</li>
            <li> I bought the L&#x27;oreal BB cream and the Maybelline BB cream at the same time to find the best fit for my skin. I have very fair skin that is combination (oily t-zone/normal everywhere else). I tried the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream first. It was a sticky shiny mess! It made my skin feel tacky and gave my skin an oil slick sheen. Plus the color was very yellowy on my skin. I had to use a blotting sheet right away. Once the oil was gone my skin did look very pretty and even but within an hour I was back to an oily gross mess. I think it may be the sunscreen in the product that was causing my skin to be so oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for the L&#x27;oreal BB cream and it did not disappoint! I usually have a hard time matching my skin tone because it&#x27;s undertones fall somewhere between pink and yellow. I love how the L&#x27;oreal cream changes to match your skin tone. I also like the way it mattified my face which kept my face from looking oily for a good couple hours (I did not set either BB cream with powder). It doesn&#x27;t provide a flawless finish but it did a great job at evening out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the L&#x27;oreal was the best fit but if you have normal to dry skin I would think the Maybelline would probably be a good choice as long as your skin&#x27;s undertone doesn&#x27;t lean too much towards pink.</li>
            <li> broke me out really bad after 1 days use! also its half the price it is on here at walgreens. try this is you have HORRIBLY dry skin. also it takes alot to cover your face :O</li>
            <li> I got this after reading the great reviews on here. When I put it on, I saw nothing. A few minutes later, I saw a very shiny, greasy face with pores that look so much larger than usual. No color difference, no evening of skin tone. I actually looked worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very, very dry pale skin, and I got the light shade. I had read that it was a bit oily, but I figured that would be to my advantage. It wasn&#x27;t. Weird thing is, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily with this on, but it looks greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can find my receipt so I can take it back to CVS and try another brand. I was really hoping the BB trend would work for me. :(</li>
            <li> I liked the color and having sunscreen in one product.  It had more perfume than I care for so I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the bb cream I liked it until evening time when I started getting little tiny balls rolling off my face when I touched it lol. I have a very oily complexion so thats probably why. However I just do not like it or the way it feels on me.</li>
            <li> Ihave not tried it yet.  Give me a chance and I&#x27;ll let you know if I like it or not.  I love the Revlon cream foundation.  I love the mascara \\&quot;they&#x27;re real\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> LOVE this wear it every single day - even my husband wears sometimes!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.  I use it every day.  Sometimes with powder and sometimes alone.  I love that it has SPF so if i&#x27;m in a rush I can put this on and run out without having to put on sunscreen and foundation.  It&#x27;s light and natural.  Perfect for the hot summer when you don&#x27;t feel like putting too much stuff on your face!!</li>
            <li> Sheer. But perfect for everyday color. I have been using this product almost everyday for a year and I am almost done with my second tube. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I keep this for weekends spent on the lake, when I want a bit of coverage that&#x27;ll mix well with sunscreen but am not so concerned about looking perfect. It moisturizes well and corrects what needs to be blended out, and is a reasonable price for decent color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that if you store it vertically, like what&#x27;s shown in the picture, a bit of the product will leak out of the tube into the cap. I don&#x27;t know if my bottle is missing a little stem inside the cap to prevent it from doing this, but I keep opening it to find a glob in the bottom. I&#x27;ve taken to storing it upside down in a cup to prevent product loss.</li>
            <li> This made my usually non-sensitive skin rashy, bumpy, and flakey. It took five days for my skin to approach normal again. It was all bad!</li>
            <li> requested per granddaughter as gift and she really likes this stuff. It is a tinted face cream she says it light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, so this is perfect for me. I splash it on when we&#x27;re going out and it looks natural but just a little bit better than normal. Not sure why everything on TV is shouting about BB cream right now, but i guess it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews about products that I&#x27;ve tried but felt I needed to write one about Maybeline&#x27;s BB Cream after reading some bad reviews. I&#x27;ve never tried a BB cream before so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to but I think that this cream is awesome! I bought the Light/Medium shade and was a little nervous when I first put it on because it was lighter than my skin color. But after a few minuets it didn&#x27;t even look like I had make up on because it really does adjusts to your skin tone! My skin looks smooth and flawless with out looking cakey like some foundations do. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily or dry or heavy, it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything at all! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I haven&#x27;t broken out and I have semi sensitive skin. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and is going to react differently to make up. Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews scare you like they almost did for me. I&#x27;m really glad that I tried it. The only thing that they could improve is selling it in a bigger bottle because I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;s going to last.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for foundation for years, literally.  I have been through Avon, Clinique, M.A.C., Shisedo, all of the drug store brands and I have NOT been able to find anything that works for me.  I have very dry patches on my nose and forehead and am oily everywhere else, plus I am in my late 30s and my skin has changed.  I used to live for M.A.C and now it just looked cakey! Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard about BB cream from my perusing beauty blogs looking for something that would even out my skin tone, cover where I need coverage, wouldn&#x27;t dry me out and would LAST all day without looking nasty. Many of the BB creams from Korea (where it originated) were having issues where consumers felt like they were getting fakes etc, so I thought I would give an American BB cream a try and after much research I settled on Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream and I am so glad I did.  I feel like I have finally found the perfect foundation/moisturizer etc.  I am extremely happy with it and hope they never get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and are trying to find the \\&quot;right\\&quot; foundation, try this and I don&#x27;t think you will be sorry!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for a summer day. Doesn&#x27;t provide a ton of coverage, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. Feels nice, definitely needs to be set though, otherwise it will be gone in a second</li>
            <li> I was worried because it was too light when I first sampled some, but then it blended in. I quite like it and they sent me two.</li>
            <li> I saw the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream in a department store and bought it on a whim since it was inexpensive and I have been wanting to find a great simple makeup/skincare combo solution for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have previously purchased one of the most raved about, original Korean BB creams, Super+ Beblesh Balm by Skin79, which has amazing reviews everywhere. I wanted to love the Super+ cream but had to admit I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan due to its thick consistency which settled into my fine lines and wrinkles, and also couldn&#x27;t stand that it was perfumed. For a product that&#x27;s supposed to do great things for your skin, perfume is one of the first ingredients you should avoid. So I ended up casting it aside and just layering moisturizer, sunscreen, foundation and powder instead which is a cumbersome routine every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I just bought the Maybelline BB cream yesterday, I can only state my experience so far after one day of use. First impression: I love how light it is. Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing something heavy on your skin. And no perfume! The active ingredient for sun protection is titanium dioxide which is non-irritating, causing minimal stinging in the eye area, and great for sensitive skin. I looked up all of the ingredients listed for this product and they all are good, recommended ingredients according to Paula Begoun, \\&quot;the Cosmetics Cop\\&quot; whose sensible and well-researched advice I trust. No irritating, unrecommended ingredients at all, although none of them what are considered super beneficial or potent antioxidants either, therefore I don&#x27;t think product can claim to do wonders for your skin. But the ingredients are basic and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe there are only 5 tint choices available for this cream but the product is supposed to blend with your skin so you don&#x27;t need a wide array. I am blonde with fair skin so I went with the Light Sheer Tint. It does indeed blend very well with my skintone. It is barely noticeable on my skin, if at all, which is great for a very natural look, yet it does even out my skin and helps cover minor blemishes. It makes my skin feel just very slightly sticky and shiny which means I do want to finish the look with a light dusting of powder instead of just running out the door with nothing but this on. As far as the product&#x27;s blurring, smoothing and enhancing capabilites, I wouldn&#x27;t say it does an amazing job at that... My pores do appear less obvious, but not to the extent that a good makeup primer would achieve. So just be realistic with your expectation on that. Brightening and enhancing? I don&#x27;t know about those claims either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this cream feels good on my skin, it does a nice, natural-looking job of evening out my skin tone, providing non-irritating sun protection, and functioning as a great all-in-one tinted SPF moisturizer with some beneficial ingredients for skin. I think it is a well thought-out product by Maybelline and I&#x27;m impressed to get something like this so inexpensively. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth buying if you&#x27;re looking for a great gentle everyday tinted sunscreen moisturizer that makes your morning routine super easy and simple!</li>
            <li> I always use it under my makeup. It&#x27;s a life saver. Great BB cream, I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I use it, I feel like my skin looks absolutely flawless, and I often get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this BB cream, but to my dismay, it did very little for me. As a matter of fact, the only thing it did for me was cause my skin to breakout.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have never found a foundation that I really like--I find that they are either too light or too dark, with no in between.  Also, most foundations feel too heavy to me.  I decided to give a BB Cream a try.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream 100 Light is the perfect shade for me.  It has a slight tint, so it evens my skin tone.  It also goes on nice and smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is caked on.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this product is that it can give you a slightly oily look.  However, I just dust a little bit of shine control powder on my face and it looks fine.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can&#x27;t leave home without wearing this BB Cream!  I feel naked without it!  I just feel like my skin looks pale, dull, and slightly red without it.  I hope they never discontinue this.  [If they do, my next best thing (even though it&#x27;s not a BB Cream) is elf Tinted Moisturizer in Porcelain.]</li>
            <li> Works really well just a little troublesome getting coverage on red bumps</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, bought this to use instead of powder foundation on days I don&#x27;t feel like doing the whole liquid foundation/brush/concealer/etc thing. Put it on over moisturizer (it feels like it would be a bit dry by itself) and about an hour later I dusted on some translucent setting powder. I actually think it looks better than my regular foundation, even though it does cover a bit less. The silicone in it gives your skin a really nice texture--not oily, but very smooth. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light looked like it might be too dark or orange for me but it wasn&#x27;t a problem once I put it on. I even did a few layers on my cheeks for a bit more coverage (rosacea) and still didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the color. I wear 110 in Maybelline&#x27;s Fit Me liquid foundation, which is very pale and yellow/olive, so I don&#x27;t think it should cause any problems for anyone.</li>
            <li> I tried this out for overall better skin. its light and has a really nice sheer tint to it. I wear it every day and makes my skin look nice. I did a lot of research on this product before purchasing it but it really does everything it claims it will do. I will deffinately be purchasing again</li>
            <li> This is outstanding!  It does not really cover well so I use makeup over it, but it has made my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 4 years now. It meets all my needs as it moisturizes, gives me SPF, and smooth coverage all day.</li>
            <li> My skin is fair and it is difficult to find a product that does not look natural but rather dark and a line around my jaw. This Dream Fresh BB was heaven sent. I use the light sheer tint and you would not believe how many comments I get about how beautiful my skin looks. I just dust a little transluscent powder over my nose and boom I am done with my make-up for the day. I highly recommend this product if you can get the right tint like I was able to.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell at the beginning. Then the texture was very strange. I put it on after the moisturizer/sunscreen and leave it to dry, and a short while later I apply the powder but the powder didn&#x27;t stay in an even way. and my shirt was full of little balls of powder.  I was using Ponds BB cream before trying this one and only after 2-3 weeks of using this Maybelline BB cream my face got lots of patches because of the sun. This cream isn&#x27;t an SPF nor a skin concealer. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago when I was on a weekend trip and forgot my foundation.  I usually prefer foundations that feel light on the skin and have tried a few other brands of BB creams before, but this Maybelline one is so light that it didn&#x27;t cover up my redness or dark spots at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it and has a good amount of SPF in it, but if you need more coverage (as I do), then I&#x27;d suggest trying another brand.  The Skin 79 version in the pink bottle seems to work well for me; while it leaves a grey tone at first, it soon blends in and offers smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m super impressed.  My original intention was to use this in lieu of foundation on days I planned to spend outside -- for the beach, etc.  I prefer to use something tinted on my face instead of straight sunscreen, so I was excited about the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: I liked the consistency, and it felt very moisturizing on the skin.  SPF 30 is pretty high for a tinted product, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: The coverage is really not great, which I expected (considering it&#x27;s not intended to be as full-coverage as foundation) but this really doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot -- basically nothing, in fact.  Also, I have very pale skin, and the &amp;#34;light sheer tint&amp;#34; shade still had a rather orange undertone that looked a bit too dark on me.  It also made my face look extremely dewy...borderline sweaty, which meant I needed to set it with some powder for it to look passable (which means I might as well just apply foundation).  It didn&#x27;t look awful, but for the lightest shade in the range, I was really hoping it would be designed for truly pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line -- western BB creams aren&#x27;t as good as the ones made in Korea, which are more full-coverage.  If you&#x27;re darker skinned this might work okay for you, but prepare to look a bit sweaty.</li>
            <li> Very  happy with this purchase! :)</li>
            <li> It provides a nice light coverage and is good if you just have some redness to cover up. You&#x27;ll need something heavier to conceal blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love this! It is so smooth, glides on very nicely, and it&#x27;s not to heavy! Sometimes I&#x27;m good to go with just this and some mascara. It does a good job at concealing too :)</li>
            <li> I use Pond&#x27;s facial cream (although I am switching to clinique lotion soon-less greasy) to help with my flaky dry skin during the winter. Even when putting that on, my makeup still looked terrible and showed my dry patches. With the BB cream, it is much better and my skin looks more hydrated. It honestly doesn&#x27;t have the best coverage, I use a spot concealer along with this BB cream and that seems to do the trick for me. Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good product for the price.</li>
