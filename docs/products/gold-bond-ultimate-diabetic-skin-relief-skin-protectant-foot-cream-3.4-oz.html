            <li>but there is better</li>
            <li>I have tried several diabetic foot creams and this one is the best for nuropathy.</li>
            <li>Much better than most moisturizers for my arid skin (bottoms of my feet).</li>
            <li>but this foot cream is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>This cream does an excellent job protecting dry skin.</li>

            <li>It could be more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>not bad</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>First time anything has worked at all, much less so amazingly well!</li>
            <li>To be honest, the Gold Bond Ultimate Diabetic Skin Relief cream is not cheaper from Amazon, but it&#x27;s a hard-to-find item locally, so I&#x27;m just glad to get it.</li>

            <li>Tryed hand cream really like the way it made my hands feel so wanted to try the foot cream.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have any particular scent.  </li>
            <li>Smooth skin in less than an hour, just like it is advertised.</li>
            <li>I need only apply it once daily after my morning shower to feel adequately moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li>But found it didn&#x27;t make my feet as soft as hands.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely helped the dry skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li>This cream really does the job for dry, cracked feet.  </li>

            <li> This product absolutely helped the dry skin on my feet.  I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It goes on easily every night and makes my feet feel great.</li>
            <li> Healing power is incredible, I am happy that I ordered this lotion.</li>
            <li> Better than anything I have tried for dry feet.  The foot cream is a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This cream does an excellent job protecting dry skin. I need only apply it once daily after my morning shower to feel adequately moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is the only diabetic foot cream that works for my feet, and I&#x27;ve tried everything else out there.  It is thick and a little goes a long way.  After it&#x27;s dried on your skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to stay in my socks and it doesn&#x27;t have any particular scent.  (I used another brand of diabetic foot cream that made my socks - and everything else in the sock drawer - smell like rancid grease.  It took several washings to get that smell out.)  To be honest, the Gold Bond Ultimate Diabetic Skin Relief cream is not cheaper from Amazon, but it&#x27;s a hard-to-find item locally, so I&#x27;m just glad to get it.</li>
            <li> not bad but there is better</li>
            <li> Tryed hand cream really like the way it made my hands feel so wanted to try the foot cream. But found it didn&#x27;t make my feet as soft as hands. Still have cracks in my feet and takes several times for it to work if that.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Feet look and feel better almost instantly. First time anything has worked at all, much less so amazingly well!</li>
            <li> Gold bond products are always good. I have tried several diabetic foot creams and this one is the best for nuropathy. It could be more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Ultimate Diabetic Skin Relief Skin Protectant Foot Cream (3.4 Oz ) This works very well.  My feet have never been smoother.</li>
            <li> nice cream for diabetic skin</li>
            <li> i have very dry arms, feet and an oily face. i put gold bond diabetic foot cream on all of these parts every night before bed. it keeps me from scratching in the middle of the night and makes my skin nice and soft!  the thickness of this cream is great for your face as an overnight face cream, and of course it&#x27;s terrific on feet and arms! and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Having been using for a couple of weeks and it has had an immediate impact. Much better than most moisturizers for my arid skin (bottoms of my feet).</li>
            <li> I had used it before so it was no surprise but it is excellent for diabetic skin care.</li>
            <li> Has helped with the major callouses, softening them.  My foot doctor said there was improvement to very rough skin on the soles and tops of my feet.  Find the foot cream takes awhile to penetrate into the skin so I use it at bedtime.  This seems to work well for me.</li>
            <li> In general Gold Bond products are the best but this foot cream is outstanding.  I have only used it for a few days now but my feet already feel great and the skin is looking so much better.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what to expect. Therefore I assume that the product is doing what it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> This cream really does the job for dry, cracked feet.  Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smooth skin in less than an hour, just like it is advertised. AND, seems to lessen the pain of neuropathy.</li>
