    <ol>
            <li>This was the best price for the Brite Eyes 111 on the internet I could find, no shipping and handling at the time also.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>You are better off putting the money in the bank and saving up towards cataract surgery!!!</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t even do a good job of lubricating the eyes!  </li>
            <li>Great eye drops.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for when you have eyestrain from computer work.</li>

            <li>Bright Eyes III is a product I ordered for a cataract condition.</li>
            <li>This is a good investment.</li>
            <li>Surgery would not be good at all</li>
            <li>, so maybe I had good \\&quot;old\\&quot; lenses to begin with.seated in the lens capsule</li>
            <li>, so maybe I had good \\&quot;old\\&quot; lenses to begin with.</li>
            <li>Since I use them up fairly quickly I like finding the best price I can, and I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Was very satisfied when received.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I have been doing this for about 30 years and it has surely has paid off!</li>
            <li>If I let then stand and warm up to room temperature they do not sting.</li>
            <li>This has been the best so far</li>
            <li>He seemed happy and engaged in the world in his walks, for the first time in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrives on time and am satisfied with the order.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, great price, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Today, I look like I&#x27;ve been smoking something. :-)</li>
            <li>I was more worried about it than her.</li>
            <li>I have eye problems and have used many eye drop brands for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>At night he still has some problems but is much better.  </li>
            <li>After about  a week we noticed she was seeing better.  </li>
            <li>She isn&#x27;t bumping into things and can see much better, she still has cataracts</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using these drops, I now can sort of see his pupils and some color to his eyes-and he does seem to see a bit better.  </li>
            <li>The cataracts are still there, but slightly more transparent.  </li>
            <li>I sure hope it helps cataracts and improves my sight some.</li>
            <li>One would think they could have come up with a better solution with straps and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One would think they could have come up with a better solution with straps and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product for 89 year old with cataracts.  </li>
            <li>it makes you feel better, feel free to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the safe delivery!</li>
            <li>When our Terrier mix was about 14 years old, I started buying the Bright Eyes drops from another supplier.  </li>
            <li>My order was filled and shipped to me promptly.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for very dry eyes.</li>
            <li>&quot; is now 16+ years old, no cataracts, and amazing everyone.  </li>
            <li>It is truly amazing, as I have pretty much given up hope of ever resolving my eye problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never stop using these because he has such a good quality of life at this age, without the cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is much happier and I am so glad we found this.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to Can-C eye drop I feel that that Brite Eyes is not as good for my condition as the latter product is.</li>
            <li>For $20.00, not bad as I was considering getting them lasered off.  </li>
            <li>Make sure when you open the bottle and have to pierce the tip use a very fine sewing needle to make the puncture.</li>
            <li>Depending on the type of cataract and other factors, this product may be of great benefit.  </li>
            <li>Her close up vision has improved,not as quick as the distance.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to make a quick judgement of this product I wanted to give it a chance to work.</li>
            <li>No other product as effective</li>
            <li>I really do not feel that Bright Eyes III has helped me in any way.</li>
            <li>This is worth a try for under $[...]</li>
            <li>After using this product she could see better, it helped to clear up her vision so that she didn&#x27;t run in to things and could jump up on the bed again.</li>
            <li>Maybe amazon doesn&#x27;t have a fresh product supply, I don&#x27;t know what else it can be.</li>
            <li>I suppose the product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>So I did some research and found Brite Eyes III to give to her and have since bought about 6 boxes worth.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>My family physician perscribed these eye drops due to the good results that have been recorded  from a test done using these drops.</li>
            <li>At that time they refrected me and my vision in that eye was about 20/50 and 20/25 in my right eye (which has the start of a cateract).</li>
            <li>I got blurry vision in my right eye that stayed with me&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a cloudy patch in his right eye.  </li>
            <li>I have studied nutrition for many years  and at 46 years old am extremely healthy, which can be proven by the extensive tests that my doctor has given me each year.</li>
            <li>evening, I had mostly good vision, but some slight blurriness.</li>
            <li>I only wish the price was better.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel great after using it, but have not used it long enough to notice an impact on cataracts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They really do work!</li>
            <li>The first month three times a day and now we use once a day.  </li>
            <li>The bottle(s) is much higher quality</li>
            <li>I have just finished my first 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li>It just a matter of realizing that the burning one feels in the eyes after placing the drops in them last the most some twenty seconds.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the cataract has progressed almost exactly as predicted and</li>
            <li>When I opened the pack and read the fine print, it said they were solely intended to relieve dryness, but I also read that N-acetyl-carnosine is an inactive ingredient, which apparently is to satisfy the FDA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just placed another order because of the positive improvement.</li>
            <li>The amino acid carnosine in them is very beneficial to eye health and repair.</li>
            <li>Her distance has improved so much.</li>
            <li>We were told that her cataracts were now classified as \\&quot;very mild\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>My dog thanks all of you who posted before me.</li>
            <li>I really had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really wanted a refill on&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Vision is much, much, improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Vision is much, much, improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I should be able to see the changes in my old dog and took a photo I can compare to later.</li>
            <li>Save your money and find a better product--I went back to Natural Opthalmics myself.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old boxer had cataracts on his right eye.</li>
            <li>Both of them also sting quite a bit, more than any other drops I have used, once in a while they don&#x27;t sting, but that is the exception.</li>
            <li>Sometimes more than other times -- I can&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a full 5 star rating is because I can&#x27;t measure the effect since I&#x27;m using them on my dog.</li>
            <li>I use Brite Eyes III for beginning cataracts (mild, just age related)</li>
            <li>The vials are very tiny so will be used up quickly</li>
            <li>Also, as I got older, I began to get what are called \\&quot;protein</li>
            <li>I highly doubt it.  </li>
            <li>minor letdown was that I was told I&#x27;d see these amazing new colors with the new lens, because my natural lenses are decades old and the replacements are shiny and such.</li>
            <li>minor letdown was that I was told I&#x27;d see these amazing new colors with the new lens, because my natural lenses are decades old and the replacements are shiny and such.</li>
            <li>Exercise, the right nutrients (vitamins and herbs) and eating well are the key.</li>
            <li>New eyeglass prescription in 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>New eyeglass prescription in 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>The dog showed slow signs of improvement with being able to see better and can now go up and down stairs, will jump up on your lap and even into bed once again.  </li>
            <li>was using Can-C previously, and could easily get 30+ days per bottle.  </li>
            <li>The second important factor is to use them on a regular basis and not allow a day to pass without using them.</li>
            <li>However, I am not sure if her vision is much better of if she is just beginning to cope with her new condition.</li>
            <li>It is the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these, somewhat foolishly, under the impression they help clear up floaters - first of all, I doubt there is an eyedrop that can do that - second of all - it&#x27;s stings!!!</li>
            <li>6 months ago the eye doctor told me that the cataract in my left eye (first diagnosed about 20 years ago) was not operable for several reasons, the main being the high risk of retinal detachment because of my progressive myopia, even though it had begun to cause problems with my vision to the extent that I wanted to do something about it.</li>
            <li>Also using on my dog ( Brite Eyes III is actually less expensive per ounce, if you check around for best prices, than  N-acetyl-carnosine drops made for animals!  </li>
            <li>Brite Eyes III helps to sooth the eyes and clear blurry vision.  </li>
            <li>I did some research online and found out that N-acetyl-carnosine will clear up cataracts.</li>
            <li>We have started using this on our 15 yr old Schnoodle as preventative measure.</li>
            <li>Our dog is diabetic and has developed glucose cataracts on her eyes.  </li>
            <li>My dog is a shiba inu who is 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>You also want to rinse off what gets on the sensitive skin around the eyes after a bit.  </li>
            <li>But I had no alternative until I found these natural drops.</li>
            <li>old shih tzu.  </li>
            <li>During daylight his vision is markedly improved.  </li>
            <li>I have what&#x27;s called \\&quot;floaters\\&quot; in my eyesight, dry  and red, irritated eyes due to a facial skin condition called \\&quot;Roscea\\&quot; which causes my face to turn a bright red and these problems with my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for when you have been outside for a long period of time and need to wash allergens and other foreign particles from your eyes.</li>
            <li>He recently told me after my recent complete set of tests, that I have the insides of an adult in their early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been about a two weeks so far</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;These eye drops are not that effective and have a weird consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We noticed slight improvement after the first week and it has continued.</li>
            <li>Was really hoping this would work based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>left eye was not as bad as right cleared first, but after getting into the second bottle I am seeing the right start to clear also.  </li>
            <li>I just use two drops daily for the first couple of weeks and went down to one drop before bed time.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than cataract surgery, they sting a little but are supposed too.  </li>
            <li>These drops are very soothing and lubricating and they do help my vision a little bit.</li>
            <li>My sixteen year old Schnauzer had moderate cataracts with only limited vision in her left eye.</li>

            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a full 5 star rating is because I can&#x27;t measure the effect since I&#x27;m using them on my dog.</li>
            <li> I use Brite Eyes III for beginning cataracts (mild, just age related)</li>
            <li> The vials are very tiny so will be used up quickly</li>
            <li> Also, as I got older, I began to get what are called \\&quot;protein</li>
            <li> I highly doubt it.  </li>
            <li> minor letdown was that I was told I&#x27;d see these amazing new colors with the new lens, because my natural lenses are decades old and the replacements are shiny and such.</li>

            <li> New eyeglass prescription in 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> The dog showed slow signs of improvement with being able to see better and can now go up and down stairs, will jump up on your lap and even into bed once again.  </li>
            <li> was using Can-C previously, and could easily get 30+ days per bottle.  </li>
            <li> The second important factor is to use them on a regular basis and not allow a day to pass without using them.</li>
            <li> However, I am not sure if her vision is much better of if she is just beginning to cope with her new condition.</li>
            <li> It is the exact same product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these, somewhat foolishly, under the impression they help clear up floaters - first of all, I doubt there is an eyedrop that can do that - second of all - it&#x27;s stings!!!</li>
            <li> 6 months ago the eye doctor told me that the cataract in my left eye (first diagnosed about 20 years ago) was not operable for several reasons, the main being the high risk of retinal detachment because of my progressive myopia, even though it had begun to cause problems with my vision to the extent that I wanted to do something about it.</li>
            <li> Also using on my dog ( Brite Eyes III is actually less expensive per ounce, if you check around for best prices, than  N-acetyl-carnosine drops made for animals!  </li>
            <li> Brite Eyes III helps to sooth the eyes and clear blurry vision.  </li>
            <li> I did some research online and found out that N-acetyl-carnosine will clear up cataracts.</li>
            <li> We have started using this on our 15 yr old Schnoodle as preventative measure.</li>
            <li> Our dog is diabetic and has developed glucose cataracts on her eyes.  </li>
            <li> My dog is a shiba inu who is 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> You also want to rinse off what gets on the sensitive skin around the eyes after a bit.  </li>
            <li> But I had no alternative until I found these natural drops.</li>
            <li> old shih tzu.  </li>
            <li> During daylight his vision is markedly improved.  </li>
            <li> I have what&#x27;s called \\&quot;floaters\\&quot; in my eyesight, dry  and red, irritated eyes due to a facial skin condition called \\&quot;Roscea\\&quot; which causes my face to turn a bright red and these problems with my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for when you have been outside for a long period of time and need to wash allergens and other foreign particles from your eyes.</li>
            <li> He recently told me after my recent complete set of tests, that I have the insides of an adult in their early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been about a two weeks so far</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;These eye drops are not that effective and have a weird consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We noticed slight improvement after the first week and it has continued.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping this would work based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> left eye was not as bad as right cleared first, but after getting into the second bottle I am seeing the right start to clear also.  </li>
            <li> I just use two drops daily for the first couple of weeks and went down to one drop before bed time.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than cataract surgery, they sting a little but are supposed too.  </li>
            <li> These drops are very soothing and lubricating and they do help my vision a little bit.</li>
            <li> My sixteen year old Schnauzer had moderate cataracts with only limited vision in her left eye.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment on tahat.</li>
            <li> But with these new eye drops, within 6 months, my floaters have totally disappeared, my dry and red eye is totally gone(no eye drops that I ever used in the past ever worked) and the protein deposits in the liquid of my eyes have also totally disappeared.</li>
            <li> less stars/flair around car lights at night while driving -- noticed that early on.  </li>
            <li> Our Miniature Schnauzer got diabetes and developed cataracts that blinded her in a few short days, it was heartbreaking</li>
            <li> They help clear the \\&quot;clouds\\&quot; in my vision which are due to factors of age, loose tissue and build up of protein.</li>
            <li> They warn you not to twist too hard, you can make the hole too large.  </li>
            <li> Apparently that happened to me because after 10 days usage I have just a little bit left at the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I will continue to use themas long as I continue to see improvement in my vision!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I began \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; with these drops, visual impairment from the cataract was minimal.  </li>
            <li> If no positive change, I&#x27;ll come back and give it 1 star.  </li>
            <li> I am now on my third order and have developed an eye infection serious enough that I had to go see my eye doctor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know just how much more improvement I will get (I still have problems with glare and ghost images in my left eye but not as bad)</li>
            <li> I use them to soothe my dry eyes and inflammation, too.</li>
            <li> am also starting them in my right eye to see if that new cateract can be stopped in it&#x27;s tracks before it gets as bad as the one in my other</li>
            <li> /&gt;So be forwarned, Brite Eyes will only be half the price (of Can-C) if you&#x27;re really careful each time you close the cap.  </li>
            <li> They are little dark specks that float around in the liquid in my eyes and are slightly bothersome, but not a major problem, as I can see them, especially when looking at for example white walls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be curious to see what the exam reveals, but that will be months from now.  </li>
            <li> The other eye drops over the 20 odd years that I used to use not only didn&#x27;t work, but they actually made my dry and red eyes worse, having to put them in 4 to 6 times a day.</li>
            <li> hard to rate as the bottle (not top) leaked &amp; only left enough for perhaps a week of treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do want to try other products like can-c.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks, he has no observable vision issues, other than that his eyes still look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just wear a contact in the other eye until then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just wear a contact in the other eye until then.</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ll be using the standard fixed IOL, as I&#x27;m concerned about annoying halos and glare (about 1/3rd of patients) and reduced contrast sensitivity (apparently the FAA will not license commercial pilots who have multifocal IOL&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still slight blurriness, but not much.</li>
            <li> The packaging requires you to perforate the tip of the bottle by removing a clip and then twisting down on the cap.  </li>
            <li> and I never had this problem (and never worried about how tight I was twisting the cap...</li>
            <li> He said that the cataract had not gotten any worse since the last visit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I plan on seeing the eye doc in a few months.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to justify the cost for the results I have so far.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> We got this a couple of months ago and have faithfully used everyday.  </li>
            <li> Beginning approximately 1.5 years ago, I began using these drops daily.  </li>
            <li> He has been completely blind in one eye for several months, and his other eye was deteriorating to the point that he bumped into things, and didn&#x27;t like to go out at night.  </li>
            <li> They are the only drops that relieve the redness in my dog&#x27;s eyes--even expensive prescriptions couldn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Product is conveniently packaged in two small vials.  </li>
            <li> My eye sight is no better and</li>
            <li> but not much better then refresh</li>
            <li> After a month the sunlight wouldn&#x27;t bother her hardly at all anymore.  </li>
            <li> At least if will stave off surgery for a while.</li>
            <li> VERY expensive, but they worked at clearing up the cataracts that he was starting to get.  </li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t play ball anymore and was walking into things all of the time, she was afraid to move around, and wouldn&#x27;t go up or down stairs nor would she jump into your lap anymore.  </li>
            <li> My dog got diabetes and was slowly going blind.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 16 year old dog whom had very bad cataracts and would run into walls.  </li>
            <li> and if they worked (about which I was a bit skeptical)</li>
            <li> It is sad, but my dog learned how to get around blind.  </li>
            <li> not that I ever twisted either brand too</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would work as well as the claims.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my Boston Terrier, who got cataracts and went blind.</li>
            <li> The Doc says that&#x27;s because the artificial lens is not yet fully seated in the lens capsule and it&#x27;s moving around a bit.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel quite \\&quot;normal\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t feel bad either.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel quite \\&quot;normal\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t feel bad either.</li>
            <li> the opinion is cleat - this is worthless</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this product becuse I have an eye disease, and I thought it might help the health of my eyes. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment on tahat. Thanks for the safe delivery!</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer for these drops. They are the only drops that relieve the redness in my dog&#x27;s eyes--even expensive prescriptions couldn&#x27;t do that. I use them to soothe my dry eyes and inflammation, too. The amino acid carnosine in them is very beneficial to eye health and repair. I recommend them to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Brite Eyes eye drops seem to be the same formula as Can-C drops for cataracts.  I have noticed improvement in my cataracts since using both of them.  I would have given them five stars except for the fact that both of them make my eyes very red and almost bloodshot.  I took a month break to give my eyes time to recover, but as soon as I started back on them, my eyes are always red again.  I still plan to continue with them because of the improvement but wish they would not have this side effect. Both of them also sting quite a bit, more than any other drops I have used, once in a while they don&#x27;t sting, but that is the exception.</li>
            <li> My sixteen year old Schnauzer had moderate cataracts with only limited vision in her left eye. Rather than subjecting her to surgery I started investigating alternative methods.She will be on these drops for almost a month. We noticed slight improvement after the first week and it has continued. Her distance has improved so much. She is not crashing into things and sees us from afar and comes up to us now. Her close up vision has improved,not as quick as the distance.We took her to the vet for an eye exam prior to use and yesterday. We were told that her cataracts were now classified as \\&quot;very mild\\&quot;. I love it! If you decide to purchase this there is only one thing to do. Make sure when you open the bottle and have to pierce the tip use a very fine sewing needle to make the puncture. We have started using this on our 15 yr old Schnoodle as preventative measure. Thank God for this product!</li>
            <li> When our Terrier mix was about 14 years old, I started buying the Bright Eyes drops from another supplier.  VERY expensive, but they worked at clearing up the cataracts that he was starting to get.  About a year ago, I found the III version on Amazon and ordered, at a substantial discount.  It is the exact same product.  Same bottle, even the same Lot number on the bottle.  I put one drop in each of his eyes daily.  The cataracts are gone, he chases bunnies, and can see like a pup.  I&#x27;ll never stop using these because he has such a good quality of life at this age, without the cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update October 2011:  \\&quot;Puppy\\&quot; is now 16+ years old, no cataracts, and amazing everyone.  These drops work!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for very dry eyes. Two years ago I had to have a detached retina corrected and I have tried every product under the sun to help my healing process. This has been the best so far but I do want to try other products like can-c. I only wish the price was better. Great eye drops.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and, when I received it, read the ingredients but no where do I find that it contains N Acetyl carnosine.  We&#x27;ll see if it lives up to the reputation that everyone keeps raving about.  I highly doubt it.  I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> Brite Eyes III helps to sooth the eyes and clear blurry vision.  I have used this product for some time now and it&#x27;s great for when you have eyestrain from computer work. It&#x27;s also good for when you have been outside for a long period of time and need to wash allergens and other foreign particles from your eyes.</li>
            <li> My order was filled and shipped to me promptly.  Product is conveniently packaged in two small vials.  In about six months I will write about the effects of the \\&quot;inert\\&quot; ingredients.</li>
            <li> Read reviews on this product before I purchased it.  I have ordered it twice now.  My eyes feel great after using it, but have not used it long enough to notice an impact on cataracts.  Arrives on time and am satisfied with the order.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old boxer had cataracts on his right eye. I did some research online and found out that N-acetyl-carnosine will clear up cataracts. I bought this just to try out and it really works. It cleared it all up in just 6 weeks and that was over a year ago. They say you should use it daily to keep it from coming back. I stop using it after the cataracts went away. I just notice it was coming back so I am ordering another one of these. I just use two drops daily for the first couple of weeks and went down to one drop before bed time. I didn&#x27;t even get to finish up the 2 vials and his cataracts was all gone. This is a good investment. Surgery would not be good at all and it doesn&#x27;t always work. This is worth a try for under $[...]</li>
            <li> Our dog is diabetic and has developed glucose cataracts on her eyes.  After using this product she could see better, it helped to clear up her vision so that she didn&#x27;t run in to things and could jump up on the bed again.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping this would work based on other reviews.  Used this product for 6 months without any change in vision.  You are better off putting the money in the bank and saving up towards cataract surgery!!!</li>
            <li> My family physician perscribed these eye drops due to the good results that have been recorded  from a test done using these drops.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this item for my father who has cataracts. I don&#x27;t think we will know the efficacy of Brite Eyes for him for about 3 months. Hopefully I can update the results. It does come with a lot of promise for hope in clearing the lens</li>
            <li> My dog is a shiba inu who is 15 years old.  He has been completely blind in one eye for several months, and his other eye was deteriorating to the point that he bumped into things, and didn&#x27;t like to go out at night.  The vet said he has cataracts, and he will soon be totally blind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these eye drops based on what I read.  When I opened the pack and read the fine print, it said they were solely intended to relieve dryness, but I also read that N-acetyl-carnosine is an inactive ingredient, which apparently is to satisfy the FDA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put one drop in each eye at bedtime.  After a week, he could see movement out of the \\&quot;blind\\&quot; eye.  I moved my finger toward the eye and he flinched, which he had not done in months.  He stopped bumping into things.  He seemed happy and engaged in the world in his walks, for the first time in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks, he has no observable vision issues, other than that his eyes still look cloudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using these.  My dog thanks all of you who posted before me.</li>
            <li> 6 months ago the eye doctor told me that the cataract in my left eye (first diagnosed about 20 years ago) was not operable for several reasons, the main being the high risk of retinal detachment because of my progressive myopia, even though it had begun to cause problems with my vision to the extent that I wanted to do something about it. At that time they refrected me and my vision in that eye was about 20/50 and 20/25 in my right eye (which has the start of a cateract). I started using these drops the same week, two drops twice a day in my left eye since i felt that the only thing I had to lose was money and if they worked (about which I was a bit skeptical) it was the only option I really had.&lt;br /&gt;I just returned from the eye doctor and my vision in my left eye has improved to 20/30. This is in 6 months time I was amazed and so was the doctor. His response was \\&quot;Your eyes are getting younger.\\&quot; He had never heard of N-acetyl carnosine eye drops but said to continue them since the drops appeard to be working. He said that the cataract had not gotten any worse since the last visit.&lt;br /&gt;I though that my vision had improved but did not want to review the drops until I had some type of confirmation from the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;They really do work! I don&#x27;t know just how much more improvement I will get (I still have problems with glare and ghost images in my left eye but not as bad) but I will continue to use themas long as I continue to see improvement in my vision!&lt;br /&gt;I am also starting them in my right eye to see if that new cateract can be stopped in it&#x27;s tracks before it gets as bad as the one in my other eye.&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that the Brite Eyes III drops do cause occasional stinging but I think that is because I keep them in the refrigerator. If I let then stand and warm up to room temperature they do not sting.</li>
            <li> This was the best price for the Brite Eyes 111 on the internet I could find, no shipping and handling at the time also. I use them on my dog for her cataract. Since I use them up fairly quickly I like finding the best price I can, and I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, great price, as advertised.  Great product for 89 year old with cataracts.  No other product as effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d try one order and see how you tolerate it.  Brite Eyes III irritates my eyes.  Sometimes more than other times -- I can&#x27;t figure out why. Today, I look like I&#x27;ve been smoking something. :-) You also want to rinse off what gets on the sensitive skin around the eyes after a bit.  I use Brite Eyes III for beginning cataracts (mild, just age related) so I need an N-acetyl-carnosine drops.  I&#x27;ve just completed week 3.  Also using on my dog ( Brite Eyes III is actually less expensive per ounce, if you check around for best prices, than  N-acetyl-carnosine drops made for animals!  You can find those on-line and in some pet stores. You can only get drops touted for human use, on-line from what I can see).  I plan on seeing the eye doc in a few months.  I have noticed (perhaps my imagination!) less stars/flair around car lights at night while driving -- noticed that early on.  I&#x27;ll be curious to see what the exam reveals, but that will be months from now.  I hit 3 stars to try to be neutral for now.  I&#x27;ll add an update but that won&#x27;t be until after I get an independent assessment from the eye doc (I had an exam, a couple months before starting the drops, that I can compare to).  If no positive change, I&#x27;ll come back and give it 1 star.  I should be able to see the changes in my old dog and took a photo I can compare to later.</li>
            <li> I got blurry vision in my right eye that stayed with me&lt;br /&gt;since I injured my eye with an eyelash curler...&lt;br /&gt;These eye drops are not that effective and have a weird consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My vision actually improved after I tried another company(NAC Drops),&lt;br /&gt;They seem to have the same ingredient list but feel&lt;br /&gt;like 2 completely different eye drops. Maybe amazon doesn&#x27;t have a fresh product supply, I don&#x27;t know what else it can be.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product because the prime ingredient was suppose to help with floaters as well as cataracts (based on research). I have used the product now six weeks with no noticeable reduction of the floaters.  The vials are very tiny so will be used up quickly and the product can severely sting your eyes for a bit.  It is difficult to justify the cost for the results I have so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased these, somewhat foolishly, under the impression they help clear up floaters - first of all, I doubt there is an eyedrop that can do that - second of all - it&#x27;s stings!!!</li>
            <li> Used this for over six months faithfully. It had no affect on reducing or slowing the progression of my cataract.I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My dog got diabetes and was slowly going blind. This product suggested it would help and since I was grasping at straws I bought it.  Waste of money.  It is sad, but my dog learned how to get around blind.  I was more worried about it than her.</li>
            <li> I have eye problems and have used many eye drop brands for over 20 years. I have what&#x27;s called \\&quot;floaters\\&quot; in my eyesight, dry  and red, irritated eyes due to a facial skin condition called \\&quot;Roscea\\&quot; which causes my face to turn a bright red and these problems with my eyes. Also, as I got older, I began to get what are called \\&quot;protein deposits\\&quot; in my eyesight. They are little dark specks that float around in the liquid in my eyes and are slightly bothersome, but not a major problem, as I can see them, especially when looking at for example white walls. But with these new eye drops, within 6 months, my floaters have totally disappeared, my dry and red eye is totally gone(no eye drops that I ever used in the past ever worked) and the protein deposits in the liquid of my eyes have also totally disappeared. And this is by putting only one drop in each eye, once in the morning. It is truly amazing, as I have pretty much given up hope of ever resolving my eye problems. The other eye drops over the 20 odd years that I used to use not only didn&#x27;t work, but they actually made my dry and red eyes worse, having to put them in 4 to 6 times a day. But I had no alternative until I found these natural drops. I have studied nutrition for many years  and at 46 years old am extremely healthy, which can be proven by the extensive tests that my doctor has given me each year. He recently told me after my recent complete set of tests, that I have the insides of an adult in their early 30&#x27;s. But everyone that meets me also thinks this. Exercise, the right nutrients (vitamins and herbs) and eating well are the key. I have been doing this for about 30 years and it has surely has paid off!</li>
            <li> Bright Eyes III is a product I ordered for a cataract condition. Not wanting to make a quick judgement of this product I wanted to give it a chance to work. I am now on my third order and have developed an eye infection serious enough that I had to go see my eye doctor. My eye doctor gave me a perscription to take care of the eye infection. I really do not feel that Bright Eyes III has helped me in any way. My eye sight is no better and the only thing that has come out of this is an eye infection.</li>
            <li> We got this for our six yr. old shih tzu.  His vision has been going downhill recently and he was running into things.  There was a cloudy patch in his right eye.  We got this a couple of months ago and have faithfully used everyday.  The first month three times a day and now we use once a day.  He is definitely improving.  During daylight his vision is markedly improved.  At night he still has some problems but is much better.  He is much happier and I am so glad we found this.  I just placed another order because of the positive improvement.</li>
            <li> I suppose the product is worth a try.  I really wanted a refill on&lt;br /&gt;Similasan Cataract Care.  I don&#x27;t like this product as well.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The packaging requires you to perforate the tip of the bottle by removing a clip and then twisting down on the cap.  They warn you not to twist too hard, you can make the hole too large.  Apparently that happened to me because after 10 days usage I have just a little bit left at the bottom of the bottle.  That&#x27;s going to make the bottle cost about 3x what it should.  And every time you close the bottle, your twist can enlarge the hole, and the problem gets worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Can-C previously, and could easily get 30+ days per bottle.  The bottle(s) is much higher quality and I never had this problem (and never worried about how tight I was twisting the cap...not that I ever twisted either brand too much!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be forwarned, Brite Eyes will only be half the price (of Can-C) if you&#x27;re really careful each time you close the cap.  As soon as Can-C is back on the market, I will probably go back to using it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would work as well as the claims.  I used it on my 16 year old dog whom had very bad cataracts and would run into walls.  After about  a week we noticed she was seeing better.  After a month the sunlight wouldn&#x27;t bother her hardly at all anymore.  I would recommend this product to anyone for themselves or their pets.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than cataract surgery, they sting a little but are supposed too.  left eye was not as bad as right cleared first, but after getting into the second bottle I am seeing the right start to clear also.  Didn&#x27;t expect that!!</li>
            <li> Our Miniature Schnauzer got diabetes and developed cataracts that blinded her in a few short days, it was heartbreaking and I could tell that the dog was depressed.  She couldn&#x27;t play ball anymore and was walking into things all of the time, she was afraid to move around, and wouldn&#x27;t go up or down stairs nor would she jump into your lap anymore.  So I did some research and found Brite Eyes III to give to her and have since bought about 6 boxes worth.  The dog showed slow signs of improvement with being able to see better and can now go up and down stairs, will jump up on your lap and even into bed once again.  She isn&#x27;t bumping into things and can see much better, she still has cataracts but it has been a noticeable improvement and I will continue giving her the eye drops.</li>
            <li> My dog is diabetic and her Cataract is the result of that condition. Brite Eyes can be attributed to clearing up her eyes to a noticeable degree in terms of clarity. However, I am not sure if her vision is much better of if she is just beginning to cope with her new condition. My current estimation is that she may have some vision back during daylight conditions.</li>
            <li> I purchased it and applied it.&lt;br /&gt;No effect whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I talked to my ophthalmologists before eye surgery -  the opinion is cleat - this is worthless</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first 2 bottles.  It does help me see when my vision starts getting blurry.  I guess I will need to use them a while before I know if they actually help my cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008RLVTBI How to Be a Good Wife: Secrets for a Happy Marriage]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0086ZCVZ8 All About Wheatgrass. How to Use, Juice and Grow Wheatgrass.]]</li>
            <li> Had cataracts.  Notice the word &amp;#34;had&amp;#34;.  After taking for about 1 month, everything cleared up!  Great stuff!  I will use again if any reoccurrence comes up.</li>
            <li> I got it for my Min-Pin who for the 2nd time has cataracts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of you are considering the surgery with the lens implants, you may wish to re-think as I had this done on him 3 years ago and approx. $3500.00 later they are back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these drops, I now can sort of see his pupils and some color to his eyes-and he does seem to see a bit better.  The cataracts are still there, but slightly more transparent.  For $20.00, not bad as I was considering getting them lasered off.  I&#x27;m also going to try the Can-C to find out if that is any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue to use these drops or Can-C.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t have cataracts, but an inherited disease called Fuch&#x27;s Corneal Dystrophy. These drops are very soothing and lubricating and they do help my vision a little bit.</li>
            <li> hard to rate as the bottle (not top) leaked &amp; only left enough for perhaps a week of treatment.&lt;br /&gt;That weeks supply did work well but not much better then refresh</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t even do a good job of lubricating the eyes!  Save your money and find a better product--I went back to Natural Opthalmics myself.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied when received.  In comparison to Can-C eye drop I feel that that Brite Eyes is not as good for my condition as the latter product is.</li>
            <li> I sure hope it helps cataracts and improves my sight some. Have to use it longer to see results. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> These eye drops are definitely and aid to improved vision. It just a matter of realizing that the burning one feels in the eyes after placing the drops in them last the most some twenty seconds. The second important factor is to use them on a regular basis and not allow a day to pass without using them. They help clear the \\&quot;clouds\\&quot; in my vision which are due to factors of age, loose tissue and build up of protein.</li>
            <li> ***I had my cataract surgery on 8-8-12.  Remarks regarding my surgery follows the review***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a cataract in my left eye.  Beginning approximately 1.5 years ago, I began using these drops daily.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve missed a day since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I began \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; with these drops, visual impairment from the cataract was minimal.  So like some of you, I figured \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; in the hope that I would see some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my eye Doc about the anticipated pace of progression.  Sure enough, the cataract has progressed almost exactly as predicted and just today I have requested to be scheduled for cataract surgery.  Looks like I&#x27;ll be using the standard fixed IOL, as I&#x27;m concerned about annoying halos and glare (about 1/3rd of patients) and reduced contrast sensitivity (apparently the FAA will not license commercial pilots who have multifocal IOL&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about giving the product 2 stars, as it could have some soothing benefit absent cataract improvement.  But after giving these drops an extended evaluation, it&#x27;s my view that they do not work for the reason people are buying them and therefore I give the product 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it makes you feel better, feel free to give it a try.  But it&#x27;s my view that these drops won&#x27;t improve your cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Post cataract surgery remarks***&lt;br /&gt;The short of it was that the surgery itself was a ton of waiting around and then a surgery that seemed almost instant. No blood, no redness, no pain. Not even any scratchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening, I had mostly good vision, but some slight blurriness. At night, there were massive and super-bright halos around all lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, those halos went away. There&#x27;s still slight blurriness, but not much. Supposedly vision will improve over the coming weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting some flickering in the corners or periphery of my eyesight. The Doc says that&#x27;s because the artificial lens is not yet fully seated in the lens capsule and it&#x27;s moving around a bit. But supposedly, it will seat in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little or no discomfort today (day 3 when written). Doesn&#x27;t feel quite \\&quot;normal\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t feel bad either. Vision is much, much, improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t lift over 20 lbs, exercise, have the hanky panky, or bend over for about a week. New eyeglass prescription in 4-6 weeks. I&#x27;ll just wear a contact in the other eye until then. She recommended against drinking alcohol for a week and I&#x27;m following that advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeguard I must wear at night is a pain. You have to tape it to your head. One would think they could have come up with a better solution with straps and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor letdown was that I was told I&#x27;d see these amazing new colors with the new lens, because my natural lenses are decades old and the replacements are shiny and such. Zero improvement in colors, so maybe I had good \\&quot;old\\&quot; lenses to begin with.seated in the lens capsule and it&#x27;s moving around a bit.

            <li> Depending on the type of cataract and other factors, this product may be of great benefit.  At least if will stave off surgery for a while.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Boston Terrier, who got cataracts and went blind. It&#x27;s only been about a two weeks so far and he still can&#x27;t see, but he actually likes these drops. He will go to the spot I keep them at (shelf by the back door) and sit and wait for me, as if to say &amp;#34;time for my eye drops Daddy&amp;#34;. They don&#x27;t seem to burn and he is happier than before, so I&#x27;m going on the assumption that they must be helping him in some way that I can&#x27;t measure yet. So I will keep using these drops and will reorder soon.&lt;br /&gt;PS....The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a full 5 star rating is because I can&#x27;t measure the effect since I&#x27;m using them on my dog.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for cataracts and this product didn&#x27;t work.  I would not recommend this product to others.  Do not buy this product.</li>
