            <li>I think this is a great spray for that.  </li>

            <li>It also gives great volume that lasts all night.</li>

            <li>Pleasant smell.  </li>

            <li>Good hold without stickiness.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance!</li>
            <li>After all, it did smell nice and worked, sort</li>
            <li>Really nice fragrance&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple of weeks of use, I did find I liked this hairspray.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I am going to keep this Fekkai on my shelf from now on.</li>
            <li>Love love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great hairspray that is very easy to use, smells nice but not too strongly, and provides a light hold.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed that it held completely.</li>
            <li>A very fine mist sprays out&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Surprisingly strong hold even in wind and humidity!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and need a medium-hold hairspray to keep any kind of wave in it.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself a huge headache, and do not purchase!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Okay, it happens.  </li>
            <li>, well medium is better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>I settled for second best.  </li>
            <li>Many moved on to search out</li>
            <li>I got three days out of it before I washed my hair again many times.</li>
            <li>they put the fragrance in the can, I would like it better, but this can gets five stars.  </li>
            <li>I got three days out of it before I washed my hair again many times.</li>
            <li>they put the fragrance in the can, I would like it better, but this can gets five stars.  </li>
            <li>It holds my hair as well as a stronger hold but feels light!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>lovely.  </li>
            <li>even, no signs of buildup around the nozzle after many uses.&lt;br /&gt;Texture...</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I would consider this more of a &amp;#34;shaping&amp;#34; spray.</li>
            <li>I tried this hair spray, I was pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re not shellacking your hair, a good hairspray is worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.</li>
            <li>Still, a $10 price tag would be more appropriate.</li>
            <li>and I was able to run my fingers through my hair immediately after application.</li>
            <li>I also like that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of build up if I use it more than once between shampoos.</li>
            <li>so I get the most of the product....</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t overpowering and it made me feel more feminine.</li>
            <li>I got a sample and love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>The best thing I can say about this hairspray is that I can style my hair, decide I want it a different way, respray, change my mind, restyle and respray</li>
            <li>I was overall very happy with this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY hairspray products:  salon, discount store, high-end, cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Fekkai Sheer Hold Hair Spray is GREAT!</li>
            <li>I love it and use it exclusively, BUT...</li>
            <li>I kind of miss the floral fragrance, but the hairspray does seem to be close to the original performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kind of miss the floral fragrance, but the hairspray does seem to be close to the original performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds better and has a unique scent my husband loves!</li>
            <li>The smell is very clean, not over powering at all.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair spray for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and fresh but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is very much a Fekkai classic- mild but lovely scent and very good quality.</li>
            <li>Comb through was reasonably easy and the style stayed well with no severe need to spray over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moreover, it does not leave residue on hair and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>it keeps getting clogged and sputters and spits no matter how many times I clean it out...</li>
            <li>look and still have a strong hold (Pantene).  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on customer reviews, since I was looking for a strong hold.</li>
            <li>The problem is that halfway through the day the curse of my fine hair wins out and any body I&#x27;m able to achieve is mostly gone.</li>
            <li>and they also proclaimed their love for the rare and exciting product that literally transformed fine hair into AMAZING</li>
            <li>There is a lot of humidity here where I live (Midwest) and it did a good job with keeping my hair in place all day.</li>
            <li>If not, well, you can always try again and see if you win next?  </li>
            <li>If not, well, you can always try again and see if you win next?  </li>
            <li>The hold is light and not sticky.</li>
            <li>It goes on light</li>
            <li>the night I tried it because it had such great hold for my style.</li>
            <li>I like the scent and light hold of this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>This is a light hair spray that holds hair in place, but isn&#x27;t like a helmet.</li>
            <li>Light hold with a pleasing scent on application that seems to change while wearing.</li>
            <li>The hold it provides is wonderful - definitely a firm hold</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this from my VoxBox.</li>
            <li>I rarely use hairspray, so I am not 100% sure how well this works.  </li>
            <li>you want a super strong hold, use another product, this dose not give a strong hold.</li>
            <li>This give a nice soft hold, you can brush through it and it still stays, and stops hair static.</li>
            <li>This hair spray does a perfect job of holding the style, even in humid conditions, without leaving my hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll look great in the morning, but by lunchtime is flat.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice high end hairspray.</li>
            <li>Also note that the spray is strong and concentrated, so if you have a delicate hair style or fly-away hair, it may not be your best option.</li>
            <li>so when I saw the name of this spray, I was excited.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in scent (again, essentially no lingering fragrance), and although there&#x27;s a \\&quot;crispness\\&quot; to my hair immediately after use, that softens while still maintaining good hold all day.</li>
            <li>It also washes clean out of the hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very light but holds so very well.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Also, the fragrance is just ok, and it was a little more sticky feeling than I liked.  </li>
            <li>a huge plus to this product is that my hair continues to smell fresh on Day 2 (vs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about ready to end my love affair with Fekkai</li>
            <li>I was back to gorgeous hair</li>
            <li>which, I think, has a more gentle hold.</li>
            <li>, but this wasn&#x27;t quite true.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair spray for daily use and a light hold with a fresh light scent that is not overpowering or strong.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I like this spray very much!</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell, but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>However upon using it, I found it to have a strong hold and a very off-putting, chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Fine, straight, can be coaxed to wave</li>
            <li>I really like the fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You just have to decide if it is worth it for you.&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just have to decide if it is worth it for you.</li>
            <li>hair is naturally curly and most of the time</li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>I recieved this complimentary through influenster.</li>
            <li>It provides a natural, non-sticky feel which i love.</li>

            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It works as a hairspray, but it lacks that nice smell that smaller bottles of Fekkai products have.</li>
            <li>The mist is very sheer but does a nice job holding the style in place as advertised.  </li>
            <li>if you like Fekkai products as this IS a nice spray; it&#x27;s just not the ultimate hairspray if you are looking for staying power from dawn until dusk.</li>
            <li>Some build up vs other brands [Aveda] but washes out fairly well.</li>
            <li>and I think this just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li>to my surprise, the performance I got out of this can was far better than anything I got since the first time</li>
            <li>to my surprise, the performance I got out of this can was far better than anything I got since the first time</li>
            <li>After the initial spray and brush through, my hair is soft, still holds it&#x27;s style and the scent is a very light floral that&#x27;s quite lovely.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what the deal has been with Fekkai and the irregular consistency of this hair spray, but for now, this can I am using seems to be close to the original performance I loved.  </li>

            <li>It smells really good and does not weigh down hair.</li>
            <li>The older version was so much better than this new version.</li>
            <li>Perfect for longer styles that you want body and movement with a lasting style hold, but not glued stiff.  </li>
            <li>even, easy to direct, consistent throughout the spray.&lt;br /&gt;Hold</li>
            <li>I loved the hold for the first few hours and the scent is fabulous, unlike so many other hairsprays.</li>
            <li>and I was interested to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re looking for that 80s-style hold, this won&#x27;t hold up your mohawk.  ;)</li>
            <li>On humid days, my styling doesn&#x27;t last much more than a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it holds pretty well without being GLUED in place.</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>Works like most hair sprays I have ever tried that promises a big hold without messing up your style.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this for a while, I definitely prefer Aveda&#x27;s Air Control--but know that it&#x27;s WAY more pricey.  </li>
            <li>It provided very light hold, wasn&#x27;t sticky or stiff and I could easily comb or brush my hair after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This Fekkai actually goes on in a sheer light mist just as the can says &amp; it smells ok.</li>
            <li>It has a great hold, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard or sticky!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, and goes away immediately, but if you&#x27;re super sensitive, proceed with caution.</li>
            <li>The hold is instant but easy to brush through if you need to restyle.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this spray and it wasn&#x27;t a strong enough hold for my taste.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice fragrance and also holds extremely well for such a light hairspray.it dries instantly</li>
            <li>I paid more and bought a new bottle from my local drug store and the nozzle works really well on that one.</li>
            <li>you have anything other than very fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair feels good to touch after using, not sticky or hard</li>
            <li>At the end of the day I brushed my hair out and there were no flakes which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>This product costs way too much to risk buying another faulty can.</li>
            <li>On the one hand, I&#x27;d forgotten how much I like an aerosol --</li>
            <li>they changed the product again, this time, it did, well, very little.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this hair spray.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to use that much because it works</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray.</li>
            <li>(I have medium length hair that is mostly straight.)  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much for this hairspray again.</li>
            <li>Fekkai Sheer Hold Hair Spray is a light hairspray.</li>
            <li>Live in a very rainy place and this I think does pretty well.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, this product&#x27;s label lists a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellant, which is better than a CFC but not without risk</li>
            <li>I just spray a bit on my round brush and run it through my hair, and I have great lift and control that stays all day long.</li>
            <li>The blue can has a more firm hold but not &amp;#34;cement&amp;#34; in any way; smell is a light scent, too.</li>
            <li>It is lightly scented and feels dry the moment you spray it on.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the slightly floral scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their hair products have always been above all others (even Chi, which is my second favorite line).  </li>
            <li>Nothing at all like the older version of this Fekkai product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try it for yourself.</li>
            <li>highly rated.</li>
            <li>feel of the 80&#x27;s-era hairsprays, and your hair WILL mimic its natural wave a bit after a number of hours, but you can comb through it and work with it without ruining the whole look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as the old version.  </li>
            <li>I received my Fekkai Sheer Hold Hair Spray complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>and although it did feel a little bit more straw-like than the original formula, it did hold my hair decently all day without having to use other sprays to give it a boost and make it stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and although it did feel a little bit more straw-like than the original formula, it did hold my hair decently all day without having to use other sprays to give it a boost and make it stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it does not make those white dry flakes that most drug store hairsprays do.</li>
            <li>Strong hair spray that actually holds my hair in place for several hours is a must.</li>
            <li>The hold is just right for my fine hair--it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but definitely holds my hair in place&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>But now there are new propellants</li>
            <li>This is new from Fekkai.  </li>
            <li>Most hairsprays leave a visible coating or, worse, a big blob where the spray was too strong.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light and does not have that classic icky hair-spray smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OUT OF ORIGINAL PRODUCT (White can blue</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use hairspray but this one was not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and with the humidity at nearly 100 percent</li>
            <li>No stiff hair, but a hold that lasts and is flexible, &amp; doesn&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li>It works quite well on my fine hair and does not make it feel stiff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell Soft Spray for a decade, it&#x27;s the only hair spray with a fragrance light enough (essentially: none) to please me.</li>
            <li>the spray is so fast and sheer.</li>
            <li>(so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have hairspray on), and at the same time, it holds your hair in place very well.  </li>
            <li>Hair still looks natural after using this hairspray.</li>
            <li>flexible hold that won&#x27;t stiffen your natural hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The spray stops coming out when the bottle is half full...</li>
            <li>It is slightly sticky, but not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other releases of the product went downhill until the only thing I was getting out of the product was a pretty smell and brief curl which just faded away after 15 minutes or</li>

            <li>Hope they bring the older version back.</li>
            <li>This has the right amount of hold for me when I wear my hair down and want it to be soft and stay put.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s hairspray with the same quality as this new formula for $5 at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>longer was my beloved Fekkai even helping me achieve anything but an expensive momentary lift to my hair only to fall</li>
            <li>It holds my bangs in place like no other hair spray has done.  </li>
            <li>It did not make my hair feel sticky or stiff, but I also feel like it really wasn&#x27;t doing much.</li>
            <li>My normal non-aerosol hair spray would always leave flakes and dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>The old formula was in a white can and had a different smell and formula.</li>
            <li>Curl and volume like possible no other way.  </li>
            <li>When I blow dry my hair to smooth it and minimize the curliness, I usually apply product to increase body and help hold the smoothness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the purchase price</li>
            <li>I just let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>have tried this in the dry climate of the high desert in California, a humid climate along the beach, and on dry and rainy days of both.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t stiff, but will hold the style, and allow your hair to be combed without loss of style (I mainly use a flat iron, but on some days, I scrunched my hair to amp up my natural curls-</li>

            <li> Pleasant smell.  </li>

            <li> Good hold without stickiness.</li>

            <li> This Fekkai spray smells great and work even better to keep my curls defined.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I will keep as a back-up spray in the event I run out of my favorite sprays, but I did not find this to be a great product.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> After all, it did smell nice and worked, sort</li>
            <li> Really nice fragrance&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of weeks of use, I did find I liked this hairspray.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I am going to keep this Fekkai on my shelf from now on.</li>
            <li> Love love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great hairspray that is very easy to use, smells nice but not too strongly, and provides a light hold.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed that it held completely.</li>
            <li> A very fine mist sprays out&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Surprisingly strong hold even in wind and humidity!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and need a medium-hold hairspray to keep any kind of wave in it.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself a huge headache, and do not purchase!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, it happens.  </li>
            <li> , well medium is better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> I settled for second best.  </li>
            <li> Many moved on to search out</li>
            <li> I got three days out of it before I washed my hair again many times.</li>
            <li> they put the fragrance in the can, I would like it better, but this can gets five stars.  </li>

            <li> they put the fragrance in the can, I would like it better, but this can gets five stars.  </li>
            <li> It holds my hair as well as a stronger hold but feels light!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> lovely.  </li>
            <li> even, no signs of buildup around the nozzle after many uses.&lt;br /&gt;Texture...</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> I would consider this more of a &amp;#34;shaping&amp;#34; spray.</li>
            <li> I tried this hair spray, I was pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re not shellacking your hair, a good hairspray is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.</li>
            <li> Still, a $10 price tag would be more appropriate.</li>
            <li> and I was able to run my fingers through my hair immediately after application.</li>
            <li> I also like that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of build up if I use it more than once between shampoos.</li>
            <li> so I get the most of the product....</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overpowering and it made me feel more feminine.</li>
            <li> I got a sample and love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> The best thing I can say about this hairspray is that I can style my hair, decide I want it a different way, respray, change my mind, restyle and respray</li>
            <li> I was overall very happy with this hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY hairspray products:  salon, discount store, high-end, cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Fekkai Sheer Hold Hair Spray is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I love it and use it exclusively, BUT...</li>
            <li> I kind of miss the floral fragrance, but the hairspray does seem to be close to the original performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kind of miss the floral fragrance, but the hairspray does seem to be close to the original performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds better and has a unique scent my husband loves!</li>
            <li> The smell is very clean, not over powering at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair spray for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and fresh but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is very much a Fekkai classic- mild but lovely scent and very good quality.</li>
            <li> Comb through was reasonably easy and the style stayed well with no severe need to spray over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moreover, it does not leave residue on hair and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> it keeps getting clogged and sputters and spits no matter how many times I clean it out...</li>
            <li> look and still have a strong hold (Pantene).  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on customer reviews, since I was looking for a strong hold.</li>
            <li> The problem is that halfway through the day the curse of my fine hair wins out and any body I&#x27;m able to achieve is mostly gone.</li>
            <li> and they also proclaimed their love for the rare and exciting product that literally transformed fine hair into AMAZING</li>
            <li> There is a lot of humidity here where I live (Midwest) and it did a good job with keeping my hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> If not, well, you can always try again and see if you win next?  </li>
            <li> If not, well, you can always try again and see if you win next?  </li>
            <li> The hold is light and not sticky.</li>
            <li> It goes on light</li>
            <li> the night I tried it because it had such great hold for my style.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and light hold of this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> This is a light hair spray that holds hair in place, but isn&#x27;t like a helmet.</li>
            <li> Light hold with a pleasing scent on application that seems to change while wearing.</li>
            <li> The hold it provides is wonderful - definitely a firm hold</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this from my VoxBox.</li>
            <li> I rarely use hairspray, so I am not 100% sure how well this works.  </li>
            <li> you want a super strong hold, use another product, this dose not give a strong hold.</li>
            <li> This give a nice soft hold, you can brush through it and it still stays, and stops hair static.</li>
            <li> This hair spray does a perfect job of holding the style, even in humid conditions, without leaving my hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll look great in the morning, but by lunchtime is flat.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice high end hairspray.</li>
            <li> Also note that the spray is strong and concentrated, so if you have a delicate hair style or fly-away hair, it may not be your best option.</li>
            <li> so when I saw the name of this spray, I was excited.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in scent (again, essentially no lingering fragrance), and although there&#x27;s a \\&quot;crispness\\&quot; to my hair immediately after use, that softens while still maintaining good hold all day.</li>
            <li> It also washes clean out of the hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very light but holds so very well.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Also, the fragrance is just ok, and it was a little more sticky feeling than I liked.  </li>
            <li> a huge plus to this product is that my hair continues to smell fresh on Day 2 (vs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about ready to end my love affair with Fekkai</li>
            <li> I was back to gorgeous hair</li>
            <li> which, I think, has a more gentle hold.</li>
            <li> , but this wasn&#x27;t quite true.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray for daily use and a light hold with a fresh light scent that is not overpowering or strong.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this spray very much!</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell, but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> However upon using it, I found it to have a strong hold and a very off-putting, chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Fine, straight, can be coaxed to wave</li>
            <li> I really like the fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You just have to decide if it is worth it for you.&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just have to decide if it is worth it for you.</li>
            <li> hair is naturally curly and most of the time</li>
            <li> worth the money.</li>
            <li> I recieved this complimentary through influenster.</li>
            <li> It provides a natural, non-sticky feel which i love.</li>

            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It works as a hairspray, but it lacks that nice smell that smaller bottles of Fekkai products have.</li>
            <li> The mist is very sheer but does a nice job holding the style in place as advertised.  </li>
            <li> if you like Fekkai products as this IS a nice spray; it&#x27;s just not the ultimate hairspray if you are looking for staying power from dawn until dusk.</li>
            <li> Some build up vs other brands [Aveda] but washes out fairly well.</li>
            <li> and I think this just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li> to my surprise, the performance I got out of this can was far better than anything I got since the first time</li>
            <li> to my surprise, the performance I got out of this can was far better than anything I got since the first time</li>
            <li> After the initial spray and brush through, my hair is soft, still holds it&#x27;s style and the scent is a very light floral that&#x27;s quite lovely.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what the deal has been with Fekkai and the irregular consistency of this hair spray, but for now, this can I am using seems to be close to the original performance I loved.  </li>

            <li> It smells really good and does not weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> The older version was so much better than this new version.</li>
            <li> Perfect for longer styles that you want body and movement with a lasting style hold, but not glued stiff.  </li>
            <li> even, easy to direct, consistent throughout the spray.&lt;br /&gt;Hold</li>
            <li> I loved the hold for the first few hours and the scent is fabulous, unlike so many other hairsprays.</li>
            <li> and I was interested to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re looking for that 80s-style hold, this won&#x27;t hold up your mohawk.  ;)</li>
            <li> On humid days, my styling doesn&#x27;t last much more than a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it holds pretty well without being GLUED in place.</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> Works like most hair sprays I have ever tried that promises a big hold without messing up your style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for a while, I definitely prefer Aveda&#x27;s Air Control--but know that it&#x27;s WAY more pricey.  </li>
            <li> It provided very light hold, wasn&#x27;t sticky or stiff and I could easily comb or brush my hair after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This Fekkai actually goes on in a sheer light mist just as the can says &amp; it smells ok.</li>
            <li> It has a great hold, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard or sticky!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, and goes away immediately, but if you&#x27;re super sensitive, proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> The hold is instant but easy to brush through if you need to restyle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this spray and it wasn&#x27;t a strong enough hold for my taste.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice fragrance and also holds extremely well for such a light hairspray.it dries instantly</li>
            <li> I paid more and bought a new bottle from my local drug store and the nozzle works really well on that one.</li>
            <li> you have anything other than very fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels good to touch after using, not sticky or hard</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I brushed my hair out and there were no flakes which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> This product costs way too much to risk buying another faulty can.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, I&#x27;d forgotten how much I like an aerosol --</li>
            <li> they changed the product again, this time, it did, well, very little.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this hair spray.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have to use that much because it works</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray.</li>
            <li> (I have medium length hair that is mostly straight.)  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much for this hairspray again.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Sheer Hold Hair Spray is a light hairspray.</li>
            <li> Live in a very rainy place and this I think does pretty well.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, this product&#x27;s label lists a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellant, which is better than a CFC but not without risk</li>
            <li> I just spray a bit on my round brush and run it through my hair, and I have great lift and control that stays all day long.</li>
            <li> The blue can has a more firm hold but not &amp;#34;cement&amp;#34; in any way; smell is a light scent, too.</li>
            <li> It is lightly scented and feels dry the moment you spray it on.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the slightly floral scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their hair products have always been above all others (even Chi, which is my second favorite line).  </li>
            <li> Nothing at all like the older version of this Fekkai product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> highly rated.</li>
            <li> feel of the 80&#x27;s-era hairsprays, and your hair WILL mimic its natural wave a bit after a number of hours, but you can comb through it and work with it without ruining the whole look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as the old version.  </li>
            <li> I received my Fekkai Sheer Hold Hair Spray complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> and although it did feel a little bit more straw-like than the original formula, it did hold my hair decently all day without having to use other sprays to give it a boost and make it stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and although it did feel a little bit more straw-like than the original formula, it did hold my hair decently all day without having to use other sprays to give it a boost and make it stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does not make those white dry flakes that most drug store hairsprays do.</li>
            <li> Strong hair spray that actually holds my hair in place for several hours is a must.</li>
            <li> The hold is just right for my fine hair--it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but definitely holds my hair in place&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> But now there are new propellants</li>
            <li> This is new from Fekkai.  </li>
            <li> Most hairsprays leave a visible coating or, worse, a big blob where the spray was too strong.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very light and does not have that classic icky hair-spray smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> OUT OF ORIGINAL PRODUCT (White can blue</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use hairspray but this one was not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and with the humidity at nearly 100 percent</li>
            <li> No stiff hair, but a hold that lasts and is flexible, &amp; doesn&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li> It works quite well on my fine hair and does not make it feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell Soft Spray for a decade, it&#x27;s the only hair spray with a fragrance light enough (essentially: none) to please me.</li>
            <li> the spray is so fast and sheer.</li>
            <li> (so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have hairspray on), and at the same time, it holds your hair in place very well.  </li>
            <li> Hair still looks natural after using this hairspray.</li>
            <li> flexible hold that won&#x27;t stiffen your natural hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The spray stops coming out when the bottle is half full...</li>
            <li> It is slightly sticky, but not bad.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Other releases of the product went downhill until the only thing I was getting out of the product was a pretty smell and brief curl which just faded away after 15 minutes or</li>
            <li> Hope they bring the older version back.</li>
            <li> This has the right amount of hold for me when I wear my hair down and want it to be soft and stay put.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hairspray with the same quality as this new formula for $5 at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> longer was my beloved Fekkai even helping me achieve anything but an expensive momentary lift to my hair only to fall</li>
            <li> It holds my bangs in place like no other hair spray has done.  </li>
            <li> It did not make my hair feel sticky or stiff, but I also feel like it really wasn&#x27;t doing much.</li>
            <li> My normal non-aerosol hair spray would always leave flakes and dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> The old formula was in a white can and had a different smell and formula.</li>
            <li> Curl and volume like possible no other way.  </li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair to smooth it and minimize the curliness, I usually apply product to increase body and help hold the smoothness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the purchase price</li>
            <li> I just let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> have tried this in the dry climate of the high desert in California, a humid climate along the beach, and on dry and rainy days of both.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t stiff, but will hold the style, and allow your hair to be combed without loss of style (I mainly use a flat iron, but on some days, I scrunched my hair to amp up my natural curls-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally like the scent, but fortunately it&#x27;s not strong and dissipates quickly, so I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li> I tried using this product on a normal day, humid day, and slightly rainy day all with the same effect.  </li>
            <li> A little high priced</li>
            <li> This hairspray is good for updo and styling usage, but day to day use for me is ruled out because it made my hair look so hard instantly and was hard to brush out and help my hair still look fluffy.</li>
            <li> so I purchased a large can for home and a small can for travel.  </li>
            <li> so well so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually use Moroccan Oil hairspray but the smell of the product has gotten kind of sour lately.</li>
            <li> It came out a little heavy at first</li>
            <li> I used to use Mink Difference all the time (harder to find now) and this has a very similar quality/texture.</li>
            <li> Yes, there&#x27;s movement, but it&#x27;s not exactly soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only found one other product where I can get the &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it four stars is because while it has the aforementioned positives it does not standout above other hairsprays I have tried that cost less.</li>
            <li> For my long hair, I which I like to curl in long bouncy waves, it provided enough hold to maintain for a few hours.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing was the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The only thing missing was the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I like this spray but don&#x27;t consider it a heavy duty extra hold hairspray.</li>
            <li> No change in my hair and absolutely no hold at all.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheaper, low quality hairspray.</li>
            <li> When it is empty, I&#x27;m planning on swapping out the nozzles with the Amazon purchased bottle to find out</li>
            <li> This is not the same as the previous hairspray!</li>
            <li> But little by little the love affair grew cold.  </li>
            <li> Like other products from this company, a little bit goes a long way, so do not overdo the spray.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive</li>
            <li> Like other higher-end hairsprays, this is a bit pricey</li>
            <li> Like other sprays, this one promised &amp;#34;soft,</li>
            <li> Plus living in Texas with wind, heat and extreme summer humidity means if I want a hairspray that works, it ends up looking like I coated my head in shellac and feels like cement.</li>
            <li> This hairspray definitely holds, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sheer.&amp;#34;  The hold is VERY firm, but if I finger-comb through it, the hold goes to zero.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is worse than buying a new hairspray with all its promises of &amp;#34;hold for hours without crispiness!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;mega hold while keeping movement!&amp;#34; and ending up with bupkis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> OF THIS EDITION (Dark Lilac/lavender can with white/light writing)&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> my previous spray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Typical Fekkai.  </li>
            <li> Typically I like flexible hold sprays, but sometimes you need your hair to just stay put.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time keeping curl in my hair and this hairspray kept my style all day long.  </li>
            <li> It has a light hold, but for my dull strait boring hair, it held the curls very well.</li>
            <li> mean here I was a star struck newbie who stumbled across Fekkai hairspray as an answer to a life long yearning.  </li>
            <li> While it did hold all day, I found it did get a little flaky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is not super stiff-</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t destroy the ozone layer but does increase greenhouse gases).</li>
            <li> The spray head is blocked and not working, cannot return, waste of money</li>
            <li> I like it not sticky and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with the nozzle...</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair - past my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use hair spray routinely and don&#x27;t like products that make my hair stiff or</li>
            <li> It works well, isn&#x27;t to stiff and doesn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
            <li> This hairspray works so well without making my hair sticky or stiff...</li>
            <li> Since I have thin hair, it&#x27;s hard to find a hair spray that actually holds my hair.</li>
            <li> No longer did the spray coax unbelievable performance out of my weanie hair.  </li>
            <li> if it works, not sure if it is the nozzle or the bottle</li>
            <li> This hair spray is almost dry--it isn&#x27;t sticky at ALL, and hardly feels as if you have any spray on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> hair Spray does just what you want a hairspray to do, hold the shape of your hair (in my care curls from the curling iron) without a sticky hard feeling on your hair.  </li>
            <li> and this has happened on at least 3 of the bottles I have purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> The spray head got clogged up so was unable to get al the liquid out.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Something is seriously wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> If someone uses hair spray routinely, this could be fairly expensive to use.</li>
            <li> It does not add any fake shine or moisture to your hair.</li>
            <li> Plus it has a faint scent</li>
            <li> unfortunately</li>
            <li> am going to search for something else that doesn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li> So disappointed that they changed this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I cannot tolerate the terrible aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too terrible, the hold lasts into the afternoon, and there&#x27;s no flakes if I touch or brush my hair.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This hairspray is good for updo and styling usage, but day to day use for me is ruled out because it made my hair look so hard instantly and was hard to brush out and help my hair still look fluffy.</li>
            <li> Hold here and place it doesn&#x27;t make it sticky. Love it.</li>
            <li> The spray head got clogged up so was unable to get al the liquid out.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not crazy about the smell, but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair spray for my fine hair.  It holds my bangs in place like no other hair spray has done.  I highly recommend you try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> l like the hairspray.  I travel so I purchased a large can for home and a small can for travel.  Halfway through both cans, it will not spray properly.  They just expel air....  I tried unclogging both.  It doesn&#x27;t last.  This product costs way too much to risk buying another faulty can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell Soft Spray for a decade, it&#x27;s the only hair spray with a fragrance light enough (essentially: none) to please me. And I&#x27;ve used pump-action sprays instead of aerosols for longer than that because chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants were environmental hazards. But now there are new propellants and I was interested to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like it. It&#x27;s light in scent (again, essentially no lingering fragrance), and although there&#x27;s a \\&quot;crispness\\&quot; to my hair immediately after use, that softens while still maintaining good hold all day. I wash my hair every other day, and a huge plus to this product is that my hair continues to smell fresh on Day 2 (vs. my previous spray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s expensive. And I remain conflicted about the aerosol aspect. On the one hand, I&#x27;d forgotten how much I like an aerosol -- the spray is so fast and sheer. On the other hand, this product&#x27;s label lists a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellant, which is better than a CFC but not without risk (it doesn&#x27;t destroy the ozone layer but does increase greenhouse gases). And, unlike a pump spray, the pressurized metallic canister is not refillable. I&#x27;ll use the product until it&#x27;s gone and update this review with final impressions about cost and quality.</li>
            <li> I am thinking- I wonder if Mr. Fekkai is a gambler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean here I was a star struck newbie who stumbled across Fekkai hairspray as an answer to a life long yearning.  What I wanted: Hair that stays in place and can last from day to day.  I told everyone who would listen about this hair spray.  I had never had anything like it before.  I even got tons of others to use it too and they also proclaimed their love for the rare and exciting product that literally transformed fine hair into AMAZING hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it happened.  They changed the color of the can.  Okay, it happens.  But little by little the love affair grew cold.  No longer did the spray coax unbelievable performance out of my weanie hair.  Now it was just, medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, well medium is better than nothing.  I settled for second best.  After all, it did smell nice and worked, sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they changed the product again, this time, it did, well, very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had lost hope.  I noticed that the former fan club of people I had known that used Fekkai were also complaining of the same thing.  Many moved on to search out another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No longer was my beloved Fekkai even helping me achieve anything but an expensive momentary lift to my hair only to fall flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about ready to end my love affair with Fekkai reaching the end of my umpteenth can, when I had the opportunity to try yet another changed can (again?).  Would I take it back?  Well, only to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And BAM- I was back to gorgeous hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR TYPE&lt;br /&gt;Baby Fine, straight, can be coaxed to wave slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE OUT OF ORIGINAL PRODUCT (White can blue writing)&lt;br /&gt;Complete reconstruction of style.  Curl and volume like possible no other way.  Lasted up to five days by re-wetting and re-pressing into place. Comb through was reasonably easy and the style stayed well with no severe need to spray over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other releases of the product went downhill until the only thing I was getting out of the product was a pretty smell and brief curl which just faded away after 15 minutes or so leaving me with just about nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE OF THIS EDITION (Dark Lilac/lavender can with white/light writing)&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, the performance I got out of this can was far better than anything I got since the first time I tried this hairspray.  The only thing missing was the fragrance.  They must have forgotten to add fragrance to this can.  I kind of miss the floral fragrance, but the hairspray does seem to be close to the original performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL COMMENTS&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what the deal has been with Fekkai and the irregular consistency of this hair spray, but for now, this can I am using seems to be close to the original performance I loved.  I got three days out of it before I washed my hair again many times. and although it did feel a little bit more straw-like than the original formula, it did hold my hair decently all day without having to use other sprays to give it a boost and make it stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they put the fragrance in the can, I would like it better, but this can gets five stars.  Who knows, however, what the next can will be like?  Buying Fekkai hairspray has become quite a gamble.  If you get a good one, it is wonderful.  If not, well, you can always try again and see if you win next?  You just have to decide if it is worth it for you.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other releases of the product went downhill until the only thing I was getting out of the product was a pretty smell and brief curl which just faded away after 15 minutes or so leaving me with just about nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE OF THIS EDITION (Dark Lilac/lavender can with white/light writing)&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, the performance I got out of this can was far better than anything I got since the first time I tried this hairspray.

            <li> This hairspray is very much a Fekkai classic- mild but lovely scent and very good quality. It came out a little heavy at first but once I used it a few times, I learned to control how much I sprayed. You don&#x27;t need much! It holds my hair as well as a stronger hold but feels light!</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful hairspray I have ever used. It is very light but holds so very well. This is a spray that you can after you spray you can run your fingers through and your hair goes back just like you placed it. I love it.</li>
            <li> This hair spray does a perfect job of holding the style, even in humid conditions, without leaving my hair stiff or sticky. Like other products from this company, a little bit goes a long way, so do not overdo the spray. Also note that the spray is strong and concentrated, so if you have a delicate hair style or fly-away hair, it may not be your best option.</li>
            <li> Fekkai does it again!&lt;br /&gt;Their hair products have always been above all others (even Chi, which is my second favorite line).  This hair spray is almost dry--it isn&#x27;t sticky at ALL, and hardly feels as if you have any spray on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this in the dry climate of the high desert in California, a humid climate along the beach, and on dry and rainy days of both.  This won&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; feel of the 80&#x27;s-era hairsprays, and your hair WILL mimic its natural wave a bit after a number of hours, but you can comb through it and work with it without ruining the whole look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smell...lovely.  Typical Fekkai.  It smells like high-end salons do.  (Ladies, you know what I mean.)&lt;br /&gt;Spray...even, no signs of buildup around the nozzle after many uses.&lt;br /&gt;Texture...the texture of thus spray is powdery-dry.  It won&#x27;t leave you feeling like you have &amp;#34;wet stuff&amp;#34; on your hair.  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage...even, easy to direct, consistent throughout the spray.&lt;br /&gt;Hold...This isn&#x27;t stiff, but will hold the style, and allow your hair to be combed without loss of style (I mainly use a flat iron, but on some days, I scrunched my hair to amp up my natural curls-it held with both styles without any problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is not super stiff-so if you&#x27;re looking for that 80s-style hold, this won&#x27;t hold up your mohawk.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;Scent...if you don&#x27;t like that salon-scent, you might not care for this one.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, and goes away immediately, but if you&#x27;re super sensitive, proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> This is spray laquer.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then great!  But I was looking for sheer hold hair spray like the name implied.  No so!</li>
            <li> Something is seriously wrong with this product. The nozzle clogs, and the product won&#x27;t dispense. Save yourself a huge headache, and do not purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. The hold is light and not sticky. The scent is very light and does not have that classic icky hair-spray smell.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a super strong hold, use another product, this dose not give a strong hold. This give a nice soft hold, you can brush through it and it still stays, and stops hair static. This is my favorite hair spray for daily use and a light hold with a fresh light scent that is not overpowering or strong. highly rated.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray!  It goes on light (so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have hairspray on), and at the same time, it holds your hair in place very well.  I&#x27;ve only found one other product where I can get the &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; look and still have a strong hold (Pantene).  Most hairsprays leave a visible coating or, worse, a big blob where the spray was too strong.  Not this one.  This is a great-quality product, and I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
            <li> I like this spray but don&#x27;t consider it a heavy duty extra hold hairspray. For my long hair, I which I like to curl in long bouncy waves, it provided enough hold to maintain for a few hours. I would consider this more of a &amp;#34;shaping&amp;#34; spray. The smell is very clean, not over powering at all. It sprays out evenly.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairspray that is very easy to use, smells nice but not too strongly, and provides a light hold. I like that this product doesn&#x27;t add any extra shine or texture to my hair, but I wish that it had a bit of a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and need a medium-hold hairspray to keep any kind of wave in it.  This hairspray definitely holds, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sheer.&amp;#34;  The hold is VERY firm, but if I finger-comb through it, the hold goes to zero.  I&#x27;ll hold onto this one for up-do&#x27;s that need helmet hair, but I&#x27;ll keep looking for a daily-use hairspray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this hair spray!  It works perfectly and has a wonderful scent. No stiff hair, but a hold that lasts and is flexible, &amp; doesn&#x27;t give up.  Perfect for longer styles that you want body and movement with a lasting style hold, but not glued stiff.  Nozzle does not clog.  Love love it!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice high end hairspray. I usually use Moroccan Oil hairspray but the smell of the product has gotten kind of sour lately. This Fekkai spray smells great and work even better to keep my curls defined. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nothing at all like the older version of this Fekkai product.  Very disappointed.  I so wish that Fekkai would bring back the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Sheer Hold Hair Spray.  So disappointed that they changed this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use hair spray routinely and don&#x27;t like products that make my hair stiff or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally curly and most of the time I just let it dry naturally.  When I blow dry my hair to smooth it and minimize the curliness, I usually apply product to increase body and help hold the smoothness longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this hair spray, I was pleased with it.  It provided very light hold, wasn&#x27;t sticky or stiff and I could easily comb or brush my hair after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the price.  If someone uses hair spray routinely, this could be fairly expensive to use.</li>
            <li> Does the job and does not turn your hair into a bird&#x27;s nest. The smell is not overpowering either. It does not add any fake shine or moisture to your hair. Hair still looks natural after using this hairspray.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on customer reviews, since I was looking for a strong hold. It works but I cannot tolerate the terrible aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to search for something else that doesn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this hair spray. It has great hold, gives shine, is very light and not sticky at all. I used to use Mink Difference all the time (harder to find now) and this has a very similar quality/texture. I need something I can run a brush thru when needed later in the day that isn&#x27;t tacky or brittle. This does a wonderful job. Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fekkai&#x27;s sheer hold for 20 years and swore by it.  This is new from Fekkai.  I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as the old version.  It just doesn&#x27;t hold.  It&#x27;s too &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34;.  What I will do next I don&#x27;t know.  Hope they bring the older version back.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; hairspray. This one comes close. I really like the fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that this product does not make my hair sticky nor does it make my hair stick&lt;br /&gt;together. The hold is very good and it is flexible (no &amp;#34;cardboard&amp;#34; hair :-D).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I like this hair spray. It smells like your standard drug store hair spray. but it does not make those white dry flakes that most drug store hairsprays do. It has a light hold, but for my dull strait boring hair, it held the curls very well. definitely recommend. worth the money.</li>
            <li> I recieved this complimentary through influenster. It works awesome as you can still run your hands through your hair after using it. works great as a straightening hair spray.</li>
            <li> This is great for when you need a stiffer hold.  Typically I like flexible hold sprays, but sometimes you need your hair to just stay put.  I think this is a great spray for that.  My hair stays put but does not feel sticky or crunchy.  It also washes clean out of the hair.  All in all a great hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair and I think this just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me. After the initial spray and brush through, my hair is soft, still holds it&#x27;s style and the scent is a very light floral that&#x27;s quite lovely. The problem is that halfway through the day the curse of my fine hair wins out and any body I&#x27;m able to achieve is mostly gone. On humid days, my styling doesn&#x27;t last much more than a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have anything other than very fine hair this would probably be an excellent choice. I loved the hold for the first few hours and the scent is fabulous, unlike so many other hairsprays. It&#x27;s pretty expensive but it&#x27;s a nice-sized can and if you&#x27;re not shellacking your hair, a good hairspray is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray. It is lightly scented and feels dry the moment you spray it on. The hold is instant but easy to brush through if you need to restyle. I live in Florida and with the humidity at nearly 100 percent I was very impressed that it held completely. At the end of the day I brushed my hair out and there were no flakes which is a huge plus for me. My normal non-aerosol hair spray would always leave flakes and dry my hair out. This is a keeper for me. A little high priced but I don&#x27;t have to use that much because it works so well so it will last a long time. Still, a $10 price tag would be more appropriate.</li>
            <li> I just tried this hairspray and was very happy with it. It provides a natural, non-sticky feel which i love. It also gives great volume that lasts all night. I got a lot of complements on my hair the night I tried it because it had such great hold for my style. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I prefer &amp;#34;comb-able&amp;#34; hair sprays, so when I saw the name of this spray, I was excited. However upon using it, I found it to have a strong hold and a very off-putting, chemical smell. I will keep as a back-up spray in the event I run out of my favorite sprays, but I did not find this to be a great product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I don&#x27;t normally use hairspray but this one was not heavy at all. It has a very nice fragrance and also holds extremely well for such a light hairspray.it dries instantly and I was able to run my fingers through my hair immediately after application. Definitely will purchase this hairspray.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray. It works quite well on my fine hair and does not make it feel stiff. This is probably the one Fekkai product I tried this month that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and light hold of this hairspray.  It works well, isn&#x27;t to stiff and doesn&#x27;t flake.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the purchase price but the product performs well.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works so well without making my hair sticky or stiff... I love it! I just spray a bit on my round brush and run it through my hair, and I have great lift and control that stays all day long. I don&#x27;t personally like the scent, but fortunately it&#x27;s not strong and dissipates quickly, so I don&#x27;t really mind. Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Fekkai Sheer Hold hair Spray does just what you want a hairspray to do, hold the shape of your hair (in my care curls from the curling iron) without a sticky hard feeling on your hair.  This does the trick, and smells good, too.  I also like that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of build up if I use it more than once between shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is a light hair spray that holds hair in place, but isn&#x27;t like a helmet. The hair can still move. It is slightly sticky, but not bad. When I spray it on I can still manipulate my hair in place. I love the fragrance! It does not leave the white flakey residue by the end of the day. I have thick, wavy hair and it holds pretty well without being GLUED in place. It&#x27;s pricey though....</li>
            <li> The spray head is blocked and not working, cannot return, waste of money</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the packaging is not up to par! The spray stops coming out when the bottle is half full... so its a battle (this has been the second bottle that has done this) makes me want to just buy the travel size every time so I get the most of the product....</li>
            <li> While it did hold all day, I found it did get a little flaky.  Also, the fragrance is just ok, and it was a little more sticky feeling than I liked.  But it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> This product simply did not work on my hair.  (I have medium length hair that is mostly straight.)  It was as though I had not used any product at all in my hair.  I tried using this product on a normal day, humid day, and slightly rainy day all with the same effect.  No change in my hair and absolutely no hold at all.  Such a bummer.  It did smell nice though! ;-)  DISCLAIMER:  I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> This is not the same as the previous hairspray! Don&#x27;t be fooled! The old formula was in a white can and had a different smell and formula. This one has a cheap/horrible smell and the formula is sticky! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheaper, low quality hairspray. There&#x27;s hairspray with the same quality as this new formula for $5 at the drugstore. The older version was so much better than this new version. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this spray and it wasn&#x27;t a strong enough hold for my taste. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received my Fekkai Sheer Hold Hair Spray complimentary from Influenster. I really enjoyed the slightly floral scent. It wasn&#x27;t overpowering and it made me feel more feminine. I also thought it was great that it held my style while making it feel as if there was no product in my hair. It&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> This has the right amount of hold for me when I wear my hair down and want it to be soft and stay put. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for updos.</li>
            <li> I got a sample and love this hairspray.  I have a hard time keeping curl in my hair and this hairspray kept my style all day long.  It has a great hold, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard or sticky!</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought this hair spray- I meant to buy the white can which, I think, has a more gentle hold. The blue can has a more firm hold but not &amp;#34;cement&amp;#34; in any way; smell is a light scent, too. The best thing I can say about this hairspray is that I can style my hair, decide I want it a different way, respray, change my mind, restyle and respray AND IT NEVER TURNS TO FLAKES.</li>
            <li> It works as a hairspray, but it lacks that nice smell that smaller bottles of Fekkai products have. Will never order again.</li>
            <li> There must be a defect with the valve or can.  I have purchased this product on different occasions and the spray stops working while you are using it.  This has happened to me 4 times, my friend once and another customer on amazon had the same problems.  It has been over a three year period so it has not been corrected, just took another can back to store.  I like the hairspray, but I cannot recommend it.  &amp;#34;What&#x27;s to like if you can&#x27;t get it out of the can&amp;#34;.  It has to be the manufacturer.  I hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I have used this before. I like it not sticky and not too heavy. I get a good wear out of it. Live in a very rainy place and this I think does pretty well. Plus it has a faint scent but I don&#x27;t notice it and when I get rained on I don&#x27;t notice it either. This is my go to hairspray.</li>
            <li> As the name describes, this is a sheer hold hair spray, and I find that meets my needs.  Your hair is not sticky or crunchy and you can comb through and re-spray, if needed.  Pleasant smell.  I like this spray very much!</li>
            <li> I was overall very happy with this hair spray.  The mist is very sheer but does a nice job holding the style in place as advertised.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that this is something knew and different.  Works like most hair sprays I have ever tried that promises a big hold without messing up your style. There is a lot of humidity here where I live (Midwest) and it did a good job with keeping my hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY hairspray products:  salon, discount store, high-end, cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Really nice fragrance&lt;br /&gt;2) A very fine mist sprays out&lt;br /&gt;3) The hold is just right for my fine hair--it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but definitely holds my hair in place&lt;br /&gt;4) My hair feels good to touch after using, not sticky or hard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Like other higher-end hairsprays, this is a bit pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a while, I definitely prefer Aveda&#x27;s Air Control--but know that it&#x27;s WAY more pricey.  It holds better and has a unique scent my husband loves!</li>
            <li> Light hold with a pleasing scent on application that seems to change while wearing. Some build up vs other brands [Aveda] but washes out fairly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Fekkai products, especially the color saving products, but hadn&#x27;t yet tried the hairspray. Since I have thin hair, it&#x27;s hard to find a hair spray that actually holds my hair. It&#x27;ll look great in the morning, but by lunchtime is flat. Nothing is worse than buying a new hairspray with all its promises of &amp;#34;hold for hours without crispiness!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;mega hold while keeping movement!&amp;#34; and ending up with bupkis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks of use, I did find I liked this hairspray. The scent isn&#x27;t too terrible, the hold lasts into the afternoon, and there&#x27;s no flakes if I touch or brush my hair. Like other sprays, this one promised &amp;#34;soft, flexible hold that won&#x27;t stiffen your natural hair&amp;#34;, but this wasn&#x27;t quite true. Yes, there&#x27;s movement, but it&#x27;s not exactly soft and flexible. You can tell you have hairspray in your hair if you run your fingers through it or brush it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a whirl if you like Fekkai products as this IS a nice spray; it&#x27;s just not the ultimate hairspray if you are looking for staying power from dawn until dusk.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much for this hairspray again.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly strong hold even in wind and humidity! I have really thick, long hair - past my shoulder blades. Strong hair spray that actually holds my hair in place for several hours is a must. Plus living in Texas with wind, heat and extreme summer humidity means if I want a hairspray that works, it ends up looking like I coated my head in shellac and feels like cement. This Fekkai actually goes on in a sheer light mist just as the can says &amp; it smells ok. It holds my hair without that crispy, crunchy to the touch feel - loving that! But the kicker was after walking around a park on vacation in South Carolina with a breeze in 93 degrees &amp; 85% humidity, my hair looked awesome! I can run a brush through it and it still bounces back. To be honest, I am going to keep this Fekkai on my shelf from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairspray!  There was really nothing that I disliked at all.  The hold it provides is wonderful - definitely a firm hold but it doesn&#x27;t leave you which helmet hair. The scent is nice and fresh but it doesn&#x27;t linger. If you are looking for a lighter hold from your hairspray this isn&#x27;t your product.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Sheer Hold Hair Spray is a light hairspray. It smells really good and does not weigh down hair. Moreover, it does not leave residue on hair and washes out easily. The reason I gave it four stars is because while it has the aforementioned positives it does not standout above other hairsprays I have tried that cost less. So either this hair spray would need to add that extra something that makes it shine and stand out above the rest or reduce its cost to get five stars.</li>
            <li> Good hold without stickiness.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Sheer Hold Hair Spray is GREAT! I love it and use it exclusively, BUT...every time I order it from Amazon I have trouble with the nozzle...it keeps getting clogged and sputters and spits no matter how many times I clean it out...and this has happened on at least 3 of the bottles I have purchased from Amazon. I paid more and bought a new bottle from my local drug store and the nozzle works really well on that one. When it is empty, I&#x27;m planning on swapping out the nozzles with the Amazon purchased bottle to find out if it works, not sure if it is the nozzle or the bottle but something is amiss...unfortunately</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this from my VoxBox. I rarely use hairspray, so I am not 100% sure how well this works.  The smell is too floral, and I was not feeling that.  It did not make my hair feel sticky or stiff, but I also feel like it really wasn&#x27;t doing much.</li>
