            <li> so they won&#x27;t hurt your fingers from cutting.</li>
            <li> I have been a stylist for years and have purchased some very expensive shears.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have a very expensive pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> I feel little/no resistance when cutting hair or having my hair cut with them!</li>

            <li> Good Quality for price</li>
            <li> It is a good shear for the price.</li>
            <li> Its ok the first time i used it they folded but you get what you pay for i still have them at my station and i use them they havent folded since i think if you get them sharpen them more and i think they wont have that problem</li>
            <li> These are ok. A little too heavy for me, but pretty ok especially since they were so inexpensive</li>
            <li> I am not a professional hair stylist.  I do my own hair, extensions, wigs, weaves, etc. and I also do hair for others.  I usually purchase scissors from the beauty supply store and decided to try a pair of better quality.  Now, I know some cost thousands, but like I said I&#x27;m not a professional.  These scissors work GREAT!!! especially from what I upgraded.  I did a bob and the cut was nice, sharp, and even.  I love these scissors!!!!  I just received a text yesterday from someone who wants their hair done, can&#x27;t wait to use these scissors on them!!!</li>
            <li> Recieved my cutting shears within two days, and they are great. They cut well and are cute, the pouch they come in is perfect for the shears deff worth the buck.</li>
            <li> The quality was more than I expectated  Very we&#x27;ll made and super sharp  I would recommend these to any who cut hair professionally</li>
            <li> These are great!!  I have been a stylist for years and have purchased some very expensive shears.  These are just as good for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Only Shears I use right now.  Love them and how they feel in my hand</li>
            <li> These have gone very dull after not even two months. Good back up pair or home pair, not exactly &amp;#34;professional quality.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m a full time barber.</li>
            <li> Amazing scissors for the price, one of my favourites I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li> These scissors are beautiful. They would be a great addition to anyone&#x27;s hair cutting products. They are high quality and are made really well. They have a ring around the finger holes so they won&#x27;t hurt your fingers from cutting. Perfect pair of scissors. They are really sharp and I had no problem using them. They feel comfortable to use. I would recommend these scissors. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite shears and I get a lot of compliments on them. They fit my hand perfectly.</li>
            <li> Heavy sheers and not too sharp</li>
            <li> Really good i love it thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for this price</li>
            <li> decent but not spectacular.</li>
            <li> These looked a little funky....but the artsy appeal called to me.  I wanted a good quality hair scissors....these are sharp- precision hair scissors.  Indeed. They are beautiful works of functional art.  I plan on using them for years and saving their cost...in a matter of weeks use.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp &amp; so far stay sharp. They cut hair better than any scissors I have used. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These shears are not only beautiful; they&#x27;re durable and they cut great!</li>
            <li> Excellent !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  l.b.</li>
            <li> cool nice looking can&#x27;t wait to try them</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp to the tip...very comfortable for the hand...perfect size for me.</li>
            <li> excellent scissors, one must buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent for cutting thick hair</li>
            <li> I cut my kids hair with these. They are professional quality. All good.</li>
            <li> These are nice!  I started cutting my own hair as a way to a) cut costs and b) cut the remorse I have with every haircut I get.  I just come home and fix it, so why not do the first part myself too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these are quite nice for the price.  They come in a nice case, they&#x27;re sharp, they look kind of fancy.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> Nice product very sharp, nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Nice looking pair of scissors and very sharp. It got  the job done but the pink rings keep falling off. I loved the sparkle it gave the scissors and wish they stayed on. BTW, they fell off during the first use</li>
            <li> Excellent barber shears, very sharp and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Just got these in the mail (3 days before the promised date) and trimmed my daughter&#x27;s bangs. Cut well and fit fingers well. You can remove the rings if you need more room. Really happy with them.</li>
            <li> quality all the way, and shipped as said to be, I,m very please thanks.</li>
            <li> very good, fit perfect and very sharp..  the color is not as shown on picture, i actually received a silver one.</li>

            <li> Cut nicely but fell apart!</li>
            <li> This item is ok...not exactly what i expected. It&#x27;s ok for at home haircuts on my sons.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. I feel like I have a very expensive pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> These scissors are SHARP.  Certainly had to remove the rubber pads so that fingers would fit, but no big deal.  Very nice and they cut extremely well.</li>
            <li> extremely sharp, great product</li>
            <li> We love these as a family. I use them to cut my sons&#x27; hair and my husband uses them to trim his beard. Very nice quality and come with a very nice what appears to be leather case to keep them in.</li>
            <li> Pulled alittle bit and nut snagged hair</li>
