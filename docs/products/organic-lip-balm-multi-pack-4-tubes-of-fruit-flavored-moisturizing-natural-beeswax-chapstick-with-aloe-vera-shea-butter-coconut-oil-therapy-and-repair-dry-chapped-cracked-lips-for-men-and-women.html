            <li>The flavors are very strong, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because of the thickness of this lip balm, which makes it very easy to over apply and look like you&#x27;re wearing lip gloss, which isn&#x27;t the look</li>
            <li>Its pretty good!</li>
            <li>It got here super quick and it feels awesome.</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re just ok plus they have no spf.</li>
            <li>Much better than the store brand and some others out there.  </li>
            <li>Love these flavors for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li>The flavors are great and you don&#x27;t have to reapply very often.  </li>
            <li>I would like to buy more if there are more flavors.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more, often.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried just applying sparingly, but I still get the taste and it&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
            <li>but I find myself liking the peppermint more though.</li>
            <li>Just depends on if you like fruity or minty flavors :)</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>but I love them all :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is emollient and my lips feel 100% better.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s safe for my toddler daughter as well.</li>
            <li>- No horrible after taste    </li>
            <li>- I feel like I have to apply it more often.    </li>
            <li>but, I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li>I love the fruity variety</li>
            <li>I love these lip balms.</li>

            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful products just love them I work outside helps fight the elements.</li>
            <li>I especially love the fact that these particular balms don&#x27;t have any menthol or peppermint quality to them, just mildly fruity sweetness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this pack</li>

            <li>Soooo smooth!</li>
            <li>I love how you can recognize almost all of the ingredients on the label.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Way better than the burt&#x27;s bee lip balm I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>Using the Beauty by Earth Lip Balm, made them smooth and supple after one use!</li>
            <li>They taste ok but wish they had more flavor/smell to them.</li>
            <li>I will order more when needed.</li>
            <li>Im glad I went with this set</li>
            <li>I will be back for more once they get lost in my couch or car.  :D</li>
            <li>This Chapstick is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>but so many don&#x27;t deliver on flavor or texture.</li>
            <li>This is better than chap stick that I always used.  </li>
            <li>I also really enjoyed the flavours and so did my boys.</li>
            <li>Having no daughters of my own, I really enjoy the chance to purchase &#x27;girly&#x27; things for my daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li>Knowing both of them love lip balms, one of them laughingly declaring her addiction to them, I ran across these lip balms on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love chapstick or lip balm.</li>
            <li>The flavors are great and the feel is very silky.</li>

            <li>I am so glad I ordered this</li>
            <li>My kids love it too</li>
            <li>This is one of the top two lip products I have used.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t run out. :)</li>
            <li>I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees but this is even smoother.</li>
            <li>The different flavors smell and taste delicious!</li>
            <li>Immediately helped my chapped lips to feel better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>These exotic flavors smell (and taste)</li>
            <li>My favorite part of these lip balms is the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>Every lip balm I&#x27;ve tried always goes on ok but end up drying out my lips even more.</li>
            <li>Really glad I ordered this set of 4 Beauty by Earth LIP BALM.  </li>
            <li>Interesting fruity flavors.</li>
            <li>We love the flavors, the texture, the smoothness</li>

            <li>I really enjoyed the flavors too.  </li>
            <li>I love that these come in a 4 pack.  </li>
            <li>I love all the oils in it..</li>
            <li>Which means much more value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>most (compared to the flavored 4 pack)  </li>
            <li>Really is top quality, from the packaging to the product itself.</li>
            <li>This lip balm has an amazing taste, and goes on light and is not too waxy, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>okay, I&#x27;m a lip balm addict.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard  of the product, but I&#x27;m really glad that I took a chance and ordered.</li>
            <li>Better to use this than some type of petroleum products.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li>Absolitely love them.&lt;br /&gt;Size</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to trying more of Beauty by Earth&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I think I would like the peppermint ones better.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re much better.</li>
            <li>Love this chapstick...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t just pick one favorite.</li>
            <li>These are lovely.</li>
            <li>The Asian pear is my favorite, but all flavors are great!</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm</li>
            <li>ALL the ingredients are listed and are safe, NOT tested on animals etc.</li>
            <li>It is differently my favorite for now.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was prepared to LOVE this stuff, based on people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many many before- burt&#x27;s bees, kiehls lip balm # 1,</li>
            <li>GREAT quality all natural pretty packaging smells and tastes great love</li>
            <li>The lip balm works really well and the 4 pack includes a very nice selection of flavors.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and flavorful.</li>
            <li>The sweet flavor is nice and enjoyable, but I have to have self control not to lick it -</li>
            <li>These are high quality, smell and taste great and aren&#x27;t too waxy.  </li>
            <li>They go on super silky and do not cause my lips to peel as many lip balms can!  </li>
            <li>But the flavored 4 pack is still the same great formula, its fun for a change and its great for kids.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and awesome flavors!</li>
            <li>The pomegranate one has a sweet taste which is nice except that taste is in my mouth all day.</li>
            <li>I have a soy allergy and was glad to find a reasonable price, good tasting lip balm :)</li>
            <li>really nice sweet flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we both loved them the first time we tried it.</li>
            <li>The flavors are all pretty good.</li>
            <li>All natural is great, but the thing that makes this product especially nice is the different varieties of scents/flavors.  </li>
            <li>Like the smell, feels pretty good on lips.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s flavors are pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>My whole family is LOVING this lip balm!  </li>
            <li>Nice full sized lip balms.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm, beeswax chapsticks are my favorite type and the unique flavors make me happy.</li>
            <li>A nice, mild flavor.</li>
            <li>Nice mild flavors.</li>
            <li>Far superior to popular drugstore brands at a comparable price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear any kind of lip products b/c of the metals and so far so good without any allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li>Great natural lip balm!</li>
            <li>They all smell and taste great, and they keep your lips soft long-term!</li>
            <li>i love these lip balms - they taste great - they go on nicely and stay on a long time</li>
            <li>My husband and I split this - we are both very satisfied with not only the quality but the pleasant scent of each one.</li>
            <li>The flavors are all very true to their name.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these, I would say better than Burt&#x27;s since they stay moist longer on my lips.</li>
            <li>Great for the all natural lifestyle.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that it is made of natural ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t take much to make your lips feel great!  </li>
            <li>All natural, not sticky and great flavor assortment.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, tastes and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>it literally has no flavor and is light better than carmex</li>
            <li>This is great as a gift or if youjust want some all natural lip balm.</li>
            <li>The great part is it&#x27;s 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a sign of a great all natural product.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth texture on my lips.  </li>
            <li>I love that it goes on smooth and stays on without drying your lips out.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth these feel on your lips &amp;</li>
            <li>Great stuff, all natural and</li>
            <li>I was happy with the results thus far.  </li>
            <li>She loves natural products and I knew this would be a great choice.</li>
            <li>These moisturize my lips very well and they taste good.</li>
            <li>I love that they are clear and have a good flavor that is not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is good, feel like it really conditions my lips.  </li>
            <li>I have given 2 away and they loved them as much as I did.</li>
            <li>The other flavors are awesome.</li>
            <li>It is nauseatingly sweet!</li>
            <li>Flavors are unique, but as many lip balms as i have tried, I am still a lover of &amp;#34;Kiss</li>
            <li>They make my lips so soft, they taste great, leave a nice shine, and are apparently pretty organic.</li>
            <li>Wonderful and will continue to buy this over any other lip balm.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li>Why the heck is it so sweet?!</li>
            <li>sweet and most important is that it keeps my lips most for hours.</li>
            <li>It also actually has a very pleasant taste slightly sweet and fruit-like.  </li>
            <li>Melts easy in the car as well</li>
            <li>The flavors if you will are very mild if you lick your lips</li>
            <li>I really did not think that I would find something I liked better than Labello.  </li>
            <li>The company is a pleasure to work with- as they were very quick to check in for feedback.</li>
            <li>This product is a great product for anyone that is careful about what they put on the family and their own body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a lipstick person, these work great with giving my lip stain just enough shine :)</li>
            <li>but I think they&#x27;re great and will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping,thank you guys:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>AND best of all they use economical for the Earth recycled cardboard, not so fancy schmancy packaging (which YOU pay for) and which I totally support.</li>
            <li>It went on better the Chapstick and didn&#x27;t have to be applied as often as Vaseline; however, it didn&#x27;t make my lips as soft Vaseline and didn&#x27;t feel as good going and being on my lips.</li>
            <li>Scents aren&#x27;t too strong so I like it.  </li>
            <li>I like the balm itself, but the flavors are strong.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the flavors being too strong but they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but they were too strong flavor for me and caused alergy to my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have good lip balms in my purse, car, bedroom, etc and not have to worry about bringing the same one everywhere.</li>
            <li>I tried Beauty by Earth&#x27;s product because of the great reviews and consistent positive feedback.  </li>
            <li>The flavors smell delicious &amp; I feel safe letting my young daughters use this products because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>The flavors are pretty amazing, too.</li>
            <li>All the favors are sweet but not too sticky, feels more like balm than chapstick, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many through the years and finally discovered that some do more harm than good.  </li>
            <li>Awesome lip balm, my lips get super dry and chapped in the winter</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best beeswax lip balm I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Every girl, whether a young one, or us &#x27;older&#x27;  girls should treat themselves to these balms, they are awesome!!</li>
            <li>very good for dry lips.</li>
            <li>- Tastes fine</li>
            <li>I received this set for free and even though I prefer the peppermint lip balm much more, these were not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Gives your lips the slightest hint of shimmer, which is perfectly fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on really smooth, nice flavor, and feels very moist!</li>
            <li>Fine lip balm, divine aroma.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fine</li>
            <li>Also the packaging is super cute, it&#x27;s like the size of your hand.</li>
            <li>The peppermint does have a strong tingling sensation, which I quite enjoy in my lip balms, but others may find over powering.</li>
            <li>Pleasant flavor and scent, this clear colored lip balm goes on like a lip gloss, leaving you with shiny lips.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Feels waxy and wears off quickly but tastes yummy!</li>
            <li>All of those lip balms either don&#x27;t protect your lips, wear off to quickly, appear too glossy on the lips, and/or contain many chemicals.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, very soft and smooth on the lips.  </li>
            <li>It feels really nice on the lips, last long (I maybe need to apply it at most twice a day) and it smells DELICIOUS.</li>
            <li>I like this product, makes my lips very soft, the flavors are nice :)</li>
            <li>All natural formula smells great and has absolutely no unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li>Which is something I&#x27;m quite happy to say since I&#x27;m really quite enjoying an all natural company!</li>
            <li>Within a week I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but then again, do I want my purchase to support a small-family business or a huge mega-corporation</li>
            <li>They taste amazing and really make my lips feel moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>balm- what a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>The company sent me free samples of their peppermint.</li>
            <li>My lips really suffer this time of year, and will have these handy everywhere</li>
            <li>They are absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>Enjoy using them every day this winter.  </li>
            <li>They are smooth and not grainy.</li>
            <li>The chapstick applies smoothly and leaves lips feeling softer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find myself licking my lips constantly to enjoy them.  </li>
            <li>These glide on smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Every product in this package has such a great smell.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a great lip balm and have finally found one.  </li>
            <li>I think the products are great and purchased several others-Witch hazel, Arman Oil, Suntan lotion and sponges.  </li>
            <li>It does last quite a bit of time on my lips, which is great.</li>
            <li>They also go on smooth, there is no grainy texture that some lip balms have.</li>
            <li>We all enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Smooth application, not waxy feeling.</li>
            <li>(Even the green tea is wonderful!)</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The products are Cruelty Free, which is extremely important to me; no animals need to be tested on for a</li>
            <li>ever!&lt;br /&gt;Really smooth and sooooo yummy.</li>
            <li>I used to primarily use EOS</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really smooth</li>
            <li>and it smells and taste fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough great things about this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally have a lip balm in every purse that works for me!</li>
            <li>Also, I never received the free sample promised for writing a review.</li>
            <li>Smooth, not waxy.</li>
            <li>And my sister stole the Asian Pair before I could try it, lol.</li>
            <li>What fantastic products.</li>
            <li>Great quality, but too sugary for my taste, which actually refrains me from using it!!</li>
            <li>The Beauty By Earth lip balm spreads on smoothly and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>I was not paid or bribed to change my rating, nor was I given anything free.</li>
            <li>I am a green tea drinker but the flavor is something I was not expecting to be the best out of the 4.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy snuggling up to.)  </li>
            <li>And all the flavors are fabulous</li>
            <li>They go on so smooth</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>And they go on smoothly, and keep your lips moisturized.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>I bought these at a reduced cost to use them and write my honest and unpaid review.</li>
            <li>I will be using this as a stocking stuffer or thoughtful gift in years to come.</li>
            <li>I like how this glides on silky smooth and is light.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave an after taste in your mouth and it does keep my lips looking fabulous.  </li>
            <li>but they are all fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I wear these over lip stains and they are pretty good about not disturbing the color.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery :) love the flavor and the way it feels on my lips.</li>
            <li>Tastes good, keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li>These balms are better than the burts bee balms, so much richer and offer more moisture.</li>
            <li>I found something natural and good for me.</li>
            <li>So far I loved it -</li>
            <li>I give it 5 start for being natural, smells and taste good, and you can feel it moisturizing and heal your lips.</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent the price right in line with any of those junk commercial products and well....you will love them as much as we do.  </li>
            <li>Nothing helped, until I started using these wonderful balms :) Now my lips are back to their soft, smooth, and calm selves!</li>
            <li>They go on more smoothly than a lot of lip balms and have a delicious sweet taste if you happen to taste them (instead of that icky chap stick type of taste).  </li>
            <li>Creamy, long lasting, smells great, tastes great.</li>
            <li>Excellent product overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have been using lip products as long as I can remember, and for a nice moisturization with nice scent/flavor, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>My new favorite lip balm!</li>

            <li>I love all of them very much.</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>I am loving these ones so far!!</li>
            <li>Ordering was easy and I enjoyed the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The flavored are such a great surprise and are very pleasant but not overwhelming like some on the market.</li>
            <li>;) about to buy more for my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I also love that the company is a small, family owned operation and the price was good too!</li>
            <li>it lasts long and tastes great on your lips.</li>
            <li>You can kiss her and enjoy a sweet flavor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands, this is definitely one of the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I have finally found a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The flavors are unique rather than vanilla or strawberry.</li>
            <li>Chapstick goes on smooth and my lips feel nice and soft!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Will be back for more of these for sure!</li>
            <li>and I know fresh beeswax!  </li>
            <li>very pleased with the result, so far 😊</li>
            <li>The scent is heavenly, and the flavor is light and sweet without a trace of chemical flavoring (like I&#x27;ve noticed with the Eos lip balms).</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and made in the U.S.A!!!!</li>
            <li>If you want to enjoy the flavors more, don&#x27;t expect them to taste a certain way before trying.</li>
            <li>Better than Burt&#x27;s bees so far I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>own personal favorite is the Acai + Goji Berry.</li>
            <li>Super smooth application not waxy or glossy.  </li>
            <li>Clean ingredients.</li>
            <li>It goes on super smooth, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Awesomely natural, soothing, great flavors, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>A few days ago he commented how nice that stick was and loved the taste too&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So far I love them!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this lip balm for about two weeks now and so far, I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love the natural ingredients - I have made my own lip balms and am willing to pay for these.</li>
            <li>So far I love these chapsticks!  </li>
            <li>The flavors are amazing and super unique, my favorite is the Asian Pear.  </li>
            <li>They leave your lips soft and smooth , look no further for a great lip balm here it is ,This product comes in 4 exotic flavors .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scents are amazing and smooth and really go on easy and last quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Would certainly buy more.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see what makes them special.</li>
            <li>Beauty by Earth has got it right!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve got 4 years of chapstick right here!</li>
            <li>It is very effective to my dry and sore lips...</li>
            <li>These feel fabulous on my lips and the flavors are subtle but delicious smelling.  </li>
            <li>All natural, high quality, smells and tastes great.</li>
            <li>My whole family tried these, and we love them.</li>
            <li>&gt; My only issue with these is that since the flavor is good, I have to fight not to lick my lips, which would defeat the purpose of applying it.</li>
            <li>and boy I am just thrilled so far.</li>
            <li>I really avoided using most chapsticks or lip balms because they have a chemical taste and sticky feel.</li>
            <li>is a true bonus.</li>
            <li>so far its kept my lips nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I tried 4 different scents but all of them smells good.  </li>
            <li>However its way to sweet.</li>
            <li>To me, the flavoring across the line was sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>Did not find to be too sweet like some others have said</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like anything sweet</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; don&#x27;t really have too potent of a smell/flavor.</li>
            <li>Lips feel moisturized and the sweet taste helps too.</li>
            <li>Hours after you use it you&#x27;ll still have a subtly sweet taste on your lips</li>
            <li>I recently purchased these lip balm and loved it.</li>
            <li>Most fragrances and textures really bother him and no lip balm nor ointment has helped, until now.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, a touch sweet.</li>
            <li>I feel very prepared for a chapped lip free winter!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much</li>
            <li>Not too sweet as others have said.</li>
            <li>My whole family (including my 2 kids) love the balms and use them.</li>
            <li>Too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too sweet</li>
            <li>it is sweet - you can taste it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much if I put it on both my top and bottom lip</li>
            <li>They smell really good and that should&#x27;ve been enough.</li>
            <li>Too sweet, and greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my wife and she loves them, for their sweet fragrances, and for their moisturizing property.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and love the packaging as well as the scents for each.  </li>
            <li>I love these lip balms because they are not only natural, but they feel great on my lips.  </li>
            <li>my lips are still nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased and loved the peppermint variety, but wanted to try some different flavors since I have people in my life that can&#x27;t handle mint (I know)</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t like sweet chapstick then maybe it isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>The bf thought they were too sweet</li>
            <li>It tastes sweet also.</li>
            <li>Nice to know it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t like the cherry one, too sweet.</li>
            <li>, my lips are definitely nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and she loves them so much that we&#x27;ve purchased more.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the sweet taste that sometimes winds up in your mouth.</li>
            <li>lips are definitely better than before thanks</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be too sweet.</li>
            <li>: They&#x27;re a tad sweet for my taste</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and truly moisturizes and is absorbed instead of just being waxy.  </li>
            <li>Too sweet.</li>
            <li>It is not too greasy, not too waxy, it tastes good when you do taste it, it stays on for the required number of hours before necessary reapplication.</li>
            <li>There are (much) cheaper and (much) better ones out there.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and there is a gentle sweet taste too.</li>
            <li>The old bat says the Asian pear goes on smooth and tastes good as well!</li>
            <li>love it,  BBE products are my favorite and these lip balms work so much better than any other that of tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best of all, no more chapped lips!</li>
            <li>The Asian pear is my favorite, glides on very smooth and lasts with no waxy feeling.</li>
            <li>They are packaged nicely (would make a nice gift) and the ingredients are not only all natural, but are also free of soy (which one of my daughters is allergic to).</li>
            <li>These are very nice product, i love them,they smells amazing, especially the Asian pear :), definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>great product,  most satisfying purchase i have made in a long, long time!</li>
            <li>Every flavor tastes subtle yet wonderful</li>
            <li>This came quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my lip super moisturized.</li>
            <li>2 days after buying I had to come back and make sure I got more to pass out to friends.</li>
            <li>and I quickly became adjusted.</li>
            <li>You just have to keep applying every now and then as it dries out quickly.</li>
            <li>flavors are awesome and they do last so you are not constantly re-applying.  </li>
            <li>Also, they came quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>So many companies say they are natural and free of toxins</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more when I run out. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky, as you can imagine...</li>
            <li>so they get used up quickly, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything like that with this product.</li>
            <li>I am super picky about my lip balms.</li>
            <li>I wish they lasted a bit longer on the lips, but they do have relatively adequate staying power.</li>
            <li>Also seems like the balm wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick, nothing was damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was shipped quick.</li>
            <li>The unique fruit flavors are a treat: subtle but very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth consistency and love the natural ingredients, but this line--up of flavors way too sweet and not to my personal taste.</li>
            <li>My lips feel pretty fabulous now after using this for a day.</li>
            <li>These balms are silky smooth and come in some amazing flavors (green tea is my favorite).</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy the diverse flavors, I would be interested in trying to minty version of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I do find myself having to apply this chapstick very often compared to Burt&#x27;s Bees to get the same coverage, the taste is also a bit overwhelming and gets kind of stuck in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using the Green Tea variety, and it&#x27;s the absolute best one in the pack.</li>
            <li>is my new favorite lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is now my new lip balm for sure.  </li>
            <li>It is defiantly one of my new favorite lip balms.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m in good moist lips throughout the dry winter here.</li>
            <li>I wish somewhere in its description it would say something to that effect, but alas here I am stuck with a set of four wonderfully fragrant but candy sweet lip balms.</li>
            <li>I bought this pack of 4 flavors several months ago and LOVED the lip balms so much!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for moisturizing my dry lips</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who has very sensitive skin, most lip balms irritate and cause cracking on the sides of her lips.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li>I love the way the lip balm feels on my lips and love how long it lasts!</li>
            <li>Thanks Beauty by Earth!!</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that I am using natural products!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying a lot more of these!</li>
            <li>i am very dissapointed with this purchase !!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>This is the first lip balm with no weird tastes &amp; strong smells.</li>
            <li>I liked all the positive reviews for the Beauty by Earth and the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for less chemical-y, cruelty-free, more natural lip balm when I stumbled upon this great product.  </li>
            <li>My lips feel soft but not greasy, there&#x27;s no weird &amp;#34;aftertaste&amp;#34; like some other lip balms I&#x27;ve used, and the flavors/scents are delicious.  </li>
            <li>After suffering through an unusually dry winter, and buying nearly every kind of &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; lip balm at the drug store, I decided to look for something all natural and hopefully more effective.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and glides on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Smells great but also not too heavy</li>
            <li>Not only does it taste amazing</li>
            <li>They all smell amazing but the green tea is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and feels very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>The flavors are yummy, it goes on smoothly and makes my lips feel very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Great limp balm/chapsticks</li>
            <li>The smell of green tea is so great, and i am just can&#x27;t stop using it every morning.</li>
            <li>These balms go on smooth, since they contain beeswax, and are very comforting.  </li>
            <li>Leaves lips smooth &amp; smells very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went on smooth, wasn&#x27;t sticky/gummy at all, and has really helped to moisturize my lips.</li>
            <li>They are very moisturizing and smell/taste fantastic.</li>
            <li>This lip balm goes on so smoothly and does not leave you feeling like you need to put on more 1 hour later.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about these lip balms is the natural ingredients with no petroleum or mineral oil.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it, if you&#x27;re like me and carry lip balm on your person all the time.</li>
            <li>I love that they are natural.  </li>
            <li>They enjoyed the all natural ingredients and the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed my routine from the cheap \\&quot;petroleum\\&quot; chapsticks and switched over to these more natural ways of keeping my lips not only moist but healthy.</li>
            <li>I also love that they are all natural.  </li>
            <li>Keep your lips soft and smooth without having to eat a bunch of chemicals!</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this product because it really does make my lips feel better definitely worth the price and will definitely buy it again soon</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its natural .</li>
            <li>I love that it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>Many lip balms that are made with natural ingredients just don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>So far this is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li>love the mix of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>They are made of more natural ingredients, and produced without testing on animals.  </li>
            <li>recommend the product based on the feedback, and I was pleased with with dealing direct with the company.  </li>
            <li>Usually lip balms are too sweet or soft or waxy, but these feel perfect.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and a family owned business.</li>
            <li>worked like a charm more natural than burts bees.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the Beauty By Earth product for a couple of weeks, but I&#x27;m really happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try something more natural</li>
            <li>So far, I love them.  </li>
            <li>I also like it is made from natural stuff and feel safe to use them on my kids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the grape and acai berry flavor so far and it feels great.</li>
            <li>I purchased these Beauty By Earth lip balms, wow, better than any I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for natural, healthy products to use on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This feels Natural and love it.</li>
            <li>I love natural products.</li>
            <li>I love the scents and that they are made from all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>The flavors are pretty sweet though.</li>
            <li>I use Nivea and E.O.S and this is by far my favorite lip balm out there.</li>
            <li>is a bit smaller than what i expected, but nonetheless great!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural as well</li>
            <li>I love this natural lip balm.</li>
            <li>so worth the money.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this multipack more than the peppermint (personal flavor preference).</li>
            <li>They have the same qualities as the original product which make up a great lip balm with the added benefit of various flavors.</li>
            <li>My first priority is natural and safe ingredients, so I am thrilled to have found these flavorful lip balms that have been made so consciously and responsibly.</li>
            <li>Still tasty, and they still feel awesome on the lips, but I liked the old formula better. :(</li>
            <li>The green tea has a nice light scent and isn&#x27;t too sweet.</li>
            <li>Other than that, all&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Got the product right away</li>
            <li>Bought it for like $10, which felt about right for a fancy box of lip balm.</li>
            <li>Reviews are right on.</li>
            <li>and I must say everyone was right.  </li>
            <li>The reviews are so right.</li>
            <li>and I tried it out right away.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more natural to try and this really did the trick!</li>
            <li>The different flavors all smell good (not too strong, just enough).</li>
            <li>Most natural chap sticks don&#x27;t have much flavor, but these do!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product as it is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make my lips more chapped and given my skin is super sensitive and I&#x27;ll get an allergic reaction to pretty much anything</li>
            <li>found this product left my lips feeling soft and supple, the different flavors are awesome .This</li>
            <li>Product feels smooth on my lips, and I feel good supporting the small business that manufactures it...</li>
            <li>It actually helped my lips get better, and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have much on my lips making it feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>I like the exotic fruit, the subtle flavors are very appealing.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding things like this that make my lips even just feel good and smooth, and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am a huge addict of lip balm and I am always up to trying new ones.</li>
            <li>The green tea is actually the best smelling one in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the scents I tried but found the green tea overwhelming when it was on ...</li>
            <li>This package was awesome as it gives you a variety and should keep me stocked for the next few months.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, not waxy at all, natural, not over powering with the sent/taste, reasonably priced, overall fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I was excited as it was largely organic and reasonably priced at Costco.</li>
            <li>I live in a super dry area, all dirt and sage brush, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good lip balm because no matter how much water I drink my lips get chapped.</li>
            <li>BBE lip balms are very, very moisturizing but not in a greasy or waxy way.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was also very reasonable and timely.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle and has not caused any problems for her, in fact it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable as well.  </li>
            <li>The closest I&#x27;ve gotten to try either of those two flavors is that old quick kiss as he walks out the door!  </li>
            <li>But this lip balm is honestly better than any of the less natural variety I use to own.  </li>
            <li>My lips were dry since I use the lipsticks very often,and my lips getting much softer and has good moisture status now.</li>
            <li>loved that first pack so much, I bought a new pack recently.</li>
            <li>Beauty by earth lip balm is very easy to use on the contrary and it keeps lips moisturized for quite long time.</li>
            <li>I sent it as little gifts for my families overseas, they loved it.</li>
            <li>I choose to open the green tea flavor first to save the best for last, but it has such a pleasant smell and taste ( my husband even like it) that I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest.</li>
            <li>but I find that they keep my lips moisturized enough that my natural lip color looks just fine without the added tint:)</li>
            <li>The flavors are really interesting and different</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more once my supply runs out.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and my lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Really helps chapped lips!</li>
            <li>Upon first application the ChapStick glides effortlessly and adheres to your lips.</li>
            <li>I love that they only use 100% organic products in there lip moisturizer!</li>
            <li>They taste great, last long, and don&#x27;t have any sticky/waxyness to them.</li>
            <li>Be careful and don&#x27;t let them get too warm, though they melt a bit easier than others.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and soft, not sticky.  </li>
            <li>love this product, I would definitely buy from Beauty by earth again...</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and leaves my lips feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying more products from Beauty by Earth in the future!</li>
            <li>smooth, creamy and such sweet taste.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but so far I really do enjoy it.</li>
            <li>love that it is in a pack of 4 and that they are all different flavors.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t heavy and best of all doesn&#x27;t have to be applied but a few times a day.  </li>
            <li>Use it sooo much!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this again and will look into more of their selections.</li>
            <li>Our family really like this lip balm!</li>
            <li>I have been using many different kinds of lip balm for ages.</li>
            <li>That said, the flavors are very tasty and not artificial tasting - probably too tasty.  </li>
            <li>The package is pretty convenient as I have one at home, at the office, in my gym bag and purse.</li>
            <li>The flavors are yummy and its so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first lip balm that works for my whole family!  </li>
            <li>it really hydrates my lips!</li>
            <li>I love the different flavors.  </li>
            <li>Love all of the different flavors !!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more for myself.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of them in the future.</li>
            <li>I wish the packaging was a bit larger and more decorated.</li>
            <li>Probably my all time favorite lip balm, and I&#x27;m a total chapstick junkie!</li>
            <li>It feels really soft and smooth going on, I like the scents/flavors</li>
            <li>definitely be purchasing from Beauty by Earth again :)</li>
            <li>Love the asian pear.</li>
            <li>Also she really loves the variety of flavors!</li>
            <li>Their lips have been so chapped, and this helped after the first day of using it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I just love them!I tryed the minty ones from the same company</li>
            <li>Just tried Beauty Earth Lip Balm for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different brands and have not found one that works as well as these do!  </li>
            <li>Once I run out of my four tubes, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this product line.  </li>
            <li>If you have pretty damaged lips you will like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>but I do like it better than the traditional &amp;#34;chap-stick&amp;#34; type lip balm.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase and will continue buying when I run out in the future.</li>
            <li>And shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li>Yeaay!;-)</li>
            <li>Even within that category I have only found 2 that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and make my lips feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I used this lip balm today and it went on soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>We love the asian pear flavor.  </li>
            <li>Also love the different flavors in the 4 pack.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried these it felt as if it had no flavor.</li>
            <li>and I actually like it a bit more.</li>
            <li>From the fruity ones that smell good to the medicated, heavy duty balms...they all do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased many brands from Fresh, Tarte, Bareminerals, etc and this by far my favorite hands down.</li>
            <li>But I can live with that to have a nice lip balm that I only have to apply 3 or 4 times a day rather than 20 times.</li>
            <li>I really like the way that these lip balms make my lips very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Tastes good but not long lasting</li>
            <li>I loved this so much in the first few days, I ordered another set</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lip balm because of its unique flavors and it was a 100 % natural beeswax.</li>
            <li>I bought this lip balm after long research &amp; it&#x27;s really turned out to be verrrry good &amp; natural....</li>
            <li>The net result is my friend got both sets of flavor and that was all a huge success.  </li>
            <li>They melt pretty easily, so when I carry one around in my purse, I find the texture much more oily than usual.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is all natural and much prefer it over some other popular all natural brands sold in stores all over the place!</li>
            <li>so much I bought several more variety packs for stocking stuffers for my daughters for Christmas.</li>
            <li>My mom loves this lip balm and so do I, the green tea lip balm for me though had little pieces sticking to my lip but besides that the other ones are great and smell really good!</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable and appreciated for something you like, that works.</li>
            <li>It feels really smooth and lasts for a super long time throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I went by all the positive reviews and purchased this</li>
            <li>The lip balms feel great, smell great, don&#x27;t leave weird residue on cups (or people), and protect from the harsh winter winds.</li>
            <li>Love the texture and how long it lasts once I put it on.</li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly and I love how long it lasts on the lips.  </li>
            <li>As a &amp;#34;lip balm junkie&amp;#34; I have tried pretty much all that is out there.  </li>
            <li>The flavors now are so light, you can barely tell they&#x27;re flavored at all.  </li>
            <li>I love the silky consistency and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much any lip balm I could find and couldn&#x27;t get relief.  </li>
            <li>The company really seems to care about their product and this is evident in the packaging and quality of ingredients.</li>
            <li>This product is very good quality and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The just plain peppermint flavor is perfect but these other flavors are just too shiny.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about what I put on my lips.</li>
            <li>Super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, but it&#x27;s the flavors that really puts it over the top.</li>
            <li>The only thing with this product is that the taste is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Not too strong but enough scent</li>
            <li>They taste a little sweet, just in case you happen to :) But moisturize my lips very well.</li>
            <li>when I used to be able to just swipe quickly), and the flavors changed a little.</li>
            <li>Plus, with the pure, non-petroleum ingredients, this lip balm can be used with 100% confidence.</li>
            <li>Ive tried all but the green tea flavor and love them all!</li>
            <li>Green tea is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I just got this product a few days ago and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>sounded new, different, interesting.  </li>
            <li>If I had any complaint, the flavors are a bit strong for my liking, I prefer a more neutral lip balm.  </li>
            <li>The green tea lip balm is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>We definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a love for natural beauty products!</li>
            <li>I have been trying to use more natural products and have found that many don&#x27;t have the right texture, or the flavors are no good.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very smooth and they make my lips so soft, plus they&#x27;re definitely long-lasting!</li>
            <li>This ChapStick is immediately self evident that it is of a high quality.</li>
            <li>(the green tea is maybe a little sweeter than I&#x27;d expect, but it&#x27;s still delicious).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a major chap stick user and am really picky about them and have been looking for a good all natural one for a long time.</li>
            <li>This Beauty by Nature lip balm smoothly glides on your lips, leaving the gentle feeling of a luxioursly deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Within just two days I noticed a huge difference in our lips especially my son&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lip balm!  </li>
            <li>I also feel they are reasonably priced for the quantity and quality of lip balm you are getting.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a lip balm that I can basically eat, since I wear so much of it.</li>
            <li>To me Baby Lips is creamy but it doesn&#x27;t feel like my lips are absorbing anything.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the creamy texture and how it feels on my lips.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to reapply very often either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like Beauty by Earth&#x27;s set of lip balm.  </li>
            <li>They feel silky smooth going on and last for a while.</li>
            <li>she really likes the flavors of these products.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.  </li>
            <li>These seem to really moisturize and are not too sticky or too shiny.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>but nothing really worked well for me.</li>
            <li>I liked these so much that I added on a set to the present I sent my sister for her birthday last week.</li>
            <li>model.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My whole family loves it.  </li>
            <li>This may change as the winter comes, but I imagine, I won&#x27;t need to use that much then</li>
            <li>cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that it really messed up my lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much prefer flavorless for this reason.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very moisturizing</li>
            <li>This product really helps my chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li>Keep an open mind and enjoy the flavors for what they are.</li>
            <li>She said really likes Acai &amp; Goji Berry and shared one of the remaining three with her friend.  </li>
            <li>This lip balm stays on and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I just got my order (faster than promised) and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it really seems to soften and condition my lips.  </li>
            <li>It really is smoother than EOS and I find that I don&#x27;t have to apply it as much.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both want natural products made with fresh ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Dont really like the acai berry.</li>
            <li>It really stays on your mouth, to the point that I&#x27;ll put it on in the morning</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They moisten and comfort your lips very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and smooth!,&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I got my shipment fast and with ease.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to lip balm lovers!</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the fact that they are also organic with no harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be purchasing it again.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth and they last.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>I am really picky with chapstick.</li>
            <li>Soften my lips very well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll include all the bullet points, just not as much</li>
            <li>have to apply too much.</li>
            <li>im going for as a straight male.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>The balm works really well</li>
            <li>This really helps the dryness.</li>
            <li>I really really like this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this company and their products.  </li>
            <li>They glide on smooth and last!  </li>
            <li>I really like these balms and would recommend them.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works well.</li>
            <li>I also really like the flavors.</li>
            <li>I really like these lip balms.</li>
            <li>I find that Burts Bees is much too waxy anyway.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>We needed something natural for medical reasons &amp; love the texture, smell, and quality of this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural I have been looking for something like this for a while and finally found it</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s cheaper than any other natural lip balms you get in-store but better!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re dry or taste funny or don&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>These are just as good, especially if you live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>My favorite flavors are the Asian Pear and the Green Tea - so unique!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and stay for a long hours.</li>
            <li>I was particularly excited about the multi-pack as it gave me a chance to try out all of the different flavor options.</li>
            <li>It works even better than that other stuff.</li>
            <li>With many other brands my lips would literally burn the moment I applied it.</li>
            <li>In the past I had used some brands that had to be applied constantly as they would wear off and require more and more applications.</li>
            <li>Not only does this balm do its job, but they &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; great and are long lasting.</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered 2 more sets and am planning to order the argan oil  along some other products I eyed that are made by this company.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I tried the peppermint lip balms from this company and had to try the other flavors because of how much I love this brand.</li>
            <li>This product works much better than Chap Stick and other lip balms I have tried.</li>
            <li>, they were much more affordable than some of the other organic balms on the Am.</li>
            <li>Great lip balm with very subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>They are very smooth and creamy, i prefer this over my other lip balms!</li>
            <li>All natural, which my lips very much appreciate.</li>
            <li>I love how it lasts longer than other lip balms I have tried and enjoy the diverse flavors, especially the green tea, and plan to buy more for my family to try.</li>
            <li>Since they are all natural there is no alcohol in in to dry out my lips like most flavored types do.  </li>
            <li>If the amazing all natural lasting hydration wasn&#x27;t enough, the fragrances are truly a mini getaway!</li>
            <li>It not only made my chapped lips smooth and soft, it lasts all day!  </li>
            <li>It is the only lip balm that I&#x27;ve tried that really satisfies my sensitive skin and and leaves my lips feeling silky smooth for hours.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm goes on smoothly and the moisture stayed on my lips for a long time.</li>
            <li>All natural really does seem to make a difference!</li>
            <li>When I first used it, i was thrown off at how soft it was - almost like it was partically melted.</li>
            <li>The ingredients list is short and sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to certain ingredients</li>
            <li>Add a little sheen to them as well, not too much though :)</li>
            <li>This may be my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lip balm!</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a normal to somewhat intense lip repair compound.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and the moisture lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry lips &amp; have tried every Chapstick available.</li>
            <li>I love the slight gritiness that melts away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used to the green tea and it feels and tastes good.</li>
            <li>I may have been guilty of licking it off once or twice, but without interference, they&#x27;re great, haha.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement for my beloved Rachel Perry Lip Lover lip balms since they went out of business a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve finally found the one!</li>
            <li>I started using Asian pear one, and as another review said, I love the smell and a little sweet flavor of</li>
            <li>So far, the response has been positive.</li>
            <li>They can be better if they&#x27;re not sweet.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants baby soft lips!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this lip balm to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Just know that Beauty by Earth has high quality lip balm.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these ones...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered several lip balms recently looking for something new and better than what I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>I only needed to reapply after 4 hours which is amazing compared to other lip balms</li>
            <li>I love that they are all natural and they stay on your lips for quite a bit longer than other balms I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>But this has a creamy texture (a little more creamier than Eos) and feels hydrating.</li>
            <li>so I am never without soft lips!!</li>
            <li>my lips are actually starting to heal for the first time in months!</li>
            <li>My lips have never felt better, and I have every intention of buying them again, for myself and for friends, as little gifts.  </li>
            <li>This is made with very safe ingredients, doesn&#x27;t taste nasty or like chemicals, moisturizes VERY well, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I really like these all natural lip balms but the smell and taste</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly over my lips and is not granular or rough.</li>
            <li>it really feels natural.</li>
            <li>It was great orginally, but then they all turned grainy and started having clumps of some weird textured stuff on my lips.</li>
            <li>I have another 100% natural product that I really like.  </li>
            <li>The green tea is my favorite</li>
            <li>I normally have a problem with chapped lips.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is worth every penny, especially for someone who has severe dry/chapped lips.</li>
            <li>I love the green tea scent and flavor.</li>
            <li>I put it on before bed and my lips were completely soft and crack free by morning, I wear it at work and it stays on a long time.</li>
            <li>used Burts Beeswax for a long time, but this is so much better, and for the same price!</li>
            <li>It has a lovely green tea + honeysuckle aroma.</li>
            <li>I am thinking about to buy a few sets as Christmas gift:)</li>
            <li>Go on soft and smooth and hydrate my lips for a long time.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the green tea</li>
            <li>I tried normal chap sticks</li>
            <li>My favorite flavor is green tea.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this lip balm a lot, however I feel it is not as long lasting as others are.</li>
            <li>They all has unique flavors and at same time it&#x27;s light not heavy as other lip balms out there.</li>
            <li>They are a must-have for any lip balm fanatic (I am pretty picky with my lip balms and have a habit of trying new ones almost all the time because of not being completely satisfied).</li>
            <li>These are a new staple as far as I&#x27;m concerned!!</li>
            <li>My lips actually feel plumper wearing this amazing balm with just a slight bit of shine.</li>
            <li>My standard Chapstick just felt okay, and didn&#x27;t seem to address winter dry lips</li>
            <li>I tried many different products but still end up having extremely dry and peeling lips all the time.</li>
            <li>This Lip Balm not only smells good, smoothens my lips, it also last longer than any other chap sticks/ products I used.</li>
            <li>tried the Asian pear flavor right after I received the package.</li>
            <li>I have tried countless lip balms, I have very sensitive skin and most leave my lips feeling dry and cracked again within a day.  </li>
            <li>My first time using a lip balm with beeswax as its major ingredient and no allergic reactions so far.</li>
            <li>Finally found the right product for my sensitive lips!.</li>
            <li>lips are nice and moist all day long without drying out completely and knowing that all the ingredients are natural, non-toxic and non-GMO, I feel god to keep putting it on for this dry season.  </li>
            <li>and I live in Chicago</li>
            <li>Looking forward to BBE&#x27;s expansion of new products.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to.</li>
            <li>His new Beauty By Earth</li>
            <li>, ever since I&#x27;ve tried those, they are definitely my new</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and like to try all new kinds.</li>
            <li>so I turned to Amazon for something new.</li>
            <li>Each one is different from the other but with the same exceptional quality.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>This seems to last a lot longer and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and covers my lips with a nice layer.  </li>
            <li>This went on a lit smoother than the EOS brand when I had really chapped lips and totally helped them heal up fast.</li>
            <li>I used Burts &amp; Bees before this and it would wear off quite quick and would end up having to use it around 3+ times a day because my lips would eventually become unbearably dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I spent my money on these instead of the regular Chap Stick from Target.</li>
            <li>My lips feel very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>My lips are very sensitive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent to much money trying to find the right balm</li>
            <li>Made my lips soft and smooth so fast I didn&#x27;t have enough time to say goodbye to my dry lips.</li>
            <li>This means a great deal to me since the only other lip product I have been able to use is petroleum jelly (not easy to carry around and is messy to apply with your finger).</li>
            <li>The actual balm is smooth feeling, not heavy, an  it doesn&#x27;t burn on chapped lips like some similar products.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who uses lip balm and is looking for a natural alternative!</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm, I just received the box within the past week.  </li>
            <li>Usually, lip balms make my lip more chapped.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Overall, the lip balm is not that greasy and it is better than other brands i have tried.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural and this is it!</li>
            <li>I am an avid runner and I will definitely be putting some of this on before each run to protect my lips</li>
            <li>The product is such good quality the green tea actually tasted like tea on my lips</li>
            <li>why but for year I only drink a few sips of water during the day and mostly get little more water from soups.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Why the heck would green tea taste sweet?!</li>
            <li>This is a very clean product with a flavor lasts longer than other commercial lip balms.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, it&#x27;s not sticky or gross, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The lip balms are so smooth and buttery, and they last a really long time.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to use lip balms or chopsticks consistently because they would always make my lips get worse than it was before I used those products.</li>
            <li>They taste sweet, but not a good sweet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone with big lips that wants to keep them naturally hydrated.</li>
            <li>Smooth, long lasting and beautifully natural.</li>
            <li>I use lip balm every day throughout the year and this is the best probably because of the coconut base which is very lush and moist.  </li>
            <li>balm not only tastes great, it feels like silk and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling dry a little while later.</li>
            <li>Her lips will be well protected from the harsh cold of Chicago winds and snow as she goes back and forth for school:) I have order heading my way - I live in Florida where its just as useful to protect the most exposed part of the body - lips!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sweet, but I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually suffered burning lips and irritated throat from using certain of those lip balms.</li>
            <li>I tried calling the company directly as I just missed the cutoff for a Saturday delivery by the time I realized my mistake--they were unable to help with my problem (my fault!), but we&#x27;re very attentive and easy to communicate with.  </li>
            <li>The flavors are hardly noticeable but that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li>I feel super wasteful because I have a lot of other lip balms that I won&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li>Due to extremely dry lips I have to apply more often than I wish.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be any different but was really hoping to be surprised</li>
            <li>So, if you are a fan of the old intense flavors, do yourself a favor and find a different product!</li>
            <li>I gave the others (acai/goji berry and grapefruit/lime) to my nine-year old.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no heavy or sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>They make my lips kissable soft and smell yummy.</li>
            <li>We were looking for lip balm with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is the smoothest natural lip balm&lt;</li>
            <li>The effect of its natural materials are clear on usage.</li>
            <li>so I am and using this lip balm but also using my old one.</li>
            <li>Pro&#x27;s:  - Organic  - Natural Non-toxic Ingredients  </li>
            <li>I have always used &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34; but have been looking to change to something that was natural with no junk in it.</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>After only 4 applications I noticed how my lips are so much softer.  </li>
            <li>it was it had to be applied frequently and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have to be applied nearly as often as Vaseline and it makes my lips soft.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because my lips feel so silky soft with the lip balm that I don&#x27;t want that feeling to end.  </li>
            <li>The coverage lasts and my lips stay soft &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li>it was almost like a pack of wild berry skittles.</li>
            <li>Maybe they make this out of 100% natural regurgitated pears.</li>
            <li>After having severe chapped lip issues since August, I was looking for a natural product that might help.  </li>
            <li>Also your lips are soft while it is on.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old grandson likes to try all the varieties.</li>
            <li>I am a complete lip balm</li>
            <li>I bought this pack because I was looking for a lip balm with natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend these to a friend and will very likely purchase again!</li>
            <li>My lips are so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>All natural product.</li>
            <li>They also make my lips soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>When I use it before I go to bed, my lips are still soft and moisturized in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I like its smell, but I feel my lips are thick.it is natural anyway.</li>
            <li>They do their job very well, but you do have to constantly reapply.</li>
            <li>You can tell from the feel of them that they are made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would give this product a try as it was natural.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this lip balm because I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li>Natural tasting, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>natural.</li>
            <li>View my last &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34;, I stated you dont have to apply much.</li>
            <li>My lips have never seemed so soft.</li>
            <li>It beats everything else I&#x27;ve tried by far.</li>
            <li>I get very chapped lips all the time, this works just like your basic chap stick.</li>
            <li>It was quite the surprise to find it tasting much like Asian Pear.</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients--important because you are probably ingesting at least some of it.</li>
            <li>I love the taste of the green tea and Asian pear, they taste like nothing else that I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li>The green tea and asian pear are my favorite flavors.  </li>
            <li>The photos make the balm container appear bigger than normal, but they are normal size lip balms, so no issue carrying them around.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant, but it is a bit of a foreign feeling upon application.</li>
            <li>but if I did happen to taste it it wasn&#x27;t bitter like most other balms.</li>
            <li>The subtle hint of Asian Pear or Grapefruit and Pomegranate flavors are also good enough to eat without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>They have a light flavor, nothing is too overpowering, even though the flavors are a little different than normal.</li>
            <li>I always want to apply more to keep my lips feeling soft and tasting sweet, unlike most other flavored lip products that I hate having to wear.</li>
            <li>Love the texture and subtle flavor.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle yet tasty flavors contained in the Beauty By Earth four-pack.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle scent and the way it makes my lips feel.  </li>
            <li>The green tea was just strange, and I actually love tea.</li>
            <li>I was a big fan of the original product and decided to tryout the other flavors.  </li>
            <li>, it is 100% natural and pure beeswax lip care with aloe vera &amp; vitamin E to condition and to repair dry</li>
            <li>(In part because I have a sweet little newborn baby</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>This Beauty by Earth lip balm, although good, feels a bit wet on my lips and doesn&#x27;t last half as long as Carmex does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure why this was the case, but I decided to try something petroleum free.</li>
            <li>Stays on a long time and you don&#x27;t need much when you apply it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great being able to switch things up whenever you want, since it gets boring using the same one all the time.  </li>
            <li>If the review is a bit long you can skip straight to the conclusion</li>
            <li>The only thing I did seem to notice is that the Asian pear flavor does have a little bit of a grainy texture, as compared to the other 3 flavors, which are super smooth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a new romantic friendship.  </li>
            <li>Really keeps my dry lips moisturized.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care flavors, but the green tea isn&#x27;t really noticeable</li>
            <li>I recently threw out all of my old make-up and decided to replace it with all natural products.  </li>
            <li>With the 24-hour lip color I use daily, I need to apply another layer of clear lip protection frequently.</li>
            <li>Makes your lips feel very soft and instant relief for chap lips.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t dry out my lips in between uses like pretty much every other lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and I use them daily for soft and moisturized lips!</li>
            <li>Perhaps not the Green Tea, but I dislike tea in general so that&#x27;s more of a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;Really does help repair damaged, cracky, peely lips and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>used to use a shea butter very thick lip balm that worked better than any other.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a natural product that is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I specially like the green tea and asian pear ones.</li>
            <li>A little bit more expensive than some of the more common ones, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>So generally one stick lasts me almost a year.</li>
            <li>So far I have tried the Asian Pear and the Acai/Goji Berry out of my 4 pack.  </li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend these to anyone looking for all natural lip balm.</li>
            <li>It made my lips soft instantly</li>
            <li>I have only tried the pear flavor one so far</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely just a personal preference,</li>
            <li>I am a lip balm junkie and only use natural formulas.</li>
            <li>but it ended up being much sweeter than I had expected.</li>
            <li>so I have only tried one so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried one of the favors so far.</li>
            <li>Only used the pear so far.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work to keep my lips moist and soft in the winter wind, but it smells delicious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using only natural lip balms without petrolatum or mineral oil.</li>
            <li>When it said 100% beeswax, I was worried that it would be sticky and very waxy (like several Burts bees products I&#x27;ve tried), but these were totally the opposite.</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm, don&#x27;t feel addicted to lip balm now</li>
            <li>the smells are not overwhelming or too sweet...</li>
            <li>The soothing pure beeswax has provided relief to my constant dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to find lip balm that doesn&#x27;t actually dry them out more</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands and Beauty by Earth is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>Lastly, this lip balm really does help repair your dry, cracked and peeling lips.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that if this gets even a teeny bit warm, it seems to melt easier than other lip balms that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m using the Green Tea flavor.</li>
            <li>I had tried Blixtex and EOS (a natural lip product) with little long term success.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have a minty flavor in addition to what ever other flavor it&#x27;s supposed to be, like Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>However, I still have to apply it all the time and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference than using any other lip balm...</li>
            <li>I live in the dry Arizona desert, so I have lip balm stashed everywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the Asian Pear so far.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tried two of the four flavors of lip balm - Asian Pear and Acai Berry.</li>
            <li>This is the only chapstick so far that has actually worked and kept working.</li>
            <li>I thought the green tea would taste much more like green tea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only bought lip balm one other time from a different brand but this right here actually works.</li>
            <li>Been using eos before I found that it doesn&#x27;t help with my chapped lips specially during this super cold winter weather.</li>
            <li>She was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the products and the fact that they are 100% natural and owned by a small, sustainable company.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other beeswax lip balms, but they didn&#x27;t last and felt very waxy.  </li>
            <li>The first few days of using it, my lips were peeling quite a bit.</li>
            <li>and I immediately used the green tea balm first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the first one I opened a few months ago.</li>
            <li>The first tube out of the box was green tea.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry place and have chapped lips almost all the time.</li>
            <li>Interesting, but the wax consistency was a little.. strange, on one of them, and another makes my lips tingle in an odd way that&#x27;s a bit of a concern.</li>
            <li>I also found that as you got farther down the tube, the balm would get a really grainy feel to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched and tried every lip balm out there for my youngest child who is plagued with dry lips and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The balm made my lips so soft and repaired my dry, peeling lips.  </li>
            <li>balms are miracle!!!&lt;br /&gt;So soft, when applied on the lip skin, last long, and i saw IMMEDIATE improvement within hour, if not minutes.</li>
            <li>I usually have all 3 at once due to over licking my lips so finding a good enough lip balm is usually a challenge.</li>
            <li>not sure if it was this, but sending it postage due isn&#x27;t really free, is it?</li>
            <li>It may feel a little bit greasy, but really keep your lip moisturized and help the cracked lips to heal.</li>
            <li>I thought I finally found my new permanent chapstick, but think I will probably give the other 3 sticks away.</li>
            <li>Smooth, creamy and gently scented without being overpowering or artificial.</li>

            <li> The scents or flavors (however :-) ) weren&#x27;t too overpowering which I loved</li>

            <li> Great product-- really feels good when putting it on.</li>
            <li> The flavors are very strong, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because of the thickness of this lip balm, which makes it very easy to over apply and look like you&#x27;re wearing lip gloss, which isn&#x27;t the look</li>
            <li> Its pretty good!</li>
            <li> It got here super quick and it feels awesome.</li>

            <li> - No horrible after taste    </li>
            <li> - I feel like I have to apply it more often.    </li>
            <li> but, I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>

            <li> All that is needed to say. :)</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Way better than the burt&#x27;s bee lip balm I&#x27;ve been using.</li>

            <li> Im glad I went with this set</li>
            <li> I will be back for more once they get lost in my couch or car.  :D</li>
            <li> This Chapstick is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> but so many don&#x27;t deliver on flavor or texture.</li>
            <li> This is better than chap stick that I always used.  </li>
            <li> I also really enjoyed the flavours and so did my boys.</li>
            <li> Having no daughters of my own, I really enjoy the chance to purchase &#x27;girly&#x27; things for my daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> Knowing both of them love lip balms, one of them laughingly declaring her addiction to them, I ran across these lip balms on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love chapstick or lip balm.</li>
            <li> The flavors are great and the feel is very silky.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this</li>
            <li> My kids love it too</li>
            <li> This is one of the top two lip products I have used.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t run out. :)</li>
            <li> I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees but this is even smoother.</li>
            <li> The different flavors smell and taste delicious!</li>
            <li> Immediately helped my chapped lips to feel better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> These exotic flavors smell (and taste)</li>
            <li> My favorite part of these lip balms is the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> Every lip balm I&#x27;ve tried always goes on ok but end up drying out my lips even more.</li>
            <li> Really glad I ordered this set of 4 Beauty by Earth LIP BALM.  </li>
            <li> Interesting fruity flavors.</li>
            <li> We love the flavors, the texture, the smoothness</li>

            <li> I love that these come in a 4 pack.  </li>
            <li> I love all the oils in it..</li>
            <li> Which means much more value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> most (compared to the flavored 4 pack)  </li>
            <li> Really is top quality, from the packaging to the product itself.</li>
            <li> This lip balm has an amazing taste, and goes on light and is not too waxy, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> okay, I&#x27;m a lip balm addict.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard  of the product, but I&#x27;m really glad that I took a chance and ordered.</li>

            <li> I think I would like the peppermint ones better.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re much better.</li>
            <li> Love this chapstick...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t just pick one favorite.</li>
            <li> These are lovely.</li>
            <li> The Asian pear is my favorite, but all flavors are great!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm</li>
            <li> ALL the ingredients are listed and are safe, NOT tested on animals etc.</li>
            <li> It is differently my favorite for now.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was prepared to LOVE this stuff, based on people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many many before- burt&#x27;s bees, kiehls lip balm # 1,</li>
            <li> GREAT quality all natural pretty packaging smells and tastes great love</li>
            <li> The lip balm works really well and the 4 pack includes a very nice selection of flavors.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and flavorful.</li>
            <li> The sweet flavor is nice and enjoyable, but I have to have self control not to lick it -</li>
            <li> These are high quality, smell and taste great and aren&#x27;t too waxy.  </li>
            <li> They go on super silky and do not cause my lips to peel as many lip balms can!  </li>
            <li> But the flavored 4 pack is still the same great formula, its fun for a change and its great for kids.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and awesome flavors!</li>
            <li> The pomegranate one has a sweet taste which is nice except that taste is in my mouth all day.</li>
            <li> I have a soy allergy and was glad to find a reasonable price, good tasting lip balm :)</li>
            <li> really nice sweet flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we both loved them the first time we tried it.</li>
            <li> The flavors are all pretty good.</li>
            <li> All natural is great, but the thing that makes this product especially nice is the different varieties of scents/flavors.  </li>
            <li> Like the smell, feels pretty good on lips.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s flavors are pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> My whole family is LOVING this lip balm!  </li>
            <li> Nice full sized lip balms.</li>

            <li> A nice, mild flavor.</li>
            <li> Nice mild flavors.</li>
            <li> Far superior to popular drugstore brands at a comparable price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear any kind of lip products b/c of the metals and so far so good without any allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li> Great natural lip balm!</li>
            <li> They all smell and taste great, and they keep your lips soft long-term!</li>
            <li> i love these lip balms - they taste great - they go on nicely and stay on a long time</li>
            <li> My husband and I split this - we are both very satisfied with not only the quality but the pleasant scent of each one.</li>
            <li> The flavors are all very true to their name.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these, I would say better than Burt&#x27;s since they stay moist longer on my lips.</li>
            <li> Great for the all natural lifestyle.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that it is made of natural ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t take much to make your lips feel great!  </li>
            <li> All natural, not sticky and great flavor assortment.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, tastes and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> it literally has no flavor and is light better than carmex</li>
            <li> This is great as a gift or if youjust want some all natural lip balm.</li>
            <li> The great part is it&#x27;s 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a sign of a great all natural product.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth texture on my lips.  </li>
            <li> I love that it goes on smooth and stays on without drying your lips out.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth these feel on your lips &amp;</li>
            <li> Great stuff, all natural and</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results thus far.  </li>
            <li> She loves natural products and I knew this would be a great choice.</li>
            <li> These moisturize my lips very well and they taste good.</li>
            <li> I love that they are clear and have a good flavor that is not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is good, feel like it really conditions my lips.  </li>
            <li> I have given 2 away and they loved them as much as I did.</li>
            <li> The other flavors are awesome.</li>
            <li> It is nauseatingly sweet!</li>
            <li> Flavors are unique, but as many lip balms as i have tried, I am still a lover of &amp;#34;Kiss</li>
            <li> They make my lips so soft, they taste great, leave a nice shine, and are apparently pretty organic.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and will continue to buy this over any other lip balm.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> Why the heck is it so sweet?!</li>
            <li> sweet and most important is that it keeps my lips most for hours.</li>
            <li> It also actually has a very pleasant taste slightly sweet and fruit-like.  </li>
            <li> Melts easy in the car as well</li>
            <li> The flavors if you will are very mild if you lick your lips</li>
            <li> I really did not think that I would find something I liked better than Labello.  </li>
            <li> The company is a pleasure to work with- as they were very quick to check in for feedback.</li>
            <li> This product is a great product for anyone that is careful about what they put on the family and their own body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a lipstick person, these work great with giving my lip stain just enough shine :)</li>
            <li> but I think they&#x27;re great and will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping,thank you guys:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AND best of all they use economical for the Earth recycled cardboard, not so fancy schmancy packaging (which YOU pay for) and which I totally support.</li>
            <li> It went on better the Chapstick and didn&#x27;t have to be applied as often as Vaseline; however, it didn&#x27;t make my lips as soft Vaseline and didn&#x27;t feel as good going and being on my lips.</li>
            <li> Scents aren&#x27;t too strong so I like it.  </li>
            <li> I like the balm itself, but the flavors are strong.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the flavors being too strong but they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but they were too strong flavor for me and caused alergy to my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have good lip balms in my purse, car, bedroom, etc and not have to worry about bringing the same one everywhere.</li>
            <li> I tried Beauty by Earth&#x27;s product because of the great reviews and consistent positive feedback.  </li>
            <li> The flavors smell delicious &amp; I feel safe letting my young daughters use this products because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> The flavors are pretty amazing, too.</li>
            <li> All the favors are sweet but not too sticky, feels more like balm than chapstick, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many through the years and finally discovered that some do more harm than good.  </li>
            <li> Awesome lip balm, my lips get super dry and chapped in the winter</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best beeswax lip balm I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Every girl, whether a young one, or us &#x27;older&#x27;  girls should treat themselves to these balms, they are awesome!!</li>
            <li> very good for dry lips.</li>
            <li> - Tastes fine</li>
            <li> I received this set for free and even though I prefer the peppermint lip balm much more, these were not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Gives your lips the slightest hint of shimmer, which is perfectly fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on really smooth, nice flavor, and feels very moist!</li>
            <li> Fine lip balm, divine aroma.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fine</li>
            <li> Also the packaging is super cute, it&#x27;s like the size of your hand.</li>
            <li> The peppermint does have a strong tingling sensation, which I quite enjoy in my lip balms, but others may find over powering.</li>
            <li> Pleasant flavor and scent, this clear colored lip balm goes on like a lip gloss, leaving you with shiny lips.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Feels waxy and wears off quickly but tastes yummy!</li>
            <li> All of those lip balms either don&#x27;t protect your lips, wear off to quickly, appear too glossy on the lips, and/or contain many chemicals.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, very soft and smooth on the lips.  </li>
            <li> It feels really nice on the lips, last long (I maybe need to apply it at most twice a day) and it smells DELICIOUS.</li>
            <li> I like this product, makes my lips very soft, the flavors are nice :)</li>
            <li> All natural formula smells great and has absolutely no unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> Which is something I&#x27;m quite happy to say since I&#x27;m really quite enjoying an all natural company!</li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but then again, do I want my purchase to support a small-family business or a huge mega-corporation</li>
            <li> They taste amazing and really make my lips feel moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> balm- what a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> The company sent me free samples of their peppermint.</li>
            <li> My lips really suffer this time of year, and will have these handy everywhere</li>
            <li> They are absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using them every day this winter.  </li>
            <li> They are smooth and not grainy.</li>
            <li> The chapstick applies smoothly and leaves lips feeling softer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself licking my lips constantly to enjoy them.  </li>
            <li> These glide on smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Every product in this package has such a great smell.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a great lip balm and have finally found one.  </li>
            <li> I think the products are great and purchased several others-Witch hazel, Arman Oil, Suntan lotion and sponges.  </li>
            <li> It does last quite a bit of time on my lips, which is great.</li>
            <li> They also go on smooth, there is no grainy texture that some lip balms have.</li>
            <li> We all enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Smooth application, not waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> (Even the green tea is wonderful!)</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The products are Cruelty Free, which is extremely important to me; no animals need to be tested on for a</li>
            <li> ever!&lt;br /&gt;Really smooth and sooooo yummy.</li>
            <li> I used to primarily use EOS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really smooth</li>
            <li> and it smells and taste fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I can not say enough great things about this lip balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally have a lip balm in every purse that works for me!</li>
            <li> Also, I never received the free sample promised for writing a review.</li>
            <li> Smooth, not waxy.</li>
            <li> And my sister stole the Asian Pair before I could try it, lol.</li>
            <li> What fantastic products.</li>
            <li> Great quality, but too sugary for my taste, which actually refrains me from using it!!</li>
            <li> The Beauty By Earth lip balm spreads on smoothly and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I was not paid or bribed to change my rating, nor was I given anything free.</li>
            <li> I am a green tea drinker but the flavor is something I was not expecting to be the best out of the 4.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy snuggling up to.)  </li>
            <li> And all the flavors are fabulous</li>
            <li> They go on so smooth</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> And they go on smoothly, and keep your lips moisturized.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I bought these at a reduced cost to use them and write my honest and unpaid review.</li>
            <li> I will be using this as a stocking stuffer or thoughtful gift in years to come.</li>
            <li> I like how this glides on silky smooth and is light.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave an after taste in your mouth and it does keep my lips looking fabulous.  </li>
            <li> but they are all fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I wear these over lip stains and they are pretty good about not disturbing the color.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery :) love the flavor and the way it feels on my lips.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li> These balms are better than the burts bee balms, so much richer and offer more moisture.</li>
            <li> I found something natural and good for me.</li>
            <li> So far I loved it -</li>
            <li> I give it 5 start for being natural, smells and taste good, and you can feel it moisturizing and heal your lips.</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent the price right in line with any of those junk commercial products and well....you will love them as much as we do.  </li>
            <li> Nothing helped, until I started using these wonderful balms :) Now my lips are back to their soft, smooth, and calm selves!</li>
            <li> They go on more smoothly than a lot of lip balms and have a delicious sweet taste if you happen to taste them (instead of that icky chap stick type of taste).  </li>
            <li> Creamy, long lasting, smells great, tastes great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using lip products as long as I can remember, and for a nice moisturization with nice scent/flavor, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> My new favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li> My new favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li> New favorite product!</li>
            <li> I have found a new favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li> Just wished it lasted longer, but otherwise it&#x27;s my new favorite chap stick!</li>
            <li> I love all of them very much.</li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> I am loving these ones so far!!</li>
            <li> Ordering was easy and I enjoyed the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The flavored are such a great surprise and are very pleasant but not overwhelming like some on the market.</li>
            <li> ;) about to buy more for my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I also love that the company is a small, family owned operation and the price was good too!</li>
            <li> it lasts long and tastes great on your lips.</li>
            <li> You can kiss her and enjoy a sweet flavor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands, this is definitely one of the best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I have finally found a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The flavors are unique rather than vanilla or strawberry.</li>
            <li> Chapstick goes on smooth and my lips feel nice and soft!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Will be back for more of these for sure!</li>
            <li> and I know fresh beeswax!  </li>
            <li> very pleased with the result, so far 😊</li>
            <li> The scent is heavenly, and the flavor is light and sweet without a trace of chemical flavoring (like I&#x27;ve noticed with the Eos lip balms).</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth the money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and made in the U.S.A!!!!</li>
            <li> If you want to enjoy the flavors more, don&#x27;t expect them to taste a certain way before trying.</li>
            <li> Better than Burt&#x27;s bees so far I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> own personal favorite is the Acai + Goji Berry.</li>
            <li> Super smooth application not waxy or glossy.  </li>
            <li> Clean ingredients.</li>
            <li> It goes on super smooth, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Awesomely natural, soothing, great flavors, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> A few days ago he commented how nice that stick was and loved the taste too&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So far I love them!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm for about two weeks now and so far, I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love the natural ingredients - I have made my own lip balms and am willing to pay for these.</li>
            <li> So far I love these chapsticks!  </li>
            <li> The flavors are amazing and super unique, my favorite is the Asian Pear.  </li>
            <li> They leave your lips soft and smooth , look no further for a great lip balm here it is ,This product comes in 4 exotic flavors .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scents are amazing and smooth and really go on easy and last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Would certainly buy more.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see what makes them special.</li>
            <li> Beauty by Earth has got it right!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve got 4 years of chapstick right here!</li>
            <li> It is very effective to my dry and sore lips...</li>
            <li> These feel fabulous on my lips and the flavors are subtle but delicious smelling.  </li>
            <li> All natural, high quality, smells and tastes great.</li>
            <li> My whole family tried these, and we love them.</li>
            <li> &gt; My only issue with these is that since the flavor is good, I have to fight not to lick my lips, which would defeat the purpose of applying it.</li>
            <li> and boy I am just thrilled so far.</li>
            <li> I really avoided using most chapsticks or lip balms because they have a chemical taste and sticky feel.</li>
            <li> is a true bonus.</li>
            <li> so far its kept my lips nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I tried 4 different scents but all of them smells good.  </li>
            <li> However its way to sweet.</li>
            <li> To me, the flavoring across the line was sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> Did not find to be too sweet like some others have said</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like anything sweet</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; don&#x27;t really have too potent of a smell/flavor.</li>
            <li> Lips feel moisturized and the sweet taste helps too.</li>
            <li> Hours after you use it you&#x27;ll still have a subtly sweet taste on your lips</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these lip balm and loved it.</li>
            <li> Most fragrances and textures really bother him and no lip balm nor ointment has helped, until now.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, a touch sweet.</li>
            <li> I feel very prepared for a chapped lip free winter!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much</li>
            <li> Not too sweet as others have said.</li>
            <li> My whole family (including my 2 kids) love the balms and use them.</li>
            <li> Too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too sweet</li>
            <li> it is sweet - you can taste it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much if I put it on both my top and bottom lip</li>
            <li> They smell really good and that should&#x27;ve been enough.</li>
            <li> Too sweet, and greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and she loves them, for their sweet fragrances, and for their moisturizing property.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and love the packaging as well as the scents for each.  </li>
            <li> I love these lip balms because they are not only natural, but they feel great on my lips.  </li>
            <li> my lips are still nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased and loved the peppermint variety, but wanted to try some different flavors since I have people in my life that can&#x27;t handle mint (I know)</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t like sweet chapstick then maybe it isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> The bf thought they were too sweet</li>
            <li> It tastes sweet also.</li>
            <li> Nice to know it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like the cherry one, too sweet.</li>
            <li> , my lips are definitely nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and she loves them so much that we&#x27;ve purchased more.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the sweet taste that sometimes winds up in your mouth.</li>
            <li> lips are definitely better than before thanks</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be too sweet.</li>
            <li> : They&#x27;re a tad sweet for my taste</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and truly moisturizes and is absorbed instead of just being waxy.  </li>
            <li> Too sweet.</li>
            <li> It is not too greasy, not too waxy, it tastes good when you do taste it, it stays on for the required number of hours before necessary reapplication.</li>
            <li> There are (much) cheaper and (much) better ones out there.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and there is a gentle sweet taste too.</li>
            <li> The old bat says the Asian pear goes on smooth and tastes good as well!</li>
            <li> love it,  BBE products are my favorite and these lip balms work so much better than any other that of tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best of all, no more chapped lips!</li>
            <li> The Asian pear is my favorite, glides on very smooth and lasts with no waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> They are packaged nicely (would make a nice gift) and the ingredients are not only all natural, but are also free of soy (which one of my daughters is allergic to).</li>
            <li> These are very nice product, i love them,they smells amazing, especially the Asian pear :), definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> great product,  most satisfying purchase i have made in a long, long time!</li>
            <li> Every flavor tastes subtle yet wonderful</li>
            <li> This came quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my lip super moisturized.</li>
            <li> 2 days after buying I had to come back and make sure I got more to pass out to friends.</li>
            <li> and I quickly became adjusted.</li>
            <li> You just have to keep applying every now and then as it dries out quickly.</li>
            <li> flavors are awesome and they do last so you are not constantly re-applying.  </li>
            <li> Also, they came quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> So many companies say they are natural and free of toxins</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky, as you can imagine...</li>
            <li> so they get used up quickly, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything like that with this product.</li>
            <li> I am super picky about my lip balms.</li>
            <li> I wish they lasted a bit longer on the lips, but they do have relatively adequate staying power.</li>
            <li> Also seems like the balm wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick, nothing was damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was shipped quick.</li>
            <li> The unique fruit flavors are a treat: subtle but very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth consistency and love the natural ingredients, but this line--up of flavors way too sweet and not to my personal taste.</li>
            <li> My lips feel pretty fabulous now after using this for a day.</li>
            <li> These balms are silky smooth and come in some amazing flavors (green tea is my favorite).</li>
            <li> but I do enjoy the diverse flavors, I would be interested in trying to minty version of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I do find myself having to apply this chapstick very often compared to Burt&#x27;s Bees to get the same coverage, the taste is also a bit overwhelming and gets kind of stuck in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using the Green Tea variety, and it&#x27;s the absolute best one in the pack.</li>
            <li> is my new favorite lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is now my new lip balm for sure.  </li>
            <li> It is defiantly one of my new favorite lip balms.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m in good moist lips throughout the dry winter here.</li>
            <li> I wish somewhere in its description it would say something to that effect, but alas here I am stuck with a set of four wonderfully fragrant but candy sweet lip balms.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack of 4 flavors several months ago and LOVED the lip balms so much!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for moisturizing my dry lips</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very sensitive skin, most lip balms irritate and cause cracking on the sides of her lips.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li> I love the way the lip balm feels on my lips and love how long it lasts!</li>
            <li> Thanks Beauty by Earth!!</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that I am using natural products!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying a lot more of these!</li>
            <li> i am very dissapointed with this purchase !!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> This is the first lip balm with no weird tastes &amp; strong smells.</li>
            <li> I liked all the positive reviews for the Beauty by Earth and the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for less chemical-y, cruelty-free, more natural lip balm when I stumbled upon this great product.  </li>
            <li> My lips feel soft but not greasy, there&#x27;s no weird &amp;#34;aftertaste&amp;#34; like some other lip balms I&#x27;ve used, and the flavors/scents are delicious.  </li>
            <li> After suffering through an unusually dry winter, and buying nearly every kind of &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; lip balm at the drug store, I decided to look for something all natural and hopefully more effective.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and glides on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Smells great but also not too heavy</li>
            <li> Not only does it taste amazing</li>

            <li> The smell of green tea is so great, and i am just can&#x27;t stop using it every morning.</li>
            <li> These balms go on smooth, since they contain beeswax, and are very comforting.  </li>

            <li> I love the fact that its natural .</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Many lip balms that are made with natural ingredients just don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> So far this is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> love the mix of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> They are made of more natural ingredients, and produced without testing on animals.  </li>
            <li> recommend the product based on the feedback, and I was pleased with with dealing direct with the company.  </li>
            <li> Usually lip balms are too sweet or soft or waxy, but these feel perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and a family owned business.</li>
            <li> worked like a charm more natural than burts bees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the Beauty By Earth product for a couple of weeks, but I&#x27;m really happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try something more natural</li>
            <li> So far, I love them.  </li>
            <li> I also like it is made from natural stuff and feel safe to use them on my kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the grape and acai berry flavor so far and it feels great.</li>
            <li> I purchased these Beauty By Earth lip balms, wow, better than any I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural, healthy products to use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This feels Natural and love it.</li>
            <li> I love natural products.</li>
            <li> I love the scents and that they are made from all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> The flavors are pretty sweet though.</li>
            <li> I use Nivea and E.O.S and this is by far my favorite lip balm out there.</li>
            <li> is a bit smaller than what i expected, but nonetheless great!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural as well</li>
            <li> I love this natural lip balm.</li>
            <li> so worth the money.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this multipack more than the peppermint (personal flavor preference).</li>
            <li> They have the same qualities as the original product which make up a great lip balm with the added benefit of various flavors.</li>
            <li> My first priority is natural and safe ingredients, so I am thrilled to have found these flavorful lip balms that have been made so consciously and responsibly.</li>
            <li> Still tasty, and they still feel awesome on the lips, but I liked the old formula better. :(</li>
            <li> The green tea has a nice light scent and isn&#x27;t too sweet.</li>
            <li> Other than that, all&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Got the product right away</li>
            <li> Bought it for like $10, which felt about right for a fancy box of lip balm.</li>
            <li> Reviews are right on.</li>
            <li> and I must say everyone was right.  </li>
            <li> The reviews are so right.</li>
            <li> and I tried it out right away.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something more natural to try and this really did the trick!</li>
            <li> The different flavors all smell good (not too strong, just enough).</li>
            <li> Most natural chap sticks don&#x27;t have much flavor, but these do!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product as it is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make my lips more chapped and given my skin is super sensitive and I&#x27;ll get an allergic reaction to pretty much anything</li>
            <li> found this product left my lips feeling soft and supple, the different flavors are awesome .This</li>
            <li> Product feels smooth on my lips, and I feel good supporting the small business that manufactures it...</li>
            <li> It actually helped my lips get better, and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have much on my lips making it feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like the exotic fruit, the subtle flavors are very appealing.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding things like this that make my lips even just feel good and smooth, and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am a huge addict of lip balm and I am always up to trying new ones.</li>
            <li> The green tea is actually the best smelling one in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the scents I tried but found the green tea overwhelming when it was on ...</li>
            <li> This package was awesome as it gives you a variety and should keep me stocked for the next few months.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, not waxy at all, natural, not over powering with the sent/taste, reasonably priced, overall fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I was excited as it was largely organic and reasonably priced at Costco.</li>
            <li> I live in a super dry area, all dirt and sage brush, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good lip balm because no matter how much water I drink my lips get chapped.</li>
            <li> BBE lip balms are very, very moisturizing but not in a greasy or waxy way.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was also very reasonable and timely.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle and has not caused any problems for her, in fact it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable as well.  </li>
            <li> The closest I&#x27;ve gotten to try either of those two flavors is that old quick kiss as he walks out the door!  </li>
            <li> But this lip balm is honestly better than any of the less natural variety I use to own.  </li>
            <li> My lips were dry since I use the lipsticks very often,and my lips getting much softer and has good moisture status now.</li>
            <li> loved that first pack so much, I bought a new pack recently.</li>
            <li> Beauty by earth lip balm is very easy to use on the contrary and it keeps lips moisturized for quite long time.</li>
            <li> I sent it as little gifts for my families overseas, they loved it.</li>
            <li> I choose to open the green tea flavor first to save the best for last, but it has such a pleasant smell and taste ( my husband even like it) that I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest.</li>
            <li> but I find that they keep my lips moisturized enough that my natural lip color looks just fine without the added tint:)</li>
            <li> The flavors are really interesting and different</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more once my supply runs out.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and my lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Really helps chapped lips!</li>
            <li> Upon first application the ChapStick glides effortlessly and adheres to your lips.</li>
            <li> I love that they only use 100% organic products in there lip moisturizer!</li>
            <li> They taste great, last long, and don&#x27;t have any sticky/waxyness to them.</li>
            <li> Be careful and don&#x27;t let them get too warm, though they melt a bit easier than others.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and soft, not sticky.  </li>
            <li> love this product, I would definitely buy from Beauty by earth again...</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and leaves my lips feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying more products from Beauty by Earth in the future!</li>
            <li> smooth, creamy and such sweet taste.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but so far I really do enjoy it.</li>
            <li> love that it is in a pack of 4 and that they are all different flavors.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t heavy and best of all doesn&#x27;t have to be applied but a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> Use it sooo much!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this again and will look into more of their selections.</li>
            <li> Our family really like this lip balm!</li>
            <li> I have been using many different kinds of lip balm for ages.</li>
            <li> That said, the flavors are very tasty and not artificial tasting - probably too tasty.  </li>
            <li> The package is pretty convenient as I have one at home, at the office, in my gym bag and purse.</li>
            <li> The flavors are yummy and its so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first lip balm that works for my whole family!  </li>
            <li> it really hydrates my lips!</li>
            <li> I love the different flavors.  </li>
            <li> Love all of the different flavors !!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more for myself.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of them in the future.</li>
            <li> I wish the packaging was a bit larger and more decorated.</li>
            <li> Probably my all time favorite lip balm, and I&#x27;m a total chapstick junkie!</li>
            <li> It feels really soft and smooth going on, I like the scents/flavors</li>
            <li> definitely be purchasing from Beauty by Earth again :)</li>
            <li> Love the asian pear.</li>
            <li> Also she really loves the variety of flavors!</li>
            <li> Their lips have been so chapped, and this helped after the first day of using it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I just love them!I tryed the minty ones from the same company</li>
            <li> Just tried Beauty Earth Lip Balm for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy more and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different brands and have not found one that works as well as these do!  </li>
            <li> Once I run out of my four tubes, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product line.  </li>
            <li> If you have pretty damaged lips you will like this lip balm.</li>
            <li> but I do like it better than the traditional &amp;#34;chap-stick&amp;#34; type lip balm.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase and will continue buying when I run out in the future.</li>
            <li> And shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li> Yeaay!;-)</li>
            <li> Even within that category I have only found 2 that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly and make my lips feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I used this lip balm today and it went on soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> We love the asian pear flavor.  </li>
            <li> Also love the different flavors in the 4 pack.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried these it felt as if it had no flavor.</li>
            <li> and I actually like it a bit more.</li>
            <li> From the fruity ones that smell good to the medicated, heavy duty balms...they all do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased many brands from Fresh, Tarte, Bareminerals, etc and this by far my favorite hands down.</li>
            <li> But I can live with that to have a nice lip balm that I only have to apply 3 or 4 times a day rather than 20 times.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that these lip balms make my lips very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Tastes good but not long lasting</li>
            <li> I loved this so much in the first few days, I ordered another set</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm because of its unique flavors and it was a 100 % natural beeswax.</li>
            <li> I bought this lip balm after long research &amp; it&#x27;s really turned out to be verrrry good &amp; natural....</li>
            <li> The net result is my friend got both sets of flavor and that was all a huge success.  </li>
            <li> They melt pretty easily, so when I carry one around in my purse, I find the texture much more oily than usual.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is all natural and much prefer it over some other popular all natural brands sold in stores all over the place!</li>
            <li> so much I bought several more variety packs for stocking stuffers for my daughters for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this lip balm and so do I, the green tea lip balm for me though had little pieces sticking to my lip but besides that the other ones are great and smell really good!</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable and appreciated for something you like, that works.</li>
            <li> It feels really smooth and lasts for a super long time throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I went by all the positive reviews and purchased this</li>
            <li> The lip balms feel great, smell great, don&#x27;t leave weird residue on cups (or people), and protect from the harsh winter winds.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and how long it lasts once I put it on.</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly and I love how long it lasts on the lips.  </li>
            <li> As a &amp;#34;lip balm junkie&amp;#34; I have tried pretty much all that is out there.  </li>
            <li> The flavors now are so light, you can barely tell they&#x27;re flavored at all.  </li>
            <li> I love the silky consistency and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much any lip balm I could find and couldn&#x27;t get relief.  </li>
            <li> The company really seems to care about their product and this is evident in the packaging and quality of ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product is very good quality and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The just plain peppermint flavor is perfect but these other flavors are just too shiny.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about what I put on my lips.</li>
            <li> Super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, but it&#x27;s the flavors that really puts it over the top.</li>
            <li> The only thing with this product is that the taste is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Not too strong but enough scent</li>
            <li> They taste a little sweet, just in case you happen to :) But moisturize my lips very well.</li>
            <li> when I used to be able to just swipe quickly), and the flavors changed a little.</li>
            <li> Plus, with the pure, non-petroleum ingredients, this lip balm can be used with 100% confidence.</li>
            <li> Ive tried all but the green tea flavor and love them all!</li>
            <li> Green tea is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I just got this product a few days ago and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> sounded new, different, interesting.  </li>
            <li> If I had any complaint, the flavors are a bit strong for my liking, I prefer a more neutral lip balm.  </li>
            <li> The green tea lip balm is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> We definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a love for natural beauty products!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use more natural products and have found that many don&#x27;t have the right texture, or the flavors are no good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very smooth and they make my lips so soft, plus they&#x27;re definitely long-lasting!</li>
            <li> This ChapStick is immediately self evident that it is of a high quality.</li>
            <li> (the green tea is maybe a little sweeter than I&#x27;d expect, but it&#x27;s still delicious).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a major chap stick user and am really picky about them and have been looking for a good all natural one for a long time.</li>
            <li> This Beauty by Nature lip balm smoothly glides on your lips, leaving the gentle feeling of a luxioursly deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Within just two days I noticed a huge difference in our lips especially my son&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lip balm!  </li>
            <li> I also feel they are reasonably priced for the quantity and quality of lip balm you are getting.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a lip balm that I can basically eat, since I wear so much of it.</li>
            <li> To me Baby Lips is creamy but it doesn&#x27;t feel like my lips are absorbing anything.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the creamy texture and how it feels on my lips.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to reapply very often either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like Beauty by Earth&#x27;s set of lip balm.  </li>
            <li> They feel silky smooth going on and last for a while.</li>
            <li> she really likes the flavors of these products.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.  </li>
            <li> These seem to really moisturize and are not too sticky or too shiny.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> but nothing really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I liked these so much that I added on a set to the present I sent my sister for her birthday last week.</li>
            <li> model.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it.  </li>
            <li> This may change as the winter comes, but I imagine, I won&#x27;t need to use that much then</li>
            <li> cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it really messed up my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much prefer flavorless for this reason.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very moisturizing</li>
            <li> This product really helps my chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li> Keep an open mind and enjoy the flavors for what they are.</li>
            <li> She said really likes Acai &amp; Goji Berry and shared one of the remaining three with her friend.  </li>
            <li> This lip balm stays on and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I just got my order (faster than promised) and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and it really seems to soften and condition my lips.  </li>
            <li> It really is smoother than EOS and I find that I don&#x27;t have to apply it as much.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both want natural products made with fresh ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Dont really like the acai berry.</li>
            <li> It really stays on your mouth, to the point that I&#x27;ll put it on in the morning</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They moisten and comfort your lips very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and smooth!,&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I got my shipment fast and with ease.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to lip balm lovers!</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the fact that they are also organic with no harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be purchasing it again.  </li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li> They go on smooth and they last.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I am really picky with chapstick.</li>
            <li> Soften my lips very well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll include all the bullet points, just not as much</li>
            <li> have to apply too much.</li>
            <li> im going for as a straight male.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> The balm works really well</li>
            <li> This really helps the dryness.</li>
            <li> I really really like this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this company and their products.  </li>
            <li> They glide on smooth and last!  </li>
            <li> I really like these balms and would recommend them.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works well.</li>
            <li> I also really like the flavors.</li>
            <li> I really like these lip balms.</li>
            <li> I find that Burts Bees is much too waxy anyway.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I will absolutely purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> We needed something natural for medical reasons &amp; love the texture, smell, and quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural I have been looking for something like this for a while and finally found it</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s cheaper than any other natural lip balms you get in-store but better!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dry or taste funny or don&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> These are just as good, especially if you live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> My favorite flavors are the Asian Pear and the Green Tea - so unique!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and stay for a long hours.</li>
            <li> I was particularly excited about the multi-pack as it gave me a chance to try out all of the different flavor options.</li>
            <li> It works even better than that other stuff.</li>
            <li> With many other brands my lips would literally burn the moment I applied it.</li>
            <li> In the past I had used some brands that had to be applied constantly as they would wear off and require more and more applications.</li>
            <li> Not only does this balm do its job, but they &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; great and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered 2 more sets and am planning to order the argan oil  along some other products I eyed that are made by this company.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I tried the peppermint lip balms from this company and had to try the other flavors because of how much I love this brand.</li>
            <li> This product works much better than Chap Stick and other lip balms I have tried.</li>
            <li> , they were much more affordable than some of the other organic balms on the Am.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm with very subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> They are very smooth and creamy, i prefer this over my other lip balms!</li>
            <li> All natural, which my lips very much appreciate.</li>
            <li> I love how it lasts longer than other lip balms I have tried and enjoy the diverse flavors, especially the green tea, and plan to buy more for my family to try.</li>
            <li> Since they are all natural there is no alcohol in in to dry out my lips like most flavored types do.  </li>
            <li> If the amazing all natural lasting hydration wasn&#x27;t enough, the fragrances are truly a mini getaway!</li>
            <li> It not only made my chapped lips smooth and soft, it lasts all day!  </li>
            <li> It is the only lip balm that I&#x27;ve tried that really satisfies my sensitive skin and and leaves my lips feeling silky smooth for hours.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm goes on smoothly and the moisture stayed on my lips for a long time.</li>
            <li> All natural really does seem to make a difference!</li>
            <li> When I first used it, i was thrown off at how soft it was - almost like it was partically melted.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list is short and sweet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to certain ingredients</li>
            <li> Add a little sheen to them as well, not too much though :)</li>
            <li> This may be my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lip balm!</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a normal to somewhat intense lip repair compound.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and the moisture lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry lips &amp; have tried every Chapstick available.</li>
            <li> I love the slight gritiness that melts away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used to the green tea and it feels and tastes good.</li>
            <li> I may have been guilty of licking it off once or twice, but without interference, they&#x27;re great, haha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement for my beloved Rachel Perry Lip Lover lip balms since they went out of business a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve finally found the one!</li>
            <li> I started using Asian pear one, and as another review said, I love the smell and a little sweet flavor of</li>
            <li> So far, the response has been positive.</li>
            <li> They can be better if they&#x27;re not sweet.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants baby soft lips!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this lip balm to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just know that Beauty by Earth has high quality lip balm.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these ones...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered several lip balms recently looking for something new and better than what I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> I only needed to reapply after 4 hours which is amazing compared to other lip balms</li>
            <li> I love that they are all natural and they stay on your lips for quite a bit longer than other balms I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But this has a creamy texture (a little more creamier than Eos) and feels hydrating.</li>
            <li> so I am never without soft lips!!</li>
            <li> my lips are actually starting to heal for the first time in months!</li>
            <li> My lips have never felt better, and I have every intention of buying them again, for myself and for friends, as little gifts.  </li>
            <li> This is made with very safe ingredients, doesn&#x27;t taste nasty or like chemicals, moisturizes VERY well, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I really like these all natural lip balms but the smell and taste</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly over my lips and is not granular or rough.</li>
            <li> it really feels natural.</li>
            <li> It was great orginally, but then they all turned grainy and started having clumps of some weird textured stuff on my lips.</li>
            <li> I have another 100% natural product that I really like.  </li>
            <li> The green tea is my favorite</li>
            <li> I normally have a problem with chapped lips.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is worth every penny, especially for someone who has severe dry/chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I love the green tea scent and flavor.</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed and my lips were completely soft and crack free by morning, I wear it at work and it stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> used Burts Beeswax for a long time, but this is so much better, and for the same price!</li>
            <li> It has a lovely green tea + honeysuckle aroma.</li>
            <li> I am thinking about to buy a few sets as Christmas gift:)</li>
            <li> Go on soft and smooth and hydrate my lips for a long time.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the green tea</li>
            <li> I tried normal chap sticks</li>
            <li> My favorite flavor is green tea.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this lip balm a lot, however I feel it is not as long lasting as others are.</li>
            <li> They all has unique flavors and at same time it&#x27;s light not heavy as other lip balms out there.</li>
            <li> They are a must-have for any lip balm fanatic (I am pretty picky with my lip balms and have a habit of trying new ones almost all the time because of not being completely satisfied).</li>
            <li> These are a new staple as far as I&#x27;m concerned!!</li>
            <li> My lips actually feel plumper wearing this amazing balm with just a slight bit of shine.</li>
            <li> My standard Chapstick just felt okay, and didn&#x27;t seem to address winter dry lips</li>
            <li> I tried many different products but still end up having extremely dry and peeling lips all the time.</li>
            <li> This Lip Balm not only smells good, smoothens my lips, it also last longer than any other chap sticks/ products I used.</li>
            <li> tried the Asian pear flavor right after I received the package.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless lip balms, I have very sensitive skin and most leave my lips feeling dry and cracked again within a day.  </li>
            <li> My first time using a lip balm with beeswax as its major ingredient and no allergic reactions so far.</li>
            <li> Finally found the right product for my sensitive lips!.</li>
            <li> lips are nice and moist all day long without drying out completely and knowing that all the ingredients are natural, non-toxic and non-GMO, I feel god to keep putting it on for this dry season.  </li>
            <li> and I live in Chicago</li>
            <li> Looking forward to BBE&#x27;s expansion of new products.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to.</li>
            <li> His new Beauty By Earth</li>
            <li> , ever since I&#x27;ve tried those, they are definitely my new</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and like to try all new kinds.</li>
            <li> so I turned to Amazon for something new.</li>
            <li> Each one is different from the other but with the same exceptional quality.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> This seems to last a lot longer and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and covers my lips with a nice layer.  </li>
            <li> This went on a lit smoother than the EOS brand when I had really chapped lips and totally helped them heal up fast.</li>
            <li> I used Burts &amp; Bees before this and it would wear off quite quick and would end up having to use it around 3+ times a day because my lips would eventually become unbearably dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent my money on these instead of the regular Chap Stick from Target.</li>
            <li> My lips feel very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> My lips are very sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent to much money trying to find the right balm</li>
            <li> Made my lips soft and smooth so fast I didn&#x27;t have enough time to say goodbye to my dry lips.</li>
            <li> This means a great deal to me since the only other lip product I have been able to use is petroleum jelly (not easy to carry around and is messy to apply with your finger).</li>
            <li> The actual balm is smooth feeling, not heavy, an  it doesn&#x27;t burn on chapped lips like some similar products.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who uses lip balm and is looking for a natural alternative!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm, I just received the box within the past week.  </li>
            <li> Usually, lip balms make my lip more chapped.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Overall, the lip balm is not that greasy and it is better than other brands i have tried.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural and this is it!</li>
            <li> I am an avid runner and I will definitely be putting some of this on before each run to protect my lips</li>
            <li> The product is such good quality the green tea actually tasted like tea on my lips</li>
            <li> why but for year I only drink a few sips of water during the day and mostly get little more water from soups.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Why the heck would green tea taste sweet?!</li>
            <li> This is a very clean product with a flavor lasts longer than other commercial lip balms.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, it&#x27;s not sticky or gross, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The lip balms are so smooth and buttery, and they last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use lip balms or chopsticks consistently because they would always make my lips get worse than it was before I used those products.</li>
            <li> They taste sweet, but not a good sweet.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone with big lips that wants to keep them naturally hydrated.</li>
            <li> Smooth, long lasting and beautifully natural.</li>
            <li> I use lip balm every day throughout the year and this is the best probably because of the coconut base which is very lush and moist.  </li>
            <li> balm not only tastes great, it feels like silk and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling dry a little while later.</li>
            <li> Her lips will be well protected from the harsh cold of Chicago winds and snow as she goes back and forth for school:) I have order heading my way - I live in Florida where its just as useful to protect the most exposed part of the body - lips!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sweet, but I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually suffered burning lips and irritated throat from using certain of those lip balms.</li>
            <li> I tried calling the company directly as I just missed the cutoff for a Saturday delivery by the time I realized my mistake--they were unable to help with my problem (my fault!), but we&#x27;re very attentive and easy to communicate with.  </li>
            <li> The flavors are hardly noticeable but that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li> I feel super wasteful because I have a lot of other lip balms that I won&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> Due to extremely dry lips I have to apply more often than I wish.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be any different but was really hoping to be surprised</li>
            <li> So, if you are a fan of the old intense flavors, do yourself a favor and find a different product!</li>
            <li> I gave the others (acai/goji berry and grapefruit/lime) to my nine-year old.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no heavy or sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> They make my lips kissable soft and smell yummy.</li>
            <li> We were looking for lip balm with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is the smoothest natural lip balm&lt;</li>
            <li> The effect of its natural materials are clear on usage.</li>
            <li> so I am and using this lip balm but also using my old one.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:  - Organic  - Natural Non-toxic Ingredients  </li>
            <li> I have always used &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34; but have been looking to change to something that was natural with no junk in it.</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> After only 4 applications I noticed how my lips are so much softer.  </li>
            <li> it was it had to be applied frequently and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have to be applied nearly as often as Vaseline and it makes my lips soft.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because my lips feel so silky soft with the lip balm that I don&#x27;t want that feeling to end.  </li>
            <li> The coverage lasts and my lips stay soft &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li> it was almost like a pack of wild berry skittles.</li>
            <li> Maybe they make this out of 100% natural regurgitated pears.</li>
            <li> After having severe chapped lip issues since August, I was looking for a natural product that might help.  </li>
            <li> Also your lips are soft while it is on.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old grandson likes to try all the varieties.</li>
            <li> I am a complete lip balm</li>
            <li> I bought this pack because I was looking for a lip balm with natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend these to a friend and will very likely purchase again!</li>
            <li> My lips are so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> All natural product.</li>
            <li> They also make my lips soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> When I use it before I go to bed, my lips are still soft and moisturized in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I like its smell, but I feel my lips are thick.it is natural anyway.</li>
            <li> They do their job very well, but you do have to constantly reapply.</li>
            <li> You can tell from the feel of them that they are made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give this product a try as it was natural.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm because I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li> Natural tasting, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> natural.</li>
            <li> View my last &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34;, I stated you dont have to apply much.</li>
            <li> My lips have never seemed so soft.</li>
            <li> It beats everything else I&#x27;ve tried by far.</li>
            <li> I get very chapped lips all the time, this works just like your basic chap stick.</li>
            <li> It was quite the surprise to find it tasting much like Asian Pear.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients--important because you are probably ingesting at least some of it.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of the green tea and Asian pear, they taste like nothing else that I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li> The green tea and asian pear are my favorite flavors.  </li>
            <li> The photos make the balm container appear bigger than normal, but they are normal size lip balms, so no issue carrying them around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant, but it is a bit of a foreign feeling upon application.</li>
            <li> but if I did happen to taste it it wasn&#x27;t bitter like most other balms.</li>
            <li> The subtle hint of Asian Pear or Grapefruit and Pomegranate flavors are also good enough to eat without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> They have a light flavor, nothing is too overpowering, even though the flavors are a little different than normal.</li>
            <li> I always want to apply more to keep my lips feeling soft and tasting sweet, unlike most other flavored lip products that I hate having to wear.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and subtle flavor.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle yet tasty flavors contained in the Beauty By Earth four-pack.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle scent and the way it makes my lips feel.  </li>
            <li> The green tea was just strange, and I actually love tea.</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of the original product and decided to tryout the other flavors.  </li>
            <li> , it is 100% natural and pure beeswax lip care with aloe vera &amp; vitamin E to condition and to repair dry</li>
            <li> (In part because I have a sweet little newborn baby</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> This Beauty by Earth lip balm, although good, feels a bit wet on my lips and doesn&#x27;t last half as long as Carmex does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why this was the case, but I decided to try something petroleum free.</li>
            <li> Stays on a long time and you don&#x27;t need much when you apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great being able to switch things up whenever you want, since it gets boring using the same one all the time.  </li>
            <li> If the review is a bit long you can skip straight to the conclusion</li>
            <li> The only thing I did seem to notice is that the Asian pear flavor does have a little bit of a grainy texture, as compared to the other 3 flavors, which are super smooth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a new romantic friendship.  </li>
            <li> Really keeps my dry lips moisturized.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care flavors, but the green tea isn&#x27;t really noticeable</li>
            <li> I recently threw out all of my old make-up and decided to replace it with all natural products.  </li>
            <li> With the 24-hour lip color I use daily, I need to apply another layer of clear lip protection frequently.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips feel very soft and instant relief for chap lips.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t dry out my lips in between uses like pretty much every other lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and I use them daily for soft and moisturized lips!</li>
            <li> Perhaps not the Green Tea, but I dislike tea in general so that&#x27;s more of a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;Really does help repair damaged, cracky, peely lips and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> used to use a shea butter very thick lip balm that worked better than any other.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a natural product that is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I specially like the green tea and asian pear ones.</li>
            <li> A little bit more expensive than some of the more common ones, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> So generally one stick lasts me almost a year.</li>
            <li> So far I have tried the Asian Pear and the Acai/Goji Berry out of my 4 pack.  </li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend these to anyone looking for all natural lip balm.</li>
            <li> It made my lips soft instantly</li>
            <li> I have only tried the pear flavor one so far</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely just a personal preference,</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm junkie and only use natural formulas.</li>
            <li> but it ended up being much sweeter than I had expected.</li>
            <li> so I have only tried one so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one of the favors so far.</li>
            <li> Only used the pear so far.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work to keep my lips moist and soft in the winter wind, but it smells delicious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using only natural lip balms without petrolatum or mineral oil.</li>
            <li> When it said 100% beeswax, I was worried that it would be sticky and very waxy (like several Burts bees products I&#x27;ve tried), but these were totally the opposite.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm, don&#x27;t feel addicted to lip balm now</li>
            <li> the smells are not overwhelming or too sweet...</li>
            <li> The soothing pure beeswax has provided relief to my constant dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find lip balm that doesn&#x27;t actually dry them out more</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands and Beauty by Earth is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> Lastly, this lip balm really does help repair your dry, cracked and peeling lips.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if this gets even a teeny bit warm, it seems to melt easier than other lip balms that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m using the Green Tea flavor.</li>
            <li> I had tried Blixtex and EOS (a natural lip product) with little long term success.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have a minty flavor in addition to what ever other flavor it&#x27;s supposed to be, like Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> However, I still have to apply it all the time and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference than using any other lip balm...</li>
            <li> I live in the dry Arizona desert, so I have lip balm stashed everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the Asian Pear so far.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried two of the four flavors of lip balm - Asian Pear and Acai Berry.</li>
            <li> This is the only chapstick so far that has actually worked and kept working.</li>
            <li> I thought the green tea would taste much more like green tea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought lip balm one other time from a different brand but this right here actually works.</li>
            <li> Been using eos before I found that it doesn&#x27;t help with my chapped lips specially during this super cold winter weather.</li>
            <li> She was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the products and the fact that they are 100% natural and owned by a small, sustainable company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other beeswax lip balms, but they didn&#x27;t last and felt very waxy.  </li>
            <li> The first few days of using it, my lips were peeling quite a bit.</li>
            <li> and I immediately used the green tea balm first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the first one I opened a few months ago.</li>
            <li> The first tube out of the box was green tea.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry place and have chapped lips almost all the time.</li>
            <li> Interesting, but the wax consistency was a little.. strange, on one of them, and another makes my lips tingle in an odd way that&#x27;s a bit of a concern.</li>
            <li> I also found that as you got farther down the tube, the balm would get a really grainy feel to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched and tried every lip balm out there for my youngest child who is plagued with dry lips and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The balm made my lips so soft and repaired my dry, peeling lips.  </li>
            <li> balms are miracle!!!&lt;br /&gt;So soft, when applied on the lip skin, last long, and i saw IMMEDIATE improvement within hour, if not minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually have all 3 at once due to over licking my lips so finding a good enough lip balm is usually a challenge.</li>
            <li> not sure if it was this, but sending it postage due isn&#x27;t really free, is it?</li>
            <li> It may feel a little bit greasy, but really keep your lip moisturized and help the cracked lips to heal.</li>
            <li> I thought I finally found my new permanent chapstick, but think I will probably give the other 3 sticks away.</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy and gently scented without being overpowering or artificial.</li>
            <li> Asian pear is tasty, it&#x27;s hard to not just lick it right off.</li>
            <li> Go on smooth and does not have a very sticky texture like other types of balms nor does it leave that weird white residual stuff that forms where your lips meet</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out like some other brands and as one who has tried several balms, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Only been using the acai + goji berry one so far, so I can&#x27;t judge for the other ones, but it&#x27;s a keeper</li>
            <li> i so far have tried the green tea and pear; they are unbelievably real to the taste and after just 3 days in Phoenix dry dessert heat, my dry lips are healed!</li>
            <li> Beats even other natural lip balms that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t read about this in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to reapply frequently like I do with other brands.</li>
            <li> I also really like that it is not thick or too thin of a consistency.</li>
            <li> What I also like is that this is a small company run by several friends who really believe in their product, and send it out in speedy deliveries.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> Can only buy a 4 pack which is a bummer considering how long these last.</li>
            <li> The packaging looks cool and the concept is nice, but the results are horrible!</li>
            <li> In Florida it is hard because it is humid but hot</li>
            <li> I have lips that dry up and crack constantly, but from recent use I have found my lips getting softer as the days go by.</li>
            <li> Oh, maybe I should share that I was having some strange issues with my lips prior to purchasing this set.</li>
            <li> last long and taste so sweet&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels, coats my lips well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps the lips moisturized for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Long lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> it is exstremly greasy , and a tiny bit goes a long way .</li>
            <li> and it last for a long time...</li>
            <li> I mean NONE of my other previous favorite lip balms were helping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say its my favorite in consistency, seems a little thin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other products that were all natural, but did not help with my dry lips.  </li>
            <li> My tight peeling lips are repairing and I need it less often (within the first week of using) as they normalize.  </li>
            <li> I live in the Midwest and the ever-changing weather is harsh.</li>
            <li> I work outside in all kinds of weather and used to have dry, chapped lips every winter.</li>
            <li> The flavors are great and don&#x27;t taste the least bit artificial.</li>
            <li> I have been using Labello for years, but my lips would still be dry if I didn&#x27;t reapply constantly.  </li>
            <li> I have been having a problem with dry lips this winter and my regular Chapstick wasn&#x27;t working for me.  </li>
            <li> I only use it in the mornings and before I go to bed, but my lips don&#x27;t get dry.  </li>
            <li> My lips are feircly dry from being outside a lot</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that 1 application last me a few hours with no reapplying.</li>
            <li> They are not normal, so you shouldn&#x27;t hold it to some standard of &#x27;cherry chapstick.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The only thing you can lose by ordering and using these products is dry lips!</li>
            <li> I get really bad migraines from certain fragrances which makes things a bit difficult, but these smell great.</li>
            <li> And it lasts for an incredibly long time, too.</li>
            <li> This lip Balm lasts a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have chapped lips all winter long and am concerned about putting chemicals on my lips to combat the problem.  </li>
            <li> Stays on a long time.  </li>
            <li> lasts long and will soften lips immediately.</li>
            <li> The silky feeling on the lips lasts for a long time and does not  cake up or flake.  </li>
            <li> and I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it for too long</li>
            <li> The coverage of the product is favorable and it keeps my lips moisturized for quite a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Keeps lips moist for a long time</li>
            <li> I have to say I miss a few of my old make-up items, like my mascara which didn&#x27;t use to run.  </li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had these for to long</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t keep my lips moist for long, just about 1hr or less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blackberry flavor is subtle with a slight sweet taste.</li>
            <li> Most balms made the problem worse, not better since they contain ingredients like camphor, which make you a lip balm junkie.  </li>
            <li> Lunchtime, my lips were still fine and usually they are not with other lip balms I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to break this review down into a plain old pros, cons and conclusion to make this as simple as possible.</li>
            <li> The creamy texture and protective long lasting qualities surpass the all other brands,  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to the other brands that have ingredients I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little more expensive, but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.</li>
            <li> I have already purchased a second time from BBE, as well as some other products in their line.  </li>
            <li> This was finally the answer after trying about 10 other lip balms.</li>
            <li> There are several levels on which these are preferable to other products.  </li>
            <li> Other lip balms I have to reapply several times during the day</li>
            <li> so I am constantly trying out other lip balms.</li>
            <li> Also it lasts really long!</li>
            <li> And it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> Many commercial lip products have bad chemicals in them..</li>
            <li> My lips are almost always dry.</li>
            <li> They were dry, burning, itching and feeling like they had a layer of skin that needed shedding.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY DRY LIPS from meds</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why my lips get so dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips like some Chapstick.</li>
            <li> Rarely it&#x27;ll be so dry that I&#x27;ll use it again at the end of the day, but</li>
            <li> I have been using blistex lip medic and my lips seemed constantly dry.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with my salivary glands, making my lips dry all the time.  </li>
            <li> with dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its a must have for people with intensely dry lips</li>
            <li> I only need to apply it a few times rather than multiple times throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to find all natural products that work or aren&#x27;t priced 9 times as high as other products!</li>
            <li> It feels luscious on my lips, very moisturizing and not the least bit sticky like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> And I like their natural ingredients approach and the small business</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this lip balm because it doesn&#x27;t have the overly waxy feel that I get from other lip balms nor does it have that weird taste whenever it gets into my mouth.</li>
            <li> No more peeling and my lips are soft.</li>
            <li> This chap stick is not very smooth, feels a bit oily and gritty.</li>
            <li> I peeled it everyday so much that my lips always looks raw, hurt, bleeding too.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of the flavors, especially the green tea, but it turns out I love all of them.  </li>
            <li> I am only marking this down to four because I was expecting thicker/larger around chapsticks.</li>
            <li> Especially the Asian pear and green tea ones!</li>
            <li> The only two slight negs for me</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t crazy strong.</li>
            <li> I have been on a medication the causes very dry chapped lips.</li>
            <li> and I do not have to reapply for a long time like I do other lip balms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry it took me so long to thank you so much for the extra bonus of the peppermint balm</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old niece&#x27;s lips are always dry, and I&#x27;ve had trouble getting her to use lip balm, but now she remembers to put this on her lips, because she loves the different flavors.</li>
            <li> A little smaller</li>
            <li> A couple of them are just a little tiny bit grainy but I&#x27;ll take that over toxin filed balms.</li>
            <li> Other balms that I had tried would dry out by morning</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry lips due to medication I take.  </li>
            <li> My lips still get dry with other lip balms but not this one.</li>
            <li> Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing, but I&#x27;ll probably lose them before I use them :)</li>
            <li> yes, I know I should fix my bad habit and drink more water.</li>
            <li> I applied some of the Green Tea chapstick and instantly felt the relief.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about buying or trying this product - don&#x27;t waste another second!</li>
            <li> Will be using this year round especially in our Arizona sunny weather.</li>
            <li> , I bought for 11, so be careful when purchasing</li>
            <li> I have only had it for just a few days</li>
            <li> The missing lip balm is the only reason I rated this product four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> Got the package a few days later</li>
            <li> Green Tea, Asian Pear, Acai and Goji Berry, and grapefruit and promegranate.  </li>
            <li> The Asian Pear and Green Tea were swapped with each other.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time which is important to me since I hate constantly re-applying lip balm.</li>
            <li> The one in my vehicle stays firmer as it is pretty cold outside.  </li>
            <li> Tasty, long lasting and moisturizing without icky chemicals</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of green tea in general.</li>
            <li> My lips are smoother and less dry since using them.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, no need to overcoat the lips.</li>
            <li> On one order, the green tea lip balm was missing; while I would have returned the box for a complete one, I needed them as little gifts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this as I try out the other 3 flavors in the 4-pack.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try all the other flavors.</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients on this lip balm, and reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I ordered the variety pack.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other flavors.</li>
            <li> This is head and shoulders above any lip ointment I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reordered twice now due to the fact it ends up in other family members pockets and purses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other brand EVER again.</li>
            <li> My husband usually refuses to use lip balm, but he is wiling to use these after I applied the Asian Pear one to his lips once.</li>
            <li> so your lips don&#x27;t feel sticky like some other lip balms.</li>
            <li> Have not tried the other favors.</li>
            <li> I had something held at the post office for postage due.</li>
            <li> I adore the other two flavors that are in my possession</li>
            <li> Havent tried the other two.</li>
            <li> It does not burn their lips like other chapsticks.</li>
            <li> The lip balm seems to stay longer than other products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I&#x27;m stoked about what I&#x27;ve found in Beauty by Earth Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> I came across this product two weeks ago and was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> With other lip balms it seems like you have to keep reapplying them</li>
            <li> I formerly used Burts Bees , once a small company as this is but now bought out by Clorox, the makers of BLEACH...</li>
            <li> Never using any other.  </li>
            <li> Chapstick, Blistex, Blistex Daily Conditioning Treatment, Carmex (in the little can and in the twist-up tube), EOS and Nivea, just to name a few.</li>
            <li> I thought I got an outdated pack, so I contacted the seller and was told they changed labs and the new flavors are &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have such an issue with chapped lips and it actually got worse once we moved to Florida.</li>
            <li> In fact, I often wonder if the lip balm I&#x27;m buying at my local drug store is actually making it worse.  </li>
            <li> The Aloe Vera has made a big difference with the dryness, and I find myself needing to apply less lip balm than I did in the past.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s been a few days since I started using this lip balm, and my severely dry, chapped lips are now healed!  </li>
            <li> One tube had hard, grainy texture in the balm (feels like facial scrub on your lips).</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth knocking points off for not having that but would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flavors/scents are not overwhelming, but distinct, so if I get bored of one, I just switch.</li>
            <li> The pic makes the package at least look bigger.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the mainstream crap that sits on the top of your lips.</li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s actually moisturizing and not just a thick wax coating like all the others I tried.  </li>
            <li> Not like some lip balms that go on thick and waxy and have to be reapplied several times a day.  </li>
            <li> After a few tries it seemed to taste sweeter</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t expect was that it would TASTE good.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down</li>
            <li> Other chapsticks that are full of chemicals we&#x27;re drying out my lips and making them painful.</li>
            <li> Having dry and chapped lips has always been a problem for me in the past.</li>
            <li> Seriously considering buying another one of these in the future.</li>
            <li> In fact, if I get a product and he doesn&#x27;t like it, somehow, who knows, it ends up in the laundry in a hidden pocket and well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lip moisturizers including Chapstick, Blistex, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Jack Black, EOS, and Beecology; but none of those brands compare to Beauty by Earth lip balms.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to get your typical flavors like Strawberry, Mint, or Cherry.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s less to think about.  </li>
            <li> The taste is very subtle and they keep my lips soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> These healed my son&#x27;s crazy dry lips, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> It keeps my lips moist and is not full of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that the company uses a little less of the peppermint oil?</li>
            <li> I started using the green tea lip balm, and my extremely chapped lips are gone!  </li>
            <li> I am very picky on lip balms, ,never liked them , my lips are very dry and choppy in the cold wet weather.&lt;br /&gt;THOSE</li>
            <li> Update - after a few weeks the pomegranate flavor started getting black stuff on it.</li>
            <li> A little on the spendy side.</li>
            <li> I could feel all of the little rips and tears that were sticking up and they felt plastic-y.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try the other flavors that came in the box.  </li>
            <li> a little over 2 hours before I felt like I needed to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it lasts a little longer on your lips.</li>
            <li> These go on a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> It reminds me a little of kool-aid.</li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Gives lips a little shine.  </li>
            <li> I found it a little too heavy in flavor, but I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> While I do appreciate the lack of chemicals and other such nasty ingredients, I found these all had a very sickeningly sweet taste in your mouth</li>
            <li> - Does not give me indigestion as some lip balms do (Shea Moisture&#x27;s Olive &amp; Green Tea Lip Balm).  </li>
            <li> I am using the Green Tea one now; my lips feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> I gave the green tea and pomegranate flavors to my girlfriend</li>
            <li> I have had problems with lip balm for a few years.</li>
            <li> I used this product ( green tea) for two days and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Wanted something that wasn&#x27;t heavy, goopy, waxy and didn&#x27;t need to be applied all the time.  </li>
            <li> The green tea took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> one of the few balms that i don&#x27;t have to apply over and over again throughout the day</li>
            <li> I have chronically chapped lips and after a few days of wearing Beauty by Earth</li>
            <li> I gave hubs the green tea and the ginger pear...</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Beauty by Earth&#x27;s product I guarantee you are missing out.  </li>
            <li> I would have only bought one because I limit the amount of lip balm I use to avoid getting my lips addicted to the stuff.</li>
            <li> My lips tend to get choppy during winter</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product a few times over, the fruit ones and the peppermint ones.</li>
            <li> I tried the green tea.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always down to support small...</li>
            <li> Not as stiff as Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> burts bees beats this small little brand any day.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands and they tend to dry out my lips, or make them waxy, or even give me a cold / canker sore.</li>
            <li> I was using Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm before the purchase, but they are dry and very hard to apply to the lips.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s extremely hard to make the lipstick go up or down.</li>
            <li> The thick balm really covers and protects from the wind and cold of nyc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sometimes weird with flavored lip balm, but these are so natural and subtle</li>
            <li> I just got this lip balm a few days ago, but I can already tell that it is making a difference on my lips!  </li>
            <li> I am usually a Burts Bees girl, but got this as a gift.</li>
            <li> I use lip balm every day, usually Blistex or Chapstic.  </li>
            <li> There is almost an exfoliating quality in the stick itself (not sure if that&#x27;s just my batch?)</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on like silk, has almost a lip gloss feel on your lips, is not grainy like usual beeswax balms I&#x27;ve tried, and lasts on my lips longer than usual lip balms.  </li>
            <li> No more peeling, cracks or bleeding.</li>
            <li> Green tea is my fave!</li>
            <li> My gf doesn&#x27;t usually like &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a small, family-owned company.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an alright chapstick but a bit expensive for what you get, I&#x27;ll probably order Burt&#x27;s Bees again in the future.</li>
            <li> I even tried plain ole Vaseline!</li>
            <li> and it was really hard to get past.</li>
            <li> She has not liked beeswax-based balms that I got her in the past</li>
            <li> We were used to Burts Bees for so long but everyone, including my kids, is now addicted to Beauty by Earth!  </li>
            <li> Ink was faded, hard to read.</li>
            <li> Or too hard.</li>
            <li> I gave these five stars because I never got a complaint from the recipients.  </li>
            <li> The pear flavor kinda has a bubble gum scent, which I was not thrilled about but am now used to.</li>
            <li> bit thick.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: A bit thick, but if you just avoid over applying the stuff then this can be a pro instead of a con, as you will almost never run out of the stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other lip balms and found them to be disappointing.</li>
            <li> Oh and the packaging makes it look so expensive compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything, and I mean everything, for my chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I like that they&#x27;re subtle.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The flavor and smell is subtle and I like all of them.</li>
            <li> Flavors are pleasantly subtle.</li>
            <li> Sounds ridiculous?</li>
            <li> Other than the missing lip balm in that order, I haven&#x27;t had a bad experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a die hard &amp;#34;organics&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; customer, but I do appreciate that this was all accomplished without nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> taste artificial, doesn&#x27;t last, overpriced, fake &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; flavors.</li>
            <li> I think the flavors are pretty boring so 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Tough to say here....</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this before</li>
            <li> Was using Burts before this and felt like I needed to apply several times a day, which got annoying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just addicted to having lip balm or lipstick on my lips.</li>
            <li> balm goes on thinly, so there isn&#x27;t that clumpy feeling where you immediately want to wipe your lips</li>
            <li> I am addicted to chap stick/lip balm and cannot go anywhere without it.  </li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my wife who is addicted to lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to these.</li>
            <li> (They had been a little sad with the winter weather!)</li>
            <li> It created my other bad habit of peeling my  lips skin.</li>
            <li> I am in the Army so we were at the range in the dead of the cold where my lips dried out so bad they cracked</li>
            <li> I usually buy my lip balm in the grocery store check-out line, but when I saw this on Amazon, I gave this product a try because I&#x27;ve been unhappy with what I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> All but the green tea smell very artificial.</li>
            <li> Asian Pear is nauseating to smell and tastes terrible too.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have weird flavors.</li>
            <li> Flavors are fake.</li>
            <li> The thing was I had accidentally ordered the wrong flavor pack and wanted to change my order.  </li>
            <li> I also like that these lip balms don&#x27;t contain a bunch of weird chemicals.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for a friend who is OBSESSED with lip balm.</li>
            <li> In summary, you can&#x27;t go wrong ordering this lip</li>
            <li> Have you ever fallen asleep with chapstick on and had that weird taste in your mouth in the morning?</li>
            <li> Also the shrink-wrapping around the tubes is really, really difficult to tear off around the cap.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with Beauty By Earth&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing some fake goo on your lips.</li>
            <li> These smell weird.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so disappointing.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know, but it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.</li>
            <li> Why put something artificial and toxic on your lips?</li>
            <li> I bought these to protect my lips during the cold months.  </li>
            <li> It relieves my lips when it&#x27;s cold out and they are chapped.</li>
            <li> Or too artificial tasting.</li>
            <li> My lips were in horrible shape from this past winter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so unpleasant.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t taste bad either.</li>
            <li> This lip balm tastes really bad.</li>
            <li> and it was painful.</li>
            <li> give it a try, you wont be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.&#x27;...</li>
            <li> So, anyway... I don&#x27;t hate this</li>
            <li> I hate having to reapply lip products all the time.</li>
            <li> like that this holds up when I use it as a base before I apply any lipstick or lip glosses as those would start drying out my lips within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> All four lip balms taste like some nasty artificial sweetener.</li>
            <li> Have always hated lip balm but this made me a believer.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Take my word for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t penetrate into your lips one bit, very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe, but since purchasing Beauty by Earth lip balm, I have become totally obsessed!!!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with the worst chapped lips.</li>
            <li> This is the worst chapstick I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot.  </li>
            <li> They feel awful!  </li>
            <li> The flavors stick out and you don&#x27;t get hit with the nasty beeswax taste if you lick your lips.  </li>
            <li> I have tried them all with Chapstick and EOS being the worst of them.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lip balm goes on so smoothly and does not leave you feeling like you need to put on more 1 hour later.  I will put this on in the morning and it stays with me until I eat lunch.  I think only then do I feel like I need to reapply because I rubbed it off while eating.  I love the fact that it is all natural and much prefer it over some other popular all natural brands sold in stores all over the place!</li>
            <li> GREAT quality all natural pretty packaging smells and tastes great love the variety ...    I&#x27;m sorry it took me so long to thank you so much for the extra bonus of the peppermint balm but I LOVE them as well or more it like eating the lil peppering star candy so refreshing I love this as well....Thank you so very muchhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!    My lips actually feel plumper wearing this amazing balm with just a slight bit of shine.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love these lip balms! There is nothing more supple and hydrating for your lips on the market. I have purchased many brands from Fresh, Tarte, Bareminerals, etc and this by far my favorite hands down. If the amazing all natural lasting hydration wasn&#x27;t enough, the fragrances are truly a mini getaway! P.S. I will be eagerly awaiting a tinted lip balm line!!!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever bought. We needed something natural for medical reasons &amp; love the texture, smell, and quality of this product. I won&#x27;t buy another brand since using this.</li>
            <li> I like the package and I love the flavors and how the lip balm feels.</li>
            <li> I love these lip balms.  So far I have tried the Asian Pear and the Acai/Goji Berry out of my 4 pack.  They go on more smoothly than a lot of lip balms and have a delicious sweet taste if you happen to taste them (instead of that icky chap stick type of taste).  I find that they keep my lips moisturized longer than traditional lip balms as well.  I wear these over lip stains and they are pretty good about not disturbing the color.  One of my favorite things about these lip balms is the natural ingredients with no petroleum or mineral oil.  Highly recommend this lip balm!  I also feel they are reasonably priced for the quantity and quality of lip balm you are getting.</li>
            <li> Made my lips soft and smooth so fast I didn&#x27;t have enough time to say goodbye to my dry lips.</li>
            <li> I tried these because I liked the peppermint ones so well.  These are just as good, especially if you live in a dry climate.  I only need to apply it a few times rather than multiple times throughout the day.  Beats even other natural lip balms that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried! Keeps lips moist without feeling waxy. I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is amazing! It goes on smooth and smells awesome! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I loved the flavors and scents!!  Works great and even my kids love using these lip balms.</li>
            <li> Great natural lip balm! Definitely would recommend these to anyone looking for all natural lip balm. Do not use the regular lip balms as they use petroleum.</li>
            <li> Best chapstick ever! Nothing even comes close.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I found it a little too heavy in flavor, but I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was particularly excited about the multi-pack as it gave me a chance to try out all of the different flavor options. Each one is different from the other but with the same exceptional quality. A definite must have in my beauty kit!</li>
            <li> Perfect! I live in a very dry place and have chapped lips almost all the time. I have been searching for a lip balm that I can basically eat, since I wear so much of it. This is made with very safe ingredients, doesn&#x27;t taste nasty or like chemicals, moisturizes VERY well, and smells amazing! Definitely worth it, if you&#x27;re like me and carry lip balm on your person all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years and love it and this is as equal to Burt&#x27;s as there can be.  This came quickly and as described.  I would not hesitate to use it or provide as gifts (which I did in this case) again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Not as stiff as Burt&#x27;s Bees. To me Baby Lips is creamy but it doesn&#x27;t feel like my lips are absorbing anything. Its just on there. But this has a creamy texture (a little more creamier than Eos) and feels hydrating. They don&#x27;t taste bad either. Also the packaging is super cute, it&#x27;s like the size of your hand.</li>
            <li> The amazon packaging isn&#x27;t the best for the size of the lip balms, but I&#x27;m guessing its for the best protection. I really enjoy these, I would say better than Burt&#x27;s since they stay moist longer on my lips. I would buy again! I don&#x27;t really care flavors, but the green tea isn&#x27;t really noticeable, actually the flavors aren&#x27;t overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/21/14: The company sent me free samples of their peppermint. (They seem like a really nice and efficient company). The peppermint does have a strong tingling sensation, which I quite enjoy in my lip balms, but others may find over powering. I would recommend that the company uses a little less of the peppermint oil? Which is something I&#x27;m quite happy to say since I&#x27;m really quite enjoying an all natural company! Still planning on repurchasing from them, again. The packaging and the design of the lipbalms would make great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth consistency and love the natural ingredients, but this line--up of flavors way too sweet and not to my personal taste. I don&#x27;t want to smell like candy! The green tea was just strange, and I actually love tea. I gave the others (acai/goji berry and grapefruit/lime) to my nine-year old. Three stars for the product, one star for the flavors.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this lip balm and so do I, the green tea lip balm for me though had little pieces sticking to my lip but besides that the other ones are great and smell really good!</li>
            <li> This a a great lip balm.  The flavors are wonderful.  My lips feel very soft and moisturized.  There&#x27;s no heavy or sticky feeling.  I love that they are natural.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm out there as far as I&#x27;m concerned , it is 100% natural and pure beeswax lip care with aloe vera &amp; vitamin E to condition and to repair dry chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These are amazing I will never need to find another lip balm again . I have tried so many different ones expensive and low cost none of them compare to these . They leave your lips soft and smooth , look no further for a great lip balm here it is ,This product comes in 4 exotic flavors .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product left my lips feeling soft and supple, the different flavors are awesome .This is my new favorite lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this product , happy happy lips.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lip balm that would last all night.  Other balms that I had tried would dry out by morning and I would wake up with parched lips.  This lip balm lasts and lasts without constant re-application.  I also like the flavors.  This balm is quite a find.</li>
            <li> I just love my Beauty by Earth Exotic Flavors Lip Balm!!! It not only made my chapped lips smooth and soft, it lasts all day!  The flavors are so yummy which is a plus!  I am very happy with this product!!!</li>
            <li> Feels great going on. Lips are moisturized!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these lip balms. They make my lips kissable soft and smell yummy. They aren&#x27;t greasy or make my mouth feel smothered so I love them even more. Try them. You wont be disappointed!  I got these at a reduced price for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product. Yes it gives you a nice shine and has good taste but hey if a lip balm doesn&#x27;t moisturize your lips *AT ALL* then why the hell do I need one, I can buy a lipstick for the looks!</li>
            <li> Good service excellent product</li>
            <li> My whole family tried these, and we love them. The flavors are really interesting and different then what you can buy in the store. The family fave is the berry one. Does the trick of chapped lips too! Great product, will be telling all my friends about these!</li>
            <li> The lip balm is wonderful to use alone or under your favorite lip product.</li>
            <li> These moisturize my lips very well and they taste good.</li>
            <li> Call me a convert. I love them all! Asian pear is tasty, it&#x27;s hard to not just lick it right off.</li>
            <li> Best lips ever with these , yummy flavors</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just ok plus they have no spf.</li>
            <li> This is now my new lip balm for sure.  It is absolutely delicious!  It made my lips soft instantly and I have never tasted a lip balm this good.  I currently have on the green tea, and really like it a lot, along with acai goji berry.  Much better than the store brand and some others out there.  Love these flavors for sure.  My lips really suffer this time of year, and will have these handy everywhere I go now.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE these chapsticks!!! I purchased these over EOS and am thankful that I did. I am in the Army so we were at the range in the dead of the cold where my lips dried out so bad they cracked and it was painful. I applied some of the Green Tea chapstick and instantly felt the relief. My lips stayed moisturized the entire time I was outside shooting at the range.. I will definitely be purchasing more once my supply runs out.</li>
            <li> Very nice product and price. I sent it as little gifts for my families overseas, they loved it. They enjoyed the all natural ingredients and the smell.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my lips! The blackberry flavor is subtle with a slight sweet taste. The actual balm is smooth feeling, not heavy, an  it doesn&#x27;t burn on chapped lips like some similar products. I love it!</li>
            <li> They are  very smooth. I love them. They can be better if they&#x27;re not sweet.</li>
            <li> Great product! Lasts a long time and awesome flavors! My new favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is really great. I only wear it once in the morning and it seems to last all day. My lips also feel softer and smoother and are never chapped and I live in Chicago so you know what kind of weather I deal with. I have only tried the pear flavor one so far and it smells and taste delicious. I will probably purchase again once I run out.</li>
            <li> We were looking for lip balm with natural ingredients. Came across these and decided to try them. They are absolutely fabulous. I specially like the green tea and asian pear ones. Enjoy using them every day this winter.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the smoothest natural lip balm&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found. The flavors smell delicious &amp; I feel safe letting my young daughters use this products because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm.  The flavors are great and you don&#x27;t have to reapply very often.  I&#x27;m giving lots of these as gifts as well.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to carry and nice to use.! The effect of its natural materials are clear on usage.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mama as a holiday gift. I hope she like it. I would like to buy more if there are more flavors.</li>
            <li> I just got this lip balm a few days ago, but I can already tell that it is making a difference on my lips!  Love it.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and stay for a long hours.</li>
            <li> Amazing balm. I have suffered with the worst chapped lips. Sometimes cracking and peeling to the point of bleeding. This balm has put an end to that. Feels great and stays on my lips.</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy and gently scented without being overpowering or artificial. Nice packaging as well.</li>
            <li> Pleasant flavor and scent, this clear colored lip balm goes on like a lip gloss, leaving you with shiny lips.&lt;br /&gt; My only issue with these is that since the flavor is good, I have to fight not to lick my lips, which would defeat the purpose of applying it.</li>
            <li> My new favorite lip balm! Very smooth, not waxy at all, natural, not over powering with the sent/taste, reasonably priced, overall fabulous product! I will be ordering more, often.</li>
            <li> I started using the pomegranate when I got this set and it moisturizes wonderfully. It goes on so smoothly and my lips feel so soft. And it lasts for an incredibly long time, too. I only needed to reapply after 4 hours which is amazing compared to other lip balms *cough cough EOS* that fade after half-hour or so. The only thing with this product is that the taste is too strong for me. The pomegranate one has a sweet taste which is nice except that taste is in my mouth all day. I don&#x27;t lick my lips at all and I&#x27;ve tried just applying sparingly, but I still get the taste and it&#x27;s overwhelming. Especially when I eat, I taste the lip balm with my food! I&#x27;ve never experienced this before and I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t read about this in other reviews. It&#x27;s so disappointing. I thought I finally found my new permanent chapstick, but think I will probably give the other 3 sticks away.</li>
            <li> I really like the creamy texture and how it feels on my lips. It stays on well and tastes good.</li>
            <li> She loves the product for how it softens and protects her lips</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift for someone.  So far, the response has been positive.</li>
            <li> I bought this lip balm because I work outside in the Pacific Northwest and seem&lt;br /&gt;to always have chapped lips so am looking to try different products that work the best&lt;br /&gt; for me and am very happy with Beauty by Earth lip balm. This lip Balm lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;and tastes great to, would recommend to someone looking for quality lip balm guys or gals.</li>
            <li> I bought these and the peppermint at the same time. These are great but I find myself liking the peppermint more though. Just depends on if you like fruity or minty flavors :)</li>
            <li> My family enjoys this lip balm and find it beneficial</li>
            <li> Love it! Really helps chapped lips! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. It keeps my lip super moisturized. I love that it is natural I have been looking for something like this for a while and finally found it, there is no after taste or build up. I love the taste too lol. I will repurchase again!!👍👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> This ChapStick is immediately self evident that it is of a high quality. Upon first application the ChapStick glides effortlessly and adheres to your lips. There is no tugging or pulling feeling like with traditional ChapStick. As well the smell is great, with minimal taste, which is ideal. I highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a normal to somewhat intense lip repair compound.</li>
            <li> KEEPING MOISTURE YOUR LIPS ABOUT 4 HRS.</li>
            <li> I love that they only use 100% organic products in there lip moisturizer! My lips feel and taste amazing! ;) about to buy more for my friends and family. The green tea is my favorite but I love them all :)</li>
            <li> Great service and fast shipping! The products are excellent and we&#x27;ll made. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I really like these all natural lip balms but the smell and taste don&#x27;t seem to last and you have to reapply them often. There is no SPF sun protection but they go on smooth, smell and tease good. A little on the spendy side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good lip balm and this is it. It&#x27;s very smooth and smells great. Lips stay moisturized and I love it.</li>
            <li> This chapstick smells great, stays on well, and is more of a glossy balm. It&#x27;s a great gift or variety pack to treat yourself. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Buy this for the ladies in your life.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I have such an issue with chapped lips and it actually got worse once we moved to Florida. I had been using Banana Boat lip balm religiously for years....maybe I built up a tolerance, I don&#x27;t know, but it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. I took a chance on the Beauty by Earth lip balm based on the reviews (I am an Amazon junkie!) and boy I am just thrilled so far. It is emollient and my lips feel 100% better. I don&#x27;t need to reapply very often either. Great product! Plus they smell good.</li>
            <li> Great flavors and glides on smoothly. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing. will definitely repurchase. I feel it&#x27;s safe for my toddler daughter as well.</li>
            <li> My lips are very sensitive so I am and using this lip balm but also using my old one. I am hoping that this one becomes the one I can use.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm that makes my lips feel moisturized! I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li> I really like Beauty by Earth&#x27;s set of lip balm.  I opened and smelled every one of four, and they all smelled really great.  Not too strong but enough scent that&#x27;s pleasant.  I started using the green tea lip balm, and my extremely chapped lips are gone!  I highly recommend the product.  Also, it&#x27;s cheaper than any other natural lip balms you get in-store but better!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  The other flavors are awesome. They are not overpowering. They are smooth and not grainy. I change my review from 3 stars to 4 stars. Also, what would be awesome as I&#x27;ve seen others recommend, is if we could choose what flavors we wanted to be sent. If we could do that in the future, I would give this a 5 stars.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Initial Thoughts on this product:  I&#x27;ve only tried the Asian Pear so far.  Pro&#x27;s:  - Organic  - Natural Non-toxic Ingredients  - Tastes fine (The Asian Pear has lots of flavor)  - Does not give me indigestion as some lip balms do (Shea Moisture&#x27;s Olive &amp; Green Tea Lip Balm).  - No horrible after taste    Con&#x27;s:  - The Asian Pear is grainy. It reminds me of how baking powder feels.  - I feel like I have to apply it more often.    My lips are almost always dry. The first few days of using it, my lips were peeling quite a bit. My bottom lip cracked open (probably because of this winter climate) and I put this on my lips and it didn&#x27;t sting but it didn&#x27;t necessarily make my lips feel any softer. I could feel all of the little rips and tears that were sticking up and they felt plastic-y. I left this on over night and my entire lips had this plastic-y feeling to them in the morning. So I exfoliated my lips and the plastic-y skin came off and I had supple skin underneath. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have a minty flavor in addition to what ever other flavor it&#x27;s supposed to be, like Burt&#x27;s Bees. So, anyway... I don&#x27;t hate this but, I don&#x27;t love it either. I&#x27;ll update this as I try out the other 3 flavors in the 4-pack.</li>
            <li> I have always used &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34; but have been looking to change to something that was natural with no junk in it. This lip balm is it!! It works even better than that other stuff. It stays with you and does not give leave you with a &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; in your mouth. I WILL definitely be a return customer!!!!! Thank you, for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Very nice! I often use a bit of the Becca Beach Tint, sold here on Amazon, for a bit of color and then follow up with this lip balm.</li>
            <li> wow...this is the best product I have ever used.  Very creamy and glides on so smoothly.  My lips have never been so pampered.  After only 4 applications I noticed how my lips are so much softer.  I will never go back to the other brands that have ingredients I cannot pronounce.  Beauty by Earth is my Number 1. And they all taste so good!</li>
            <li> Best lip product out there. 2 days after buying I had to come back and make sure I got more to pass out to friends. Best part is I can pronounce all the ingredients too!</li>
            <li> Yummy. These lip balm are nourishing and moisturizing. This isn&#x27;t the mainstream crap that sits on the top of your lips. This lip balm penetrates and conditions. I have eczema and this product does not irritate my skin in the slightest. And the flavors are yummy and have no chemical taste. Makes me feel like a kid when I had the giant oversized lip balm that was flavored. Buy this.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery :) love the flavor and the way it feels on my lips. The grapefruit one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed my routine from the cheap \\&quot;petroleum\\&quot; chapsticks and switched over to these more natural ways of keeping my lips not only moist but healthy. Within a week I noticed a huge difference. I only have to put it on once and I don&#x27;t need to reapply after eating or blowing my nose or whatever else I do unconsciously that always wore out my prior chapstick. I love the fruity variety and I will definitely get my family and friends to make the switch. Yes, it is a little more expensive, but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. This product is GREAT!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, very soft and smooth on the lips.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm, beeswax chapsticks are my favorite type and the unique flavors make me happy. The chapstick applies smoothly and leaves lips feeling softer.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. Great for the all natural lifestyle. Smells divine. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very Nice. I like it and my kids like it too! Not too waxy.</li>
            <li> I love these lip balms.</li>
            <li> I have chapped lips all winter long and am concerned about putting chemicals on my lips to combat the problem.  In fact, I often wonder if the lip balm I&#x27;m buying at my local drug store is actually making it worse.  The Beauty Earth lip balm keeps my lips moisturized and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting chemicals on my face!&lt;br /&gt;Love love love</li>
            <li> This lip balm is the best! Decades ago I started with the standard Chapstick but didn&#x27;t like how it went on and felt on. This led to the discovery of Vaseline which I love. It went on great, felt great, and made my lips super soft. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was it had to be applied frequently and the fact that it&#x27;s petroleum jelly. A short time ago I found EOS. I was excited as it was largely organic and reasonably priced at Costco. EOS was a happy compromise between Chapstick and Vaseline. It went on better the Chapstick and didn&#x27;t have to be applied as often as Vaseline; however, it didn&#x27;t make my lips as soft Vaseline and didn&#x27;t feel as good going and being on my lips. Then I found the Beauty by Earth Lip Balm and it is the best ever! It goes on like Vaseline and feels like Vaseline on my lips but is totally organic. It doesn&#x27;t have to be applied nearly as often as Vaseline and it makes my lips soft. Highly recommend this product as it is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love all of the flavors and I wasn&#x27;t sure I would.  Although they taste great I don&#x27;t find myself licking my lips constantly to enjoy them.  That&#x27;s because my lips feel so silky soft with the lip balm that I don&#x27;t want that feeling to end.  My favorite part is that it is made of natural ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t take much to make your lips feel great!  Oh and the packaging makes it look so expensive compared to other brands.  My favorite lip balm ever!</li>
            <li> I received this set for free and even though I prefer the peppermint lip balm much more, these were not bad at all. I love the way the lip balm feels on my lips and love how long it lasts! I am a huge addict of lip balm and I am always up to trying new ones. I am thankful to this company that I got to try these flavors. I have them all over the house so I am never without soft lips!!</li>
            <li> My husband and I split this - we are both very satisfied with not only the quality but the pleasant scent of each one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to certain ingredients but I am abl to use these! The flavors are all great.  The coverage lasts and my lips stay soft &amp; hydrated. New favorite product!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm EVER!! I am usually a Burts Bees girl, but got this as a gift. I&#x27;m so glad I did!! They taste great, last long, and don&#x27;t have any sticky/waxyness to them. Be careful and don&#x27;t let them get too warm, though they melt a bit easier than others. So happy :-)</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm multipack! They feel silky smooth going on and last for a while. The flavors are all so yummy I want to eat them and with all natural ingredients and no chemicals I am happy to use this product knowing it is good for my body. I really avoided using most chapsticks or lip balms because they have a chemical taste and sticky feel. These lip balms have none of that for me!</li>
            <li> These glide on smooth and creamy.  The flavors are delicious.</li>
            <li> I bought these as stocking stuffers and now I just want to keep all of them for myself. I love that they are all natural and they stay on your lips for quite a bit longer than other balms I&#x27;ve used. I love the smell and there is a gentle sweet taste too. I also love that the company is a small, family owned operation and the price was good too! Recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Arrived on time and in good condition.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really happy with my order. Got the product right away and they smell great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful products just love them I work outside helps fight the elements.</li>
            <li> I tried this lip balm because I wanted something that was non-petroleum based.  I was a little wary of the flavors, especially the green tea, but it turns out I love all of them.  The texture is smooth and soft, not sticky.  I especially love the fact that these particular balms don&#x27;t have any menthol or peppermint quality to them, just mildly fruity sweetness.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this lip balm to anyone.</li>
            <li> love this product, I would definitely buy from Beauty by earth again...feels amazing and smells great.</li>
            <li> Smell and taste yummy. Arrived on time too.</li>
            <li> I started using Asian pear one, and as another review said, I love the smell and a little sweet flavor of it.&lt;br /&gt;My lips are nice and moist all day long without drying out completely and knowing that all the ingredients are natural, non-toxic and non-GMO, I feel god to keep putting it on for this dry season.  I&#x27;m glad I got this pack I know I&#x27;m in good moist lips throughout the dry winter here. I can&#x27;t wait to try all the other flavors. Thanks Beauty by Earth!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for a gift for my niece and she seemed very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great flavors, but too sweet.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Goes on smooth and leaves my lips feeling so soft. Every product in this package has such a great smell. Definitely a product I use daily and they&#x27;re all so different.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my sister- she really likes the flavors of these products. Would love to try mind flavor!</li>
            <li> Always looking for good organic/natural products that work well. The lip balm goes on smoothly and moisturizes well! Looking forward to trying more products from Beauty by Earth in the future!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write very many reviews but I LOVE this product.  I&#x27;ve been searching and trying all different kinds of lip balm and this is THE one.  Goes on very smooth.  Stays on a long time.  Feels like it&#x27;s actually moisturizing and not just a thick wax coating like all the others I tried.  I&#x27;m not a die hard &amp;#34;organics&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; customer, but I do appreciate that this was all accomplished without nasty chemicals.  I would have been grateful for non-flavored and would even have been happy with medicine flavored, in order to do what this does, so to be in wonderful and delicious flavors is a true bonus.</li>
            <li> I got this item for testing and review purposes to my lips having a cracking i recommend this is better</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived promptly and the quality of the product is excellent. The reason I gave 3 stars is because of its taste. It is nauseatingly sweet! I wish somewhere in its description it would say something to that effect, but alas here I am stuck with a set of four wonderfully fragrant but candy sweet lip balms.</li>
            <li> THE BEST smelling and best tasting lip balm EVER! My lips feel pretty fabulous now after using this for a day. (They had been a little sad with the winter weather!)</li>
            <li> This lip balm is absolutely lovely. After suffering through an unusually dry winter, and buying nearly every kind of &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; lip balm at the drug store, I decided to look for something all natural and hopefully more effective. With many other brands my lips would literally burn the moment I applied it. I&#x27;m not really sure why this was the case, but I decided to try something petroleum free. After reading the ingredients on this lip balm, and reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I ordered the variety pack. Wow, was I impressed! This Beauty by Nature lip balm smoothly glides on your lips, leaving the gentle feeling of a luxioursly deep conditioning. The subtle hint of Asian Pear or Grapefruit and Pomegranate flavors are also good enough to eat without being overpowering. Also, I&#x27;ve had zero irritation or burning. All natural really does seem to make a difference! These are a new staple as far as I&#x27;m concerned!!</li>
            <li> I love these Lip Balms! They all worked great and tasted wonderful aside for the grapefruit one which made my lips burn (but I am sensitive to citrus so i do not think this is a reflection of quality of the product). They have lasted quite a while and I have used them daily. Would recommend to anyone who uses lip balm and is looking for a natural alternative!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm i have ever used. smooth, creamy and such sweet taste. lasts long and will soften lips immediately. very good for dry lips.</li>
            <li> The cure for my chapped lips!  Great flavors.  Fast shipping too.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased 5 of these lip balm sets as gifts.  My daughters were quite happy with them.  I could not have gotten them a nicer gift.</li>
            <li> It is really nice and works well with chapped lips!</li>
            <li> Good variety of flavors and so far its kept my lips nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Got these adorable lip balms as a gift, and I absolutely love them. They don&#x27;t make my lips more chapped and given my skin is super sensitive and I&#x27;ll get an allergic reaction to pretty much anything yet I didn&#x27;t react to these, I can only give it my best recommendations. They smell and taste amazing too :)</li>
            <li> Like butter on my lips! Great natural products with wonderful flavors.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm, I just received the box within the past week.  I am using the Green Tea one now; my lips feel like silk.  The silky feeling on the lips lasts for a long time and does not  cake up or flake.  I am anxious to try the other flavors that came in the box.  I would recommend this product, and I will reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> better than any others that I have tried</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a great lip balm and have finally found one.  These seem to really moisturize and are not too sticky or too shiny.  I love that they are clear and have a good flavor that is not too overwhelming.  I also love that they are all natural.  The only thing I did seem to notice is that the Asian pear flavor does have a little bit of a grainy texture, as compared to the other 3 flavors, which are super smooth.  I did wish a mint flavor was one of the additions to this pack so I could share with my husband, who refuses to wear fruity flavors. And BONUS, my kids love it too!</li>
            <li> meh..this is ok. Im not in love with it for the price tho. Melts easy in the car as well</li>
            <li> This product remains on my lips longer than the name brands found in groceries and drug stores.</li>
            <li> Love the &#x27;flavors&#x27; of the lip balm. Go on smooth and does not have a very sticky texture like other types of balms nor does it leave that weird white residual stuff that forms where your lips meet (maybe that&#x27;s just me...).</li>
            <li> I bought several of these as gifts, and they were well received. I use the peppermint lip balm myself and love it.</li>
            <li> All natural, not sticky and great flavor assortment. Perfect stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> I love these!!! I have a hard time finding things like this that make my lips even just feel good and smooth, and hydrated. The scents or flavors (however :-) ) weren&#x27;t too overpowering which I loved</li>
            <li> the berry lip balm was my favorite! it was almost like a pack of wild berry skittles. I gave the green tea and pomegranate flavors to my girlfriend she loved it! The lip balm is very moisturizing it lasts long and tastes great on your lips.</li>
            <li> This is the worst chapstick I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot.  Asian Pear is nauseating to smell and tastes terrible too.  Maybe they make this out of 100% natural regurgitated pears.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much in the first few days, I ordered another set so I could leave them around the house, in my office and in my truck!  After having severe chapped lip issues since August, I was looking for a natural product that might help.  I had tried Blixtex and EOS (a natural lip product) with little long term success.  As soon as I read the reviews I knew I had to try these.  I love them!  One note is that when they get warm they soften up (as they are made with oils), and sometimes they feel as if they have become bumpy.  Once you put them on your lips that goes away, and there is no residue on your lips.  The one in my vehicle stays firmer as it is pretty cold outside.  I think the products are great and purchased several others-Witch hazel, Arman Oil, Suntan lotion and sponges.  The company has a great website with lots of information and they are very helpful if you have questions.  Great products!</li>
            <li> All the flavor safe really good and they made lips softer than before. Good choice to buy ladies :)</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Tastes great! Keeps my lips hydrated although I wish it would stay on longer.. but maybe Im just licking my lips more!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the balm.  Stays on a long time and you don&#x27;t need much when you apply it. Was using Burts before this and felt like I needed to apply several times a day, which got annoying.  This Beauty by Earth lip balm is way better.  Best one I&#x27;ve used so far, including a lip moisturizer from Clinique.  Will for sure buy it again.  I gave two sticks to my friends, and kept two for me from this 4-pack :-).</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find all natural products that work or aren&#x27;t priced 9 times as high as other products! Not to mention that it seams that every time I pick up a product that says its &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; it still contains some sort of chemicals or perfume/fragrance! Not these!!! I was very excited to find these. These lip balms feel great! Keep your lips soft and smooth without having to eat a bunch of chemicals! Very happy with them!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, is very moisturizing and all of the smells are delicious.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great flavor and moist balm. Due to extremely dry lips I have to apply more often than I wish. I recommend this product mostly because of the great flavors.</li>
            <li> Really lovely lip balms. Wonderful texture, great smell and taste and everything in it is healthy and natural.</li>
            <li> BBE lip balms are very, very moisturizing but not in a greasy or waxy way.  They truly penetrate the lips.  I use the lip balm daily, and often under lipstick.  The natural flavors are delightful but not overpowering.  I have tried different balms over the years but have never bought any a second time.  I have already purchased a second time from BBE, as well as some other products in their line.  The toner and mask, specifically.  They work great and are a delight to use!  Looking forward to BBE&#x27;s expansion of new products.</li>
            <li> Its like you could them they taste so good. I would recommend getting for a female tho. You can kiss her and enjoy a sweet flavor. Youd want to make out all day ! lol</li>
            <li> I gave these five stars because I never got a complaint from the recipients.  Wish I could do better by this product, but I&#x27;ve never used it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Goes on smooth, it&#x27;s not sticky or gross, and it lasts a long time. Excellent product. I&#x27;ve only used to the green tea and it feels and tastes good. The old bat says the Asian pear goes on smooth and tastes good as well!</li>
            <li> Smells great. The lip balm is very smooth! I recommend buying it!</li>
            <li> Amazing products.  I tried 4 different scents but all of them smells good.  Scents aren&#x27;t too strong so I like it.  It will keep moisture on your lip and it last for a while.</li>
            <li> Tough to say here.... I like the lip balms while they are on. The flavors if you will are very mild if you lick your lips and you can&#x27;t tell what the flavor is.  Also your lips are soft while it is on.  Does it help your lips... Not in my opinion. I&#x27;ve not noticed any help in that dept.</li>
            <li> Bought it for like $10, which felt about right for a fancy box of lip balm. A little bit more expensive than some of the more common ones, but it&#x27;s well worth it. It feels really nice on the lips, last long (I maybe need to apply it at most twice a day) and it smells DELICIOUS. But, don&#x27;t eat it. It&#x27;s not that delicious. Only been using the acai + goji berry one so far, so I can&#x27;t judge for the other ones, but it&#x27;s a keeper, that&#x27;s for sure. Gives your lips the slightest hint of shimmer, which is perfectly fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, the box is really cute. 100% agree. I almost didn&#x27;t want to open it, but I did, because, y&#x27;know, I need the lip palm on my lips, not in a box.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm! I can&#x27;t wait to try all four. Excellent delivery!</li>
            <li> Awesome lip balm, my lips get super dry and chapped in the winter and it&#x27;s hard to find lip balm that doesn&#x27;t actually dry them out more but this stuff does the job!  Would reccomend.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! The green tea lip balm is my absolute favorite! They all smell and taste great, and they keep your lips soft long-term!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product&lt;br /&gt;will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> This lip balm is a great find.  It feels luscious on my lips, very moisturizing and not the least bit sticky like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  A bonus is that the flavors are all delightful.  This balm cleared up my chapped lips in one day.  I&#x27;m a fan for life!!.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product because it really does make my lips feel better definitely worth the price and will definitely buy it again soon</li>
            <li> I have had problems with lip balm for a few years. For some reason my lips have become red and sore whenever I use lip gloss, any lip balm with sunscreen, lip stick or stain. They feel awful!  I used this product ( green tea) for two days and have had no problems. This means a great deal to me since the only other lip product I have been able to use is petroleum jelly (not easy to carry around and is messy to apply with your finger). I can&#x27;t wait to try the other flavors. The green tea has a nice light scent and isn&#x27;t too sweet. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Started with pomegranate  scented lip balm and already liking it! It glides smoothly over my lips and is not granular or rough. My first time using a lip balm with beeswax as its major ingredient and no allergic reactions so far. Its pretty good! cant wait try the rest of the three scents in my pack!</li>
            <li> I normally have a problem with chapped lips. I can&#x27;t seem to keep them well moisturized no matter what I use and try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because of it&#x27;s claim to be long-lasting and to repair dry/chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried plently of lip balms with beeswax and shea butter but nothing really worked well for me. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be any different but was really hoping to be surprised and I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it for too long but so far I really do enjoy it. It does last quite a bit of time on my lips, which is great. I hate having to reapply lip products all the time. I also really like that it is not thick or too thin of a consistency. The only thing I wish this had, and mind you it&#x27;s completely just a personal preference, is that this had a minty or tingly feeling. Certainly not worth knocking points off for not having that but would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this holds up when I use it as a base before I apply any lipstick or lip glosses as those would start drying out my lips within 5 minutes. Using this underneath seemed to have lasted a little over 2 hours before I felt like I needed to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is in a pack of 4 and that they are all different flavors. Great to keep one in bags or in areas where I spend a lot of time. Seriously considering buying another one of these in the future.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm. Usually, lip balms make my lip more chapped. This one never did, and it tastes good! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that its natural . However its way to sweet. Nothing like lip balm from Melaluca</li>
            <li> ugh, i hate writing reviews, but these are really great.  smells good, goes on very smooth, protects/moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Love this product! When I first used it, i was thrown off at how soft it was - almost like it was partically melted. After the second use, I realized that was the intended consistency and I quickly became adjusted. Ive tried all but the green tea flavor and love them all! I have a soy allergy and was glad to find a reasonable price, good tasting lip balm :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the chance to try the Asian pear one and it is amazing. Smells and tastes great.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm. This is head and shoulders above any lip ointment I have used in the past. The flavors/scents are not overwhelming, but distinct, so if I get bored of one, I just switch. I have one with my makeup (I put it on under my lipstick), one in my nightstand, one in my purse and one at work. These don&#x27;t dry out my lips in between uses like pretty much every other lip balm I&#x27;ve used. I love the natural ingredients--important because you are probably ingesting at least some of it. I liked these so much that I added on a set to the present I sent my sister for her birthday last week. An excellent product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Feels waxy and wears off quickly but tastes yummy!</li>
            <li> I personally love the flavors. They are not normal, so you shouldn&#x27;t hold it to some standard of &#x27;cherry chapstick.&#x27; If you like 100% natural products with a unique (and good) flavor, then these are great! They also go on smooth, there is no grainy texture that some lip balms have.</li>
            <li> Have always hated lip balm but this made me a believer. It works well. Love the flavors. Not overly tasty on your lips.</li>
            <li> I am a huge lip balm fan addict! these last a while, taste and smell yummy. Flavors are unique, but as many lip balms as i have tried, I am still a lover of &amp;#34;Kiss My Honey usda organic lip balm!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reordered twice now due to the fact it ends up in other family members pockets and purses. My 3 year old grandson likes to try all the varieties. I don&#x27;t mind since he&#x27;s out in the yard following me around. Bottom line...We all enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and subtle flavor. I have found a new favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li> Smooth application, not waxy feeling. Great scents and flavors!</li>
            <li> silky smooth smells and tastes delicious.</li>
            <li> Been looking for lip balm to replace Yes to Carrots which I can longer find to purchase.  Wanted something that wasn&#x27;t heavy, goopy, waxy and didn&#x27;t need to be applied all the time.  This was finally the answer after trying about 10 other lip balms. Closest one I can find to Yes to Carrots.  Goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t heavy and best of all doesn&#x27;t have to be applied but a few times a day.  I am a complete lip balm junky - always have one in my pocket, one in my purse, one by my bed,  and one on my desk.  Cannot leave home without lip balm.  In the past I had used some brands that had to be applied constantly as they would wear off and require more and more applications. Not the case with Beauty by Earth.  Love it!  All four flavors are great.  My only complaint is that if this gets even a teeny bit warm, it seems to melt easier than other lip balms that I have tried.  But I can live with that to have a nice lip balm that I only have to apply 3 or 4 times a day rather than 20 times.</li>
            <li> The BEST lip balm ever. I&#x27;ll never buy any other brand EVER again. This lip balm is worth every penny, especially for someone who has severe dry/chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Wow! Creamy, long lasting, smells great, tastes great. What more to say? Oh, maybe I should share that I was having some strange issues with my lips prior to purchasing this set. They were dry, burning, itching and feeling like they had a layer of skin that needed shedding. None, and I mean NONE of my other previous favorite lip balms were helping. I even tried plain ole Vaseline! Nothing helped, until I started using these wonderful balms :) Now my lips are back to their soft, smooth, and calm selves! I will continue buying them, too. (Even the green tea is wonderful!)</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used and I even have my husband using it!</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% natural. All the flavors are great and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm with very subtle scent.  I&#x27;ve used many different brands, this is definitely one of the best.  And I like their natural ingredients approach and the small business model.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Many lip balms that are made with natural ingredients just don&#x27;t work well. They&#x27;re dry or taste funny or don&#x27;t go on smoothly. This one is just wonderful. It goes on smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t have weird flavors. It&#x27;s just really nice. I love it!</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff. Tastes good, keeps my lips soft. Does the job. BF likes it too. :)  Love the exotic flavor combos to match. And the price is very reasonable and appreciated for something you like, that works. Will definitely continue purchasing this product.  Use it sooo much!</li>
            <li> Some tubes had nice smooth texture. One tube had hard, grainy texture in the balm (feels like facial scrub on your lips). To me, the flavoring across the line was sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> I love these lip balms! They taste delicious (even my boyfriend thinks so ;) ) and I like the ingredients. I will likely repurchase when I run out/lose them.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm! I tend to think of myself as a chapstick connoisseur, or junkie, whatever, and I am very particular about what I put on my lips. I have been trying to use more natural products and have found that many don&#x27;t have the right texture, or the flavors are no good. Not this one! Beauty by Earth has got it right! I love the flavors, I love the texture, I love everything about it! Five stars. If you are on the fence about buying or trying this product - don&#x27;t waste another second! Buy this! You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried all the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; - these are officially my favorite lip balms! I work outside in all kinds of weather and used to have dry, chapped lips every winter. Not only does this balm do its job, but they &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; great and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> Delicious and effective.</li>
            <li> I love this product, nice shine, keeps your lips soft and has a great taste.  I will definitely purchase again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lip balm without the chemicals in it so I was happy to find these. The flavors are hardly noticeable but that&#x27;s ok with me. I don&#x27;t lick my lips. I&#x27;m just addicted to having lip balm or lipstick on my lips.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is wonderful.  It goes on smooth &amp; smells great.  I will definitely being buying it again.</li>
            <li> Best Chapstick I&#x27;ve been able to find. Did not find to be too sweet like some others have said and I don&#x27;t like anything sweet</li>
            <li> taste artificial, doesn&#x27;t last, overpriced, fake &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; flavors.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered these. Other chapsticks that are full of chemicals we&#x27;re drying out my lips and making them painful. I was looking for something more natural to try and this really did the trick! I will continue to buy these!</li>
            <li> Flavors are fake. No function......</li>
            <li> The flavors are very nice and not too strong. It does its job of keeping lips healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm!!! The 4 exotic flavors are really very good.  I tried all flavors already.  When I started using this lip balm, my lips are not drying anymore.. It is very effective to my dry and sore lips...</li>
            <li> Great product!! Great price !!!&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated it 6 stars</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  The flavors are amazing and the texture of the lip balm is great.  My whole family loves it.  I will definitely be buying this again and will look into more of their selections.</li>
            <li> Having tried several lip balm products recently to deal with my dehydrated lips, I have settled on Beauty by Earth. The Aloe Vera has made a big difference with the dryness, and I find myself needing to apply less lip balm than I did in the past. This may change as the winter comes, but I imagine, I won&#x27;t need to use that much then either.&lt;br /&gt;The products are Cruelty Free, which is extremely important to me; no animals need to be tested on for a cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very fair.&lt;br /&gt;The balm goes on thinly, so there isn&#x27;t that clumpy feeling where you immediately want to wipe your lips off.&lt;br /&gt;The flavors are pleasant and don&#x27;t taste &amp;#34;chemical.&amp;#34; Will purchase product again and would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the varying flavors of this brand! Lots of different tastes to choose from!</li>
            <li> This product leaves my lips perfectly conditioned. I have one at my desk, one in my purse, and one next to my bed. All four flavors are great. I&#x27;m so glad I have finally found a great product at a reasonable price. This is my new go to.</li>
            <li> Overall, the lip balm is not that greasy and it is better than other brands i have tried. The flavors are unique rather than vanilla or strawberry.</li>
            <li> Our family really like this lip balm! My girls love the flavors. We&#x27;ll order them again.</li>
            <li> The packaging looks cool and the concept is nice, but the results are horrible! All four lip balms taste like some nasty artificial sweetener. Why the heck would green tea taste sweet?! I don&#x27;t know why people like this. The taste of all the lip balms make this product unwearable.</li>
            <li> I love these things. They make my lips so soft, they taste great, leave a nice shine, and are apparently pretty organic.</li>
            <li> Its ok. Nothing special. Its made out of bees wax so it lasts a little longer on your lips. The &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; don&#x27;t really have too potent of a smell/flavor. Thought they would be a bit bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again. I&#x27;d stick to Burts Bees in a store.</li>
            <li> These feel fabulous on my lips and the flavors are subtle but delicious smelling.  Would certainly buy more.</li>
            <li> I have been using many different kinds of lip balm for ages. I didn&#x27;t know when I ordered this that it had stevia in it, which is an estrogenic and should be avoided. Additionally this product caused me problems in that I found that it really messed up my lips. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> The reviews raved about this product, like it has magic healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s healing properties, but it tastes like candy.  Which is good.  Unless you&#x27;re eating or drinking something that is not like candy.  Then it gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe people feel it is healing because they like wearing it.  It&#x27;s beeswax, sunflower oil, and really nice sweet flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s just lip balm.</li>
            <li> love&#x27;m, love&#x27;m, love&#x27;m i keep one in my pocket at work, one in the bedroom, one in the living room and one in my bicycle pack. I dont go anywhere without these.</li>
            <li> I tried lots of lip things&lt;br /&gt;i like this lip balm&lt;br /&gt;It last long and taste so sweet&lt;br /&gt;Will come back</li>
            <li> Its a good lip balm. A bit overpriced. Over the years, I have switched from one lip balm to another. Ultimately I settled on Carmex. I like the way it feels, coats my lips well and last a long time. This Beauty by Earth lip balm, although good, feels a bit wet on my lips and doesn&#x27;t last half as long as Carmex does. I will go back to Carmex.</li>
            <li> I like the balm itself, but the flavors are strong. Even after wiping it off of my lips with a napkin to eat I am still tasting it with my food. meh. I&#x27;d much prefer flavorless for this reason.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great. I love all the flavors! I don&#x27;t have to reapply frequently like I do with other brands. I definitely recommend trying these!!</li>
            <li> these are fantastic in every way! Many commercial lip products have bad chemicals in them..these don&#x27;t, plus they feel great and make your lips feel spectacular!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very moisturizing and I have to reapply it often.</li>
            <li> It is not the type that I prefer. It has a sweetener in it which I don&#x27;t like the sweetness and I don&#x27;t like the texture. But for others it may just be perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product. Lips feel moisturized and the sweet taste helps too.</li>
            <li> Had the ingredients I was looking for.  The consistency is good, feel like it really conditions my lips.  If I had any complaint, the flavors are a bit strong for my liking, I prefer a more neutral lip balm.  That said, the flavors are very tasty and not artificial tasting - probably too tasty.  I prefer the grapefruit/pomegranate flavor which is the most neutral.</li>
            <li> The package is pretty convenient as I have one at home, at the office, in my gym bag and purse. You just have to keep applying every now and then as it dries out quickly.</li>
            <li> Chapstick goes on smooth and my lips feel nice and soft! Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I thought Burts Bees lip balm was good but these are superior.  I use lip balm every day throughout the year and this is the best probably because of the coconut base which is very lush and moist.  I bought the set of exotic flavors and have loved every one of them.  The only thing you can lose by ordering and using these products is dry lips!</li>
            <li> Very nice set, soothing and great taste.</li>
            <li> I gave this set as a gift to my daughter.  She is always looking for a better lip balm.  She likes using this.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm!! The flavors are yummy and its so soft and smooth. It&#x27;s just the best!</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction to something in the product and had to return it...I am wondering if it was something in the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; because what was use in it was not explained...</li>
            <li> Best.....lip balm.....ever!&lt;br /&gt;Really smooth and sooooo yummy. Hours after you use it you&#x27;ll still have a subtly sweet taste on your lips</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love these! Great ingredients, too.</li>
            <li> Great flavors. Will recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Love it. The pear flavor kinda has a bubble gum scent, which I was not thrilled about but am now used to. The product itself is a great lip balm. Not greasy or filmy. I have one in every purse.</li>
            <li> I am a hoarder of lip balms - I will try any new lip balms and all in search of the best one. So far this is at the top of the list. Love the texture and how long it lasts once I put it on. Smells great but also not too heavy which is nice. I used to primarily use EOS but now I have switched the lip balm in my bags to this lip balm.</li>
            <li> Lip balms are great and have excellent and fun flavors!</li>
            <li> This product really helps my chapped lips.  I love the green tea scent and flavor.</li>
            <li> GREAT lip balms!!  Plan to give them to family in their Christmas stockings this year.  Goes on smooth, tastes and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these lip balm and loved it. I was using Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm before the purchase, but they are dry and very hard to apply to the lips. Beauty by earth lip balm is very easy to use on the contrary and it keeps lips moisturized for quite long time. Also, its texture and the smell/taste of the balm are very pleasant. My husband usually refuses to use lip balm, but he is wiling to use these after I applied the Asian Pear one to his lips once. With four lip balms, we are ready for the harsh weather in winter. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> The first lip balm that works for my whole family!  Beyond the fact that the product is all natural and smells great, these are amazing.  I&#x27;ve searched and tried every lip balm out there for my youngest child who is plagued with dry lips and extremely sensitive skin. Most fragrances and textures really bother him and no lip balm nor ointment has helped, until now. His new Beauty By Earth Asian Pear lip balm goes everywhere he goes and his lips have healed in a matter of days!</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm junkie and only use natural formulas. I ordered several lip balms recently looking for something new and better than what I&#x27;ve been using.  These were amazing compared to anything I have ever tried. All natural formula smells great and has absolutely no unpleasant taste. I immediately ordered 2 more sets and am planning to order the argan oil  along some other products I eyed that are made by this company.  You will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> These Lip balms are very nice. They apply very smooth and have a very pleasant smell. The green tea is actually the best smelling one in my opinion.</li>
            <li> LOVE! All that is needed to say. :)</li>
            <li> I use lip balm every day, usually Blistex or Chapstic.  One day shopping Amazon online I saw the Beauty by Earth lip balm and liked the ingredients.  I loved it.  The creamy texture and protective long lasting qualities surpass the all other brands,  give it a try, you wont be disappointed.  I like the exotic fruit, the subtle flavors are very appealing. This was my third order, wont use anything else.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t for me but for my four yo. She loves it, just came today! I tried it on it literally has no flavor and is light better than carmex and I loooove carmex lol</li>
            <li> Best chapstick ever! Not only does it taste amazing it really hydrates my lips! I put it on before bed and my lips were completely soft and crack free by morning, I wear it at work and it stays on a long time. I recommend this to anyone who wants baby soft lips!</li>
            <li> I bought this pack because I was looking for a lip balm with natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;These four are beautiful. They taste a little sweet, just in case you happen to :) But moisturize my lips very well. Add a little sheen to them as well, not too much though :)&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again certaily.</li>
            <li> I love the different flavors.  It&#x27;s great being able to switch things up whenever you want, since it gets boring using the same one all the time.  What&#x27;s even greater is that all of them work well!  They&#x27;ve helped my chapped lips a lot and even though I do switch between the flavors, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my improved lips.  Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Product feels smooth on my lips, and I feel good supporting the small business that manufactures it... Now it&#x27;s been a few days since I started using this lip balm, and my severely dry, chapped lips are now healed!  This product worked when others that I tried did not.</li>
            <li> I gave this product as a gift or my mother, and she was very glad i got them for her. She let me have one and we both loved them the first time we tried it. They are very smooth and creamy, i prefer this over my other lip balms! This is great as a gift or if youjust want some all natural lip balm. I will definitly be buying from beauty by earth again!</li>
            <li> I am loving your product. Ordering was easy and I enjoyed the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Better than Burt&#x27;s bees so far I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> These are some GOOD lip balms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a shea butter very thick lip balm that worked better than any other.&lt;br /&gt;Well, ever since I&#x27;ve tried those, they are definitely my new favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the mix of natural ingredients. The different flavors all smell good (not too strong, just enough). Very handy to have in the house, and with you as there are 4!</li>
            <li> As mentioned, a touch sweet. Other than that, LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love all of the different flavors !!! Always carry it in my purse ...love it</li>
            <li> These are great lip balms.  The taste is very subtle and they keep my lips soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This is amazing product! I bought this pack for my wife and she can&#x27;t stop raving about it! The flavors are great and don&#x27;t taste the least bit artificial. And to be honest her lips have never been softer. We definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a love for natural beauty products!</li>
            <li> good package and good smell. like it.</li>
            <li> Bought for friends, haven&#x27;t heard from them, will update. I am sure it is a good product, almost five stars on Amazon</li>
            <li> These lip balms are amazing! So many lip balms on the market use ingredients I can&#x27;t even pronounce. Everything about this company aligns with my values: sustainable practices, cruelty-free, non-GMO ingredients. What&#x27;s not to like? Yes, they&#x27;re pricier than Burt&#x27;s Bees but then again, do I want my purchase to support a small-family business or a huge mega-corporation (Burt&#x27;s Bees is owned by Clorox). Since I purchased these as stocking stuffers for my daughters, I wanted a lip balm that used ingredients that will heal, not harm. The ingredients list is short and sweet. Why put something artificial and toxic on your lips? These balms are silky smooth and come in some amazing flavors (green tea is my favorite). I will definitely purchase more for myself. Thanks, Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li> The quality of this lip balm is superb. It lasts a long time which is important to me since I hate constantly re-applying lip balm. The flavors are all pretty good. The green tea took some getting used to. If you want to enjoy the flavors more, don&#x27;t expect them to taste a certain way before trying. Keep an open mind and enjoy the flavors for what they are. I thought the green tea would taste much more like green tea but it ended up being much sweeter than I had expected. So don&#x27;t expect! Just know that Beauty by Earth has high quality lip balm. These have been so great that I am thinking about giving a couple boxes as gifts.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for a friend who know&#x27;s the true importance of good balms. She was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the products and the fact that they are 100% natural and owned by a small, sustainable company. I also think that the flavor assortment of this pack is great and will suit just about anyone. She has since told me that all flavors are delicious and provide smooth application and long-lasting moisture. The shipping was also very reasonable and timely. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My daughter and my friends love them. It moisture their lips during Spring time.</li>
            <li> Really nice product. Love flavors. Feels great on the lips. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Goes on really smooth, nice flavor, and feels very moist!</li>
            <li> Interesting, but the wax consistency was a little.. strange, on one of them, and another makes my lips tingle in an odd way that&#x27;s a bit of a concern. No rashes broke out, thank goodness, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves these.  There are several levels on which these are preferable to other products.  They are made of more natural ingredients, and produced without testing on animals.  I will be ordering more of them in the future.</li>
            <li> The Asian pear is my favorite, glides on very smooth and lasts with no waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a new romantic friendship.  The thing was I had accidentally ordered the wrong flavor pack and wanted to change my order.  I tried calling the company directly as I just missed the cutoff for a Saturday delivery by the time I realized my mistake--they were unable to help with my problem (my fault!), but we&#x27;re very attentive and easy to communicate with.  The net result is my friend got both sets of flavor and that was all a huge success.  I&#x27;m told the lip balm is very good and that from an addict of Chapstick/lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product based on the feedback, and I was pleased with with dealing direct with the company.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wish the packaging was a bit larger and more decorated. Ink was faded, hard to read. I had to repackage it for a gift box. The lip balm was a great price, worked great.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm, don&#x27;t feel addicted to lip balm now, this stayed with me for hours</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for less chemical-y, cruelty-free, more natural lip balm when I stumbled upon this great product.  My lips feel soft but not greasy, there&#x27;s no weird &amp;#34;aftertaste&amp;#34; like some other lip balms I&#x27;ve used, and the flavors/scents are delicious.  I would absolutely recommend these to a friend and will very likely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage niece. I was visiting her on a business trip and asked her did she have lip balm. She said her mom dones allow her to wear lipstick (lol). Any way I thought a good natural lip balm would be a good start for her. She said really likes Acai &amp; Goji Berry and shared one of the remaining three with her friend.  Her lips will be well protected from the harsh cold of Chicago winds and snow as she goes back and forth for school:) I have order heading my way - I live in Florida where its just as useful to protect the most exposed part of the body - lips!</li>
            <li> Great lip balm! It&#x27;s really smooth so your lips don&#x27;t feel sticky like some other lip balms. They all smell amazing but the green tea is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great product, my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> awesome product!  one of the few balms that i don&#x27;t have to apply over and over again throughout the day and it smells and taste fantastic.  i&#x27;m definitely going to buying some as gifts...</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend and she LOVES them!!! I can not say enough great things about this lip balm. She has worn every flavor and it has not only moisturized her lips, but her lips taste fruity! A+++++</li>
            <li> I bought these to protect my lips during the cold months.  The thick balm really covers and protects from the wind and cold of nyc.  So far I love them!  I even put them on before bed for added softness.  The flavors are delicious too!</li>
            <li> These lip balms are wonderful.  They keep my lips hydrated and feeling great.  I really love the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;, they are natural and smell wonderful.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I live in the dry Arizona desert, so I have lip balm stashed everywhere. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered from Beauty by Earth. The flavors are great and the lip balm really stays lasts and hydrates my lips.</li>
            <li> I have used two of these since I received them.  They go on super silky and do not cause my lips to peel as many lip balms can!  Love them</li>
            <li> Product has kept my lips moist. Winter is coming and I will not have any chapped lips!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this lip balm because it doesn&#x27;t have the overly waxy feel that I get from other lip balms nor does it have that weird taste whenever it gets into my mouth. I have lips that dry up and crack constantly, but from recent use I have found my lips getting softer as the days go by. I love how it lasts longer than other lip balms I have tried and enjoy the diverse flavors, especially the green tea, and plan to buy more for my family to try.</li>
            <li> من أفضل المرطبات لك وللعائلة!&lt;br /&gt;خدمتهم ممتازة وتوصل في الوقت المحدد، السعر مناسب.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my friend and she loved it! Also would recommend it to anyone else!</li>
            <li> Love the pear flavor the best but they are all awesome.  My lips are so soft and moisturized.  Probably my all time favorite lip balm, and I&#x27;m a total chapstick junkie! Wish I could get a pack of the Asian pear!</li>
            <li> Wow.  I really did not think that I would find something I liked better than Labello.  I have been using Labello for years, but my lips would still be dry if I didn&#x27;t reapply constantly.  I put this lip balm on at night and my lips are still moist in the morning.  The smell is heavenly and I love how long it lasts on the lips.  I would highly recommend and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Like the consistency of the lip balm. I enjoyed the scents I tried but found the green tea overwhelming when it was on ...though my daughter liked it.  Will continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> My favorite lib balms ever! It&#x27;s very rich and flavorful. I love all of them very much.</li>
            <li> Amazing product with amazing flavors! I love the taste of the green tea and Asian pear, they taste like nothing else that I&#x27;ve ever tried before. Usually lip balms are too sweet or soft or waxy, but these feel perfect. I have chronically chapped lips and after a few days of wearing Beauty by Earth my lips are actually starting to heal for the first time in months! I always want to apply more to keep my lips feeling soft and tasting sweet, unlike most other flavored lip products that I hate having to wear. I even gave one of the tubes to my boyfriend, and he loves them too. I&#x27;m so happy to finally have a lip balm in every purse that works for me!</li>
            <li> My first priority is natural and safe ingredients, so I am thrilled to have found these flavorful lip balms that have been made so consciously and responsibly. I live in the Midwest and the ever-changing weather is harsh. I feel very prepared for a chapped lip free winter! The acai + goji berry is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Just got these so I have only tried one so far. I choose to open the green tea flavor first to save the best for last, but it has such a pleasant smell and taste ( my husband even like it) that I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest. I loved the silky (not waxy) feel on my lips too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the lip balms from Beauty by Earth. I tried the peppermint lip balms from this company and had to try the other flavors because of how much I love this brand. The lip balms are so smooth and buttery, and they last a really long time. Other lip balms I have to reapply several times during the day but I&#x27;ve only been using these lip balms 1-2 times per day. Really good flavors too, and I like that they&#x27;re subtle.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried two of the four flavors of lip balm - Asian Pear and Acai Berry. I&#x27;m not a fruity person but I do enjoy the diverse flavors, I would be interested in trying to minty version of this product. The coverage of the product is favorable and it keeps my lips moisturized for quite a long period of time. The texture is a tad greasy for my liking but not to an extent where it bothers me. There is almost an exfoliating quality in the stick itself (not sure if that&#x27;s just my batch?) to which I&#x27;ve grown fond of. Overall I would say this is an excellent product. I love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and a family owned business. My only piece of advice would be to use something different then a regular chap stick tube, if you want something to stand out then make it interesting! (Nothing against the company at all - this is just my personal preference-this is also the reason for my 4 star rating).</li>
            <li> I love lip balm. This one is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> All natural product. Glides on well and provides a nice moisture without being sticky. Doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly. Highly recommended and a great price!</li>
            <li> Lip Balm smells great!</li>
            <li> Great lip balm! Goes on smooth and smells great! Would recommend and will buy more when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> Just got it and I love how it feels on my lips! Will be using this year round especially in our Arizona sunny weather.</li>
            <li> As a &amp;#34;lip balm junkie&amp;#34; I have tried pretty much all that is out there.  I have to say these balms are now one of my favs!&lt;br /&gt;The flavors are awesome and they do last so you are not constantly re-applying.  Will be back for more of these for sure!</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY DRY LIPS from meds I take and being diabetic. I have tried about every lip balm there is. I have found the Beauty by Earth Lip Balm is one of the best I have found. Tastes great, moisturizing, not sticky, stays on. I am very pleased with the product and I willorder again. I would give this Balm 10 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> I really like the way that these lip balms make my lips very soft and smooth. I could notice an immediate difference once I applied it.  I also like the way that it tastes.</li>
            <li> worked like a charm more natural than burts bees.</li>
            <li> absolutely the best lip balm i have ever tried! the flavors are amazing. i so far have tried the green tea and pear; they are unbelievably real to the taste and after just 3 days in Phoenix dry dessert heat, my dry lips are healed! The product is such good quality the green tea actually tasted like tea on my lips and i kept wondering how many calories i just ate to realize it just a BALM!! I love this product so much i let my office workers sample it on their palms and they&#x27;ve ordered it on the spot!! ...great product,  most satisfying purchase i have made in a long, long time!</li>
            <li> I have been on a medication the causes very dry chapped lips. I tried a few other lip balms and found them to be disappointing. This lip balm stays on and is very moisturizing. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I just got my order (faster than promised) and I really like it. I&#x27;ve only tried one of the favors so far. Not too sweet as others have said. A nice, mild flavor. Really keeps my dry lips moisturized.    Update - after a few weeks the pomegranate flavor started getting black stuff on it. I assume it&#x27;s mold. I&#x27;ve wiped it off but it comes back in another week. Have not tried the other favors. Maybe I need to try keeping it in the fridge?    Also, I never received the free sample promised for writing a review. I had something held at the post office for postage due. I never picked it up, so not sure if it was this, but sending it postage due isn&#x27;t really free, is it?</li>
            <li> I usually buy my lip balm in the grocery store check-out line, but when I saw this on Amazon, I gave this product a try because I&#x27;ve been unhappy with what I&#x27;ve been using.  My standard Chapstick just felt okay, and didn&#x27;t seem to address winter dry lips the way I&#x27;d like.  I&#x27;ve only been using the Beauty By Earth product for a couple of weeks, but I&#x27;m really happy with it so far.  It feels really soft and smooth going on, I like the scents/flavors and it really seems to soften and condition my lips.  No greasy pretrolium feel either.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a couple of friends.</li>
            <li> Smooth, not waxy. Works well.</li>
            <li> I have been having a problem with dry lips this winter and my regular Chapstick wasn&#x27;t working for me.  I wanted to try something more natural so I decided to check these out.  So far, I love them.  They have a great flavor, not that waxy flavor.  They also make my lips soft and shiny.  I would definitely recommend them to friends.  Also, they came quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Love them! Green tea is my favorite!</li>
            <li> It got here super quick and it feels awesome. I wanted something natural and this is it! it also has a great scent and ...taste. It happens nothing you can do about it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lip balms! They are a must-have for any lip balm fanatic (I am pretty picky with my lip balms and have a habit of trying new ones almost all the time because of not being completely satisfied). These are all just so awesomely wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own personal favorite is the Acai + Goji Berry. And my sister stole the Asian Pair before I could try it, lol. And she never steals my lip balms so that&#x27;s saying something...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be purchasing from Beauty by Earth again :)</li>
            <li> Made a great stocking stuffer, she loved all of them!</li>
            <li> Finally found the right product for my sensitive lips!. Been using eos before I found that it doesn&#x27;t help with my chapped lips specially during this super cold winter weather. I have braces as well that&#x27;s why my lips get so dry and chapped. I definitely recommend this! And will buy me some more before I ran out.😊😊✌️✌️</li>
            <li> Just got my package in and I immediately used the green tea balm first. I am completely in love with this product. It really is smoother than EOS and I find that I don&#x27;t have to apply it as much. I&#x27;ve spent to much money trying to find the right balm and I&#x27;m glad I came upon this one. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this bam.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that we are bee keepers and I know fresh beeswax!  My husband and I both want natural products made with fresh ingredients.  We go through lip balm...a lot.  In fact, if I get a product and he doesn&#x27;t like it, somehow, who knows, it ends up in the laundry in a hidden pocket and well.  Then I hear \\&quot;Honey, do you have any lip stuff?\\&quot;  So I tried this product.  I liked the name and the flavor selection sounded new, different, interesting.  Let me tell you....This lip balm is AWESOME!  I gave hubs the green tea and the ginger pear...He is guarding them like his life depends on it.  The closest I&#x27;ve gotten to try either of those two flavors is that old quick kiss as he walks out the door!  I adore the other two flavors that are in my possession and I admit that I ran around the house, no lie, rearranging lip balms so that any that are likely for hubs to grab are NOT these...because I know I would never see them again!  The quality is excellent the price right in line with any of those junk commercial products and well....you will love them as much as we do.  That said, I have two notions come to mind...If everyone starts buying them based on my review will there be any when I want more? and is this going to be like that favorite, you finally find it lipstick one month before they discontinue that color?  Hope it is no on both counts.</li>
            <li> Great flavors. Very pleased</li>
            <li> The product is very good. I love it very much.</li>
            <li> natural-tasting flavors - nice, non-overly sugary variety!</li>
            <li> What fantastic products. I bought all I could find, sunscreen, face charcoal activated sponges, etc. All great.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the result, so far 😊</li>
            <li> Great quality, but too sugary for my taste, which actually refrains me from using it!! for the &amp;#34;sweet-flavor lovers&amp;#34;--the best choice!</li>
            <li> My whole family (including my 2 kids) love the balms and use them. It may feel a little bit greasy, but really keep your lip moisturized and help the cracked lips to heal. I also like it is made from natural stuff and feel safe to use them on my kids. Recommended!</li>
            <li> These are the best lip balms I have ever used!  They keep my lips moisturized for hours!  When I use it before I go to bed, my lips are still soft and moisturized in the morning.  I&#x27;ve tried lip moisturizers including Chapstick, Blistex, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Jack Black, EOS, and Beecology; but none of those brands compare to Beauty by Earth lip balms.</li>
            <li> These healed my son&#x27;s crazy dry lips, HIGHLY RECOMMEND. However, please don&#x27;t buy when price us at 19.99, I bought for 11, so be careful when purchasing</li>
            <li> Too sweet for me. Doesn&#x27;t last long enough. I need to reapply every two-three hours.</li>
            <li> I like the product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too sweet, I like the flavors. However, I still have to apply it all the time and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference than using any other lip balm...</li>
            <li> Love the asian pear. Dont really like the acai berry. Havent tried the other two. The lip balm is good though, so no complains. The only complain I would have is that the number of times they asked for a review. Other than that, all&#x27;s good. Will definitely order from them again (Want to try their mint one next!) :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very sensitive skin, most lip balms irritate and cause cracking on the sides of her lips. This product is very gentle and has not caused any problems for her, in fact it seems to be helping. Also she really loves the variety of flavors! Very happy to have found this product!</li>
            <li> Really nice lip balm. All of the smells/flavours are great and they go on smooth. Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> These chapsticks have a great feel to them, dont leave your lips feeling sticky or have a waxy aftertaste. Would love to try more varieties.</li>
            <li> A little smaller then it looks in the picture but their alright.</li>
            <li> I love it. :) feels good and the flavors are great</li>
            <li> Reviews are right on. Tasty, long lasting and moisturizing without icky chemicals</li>
            <li> I like its smell, but I feel my lips are thick.it is natural anyway.</li>
            <li> Love love love the smell and texture! Lips stay moisturizer longer than most Chapstick!</li>
            <li> The lip balm works really well and the 4 pack includes a very nice selection of flavors.</li>
            <li> it is sweet - you can taste it</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm ever.  I have tried multiple brands and they tend to dry out my lips, or make them waxy, or even give me a cold / canker sore. Beauty by Earth lip Balm as soon as you put it on you can feel the moisture sink into your lips.  This pack has great flavors in it.  My favorite is th pomagranite. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many lip balms over the years. Chapstick, Blistex, Blistex Daily Conditioning Treatment, Carmex (in the little can and in the twist-up tube), EOS and Nivea, just to name a few. All of those lip balms either don&#x27;t protect your lips, wear off to quickly, appear too glossy on the lips, and/or contain many chemicals. I&#x27;ve actually suffered burning lips and irritated throat from using certain of those lip balms. My search for the ultimate lip balm lead me to the Beauty By Earth lip balm here on Amazon. I&#x27;VE FINALLY FOUND THE ONE! I love the subtle yet tasty flavors contained in the Beauty By Earth four-pack. I also like that these lip balms don&#x27;t contain a bunch of weird chemicals. The Beauty By Earth lip balm spreads on smoothly and lasts quite a while. I find I typically only need to apply it three times per day - once in the morning on my way out the door, once in the afternoon before leaving work, and once again at bed time after brushing. I&#x27;ve also used the balm on my kids and they love it! Can&#x27;t recommend this lip balm highly enough. Buy it.You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Soooo smooth! My lips are in heaven! I used to only use vaseline until I realized I was essentially putting oil on my lips! gross! Love how natural and deliciously smelling these are.</li>
            <li> This product is very good quality and a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s too much if I put it on both my top and bottom lip so I just put it on the bottom and press them together. It really stays on your mouth, to the point that I&#x27;ll put it on in the morning and I have to actually wipe it off before I eat lunch if I don&#x27;t want the taste of the lip balm in with my food.</li>
            <li> These are just too glossy for me. The just plain peppermint flavor is perfect but these other flavors are just too shiny.</li>
            <li> I gave this a two star rating last time with the following review: &#x27;These have sweetener which draws you to lick your lips which makes them chapped! Defeats the purpose. They smell really good and that should&#x27;ve been enough. Disappointed.&#x27;...HOWEVER, I kept these and continued to use them until they were almost gone. By this time I learned not to lick my lips but if I did happen to taste it it wasn&#x27;t bitter like most other balms. And I can&#x27;t believe it but I LOVE THESE and don&#x27;t want to be without them ever again! I was not paid or bribed to change my rating, nor was I given anything free. I was wrong and I&#x27;m more than happy to admit it and happy to recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love how you can recognize almost all of the ingredients on the label. I like knowing what&#x27;s in my products. They do their job very well, but you do have to constantly reapply. They melt pretty easily, so when I carry one around in my purse, I find the texture much more oily than usual.</li>
            <li> I am admittedly a lip balm addict and this is the best-ever.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quick delivery. Great for winter chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I have ever used (over ChapStick, Blistex, Burt&#x27;s Bees). Keeps lips moist for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying. Flavors are yummy!</li>
            <li> Too sweet, and greasy.</li>
            <li> The flavors are wonderful in the variety pack. It is prefect for the kids. It does not burn their lips like other chapsticks. Their lips have been so chapped, and this helped after the first day of using it.</li>
            <li> I just got my package and can&#x27;t decide which one I like the best! They are all so good amazing that I will have to keep circulating the flavors to know. I highly recommend these for anyone with big lips that wants to keep them naturally hydrated. In Florida it is hard because it is humid but hot and I don&#x27;t wear lipstick so I am constantly trying out other lip balms. My search is over!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Way better than the burt&#x27;s bee lip balm I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give these 6 stars.  Yummy scented and taste good too. Super smooth application not waxy or glossy.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack of 4 flavors several months ago and LOVED the lip balms so much!  The texture, the moisturizing, and the wonderful flavors.  That was then.... this is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that first pack so much, I bought a new pack recently. To my dismay, the flavors are drastically weaker than the box I bought several  months ago.  The flavors now are so light, you can barely tell they&#x27;re flavored at all.  I thought I got an outdated pack, so I contacted the seller and was told they changed labs and the new flavors are &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34;.  So, if you are a fan of the old intense flavors, do yourself a favor and find a different product!</li>
            <li> By far the best lip balm I have ever used.  My lips were in horrible shape from this past winter.  Using the Beauty by Earth Lip Balm, made them smooth and supple after one use! (I applied before going to bed).  The smell and taste of the lip balm is also very nice.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have tried countless lip balms, I have very sensitive skin and most leave my lips feeling dry and cracked again within a day.  I tried Beauty by Earth&#x27;s product because of the great reviews and consistent positive feedback.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  It is the only lip balm that I&#x27;ve tried that really satisfies my sensitive skin and and leaves my lips feeling silky smooth for hours.  The great part is it&#x27;s 100% natural.  The flavors are amazing and super unique, my favorite is the Asian Pear.  If you haven&#x27;t tried Beauty by Earth&#x27;s product I guarantee you are missing out.  Take my word for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> These go on a little clumpy. They taste ok but wish they had more flavor/smell to them.</li>
            <li> This product is just as it is described. I have never been able to use lip balms or chopsticks consistently because they would always make my lips get worse than it was before I used those products. But not for this one. It actually helped my lips get better, and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have much on my lips making it feel comfortable. It also tastes good! Also it lasts really long! I don&#x27;t have to keep on putting it on. Only once in a while. I already have one of my lip balm to a friend so that she can have a try :) this is the best lip balm ever in my whole life :)</li>
            <li> These lip balms are great. They moisten and comfort your lips very well. You can tell from the feel of them that they are made with all natural ingredients. They&#x27;re great quality.</li>
            <li> This product works much better than Chap Stick and other lip balms I have tried. I was concerned about the flavors being too strong but they aren&#x27;t. The flavor and smell is subtle and I like all of them. I will order more when needed. Great stocking stuffer too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the set for just about a week. For starters, the balms are organic, and oh boy do they smell amazing. These balms are better than the burts bee balms, so much richer and offer more moisture. Im glad I went with this set, they were much more affordable than some of the other organic balms on the Am. Market. If you are looking for some organic lip salvation, honestly try these out.</li>
            <li> I accidentally came across this stuff before checking out with my initial purchase.  I am VERY HAPPY that I hit that add to cart button.  This is hands down the best beeswax lip balm I have ever tried.  I am addicted to chap stick/lip balm and cannot go anywhere without it.  This stuff goes on like silk, has almost a lip gloss feel on your lips, is not grainy like usual beeswax balms I&#x27;ve tried, and lasts on my lips longer than usual lip balms.  The flavors stick out and you don&#x27;t get hit with the nasty beeswax taste if you lick your lips.  The green tea and asian pear are my favorite flavors.  I am a green tea drinker but the flavor is something I was not expecting to be the best out of the 4.  I will be back for more once they get lost in my couch or car.  :D</li>
            <li> Both my wife and myself are LOVING these lip balms :)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even regularly use any lip balm, but i&#x27;ve found myself carrying the grapefruit/pomegranate one in my pocket all week.&lt;br /&gt;We also ordered the Peppermint lip balm and my wife keep going on and on about it.&lt;br /&gt;We used Burts Beeswax for a long time, but this is so much better, and for the same price!</li>
            <li> Really nice assortment.  They all feel heavenly on my lips.  Helps with that winter heater dryness.</li>
            <li> These are great and moisturize, smell, and taste GREAT!</li>
            <li> This Chapstick is fantastic! It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips like some Chapstick. You only need to use it like twice daily! And they all smell and taste awesome!!</li>
            <li> The lip balm seems to stay longer than other products that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve only tried the grape and acai berry flavor so far and it feels great.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I went by all the positive reviews and purchased this and I must say everyone was right.  This is the best lip balm I have ever used.  It goes on smooth and feels very moisturizing.  I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip balm. So many companies say they are natural and free of toxins but so many don&#x27;t deliver on flavor or texture. They do here for sure!  The scents are amazing and smooth and really go on easy and last quite a while.  I was using Badger but after using this I will never go back.  This seems to last a lot longer and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and covers my lips with a nice layer.  A great buy and great flavors will keep you happy.</li>
            <li> This is better than chap stick that I always used.  I dont have to apply it often plus the flavor is very good.  Definitely would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Wonderful and will continue to buy this over any other lip balm.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My son and I have battled chapped lips for years. We used a chap stick years ago that worked great but was discontinued. Since then nothing has worked until beauty by earth lip balm. Within just two days I noticed a huge difference in our lips especially my son&#x27;s. No more peeling, cracks or bleeding. I also really enjoyed the flavours and so did my boys. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Great flavors, goes on very smooth, will keep me from getting chapped this winter for sure.</li>
            <li> Great products. I bought these for my wife and she loves them, for their sweet fragrances, and for their moisturizing property. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT.  Very soothing and love the packaging as well as the scents for each.  Green tea is my fave!</li>
            <li> Having no daughters of my own, I really enjoy the chance to purchase &#x27;girly&#x27; things for my daughter-in-law. Knowing both of them love lip balms, one of them laughingly declaring her addiction to them, I ran across these lip balms on amazon. The reviews were overwhelming! How often is a product loved by everyone! I purchased these Beauty By Earth lip balms, wow, better than any I&#x27;ve seen. The reviews are so right. Every girl, whether a young one, or us &#x27;older&#x27;  girls should treat themselves to these balms, they are awesome!!</li>
            <li> Very nice package and colorful lipbalms that smell great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm for about two weeks now and so far, I love it! The flavors are yummy, it goes on smoothly and makes my lips feel very moisturized.  This doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out like some other brands and as one who has tried several balms, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great flavors, great ingredients!  got this for my teenage daughter as a gift!  now I need one for me!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best for me! They moistourize and feel so nice on my lips.I just love them!I tryed the minty ones from the same company but they were too strong flavor for me and caused alergy to my eyes.I m.happy I found something natural and good for me.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm!  Very moisturizing and smooth!,&lt;br /&gt;Will definately be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you beauty by earth!</li>
            <li> I love chapstick or lip balm. I use it all the time and like to try all new kinds. I was very happy with the smell, feel, and texture of this lip balm. The flavors are great and the feel is very silky. It is defiantly one of my new favorite lip balms.</li>
            <li> Gread product. One of the best lip balms I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> From the the scents and flavors to the packaging (eco friendly and a great presentation!), I am very impressed. This is a very clean product with a flavor lasts longer than other commercial lip balms. The company is a pleasure to work with- as they were very quick to check in for feedback. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  Recipient loved the product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> love it- goes on easy, feels good</li>
            <li> Just tried Beauty Earth Lip Balm for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth and refreshing. Great scent. This may be my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lip balm!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural, healthy products to use on my skin.  I love these lip balms because they are not only natural, but they feel great on my lips.  I only use it in the mornings and before I go to bed, but my lips don&#x27;t get dry.  The added bonus is that they smell delicious.</li>
            <li> Clean ingredients. Nice scents. Good price. Thank you for offering this product on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great!  All natural is great, but the thing that makes this product especially nice is the different varieties of scents/flavors.  Gave this as a stocking stuffer gift - at this price and variety, you can&#x27;t miss!</li>
            <li> Beauty by Earth Products are terrific!! They are so refreshing and moisturizing! I would highly recommend this brand. Also they are a great customer oriented based company. I got my shipment fast and with ease.</li>
            <li> Lip Balm feels clean and smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.  I recently threw out all of my old make-up and decided to replace it with all natural products.  (In part because I have a sweet little newborn baby I enjoy snuggling up to.)  I have to say I miss a few of my old make-up items, like my mascara which didn&#x27;t use to run.  But this lip balm is honestly better than any of the less natural variety I use to own.  I love the subtle scent and the way it makes my lips feel.  Kissable and awesome!  Will definitely be buying more when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> Like the smell, feels pretty good on lips.</li>
            <li> I love this!! It doesn&#x27;t feel waxy and it lasts forever. The flavors are very strong, but not overbearing. I am so glad I ordered this and I will continue to do so in the future</li>
            <li> This feels Natural and love it. This is the first lip balm with no weird tastes &amp; strong smells. I have tried all the flavors and all are mild smell and perfect. My kids love it too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a major chap stick user and am really picky about them and have been looking for a good all natural one for a long time. I am loving these ones so far!! They taste amazing and really make my lips feel moisturized and smooth. I would definitely buy more and would recommend it to others. Just wished it lasted longer, but otherwise it&#x27;s my new favorite chap stick!</li>
            <li> This is one of the top two lip products I have used.I just went on a binge and bought eleven different kinds.my favourite is grapefruit and pomegranate..</li>
            <li> I am picky about my lip balm. I love the silky consistency and it lasts a long time. I would highly recommend to lip balm lovers!</li>
            <li> These are very nice product, i love them,they smells amazing, especially the Asian pear :), definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This went on a lit smoother than the EOS brand when I had really chapped lips and totally helped them heal up fast. Tastes/smells great and approve of the ingredients list!</li>
            <li> Fine lip balm, divine aroma. I love natural products. Perfectly humidifies and feeds lips. I will buy still, I recommend in purchase.</li>
            <li> With the 24-hour lip color I use daily, I need to apply another layer of clear lip protection frequently. This Lip Balm not only smells good, smoothens my lips, it also last longer than any other chap sticks/ products I used. I&#x27;m happy to find this works so well for me, and planning to buy more so I don&#x27;t run out. :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!  They smell wonderful, work well and are long-lasting. I really appreciate the fact that they are also organic with no harmful chemicals.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I got these in my Christmas stocking!  I love the scents and that they are made from all natural ingredients. My husband made a great decision by purchasing them for me.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love these! I have tried everything, and I mean everything, for my chapped lips. Finally I found my answer! The quality is great, flavors are awesome! I have recommended this to friends and I will buy again!</li>
            <li> i love these lip balms - they taste great - they go on nicely and stay on a long time and I love the fact that I am using natural products!</li>
            <li> Great product-- really feels good when putting it on. I have only had it for just a few days but so far I love it. Also, there are NO added chemicals in it! Very good lip balm</li>
            <li> Best lip balm i&#x27;ve ever used. Lovely taste, without that horrible waxy feeling most lip balms have.</li>
            <li> I have had severely chapped lips to the point of bleeding and nothing has worked. This is the only chapstick so far that has actually worked and kept working. And it&#x27;s flavors are pretty good as well. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very good quality balms. Gave one to each my daughters and one for my husband. A few days ago he commented how nice that stick was and loved the taste too&amp;#34; haha</li>
            <li> OMG!  This is the best lip balm!  I have tried so many different brands and have not found one that works as well as these do!  And all the flavors are fabulous, I cannot decide which flavor I like best! They go on so smooth, they stay on, and have relieved my chapped lips.  I am an avid runner and I will definitely be putting some of this on before each run to protect my lips and I have no doubt it&#x27;ll keep my lips from chapping!  PERFECT lip balm!</li>
            <li> Wonderful lip balm. Smooth, long lasting and beautifully natural. LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Super soft and silky. Great packaging and flavors! I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees but this is even smoother.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s luxurious and has a lasting effect. The different flavors smell and taste delicious! I&#x27;ve tried other beeswax lip balms, but they didn&#x27;t last and felt very waxy.  These are very smooth and the scents are wonderful.  The photos make the balm container appear bigger than normal, but they are normal size lip balms, so no issue carrying them around.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have severe allergies. I have purchased other products that were all natural, but did not help with my dry lips.  I thought I would give this product a try as it was natural.  It works!  I will absolutely be purchasing it again.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Great quality product.</li>
            <li> The lip balms feel great, smell great, don&#x27;t leave weird residue on cups (or people), and protect from the harsh winter winds. Will definitely buy these again!</li>
            <li> Immediately helped my chapped lips to feel better.</li>
            <li> I am only marking this down to four because I was expecting thicker/larger around chapsticks. The pic makes the package at least look bigger.  Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product. The scents are great.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised by the flavors and quality.  The flavors are very light and the balm goes on very smoothly.  The packaging is also great!  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This chap stick is not very smooth, feels a bit oily and gritty. Doesn&#x27;t feel like the quality beeswax lip balm I&#x27;ve had from others</li>
            <li> Very good Chapstick :). I have really dry lips &amp; have tried every Chapstick available. I highly recommend these ones...very pleased w/ them.  They are not tinted but I find that they keep my lips moisturized enough that my natural lip color looks just fine without the added tint:)</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm. I have tried the unscented, honey/vanilla and now these. I like all of them. These exotic flavors smell (and taste) great. They go on smooth and they last. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on super smooth, not sticky at all. And it lasts a long time as well. I apply it before bed at night, and in the morning my lips are still nice and soft. The best part about it is the scent and flavor. Right now I&#x27;m using the Green Tea variety, and it&#x27;s the absolute best one in the pack. It has a lovely green tea + honeysuckle aroma. It&#x27;s very similar to the Jasmine Dragon Phoenix Pearls tea from Teavana. The scent is heavenly, and the flavor is light and sweet without a trace of chemical flavoring (like I&#x27;ve noticed with the Eos lip balms). Overall, I highly recommend this and I&#x27;ll be buying it again!</li>
            <li> This product is a great product for anyone that is careful about what they put on the family and their own body. The flavored are such a great surprise and are very pleasant but not overwhelming like some on the market. This product gives a very nice coverage and helps heal lips right away. This has become my go to brand of lip balm for my family and myself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm because I wanted something natural. So far, I&#x27;m not disappointed. The flavors are interesting, but not in a weird way. You&#x27;re not going to get your typical flavors like Strawberry, Mint, or Cherry. Right now, I&#x27;m using the Green Tea flavor. It&#x27;s a little sweet, but I&#x27;d highly recommend it. My favorite part of these lip balms is the ingredient list. It&#x27;s short, and you can actually pronounce the words. That&#x27;s a sign of a great all natural product. Once I run out of my four tubes, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great flavor and works great.  I had my lip surgically repaired after a severe dog bite and have been using your product during the healing process</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of the original product and decided to tryout the other flavors.  I&#x27;m glad I did because these things are awesome.  They have the same qualities as the original product which make up a great lip balm with the added benefit of various flavors.</li>
            <li> Every lip balm I&#x27;ve tried always goes on ok but end up drying out my lips even more. From the fruity ones that smell good to the medicated, heavy duty balms...they all do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm not only tastes great, it feels like silk and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling dry a little while later. I have given 2 away and they loved them as much as I did. I have to get more now!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for a friend who is OBSESSED with lip balm. She loves beeswax, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. She raves about it and loves all of the different fruity flavors. Truly a great buy!</li>
            <li> Really glad I ordered this set of 4 Beauty by Earth LIP BALM.  This is the first time I have tried this product line.  Love the smooth texture on my lips.  Interesting fruity flavors.</li>
            <li> Great limp balm/chapsticks</li>
            <li> Great lip balm at a surprisingly affordable price! The unique fruit flavors are a treat: subtle but very pleasant. Perfect for every member of the family. Plus, with the pure, non-petroleum ingredients, this lip balm can be used with 100% confidence. It&#x27;s very smooth and conditioning. Far superior to popular drugstore brands at a comparable price. In summary, you can&#x27;t go wrong ordering this lip bam. A great value for a truly superior, chemical-free lip treatment.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this lip balm!  It goes on smoothly and the moisture lasts a very long time.  Not like some lip balms that go on thick and waxy and have to be reapplied several times a day.  I ordered some for myself and some for stocking stuffers. I can&#x27;t decide which flavor I like best but I think I&#x27;m leaning toward the Asian Pear. This is a great product and I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these! I purchased and loved the peppermint variety, but wanted to try some different flavors since I have people in my life that can&#x27;t handle mint (I know) and these are just as amazing! They have a light flavor, nothing is too overpowering, even though the flavors are a little different than normal. And they go on smoothly, and keep your lips moisturized. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Did not like this Chapstick. I bought this for gifts because I read good reviews on it and people said it did not make your lips feel greasy, but it does. It doesn&#x27;t penetrate into your lips one bit, very disappointed in this product. I was embarrassed I had given given these as part of a gift after I had opened it and used one myself.</li>
            <li> I am really picky with chapstick. These ones are perfect!! I have tried several different brands and Beauty by Earth is one of my new favorites. The flavors are pretty sweet though. It reminds me a little of kool-aid. So if you don&#x27;t like sweet chapstick then maybe it isn&#x27;t for you. However, they are a great lip blam, that doesn&#x27;t have to be constantly reapplied.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my wife who is addicted to lip balm.  She has not liked beeswax-based balms that I got her in the past (many went in the trash after one application), but she LOVES these!  These will definitely be a part of her regular rotation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT, it&#x27;s become a favorite for me. Definitely keeps the lips moisturized for a long period of time. I love that it goes on smooth and stays on without drying your lips out. Gives the lips a nice shine with no tacky feeling. The flavors are tasty but not over done, smells good without being overbearing. This package was awesome as it gives you a variety and should keep me stocked for the next few months. I&#x27;m not a lipstick person, these work great with giving my lip stain just enough shine :)</li>
            <li> My daughter and I obsess over lip balm. This package is wonderful! We love the flavors, the texture, the smoothness and it&#x27;s a bargain to boot! My lips feel great and the flavors are so unique. I can&#x27;t decide which is my favorite, they&#x27;re that good. Natural tasting, and not overpowering. Long lasting moisture. Love them!</li>
            <li> Love these flavors.  The bf thought they were too sweet but I think they&#x27;re great and will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love my lip balms from Beauty by Earth.  It&#x27;s really good for moisturizing my dry lips and I love the natural ingredients - I have made my own lip balms and am willing to pay for these.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping,thank you guys:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Asian pear flavor right after I received the package. My lips were dry since I use the lipsticks very often,and my lips getting much softer and has good moisture status now. I love &#x27;em! I gave one to my mother-in-law, she loves it too,she said she will order one set when the one I gave to her use up.I am thinking about to buy a few sets as Christmas gift:)</li>
            <li> I truly like this lip balm.  I have extremely dry lips due to medication I take.  I have to keep my lips moisturized constantly.  This product is wonderful.  So glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> All natural, high quality, smells and tastes great. The wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The smell of green tea is so great, and i am just can&#x27;t stop using it every morning. It tastes sweet also. I give 5 stars to it. Great lip balm! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. The balm made my lips so soft and repaired my dry, peeling lips.  The flavors are all very true to their name. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I adore this lip balm! Every flavor tastes subtle yet wonderful (the green tea is maybe a little sweeter than I&#x27;d expect, but it&#x27;s still delicious). I think the Acai &amp; Goji Berry flavor is my favorite. They&#x27;re very smooth and they make my lips so soft, plus they&#x27;re definitely long-lasting! I may have been guilty of licking it off once or twice, but without interference, they&#x27;re great, haha. My lips have never felt better, and I have every intention of buying them again, for myself and for friends, as little gifts.  Edit: After the reformulation, they&#x27;re definitely not as creamy as they used to be (it feels like I have to kind of work the balm into my lips, when I used to be able to just swipe quickly), and the flavors changed a little. Still tasty, and they still feel awesome on the lips, but I liked the old formula better. :( I might not repurchase these after I get through this pack.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase. I was pleasantly surprised that 1 application last me a few hours with no reapplying. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Love the flavors! Overall great product.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I really enjoyed the flavors too.  Most natural chap sticks don&#x27;t have much flavor, but these do!</li>
            <li> Great product! Nice to know it&#x27;s all natural and it works well. My gf doesn&#x27;t usually like &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; lip balms but she made an exception for this.</li>
            <li> My whole family is LOVING this lip balm!  We were used to Burts Bees for so long but everyone, including my kids, is now addicted to Beauty by Earth!  It feels great, really soothes and we are loving the variety of flavors!</li>
            <li> For a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> I love that these come in a 4 pack.  My kids each got to choose one to keep in their backpacks, which has been really great because with the weather getting colder and drier, their lips get easily chapped.  The scents are lovely and the balm has good staying power.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was the most amazing lip balm ever... I love all the oils in it.. My lips still get dry with other lip balms but not this one. and THey taste yummy also. Really nice feeling on lips</li>
            <li> I have big lips and I&#x27;m constantly on the hunt for chap stick that will keep them moisturized. I haven&#x27;t had these for to long but they seem to being doing the job (knock on wood)</li>
            <li> I like the size of these lip balms. works well. But I don&#x27;t like the cherry one, too sweet.</li>
            <li> Love!!!! Flavors are awesome! Soften my lips very well. Nice full sized lip balms. Go on soft and smooth and hydrate my lips for a long time. My lips are feircly dry from being outside a lot and I do not have to reapply for a long time like I do other lip balms. I bought these at a reduced cost to use them and write my honest and unpaid review. I love them!!!</li>
            <li> I love these!  Since they are all natural there is no alcohol in in to dry out my lips like most flavored types do.  I just wish it lasted a little longer.  The flavors are great though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE every one of the lip balms in this box!  Each one is creamy and perfect.  They stay on and smell (and taste) great.  I will be using this as a stocking stuffer or thoughtful gift in years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to break this review down into a plain old pros, cons and conclusion to make this as simple as possible. If the review is a bit long you can skip straight to the conclusion and I&#x27;ll include all the bullet points, just not as much detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;All natural. I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a hippie, but I am a big believer that the Earth knows what our bodies need. Also, I don&#x27;t like putting unpronounceable chemicals in or on my body in general.&lt;br /&gt;Great flavors. The Acai is probably my favorite, but they are all good. Perhaps not the Green Tea, but I dislike tea in general so that&#x27;s more of a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;Really does help repair damaged, cracky, peely lips and lasts a long time. I used Burts &amp; Bees before this and it would wear off quite quick and would end up having to use it around 3+ times a day because my lips would eventually become unbearably dry. I apply this once in the morning and it&#x27;ll usually last all day. Rarely it&#x27;ll be so dry that I&#x27;ll use it again at the end of the day, but not often.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have to apply too much. Which means much more value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit thick. View my last &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34;, I stated you dont have to apply much. That&#x27;s because of the thickness of this lip balm, which makes it very easy to over apply and look like you&#x27;re wearing lip gloss, which isn&#x27;t the look im going for as a straight male.&lt;br /&gt;Can only buy the 4-pack. I would have only bought one because I limit the amount of lip balm I use to avoid getting my lips addicted to the stuff. So generally one stick lasts me almost a year. So I&#x27;ve got 4 years of chapstick right here! Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing, but I&#x27;ll probably lose them before I use them :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: A bit thick, but if you just avoid over applying the stuff then this can be a pro instead of a con, as you will almost never run out of the stuff. Can only buy a 4 pack which is a bummer considering how long these last. I&#x27;ll probably just give my extras to family.All natural, which my lips very much appreciate. Great flavors as well. Lastly, this lip balm really does help repair your dry, cracked and peeling lips. I usually have all 3 at once due to over licking my lips so finding a good enough lip balm is usually a challenge. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. If you have pretty damaged lips you will like this lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love these flavors! Especially the Asian pear and green tea ones! It&#x27;s so nice to have good lip balms in my purse, car, bedroom, etc and not have to worry about bringing the same one everywhere.</li>
            <li> The balm works really well, my lips are definitely nice and soft. They&#x27;re just really...sweet? Have you ever fallen asleep with chapstick on and had that weird taste in your mouth in the morning? It&#x27;s like that. They taste sweet, but not a good sweet. They smell nice, though. I&#x27;m just not overwhelmed. Also the shrink-wrapping around the tubes is really, really difficult to tear off around the cap. It also has sort of a grainy texture - not overtly so, but it&#x27;s noticeable.</li>
            <li> BEST Lip Balm I have used. I use Nivea and E.O.S and this is by far my favorite lip balm out there. Defiantly worth the money!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm because of its unique flavors and it was a 100 % natural beeswax. It relieves my lips when it&#x27;s cold out and they are chapped. I would recommend this product for both women and gay men!</li>
            <li> The ratings are correct! These are the best!</li>
            <li> I got these for my girlfriend and she loves them so much that we&#x27;ve purchased more.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip balm I have ever used. I waited a couple of months of use before posting this review. My lips tend to get choppy during winter and I need to use a lip balm but I have the greasiness and the chemical taste of everything else that I&#x27;ve tried over the years. This product is awesome. It gives you an amazing sense of hydration and softness, without being too glossy, it&#x27;s not greasy at all and it&#x27;s delicious whike it really feels natural. Excellent product overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using blistex lip medic and my lips seemed constantly dry.  I looked at the reviews for something else and came across  Beauty by Earth lip balm- what a HUGE difference. My lips have not felt this good in years.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lip balm without petrolatum, so this was perfect.  I love how smooth these feel on your lips &amp; the scents are nice too.</li>
            <li> It was great orginally, but then they all turned grainy and started having clumps of some weird textured stuff on my lips. burts bees beats this small little brand any day.</li>
            <li> Like everybody said, this lip balm is great.  My tight peeling lips are repairing and I need it less often (within the first week of using) as they normalize.  I like how this glides on silky smooth and is light.  The sweet flavor is nice and enjoyable, but I have to have self control not to lick it - that is why I like the peppermint most (compared to the flavored 4 pack)  - it&#x27;s less to think about.  But the flavored 4 pack is still the same great formula, its fun for a change and its great for kids.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to these. The flavors are so good. I love the slight gritiness that melts away. It feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating my lips. My lips have never seemed so soft.</li>
            <li> A couple of them are just a little tiny bit grainy but I&#x27;ll take that over toxin filed balms.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Very smooth and great fragrances. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like this product, makes my lips very soft, the flavors are nice :)</li>
            <li> Great stuff, all natural and the flavors are all delicious.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality lib balm. It lasts a long time, but it&#x27;s the flavors that really puts it over the top.</li>
            <li> Really is top quality, from the packaging to the product itself. I&#x27;ve only bought lip balm one other time from a different brand but this right here actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement for my beloved Rachel Perry Lip Lover lip balms since they went out of business a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve finally found the one! This lip balm has an amazing taste, and goes on light and is not too waxy, which I appreciate. My favorite flavors are the Asian Pear and the Green Tea - so unique! I will definitely be buying a lot more of these!</li>
            <li> Tastes good but not long lasting</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product a few times over, the fruit ones and the peppermint ones. I think it is a superior lip balm to all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. There is a slight graininess to the fruit ones, in particular. It&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant, but it is a bit of a foreign feeling upon application. I like all of the flavors equally.  On one order, the green tea lip balm was missing; while I would have returned the box for a complete one, I needed them as little gifts so I just did without that one. Other than the missing lip balm in that order, I haven&#x27;t had a bad experience with this product.  The missing lip balm is the only reason I rated this product four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> So far I loved it - It does not leave an after taste in your mouth and it does keep my lips looking fabulous.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It is winter and my lips are D-R-Y. I use lip balm in all seasons when I go to bed at night. I have tried them all with Chapstick and EOS being the worst of them. The one I was using was a sample and I was running out so I turned to Amazon for something new. I liked all the positive reviews for the Beauty by Earth and the natural ingredients so I ordered. This really helps the dryness. A little goes a long way, no need to overcoat the lips. I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the sweet taste that sometimes winds up in your mouth. It is hydrating and smells nice. My daughter likes it too and I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> love it,  BBE products are my favorite and these lip balms work so much better than any other that of tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely last longer (hold back the temptation to lick your lips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips are definitely better than before thanks BBE :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.</li>
            <li> great seller, great buy. oh their scent is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is that after using them for a while the texture on the sticks become grainy and almost sandy.&lt;br /&gt;i would still buy them again though. its a good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm aficionado. okay, I&#x27;m a lip balm addict. I&#x27;m one of those people who has tried virtually ever lip balm, salve, chap stick out there. I&#x27;m super picky, as you can imagine... It can&#x27;t be too gooey. Or too hard. It can&#x27;t be too sweet. Or too artificial tasting. And it can&#x27;t leave me wanting to re-apply in an hour, you know? It has to last a while. It&#x27;s gotta have some staying power. I really really like this product. You get four options. They feel GREAT on your lips and they come in super interesting flavors... like, NOT strawberry or lemon. And! they&#x27;re a small, family-owned company. I&#x27;m always down to support small... The only two slight negs for me: They&#x27;re a tad sweet for my taste and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of green tea in general. But other than that, I&#x27;m stoked about what I&#x27;ve found in Beauty by Earth Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much any lip balm I could find and couldn&#x27;t get relief.  I came across this on Amazon and it had good reviews so I ordered.  So glad I did!  Finally I can feel a difference and my lips are no longer peeling and cracked.  Smells awesome and goes on smoothly.  Will definitely stick with this from now on!</li>
            <li> I love these products! The tested is awesome (very important to someone with special needs) and the ship time was way fast! I will be ordering again....I am so happy I found ChapStick without dyes!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this company and their products.  I have been using their peppermint lip balm for a while so I was thrilled to see some more varieties!  My favorite is the green tea but they are all fantastic.  They glide on smooth and last!  From this lip balm addict this is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I have a problem with my salivary glands, making my lips dry all the time.  Most balms made the problem worse, not better since they contain ingredients like camphor, which make you a lip balm junkie.  These balms go on smooth, since they contain beeswax, and are very comforting.  I really like these balms and would recommend them.  My lips are smoother and less dry since using them.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips feel moisturized and beautiful</li>
            <li> this chapstick is the best tasting chapstick i have ever purchased ! BUT it does not help chapped lips . it is exstremly greasy , and a tiny bit goes a long way . again it is exstremly flavored and i think they lost sight of what the purpose is of chapstick . it&#x27;s not to taste good , its to heal chapped lips , which this chapstick does not do unfortunatly . i am very dissapointed with this purchase !!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff in my book.  It goes on smoothly and truly moisturizes and is absorbed instead of just being waxy.  It also actually has a very pleasant taste slightly sweet and fruit-like.  Its a bit pricey but I do like it better than the traditional &amp;#34;chap-stick&amp;#34; type lip balm.</li>
            <li> Great products! Very nice smells &amp; flavors.</li>
            <li> Great flavors and a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love the product it taste good and it feels great on my lips.</li>
            <li> Too sweet. Why the heck is it so sweet?!</li>
            <li> I have a problem that I won&#x27;t want to drink water when thirsty. I don&#x27;t know why but for year I only drink a few sips of water during the day and mostly get little more water from soups.&lt;br /&gt;As the results, I am totally dehydrated. My lips were chapped, skin was peeling out. It created my other bad habit of peeling my  lips skin. I can&#x27;t stop it. I peeled it everyday so much that my lips always looks raw, hurt, bleeding too. I tried normal chap sticks but they didn&#x27;t keep my lips moist for long, just about 1hr or less.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product while looking for some body oil and decided to give it a try after reading the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I just tried the asian pear. It&#x27;s smell so good, taste sweet and most important is that it keeps my lips most for hours. I just have to use it 3 times a day and haven&#x27;t have problem with peeling lips again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I know I should fix my bad habit and drink more water.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these lip balms after suffering all winter (I wish I&#x27;d found you guys earlier!)...with dry, chapped lips. These balms are  really great.  Awesomely natural, soothing, great flavors, reasonably priced. I&#x27;d never heard  of the product, but I&#x27;m really glad that I took a chance and ordered. I will definitely be  reordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky with the lip balm I use.  These are high quality, smell and taste great and aren&#x27;t too waxy.  Great value and I like the variety.</li>
            <li> Only used the pear so far. Better to use this than some type of petroleum products.</li>
            <li> Awesome lip balm, bought as a gift for the gf who has a Chapstick addiction, so figure I&#x27;d get her the best stuff money can buy! All the favors are sweet but not too sticky, feels more like balm than chapstick, which I prefer. My favorite flavor is green tea.</li>
            <li> Having dry and chapped lips has always been a problem for me in the past. I tried many different products but still end up having extremely dry and peeling lips all the time. I came across this product two weeks ago and was skeptical at first. After reading through the reviews, I decided to give it a try. Got the package a few days later and I tried it out right away. The lip balm goes on smoothly and the moisture stayed on my lips for a long time. I am satisfied with my purchase and will continue buying when I run out in the future.</li>
            <li> So far I love these chapsticks!  I can&#x27;t wear any kind of lip products b/c of the metals and so far so good without any allergic reactions.  I love the way it makes my lips feel. And shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li> Very effective lip balm with wonderful flavors!</li>
            <li> I am very picky on lip balms, ,never liked them , my lips are very dry and choppy in the cold wet weather.&lt;br /&gt;THOSE balms are miracle!!!&lt;br /&gt;So soft, when applied on the lip skin, last long, and i saw IMMEDIATE improvement within hour, if not minutes. Absolitely love them.&lt;br /&gt;Size is a bit smaller than what i expected, but nonetheless great!</li>
            <li> LOVEEEE these. Obsessed with Beauty By Earth&#x27;s products. These feel amazing and taste amazing. Packaging is great. Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural as well and I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals in my lip balm</li>
            <li> I love this natural lip balm. It keeps my lips moisturized. I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have to constantly reapply everytime I eat or take a sip of water. The flavors are pretty amazing, too. Highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a natural product that is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great flavors and so smooth and creamy.  Makes lips feel amazing for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I absolutly loved these. so worth the money.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, not sticky at all! Fairly long-lasting. Flavors are pleasantly subtle. I am looking forward to trying more of Beauty by Earth&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective! I have been using EOS and didn&#x27;t understand why my lips keeps on peeling until someone point out to me that EOS was the problem. On my search for the best lip balm, I found this. Been using it for about 3 days and my lips are slowing improving. No more peeling and my lips are soft. I think the flavors are pretty boring so 4 stars. I think I would like the peppermint ones better.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm!!!! I&#x27;m sometimes weird with flavored lip balm, but these are so natural and subtle, you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing some fake goo on your lips. Love!!! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s really amazing. I live in a super dry area, all dirt and sage brush, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good lip balm because no matter how much water I drink my lips get chapped. This stuff really works well. I feel super wasteful because I have a lot of other lip balms that I won&#x27;t use anymore. It beats everything else I&#x27;ve tried by far. And it lasts for a long time! I&#x27;m still using the first one I opened a few months ago. With other lip balms it seems like you have to keep reapplying them so they get used up quickly, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything like that with this product. I also really like the flavors. They aren&#x27;t crazy strong. I get really bad migraines from certain fragrances which makes things a bit difficult, but these smell great. I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL:DR&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips.&lt;br /&gt;The flavors aren&#x27;t overly strong.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth trying! c:</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this lip balm a lot, however I feel it is not as long lasting as others are. Still a great product. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I get very chapped lips all the time, this works just like your basic chap stick.</li>
            <li> Loved these lip balms, they smell really nice and work great!</li>
            <li> I have another 100% natural product that I really like.  So, why did I try Beauty By Earth?  I was taken by the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; they listed.  Green Tea, Asian Pear, Acai and Goji Berry, and grapefruit and promegranate.  I am enthralled with this product.  Not only does it work to keep my lips moist and soft in the winter wind, but it smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;That is what I hoped.  What I didn&#x27;t expect was that it would TASTE good.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, this has become my favorite now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent my money on these instead of the regular Chap Stick from Target. It doesn&#x27;t feel all greasy and waxed up. It feels really smooth and lasts for a super long time throughout the day. Max I&#x27;ve had to apply it on in a day was twice. They smell great and taste delicious too. A tip for smoother looking lips is exfoliate your lips with your toothbrush before you apply these!</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. There are enough natural/organic lip balms out there that I would probably pass on this pack again. While I do appreciate the lack of chemicals and other such nasty ingredients, I found these all had a very sickeningly sweet taste in your mouth and it was really hard to get past. I also found that as you got farther down the tube, the balm would get a really grainy feel to it. I wasn&#x27;t impressed. My recommendation. Go with Yes To or Badger...they&#x27;re much better.</li>
            <li> Love this chapstick... the smells are not overwhelming or too sweet... and it last for a long time... its a must have for people with intensely dry lips</li>
            <li> Leaves lips smooth &amp; smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR PROVIDING AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I have never tried anything like it.They all has unique flavors and at same time it&#x27;s light not heavy as other lip balms out there.It gives enough moisture to my lips so i have no worry about going with chapped lips anymore.Yeaay!;-)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t just pick one favorite. All these lip balms are amazing and I use them daily for soft and moisturized lips!</li>
            <li> I am super picky about my lip balms. I have tried so many through the years and finally discovered that some do more harm than good.  I started using only natural lip balms without petrolatum or mineral oil. Even within that category I have only found 2 that I absolutely love. Until now...  These are lovely. They go on smoothly and make my lips feel soft and supple. I wish they lasted a bit longer on the lips, but they do have relatively adequate staying power. I love all the favors in this variety pack too!</li>
            <li> I just got these and I am very pleased with them. They are packaged nicely (would make a nice gift) and the ingredients are not only all natural, but are also free of soy (which one of my daughters is allergic to). Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I really like these lip balms. They offer long-lasting moisture and taste great. My 3-year-old niece&#x27;s lips are always dry, and I&#x27;ve had trouble getting her to use lip balm, but now she remembers to put this on her lips, because she loves the different flavors.</li>
            <li> I received this lip balm as a gift, the flavor variety pack and I love it!!!! The Asian pear is my favorite, but all flavors are great! I love that it is all natural and made in the U.S.A!!!! I will absolutely purchase this again and again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm and I&#x27;m so glad I got the pack of 4! I&#x27;m ridding myself of as many chemicals as possible, so I&#x27;ve been thrilled with these delicious, organic lip balms. And they work great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I used this lip balm today and it went on soft and smooth.  I tried the green tea.  Lunchtime, my lips were still fine and usually they are not with other lip balms I have used in the past.  I was happy with the results thus far.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> So, I am admittedly a bit of a chapstick connoisseur. Sounds ridiculous? Maybe, but since purchasing Beauty by Earth lip balm, I have become totally obsessed!!! The flavors are unique, light and delicious! When it said 100% beeswax, I was worried that it would be sticky and very waxy (like several Burts bees products I&#x27;ve tried), but these were totally the opposite. It went on smooth, wasn&#x27;t sticky/gummy at all, and has really helped to moisturize my lips. Going into the winter season, I&#x27;m beyond thrilled that I&#x27;ve found these. No need to look any further. In fact, I&#x27;m considering buying more of these as stocking stuffers for Christmas! They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Best Lip Balm. EVER!&lt;br /&gt;I have had chapped lips all my life and have used every lip balm there exists. This is by far the best lip balm there is. Why? It is not too greasy, not too waxy, it tastes good when you do taste it, it stays on for the required number of hours before necessary reapplication. AND best of all they use economical for the Earth recycled cardboard, not so fancy schmancy packaging (which YOU pay for) and which I totally support. ALL the ingredients are listed and are safe, NOT tested on animals etc. I formerly used Burts Bees , once a small company as this is but now bought out by Clorox, the makers of BLEACH... so who knows what they will do to the product in the future. They&#x27;ve already raised the prices astronomically. AND after using BEAUTY by EARTH I find that Burts Bees is much too waxy anyway. Liked Beauty so much I bought several more variety packs for stocking stuffers for my daughters for Christmas. I&#x27;m sure they will like it best too. What I also like is that this is a small company run by several friends who really believe in their product, and send it out in speedy deliveries. Cant beat that! HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the Lip Balm a lot. I give it 5 start for being natural, smells and taste good, and you can feel it moisturizing and heal your lips. It is differently my favorite for now. I wonder if they would have any with Argan oil or Tea tree oil in the future..</li>
            <li> I ordered these based on reviews and they did not disappoint. Nice mild flavors.</li>
            <li> This lip balm tastes really bad. Also, it&#x27;s extremely hard to make the lipstick go up or down. I don&#x27;t recommend it. There are (much) cheaper and (much) better ones out there.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading all of the reviews.  Best lip balm I have ever purchased.  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product! Great flavors! Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Very smooth lip balm and it is nice to know that it is 100% organic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lip balm as a birthday gift for my sister. She loves natural products and I knew this would be a great choice. When she received it she exclaimed how fancy and beautiful the packaging is.  The lip balm itself is very smooth and moisturizing. We love the asian pear flavor.  The company really seems to care about their product and this is evident in the packaging and quality of ingredients. It is a great value for the price as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this lip balm after long research &amp; it&#x27;s really turned out to be verrrry good &amp; natural....I&#x27;m loving it :) :) :)</li>
            <li> I just got this product a few days ago and I absolutely love it! It goes on silky smooth and just feels really great.</li>
            <li> all the flavors are amazing!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this lip balm.  And the price is very reasonable as well.  I will absolutely purchase it again.  It keeps my lips moist and is not full of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I tried! It is very smooth, glide on and smell so good!</li>
            <li> I was prepared to LOVE this stuff, based on people&#x27;s reviews. These smell weird. All but the green tea smell very artificial. It&#x27;s so unpleasant. Also seems like the balm wears off quickly. Next time, I&#x27;d try the peppermint flavors.</li>
            <li> Awesome chapsticks!! The original one is my favorite, but these 4 new flavors are so good and the chapstick is great!!</li>
            <li> The soothing pure beeswax has provided relief to my constant dry, chapped lips. The fruity flavors are a delightful treat with each flavor pleasantly recognizable unlike some brands. Two of the flavors were mislabeled in the package I received. The Asian Pear and Green Tea were swapped with each other. The first tube out of the box was green tea. It was quite the surprise to find it tasting much like Asian Pear. The product would have received 5 stars if it were not for this error in labeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the cat&#x27;s meow. I have been using lip products as long as I can remember, and for a nice moisturization with nice scent/flavor, this can&#x27;t be beat. I bought a couple of packs as stocking stuffers for our kids (girls and boys alike!)</li>
            <li> Love these!  Makes your lips feel very soft and instant relief for chap lips. Also love the different flavors in the 4 pack.  Will be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li> I like these lip balms. My lips are sensitive and I need to be careful and this product is doing quite well.</li>
            <li> The smell is very nice and the product itself is well package and neat. The shipping was quick, nothing was damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find myself having to apply this chapstick very often compared to Burt&#x27;s Bees to get the same coverage, the taste is also a bit overwhelming and gets kind of stuck in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an alright chapstick but a bit expensive for what you get, I&#x27;ll probably order Burt&#x27;s Bees again in the future.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fine but I don&#x27;t see what makes them special. Just buy Burts Bees.</li>
            <li> Never using any other.  Stays on.  Smells great.  Gives lips a little shine.  Best of all, no more chapped lips!</li>
            <li> When I first tried these it felt as if it had no flavor. After a few tries it seemed to taste sweeter and I actually like it a bit more. I can&#x27;t say its my favorite in consistency, seems a little thin. I will continue to use it until it is gone but will not purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the greatest chapstick. Delicious scents, stays on for hours and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Moisturizing and delicious.  Was shipped quick.</li>
            <li> Grainy texture,  but does moisturize</li>
            <li> Buying out every flavor they make. Enjoy this multipack more than the peppermint (personal flavor preference). Truly the best lip product I have ever tried and I have tried many many before- burt&#x27;s bees, kiehls lip balm # 1, candy kisses lip balm, jtree salve, etc etc</li>
            <li> These lip balms are wonderful!  They are very moisturizing and smell/taste fantastic.</li>
