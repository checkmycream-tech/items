    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Well, I have AWESOME news for the skeptics ! !  </li>
            <li>Dont expect the best lipstick ever</li>
            <li>Would make a great party favor.</li>
            <li>. . . .These are JUST as good and the price is GREAT.</li>
            <li>but this really is magic and compared to competitors prices this was the best deal out there</li>
            <li>My friends and I loved seeing the shades that this lip stick went on as on each of us.</li>
            <li>Still good.</li>
            <li>Awesome product that came super quick?</li>
            <li>Love this use to buy it 90 looks nice on any shade of color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really neat to see the beautiful color enhancing hues that it is applied as.</li>
            <li>However, for the money it provided a good deal of fun, and I will continue to wear it.</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I repeated this step 2 more times</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This lipstick to me is an okay cheaper version if you can&#x27;t get &amp;</li>
            <li>love them better than chip stick</li>
            <li>Moisture is still there and applies easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of waxey and doesn&#x27;t turn that great of a pink, but in a pinch it could suffice.</li>
            <li>hydrates a lot and is the perfect little gift.</li>
            <li>this stuff is not so great- the lines in your lips get darker than the rest of your lips and also it doesn&#x27;t matter who you put it on its all the same color-</li>
            <li>Smells and tastes cheap.</li>
            <li>But, cost was cheap as well, so I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>a nice pink color that looks good with my skin tone</li>
            <li>cool idea though</li>
            <li>A fun, cheap, and useful purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from that, it is a fun topic of conversation</li>
            <li>A great and fun gift, but it&#x27;s only a little more than a fun toy.</li>
            <li>But if you wipe your lips off, the first couple of applications are pretty!</li>
            <li>Overall, its a good buy, fast shipping, really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed having enough tubes to give away.</li>
            <li>It really works !</li>
            <li>I was amazed i would recommend lightly applying it tgoigh because one solid swipe across the lips was a bit too bold for my taste</li>
            <li>I applied, then after a few seconds I lightly dabbed the shiny top coat.</li>
            <li>It goes on as a super dark pink, but I wear it over a  lip stain and it kind of takes on the color underneath and makes it more vibrant!</li>
            <li>This is pretty good for the price, however it does not last as long nor is it as bright than others I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li>This feels more like a chapstick than a lipstick, and the packaging is not high quality.</li>
            <li>Its been fun to try daily to see what color it turns each day.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t replaced my daily lipstick, but it is fun to try with friends.</li>
            <li>so I can go as light or dark as I like.</li>
            <li>and we all ended with the same color, which was fairly pretty.</li>
            <li>Looks natural (once it&#x27;s on)</li>
            <li>I wanted to try these green aloe vera mood lipsticks to see if they were good enough to buy in place of the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>If you want to get your lips hot pink, you do need to put on a triple application.  </li>
            <li>I love the Fran Wilson greenies but the price is the only negative factor.</li>

            <li> My friends and I loved seeing the shades that this lip stick went on as on each of us. It&#x27;s really neat to see the beautiful color enhancing hues that it is applied as. This feels more like a chapstick than a lipstick, and the packaging is not high quality. However, for the money it provided a good deal of fun, and I will continue to wear it. A fun, cheap, and useful purchase. Would make a great party favor.</li>
            <li> Mood lipstick? Who wouldn&#x27;t love it. Looks natural (once it&#x27;s on)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this items to friends. Its been fun to try daily to see what color it turns each day.</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered these lipsticks because the Fran Wilson Moodmatcher green lipstick is getting a little too expensive for me. I remember when they were $3.+ each. I wanted to try these green aloe vera mood lipsticks to see if they were good enough to buy in place of the more expensive brand. Well, I have AWESOME news for the skeptics ! !  . . . .These are JUST as good and the price is GREAT. If you want to get your lips hot pink, you do need to put on a triple application.  I applied, then after a few seconds I lightly dabbed the shiny top coat. I repeated this step 2 more times (I had the time to test the lipstick today)😁.. The color of these green aloe vera moodies is the same deep pink of the other brand. The color doesn&#x27;t rub off unless you&#x27;re determined to scrub it off. This is a winner for me and I will DEFINITELY be ordering ALOT of these. I love the Fran Wilson greenies but the price is the only negative factor.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that came super quick?</li>
            <li> This is pretty good for the price, however it does not last as long nor is it as bright than others I have had in the past.  Moisture is still there and applies easily. Still good.</li>
            <li> a nice pink color that looks good with my skin tone and it is layerable so I can go as light or dark as I like. This lipstick stays on until lunch time and is moisturizing</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. I use it usually only once in the morning when lining my lips to stain them for the day and trust me it does. I use a brand name lipstick over and only have to reapply a couple of time a day. I stock up when I find it.</li>
            <li> I love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this stuff is not so great- the lines in your lips get darker than the rest of your lips and also it doesn&#x27;t matter who you put it on its all the same color- cool idea though for kids birthday party goodie bags.</li>
            <li> It goes on as a super dark pink, but I wear it over a  lip stain and it kind of takes on the color underneath and makes it more vibrant! I like it, but it does have this weird taste I cant describe. Overall, its a good buy, fast shipping, really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This lipstick to me is an okay cheaper version if you can&#x27;t get &amp;#34;Mood Magic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Fran Wilson&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s kind of waxey and doesn&#x27;t turn that great of a pink, but in a pinch it could suffice.</li>
            <li> after a few applications, the brightish pink color starts to build up in an unflattering way. But if you wipe your lips off, the first couple of applications are pretty!</li>
            <li> Goes on like a chap stick but does a subtle change into you ph match.</li>
            <li> love them better than chip stick</li>
            <li> A great and fun gift, but it&#x27;s only a little more than a fun toy. The mood-changing colors are varying colors of pink, and I never did see it change to any other extreme colors. The container is also flimsy - the cap comes off without effort. It came open inside of my purse and turned some of my things pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, it is a fun topic of conversation and I enjoyed having enough tubes to give away. It hasn&#x27;t replaced my daily lipstick, but it is fun to try with friends.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels BUT the color is VERY pink - I am a redhead and do not like the color it goes on.....</li>
            <li> It really works ! I was amazed i would recommend lightly applying it tgoigh because one solid swipe across the lips was a bit too bold for my taste but this really is magic and compared to competitors prices this was the best deal out there</li>
            <li> Love this use to buy it 90 looks nice on any shade of color</li>
            <li> Smells and tastes cheap. Did a &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; with several women and we all ended with the same color, which was fairly pretty. But, cost was cheap as well, so I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> hydrates a lot and is the perfect little gift. Dont expect the best lipstick ever</li>
